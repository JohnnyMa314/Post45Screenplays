           EXT. CITY STREET - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A CABLE-CAR wipes the frame outside a classic San 
           Francisco restaurant.  TYPE clacks onto the screen:                

           SUPER: “Tadich Grill.  Tuesday.  8:13 PM”  

           INT. TADICH GRILL - CONTINUOUS

           We follow a diet soda and a Jack Daniels from the bar, 
           through the restaurant, to a young couple in a booth.    

           PICTURE FREEZE

                                 FEMALE’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        I know what you’re thinking, and you’re a 
                        sexist pig.  The whiskey is mine and the 
                        diet coke is Jason’s.  Or Jeremy.  Jimmy?  
                        Something like that.   

           UNFREEZE.  The drinks are served as we continue to hear 
           the Female’s V.O.:

                                 FEMALE’S VOICE (V.O.) 
                                 (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to blind date #63 of my life.  So 
                        far, the odds for a second date are at 10-
                        to-1.

           She slams her whiskey; he sips the soda.  The guy calls 
           out to a passing busboy.

                                 GUY
                        My diet’s flat.  Can I get a spritz of 
                        bubbles?      

                                 FEMALE’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        60-to-1.  

           Meet IZZY SPELLMAN (28).  As a kid, she wasn’t a tomboy, 
           she kicked the tomboy’s ass. And if a squad of 
           fashionistas joined forces to surgically remove her 
           ripped-up Levis, her legs would be stunning.  We’ll never  
           know, though, because Izzy wearing a skirt is the 5th 
           sign of the Apocalypse.  

                                 IZZY 
                        So, you’re a lawyer? 
                                 GUY
                        4th generation.  My theory on law is...

           The Guy CONTINUES TO TALK, but we only hear Izzy’s V.O. 
           as she impatiently fingers two initials inside a heart 
           which is carved into the old wooden table. “C.H. + M.M.” 

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        It is at this moment -- 4 minutes, 16 
                        seconds into the date -- that I realize 
                        Guy-Whose-Name-Starts-With-A-J and I have 
                        no future together.  Fortunately, I 
                        stopped by the restaurant yesterday to 
                        plan my escape routes--

           CGI OVERLAY:  A BLUEPRINT of the restaurant comes up, 
           LITTLE WHITE SLASHES ANIMATE THE DIFFERENT EXIT PATHS.

                                 IZZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Our booth is 16 1/2 feet from the front 
                        door.  Careful of the fat guy whose chair 
                        is in the aisle, easy to trip up.  Better 
                        option is the ladies’ room.  In my dry 
                        run, I found I could just squeeze out the 
                        window into the back alley, if I’m 
                        willing to rip my shirt and fall from the 
                        second story into a dumpster.
                                 (then)
                        No-brainer.

           We suddenly realize that our Guy has asked us a question.  
           We have no idea what...  He asks again.  

                                 GUY
                        I said, “Izzy, what do you do?”

                                 IZZY
                        My brother didn’t tell you?

                                 GUY
                                 (laughing)
                        David said he didn’t want to scare me 
                        away.

                                 IZZY
                        He wasn’t joking.

           His smile drops.  Izzy is distracted, looking out the 
           front window.

                                 GUY
                        Is something wrong?
                                 IZZY
                        The same 1996 blue Ford sedan has driven 
                        past 5 times in the last 6 minutes.

                                 GUY
                        Maybe they’re looking for a spot.

                                 IZZY
                        Or they’re following me.

           The Guy chuckles and head-nods to Izzy’s whiskey.  

                                 GUY
                        Maybe you’ve had enough.  

           INT.  PARKING STRUCTURE - 3 MINUTES LATER

           Izzy walks briskly, the Guy struggles to keep up.

                                 GUY
                        I didn’t mean to end our date.

                                 IZZY
                        How do you expect me to relax when I’m 
                        under surveillance?!

                                 GUY
                        It was just a car!

           At the far end of the parking row, they see the 1996 blue 
           Ford.  Tinted windows.  Menacing.  

                                 IZZY
                        Give me your keys.

           Suddenly nervous, he tosses her the keys to his BMW.

           EXT.  PARKING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

           The guy white-knuckle-clutches the Jesus-strap as Izzy 
           flies down the parking row at 60mph.  In the next row, 
           the Ford is speeding to keep up.  A race to the gate.

           Seconds before the Ford can cut off their BMW, Izzy 
           launches them out the exit.

           EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT

                                 GUY
                        I wanna get out.  Stop the car.
           In the rear-view mirror: the Ford is right on their tail.

                                 IZZY
                        Not now, Joe.

                                 GUY
                        It’s Jerry.

           Izzy mouths “Jerry”, remembering.  She makes a sharp 
           left, accelerating.  The Ford is right behind them.

                                 IZZY
                        Fantastic acceleration.  What is this, 
                        400 horses?

                                 GUY
                        You don’t have to use all of them.

           Jerry moans as the car catches air over a hill.  Slamming 
           to the ground, Izzy breaks to 40mph.  She overshoots the 
           turn onto Sacramento Street, but the Ford is right there.

                                 IZZY 
                        Dammit They know all my tricks.

           They speed over two hills.  Jerry closes his eyes and 
           whimpers.  Izzy makes a sharp right into an alley, 
           rattling the bums, only to spit out the other side.  

           She makes a left turn onto a ONE WAY STREET.  GOING THE 
           WRONG WAY.  Cars honk, swerving out of the way.

                                 GUY
                        Holy crap!  Holy crap on a crap-holding 
                        plate.  

           A growing wet spot appears on his crotch.

                                 IZZY
                        I can’t lose ‘em.  They’re too damn good.

                                 GUY
                                 (sobbing)
                        Then stop.  Please just stop.  I want to 
                        go home.  I want this date to be over.

           Izzy SLAMS the breaks.  The Ford almost crashes into 
           them, but stops a millimeter short of the bumper.

           Izzy gets out of the car and storms to the drivers side 
           of the Ford.  SHE KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW.

           A moment passes before the window rolls down, revealing a
           middle-aged couple, the woman in the driver’s seat.
           Izzy leans into the car...

                                 IZZY
                        Mom.  Dad.  This has to stop.

           TITLE CARD: “THE SPELLMAN FILES”

           The words “THE” and “FILES” disappear from the screen, 
           bleeding away like spy invisible ink.  We start to PULL 
           OUT from the word “SPELLMAN” to REVEAL...

           ...a line of mailboxes.  The first branded with the name 
           “Spellman Investigations”.  There are a dozen other 
           boxes, marked with aliases (including Marcus Godfrey and 
           Garrison Enterprises) and others with P.O. Box numbers.   

           The house, at 1799 Clay Street, is an impressive four-
           level Victorian located on the outskirts of the Nob Hill 
           district.  There are two entrances (one for business and 
           one for personal), as well as a one-unit apartment over 
           the unconnected garage.  

           INT.  SPELLMAN HOUSE - OFFICE - MORNING

           OLIVIA SPELLMAN (early 50s) sits calmly in the office.  
           The layout is unusual:  FIVE TEACHERS’ DESKS FORM A 
           PENTAGON.  Izzy paces.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s not that we don’t trust you, Izzy.  
                        We just don’t trust you romantically.  

           Before Izzy can protest, Olivia kicks open the file 
           cabinet and pulls out a LENGTHY PORTFOLIO, all typed up 
           on Spellman Investigations stationery.  

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                        Exhibit A:  A complete breakdown of every
                        bad relationship you’ve ever had.  
                                 (beat)
                        Your father and I had a little free time 
                        this week. 

           Olivia quickly FLIPS through the tome in front of Izzy.  
           As she does, we FREEZE FRAME on three of the pages.

           BACK TO SCENE:
                                 IZZY
                        Mom, the “dating surveillance” has got to 
                        stop!

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s an expression of love.    

           Izzy holds up a small electronic box.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s a CLASS A FELONY!  I found the GPS 
                        tracker you had Grandpa sew into my 
                        purse!

                                 OLIVIA
                        Izzy, honey, we’re private investigators-

                                 IZZY
                        In this family, nothing is “private”!  

           ALBERT SPELLMAN (early-50’s) passes through the living 
           room holding a half-full bag of trash.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Trash day isn’t ‘till next week.  Dad’s 
                        going through everyone’s garbage looking 
                        for dirt!

                                 ALBERT
                        This isn’t our garbage.  It’s for the 
                        Jacobson case.  I’m trying to find proof 
                        of expense account abuse.  

                                 IZZY
                                 (accusatory)
                        So, you haven’t gone through our trash 
                        today?

           Albert slinks out, silently pleading the 5th.  Izzy 
           throws up her arms to Olivia in protest.  “See!?!?”

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where did the day get away to?
                                 (then; calling out)
                        Kitchen everyone!  Spellman Boardroom.  
                        Five minutes!

           Olivia follows Albert into the kitchen while a frustrated 
           Izzy heads for the front door, aching for freedom.  
           EXT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS, FRONT STOOP - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy sits on the bottom step -- stopped by an apparent 
           invisible force-field of guilt.  DAVID SPELLMAN (31), 
           walks up, a floating dream boat. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hey kiddo, where you going?

                                 IZZY
                        Nowhere apparently.  How did you do it?

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 IZZY
                        Escape this family.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s 8:45 A.M., I’m here for the daily 
                        board meeting before court... and you 
                        think I escaped?

                                 IZZY
                        They’re impossible.  You have no idea.  
                        Star athlete, bigshot lawyer, perfect 
                        son.  Christ, David, you never even got a 
                        “B” in school.

                                 DAVID
                        What about the one you forged on my 
                        report card for 9th grade Algebra?

                                 IZZY
                        Everyone should know what a “B” feels 
                        like.

                                 DAVID
                                 (teasing)
                        You know, I’m getting nostalgic here.  
                        Maybe I’ll move back home.  Take my old 
                        room above the garage.

                                 IZZY
                        And force me back into CIA Headquarters?  
                        I’ll murder you in your sleep.

                                 ALBERT (O.S.)
                                 (yelling from the house)
                        Spellman Boardroom Meeting, November 
                        11th, called to order!
                                 DAVID
                                 (smiling)
                        Come on, I don’t want to spoil my perfect 
                        attendance record.

           She slugs his arm.

           INT.  KITCHEN, SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - CONTINUOUS

           The family sits around the daily Spellman Board Meeting:  
           aka The Breakfast table.  David and Izzy dash in from 
           outside and join breakfast.  

           And, lastly, LITTLE RAE SPELLMAN (10).  When people say 
           “the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t”, 
           they clearly never met Little Rae.  Looking innocent as 
           pie, she wears an iPod ear-bud and eats Fruit Loops.

                                 ALBERT
                        Status reports?  David?

                                 DAVID
                        My firm has some new subpoenas for you 
                        guys to serve.

                                 LITTLE RAE

                        Girl Scout cookie process server!

                                 ALBERT
                        Fine, after school.  I’ll back you up.
                                 (beat)
                        David, would you pass the donuts?

           David reaches for a box of donuts, but Olivia stops him.  
           She pulls out a little blacklight flashlight and shines 
           it on the box, exposing FINGERPRINTS.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Darling, I ran these prints this morning.  
                        Do you want to admit you broke your diet 
                        or do we need to send a stool sample to 
                        the lab for custard?

                                 ALBERT
                        For God sakes, Dad, put on some pants!

           He’s saved by RAY SPELLMAN, Albert’s Father (71), who  
           strolls out in tightie-whitie briefs and a wife beater.  
           A career FBI man, Albert was sent on early retirement for 
           “excessively  bugging his co-workers”.
                                 BIG RAY
                        I burned them up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You burned your pants?

                                 BIG RAY
                        I was trying to make them flame retardant  
                        and-
                                 (illustrates with his hands)
                        -POOF.  

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        What about your other pairs?

                                 BIG RAY
                        I really thought the 12th version of the 
                        formula would work.

           They all start eating breakfast as Grandpa joins them.

                                 ALBERT
                        Izzy.  The Linda Cho case.  Is her 
                        husband gay and is he having an affair?  

           Izzy pulls out SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of an ASIAN MAN and a 
           GOOD-LOOKING GUY, passing them around the table... 

                                 IZZY
                        I followed Mr. Cho to Beechwood Country 
                        Club three times this week, where he’s 
                        played tennis with a Dr. Daniel Castillo, 
                        local dentist.  I’m going for a cleaning 
                        today to figure out which way he swings. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        I need you on the Lucchesi case A-SAP.  
                        Can’t Grandpa do it?

                                 IZZY
                        I was planning on seducing him.  And I’ve 
                        got bigger boobs.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                                 (under her breath)
                        Barely.   

           Izzy playfully throws a donut at her.  It bounces off of 
           Little Rae and lands near Albert.  He looks at it, but 
           feels Olivia’s eyes burning into him.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Last on the docket, we lost our fifth 
                        baby-sitter in a month.    
           Everyone turns to Little Rae.  She shrugs:

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        She couldn’t even handle “hide and seek”.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You lay motionless under the stove for 
                        six hours.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        So I’m good at the game!  So what?  

                                 ALBERT
                        So Izzy will need to take Little Rae on 
                        non-school-night stake-outs.  

                           IZZY
                                                      LITTLE RAE
           No!  No-no-no-no-no.  
                                             Yes!  Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.

                                 IZZY
                        She’s ten years old!!!

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’ve been training for this since I was 
                        born!

                                 ALBERT
                        Family vote.  All in favor?

           Everyone raises their hands, except Izzy.  She glares at 
           her brother: “E tu, Brutus?”  He smiles a perfect grin.  

           Little Rae throws her arms up in triumph.  FREEZE-FRAME.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        So this is my dysfunctional family.  If 
                        we spent half the time investigating our 
                        cases that we spend on each other, we’d 
                        put the police out of business.

           The DOORBELL RINGS.

                                 ALBERT
                        New clients!  Act normal!  

           The family fans out:  David to court, Big Ray to get 
           dressed, leaving Little Rae to eat her breakfast in peace 
           with her iPod. 

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy, Albert and Olivia all have smiles plastered onto 
           their faces.  Trying their best to look “normal”.  
           Sitting opposite them are TWO RED-HEADED SIBLINGS: LAURA 
           and PETER HOLT (mid-40s).

                                 LAURA HOLT
                                 (stalling; to Peter)
                        This is an exercise in futility.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        Then why are you here?

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        The pure joy of watching you look stupid.

           An awkward beat.  

                                 ALBERT
                        So, tell us, Mr. and Ms. Holt, what 
                        brings you to Spellman Investigations?

                                 PETER HOLT
                        Our parents died in a car accident on PCH 
                        three weeks ago.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Don’t be.

                                 PETER
                        Penny pinchers left us a triple mortgaged 
                        house, $382 in savings, and this:  

           Peter holds up a tattered-looking journal.  100 years old 
           and looks every day of it.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        I instantly love these two.  They make 
                        our family look healthy.

                                 PETER 
                        The lawyer gave it to me at the funeral.  
                        Turns out it was our grandfather’s.

           Izzy inspects the journal, intrigued.  

                                 IZZY 
                        Burn marks.  Water damage.  
                                 (then)
                        Wait... Holt - Not Cyrus Holt!?

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        So, you’ve heard of our family?  
                                 ALBERT
                        I was a police officer for twenty years.  
                        There isn’t a cop by the Bay who doesn’t 
                        know the name Holt.  

           Peter and Laura’s faces drop.  This has clearly been a 
           life-long issue for them. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Excuse my husband.  He hasn’t been the 
                        same since he hit his head.  

                                 ALBERT
                        I had to quit the force after an on-the-
                        job injury.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        He fell down a flight of stairs while 
                        walking to the bathroom.  He was telling 
                        his informant a joke.

                                 ALBERT
                        It was a really good joke.

                                 IZZY
                        Mom, Dad.  This is when we usually take 
                        the client’s history. 

                                 PETER HOLT
                        You’re holding it.  Go ahead.

           Izzy flips through the pages.  Toward the beginning is a 
           hand drawn aerial map of San Francisco. 

           EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO AERIAL SHOT - DAY

           CAMERA soars above S.F. in all its glory... Coit Tower... 
           the Golden Gate Bridge, the TransAmerica Pyramid, etc.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)

                        “April 18th, 1906.”  

           Below:  The city CHANGES.  The Golden Gate dissolves.  
           Coit Tower.  The Transamerica. All MELT INTO 1906 San 
           Francisco.

                        “Met the boys for dinner at Taditch 
                        tonight, sprung my plan on them...”

           ZOOM DOWN INTO:
           INT.  TADICH GRILL, 1906 - NIGHT

           It’s the same 156 year old restaurant Izzy had her date 
           in.  It’s unchanged except for the clothing and hair 
           styles.  We follow a waiter bringing three whiskeys to 
           same booth where Izzy was sitting.

           CYRUS HOLT (19) is a dashing, red-headed Irish rogue.  He 
           sits with his two red-headed brothers, JASPER (22) and 
           OSWALD (16).  They are looking over a hand-drawn map 
           drawn inside Cyrus’ pristine leather-bound journal (the 
           same one we just saw in Izzy’s hands).  

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Jasper, you’ve got the getaway buggy 
                        here.  Oswald will have the stolen 
                        uniforms.  I’m “borrowing” some firepower 
                        from Fort Alcatraz.  We hit ‘em fast, 
                        brothers, and we hit ‘em hard.

           Oswald throws back a shot of whiskey as Cyrus digs his 
           knife into the table, carving something in the wood.

                                 JASPER
                        Cyrus, we’ve never robbed more than a 
                        candy shop, and suddenly you want to take 
                        down the U.S. Mint?

                                 OSWALD
                        If 1/3 of the gold in the country is in 
                        there, why aren’t we taking THAT?

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Gold certificates ARE gold, Oswald.  You 
                        can trade ‘em in at any bank.  And 
                        they’re damn sure lighter.

                                 JASPER
                        You make it sound like buying catfish off 
                        the wharf.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        What did father always say?
                                 (thick Irish brogue)
                        “With family at your back, mountains 
                        crumble at your feet-

                                 OSWALD/JASPER/CYRUS
                        - ladies will swoon, and the whiskey will 
                        never run dry.”

           They raise their glasses and drink their shots.  Cyrus 
           pours another round, spilling extra whiskey on the table.
                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        To family!

           They down the next shot.  Glasses slam back down on the 
           table, as we see what Cyrus was carving... “C.H. + M.M.”  

           EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREET, 1906 - DAWN

           The three brothers are exhausted and drunk.  The whiskey 
           bottle is almost empty.  The sun is just rising.

           They stagger in front of the The US Mint at San 
           Francisco.  Steel, granite, stone.  Impossibly steep 
           steps leading to the giant iron doors.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        One week, my love, we have a date.

                                 JASPER
                        Cyrus, tell me what’s going on.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        I’m a criminal genius.

           Oswald lays out on the steps.

                                 JASPER
                        Who’s three fingers short of wetting 
                        himself.

                                 CYRUS HOLT 
                        Maggie’s not coming over.

                                 JASPER
                        From Dublin?

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Not unless I can bring her whole family.  
                        The whole clan McDonnell.  There’s no 
                        work, no money - she can’t leave ‘em.

                                 JASPER 
                        So your answer is robbing the U.S. Mint 
                        of San Francisco.  The Granite Lady.

           Cyrus steels his eyes into Jasper’s.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        She’s going to be my wife, Jasper.  
                        Nothing before family.

           Jasper digests this.  A crossroad.
                                 JASPER
                        You tell Maggie you’re naming the first 
                        two kids after their Uncle Jasper.  

           Cyrus grins and puts his brother in a neck hold.

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy lowers the book after perusing a few pages.

                                 IZZY
                        He robbed the mint for a girl!?  I can’t 
                        get a guy to hold the door.

                                 PETER HOLT 
                        Cyrus was our grandfather.  Mastermind of 
                        the biggest unrecovered heist in U.S. 
                        History.

                                 ALBERT
                                 (to Olivia)
                        Legend holds in the hours after the great 
                        Earthquake, Cyrus Holt supposedly made 
                        off with millions in gold certificates.  
                        And no one ever saw them again.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        I’d like to hire you to find them.

                                 IZZY
                        From 1906.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        My brother inherited the Holt “delusion 
                        gene”.

                                 ALBERT
                        Mr. Holt, with all due respect, people 
                        have been searching for that money for a 
                        hundred years.  There’s no hard proof he 
                        even stole the money. 

           Peter snatches the journal and flips through the pages.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        Maps.  Guard shifts.  Blueprints.  And 
                        here, at the end, he’s about to go into 
                        hiding with “the greatest treasure in 
                        history”.
                                 LAURA HOLT
                                 (shaking her head; sarcastic)
                        Oh, let’s not forget the will.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        The last line of my parents’ will says 
                        they hope we’ll inherit the “Holt Family 
                        Legacy.” 

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Peter, you’re grasping.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        No Laura!  This journal proves Cyrus 
                        pulled it off. Not only that, but there 
                        are four pages torn out at the end of the 
                        book.  It must give the location.  The 
                        money is real.

                                 IZZY
                        But why wouldn’t your parents-

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Dad was too ashamed to say his last name, 
                        let alone dig up some imaginary fortune.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        If it’s “imaginary” Laura, why did you 
                        call the currency museum?  

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        What are you talking about?

                                 PETER HOLT
                        I found the guy’s number in your purse!

                                 LAURA HOLT 
                        Yes, I called.  You know what he said?  
                        There’s no money!  Not a shred.  Cyrus 
                        lived poor and he died poor.  He was a 
                        lost cause, that’s the family legacy.

                                 ALBERT
                        Look, we can check into it.  See if any 
                        of the gold certificates turned up over 
                        the years.  Trace Cyrus’ history.

                        but if there’s something to uncover, 
                        we’ll find it.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        That’s all I ask.
           Everyone gets up.

                                 IZZY
                        Mr. Holt, we are very, very good at what 
                        we do.  If it’s out there, we’ll find it.

           Izzy opens the door and Little Rae stumbles in, 
           eavesdropping with a glass to her ear.

           INT. DENTIST OFFICE - LATER

           Izzy sits in a dentist chair getting her teeth cleaned by 
           a heavy-set American Indian HYGIENIST.  

           TYPE clacks onto the screen:  

           SUPER: “THE CHO CASE.  ATTEMPTED SEDUCTION.  2:37 PM”

           Izzy wears sexy jeans that look like they’re painted on.

                                 HYGIENIST
                        Dr. Castillo will be right in.

           Izzy leans over to spit, revealing her thong panties.

                                 IZZY
                        Is my thong sticking out too much?

                                 HYGIENIST
                                 (dryly)
                        How much of it is supposed to?

           Suddenly, DR. DANIEL CASTILLO (35) appears at the door 
           with her chart.  Dressed up, he’s even better looking 
           than the surveillance photos.  Izzy loses all composure.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hi.  You must be my new-

                                 IZZY
                        -Isabel.  Izzy.  Isabel.

           Izzy sits in the chair, trying to look sexy as Dr. Daniel 
           examines her teeth.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                                 (mumbling, fingers in mouth)
                        I’ve always wondered how dentists 
                        understand what people are saying.  Stuff 
                        in mouth and everything.
                                 DANIEL

                        And funny, too.  I couldn’t help but 
                        notice no wedding ring.

           A little drool drips from her chin.  He chuckles.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re drooling.

           Izzy blushes; the Hygienist hands Dr. Castillo a scraper.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        So what do you do for a living?

           CGI OVERLAY:  Daniel’s “file” appears on the screen, 
           Terminator style.

                        Spit.

           Izzy turns to drink a cup of water, revealing her thong.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wow.  The kids must love you.

                        How about you?  How does Dr. Daniel get 
                        his hands dirty off-hours?  Movies, 
                        walks... alternative bars?
                                 DANIEL
                        Honestly?  I like to get dirty.

                        there’s always the window if I’m willing 
                        to jump two stories into the dumpster.

           Her eyes light up.  This just went from being a job to 
           something a lot more interesting.

                        Or we could just, you know, go to dinner.

           Before Daniel can answer, the hygienist comes in with x-
           rays.  Daniel examines them.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Your lower left 1st and 2nd bicuspids say 
                        otherwise.  Two deep cavities.  And your 
                        upper right... oh, this isn’t good.
                                 (to Hygienist)
                        Clear my afternoon.

           Daniel picks up his drill and WHIRS it.  IZZY’S EYES GO 
           WIDE, as we CUT TO...  

           INT.  HOUSE, FRONT DOOR PEEPHOLE  

           DING DONG.  The Doorbell chimes.  Someone peers through, 
           standing outside is Little Rae in her Girl Scout Uniform.

           The door opens.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Would you like to buy some Girl Scout 
                        cookies?  Thin mints on special - check

           She hands over a sheet of paper. 

                                 MAN
                        Hey, this has my name on it.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You have been served by Rae Spellman.

           She curtsies and runs to the car.  Albert drives away.  

           INT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - DAY 

           Izzy walks in, cheeks puffed out, novocaine tongue.

                                 IZZY
                                 (cotton-mouth, mumbly)
                        He’s not gay.

           Olivia surfs the web with a copy of the Gold Certificate.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Who’s not gay?

                                 IZZY
                        Mr. Cho’s dentist.  He asked me out.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Old news.  Your grandpa bugged Cho 
                        screwing his receptionist at lunch.

                                 IZZY
                        Why didn’t anyone call me?

                                 OLIVIA
                        You were overdue for a teeth cleaning.

                                 IZZY
                                 (annoyed)
                        How go the Holts?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Lots of dead ends.  Apparently very few 
                        people had internet access in 1906.

           Izzy starts to head up to her room...

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                                 (without looking up)
                        So what did you tell the densist?

                                 IZZY
                        A dentist?  ME with a dentist?  Please.  
                        They date girls in skirts.
                                 OLIVIA
                        Why do you look like you’re lying?

                                 IZZY
                        Mom, I’ve practiced my poker face in the 
                        mirror so often, it’s frozen in one 
                        expression.  
                                 (stoic face)
                        This is me smiling.

           Not entirely satisfied, Olivia goes back to work.

           INT.  IZZY’S STUDIO APT, SPELLMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY  

           Izzy is awkwardly modeling a sexy dress in the mirror.

           She lives in the converted garage, her only refuge from 
           her parents.  It’s a funky quirky extension of her 
           personality -- hookah, tapestries, a poster of Kirk 
           Douglas’ film noir “Detective Story” on the closet door.  
           (Paramount Pictures, 1951).

           Big Ray knocks, entering the room wearing bathing trunks 
           and FBI T-shirt.  He takes in Izzy’s dress.  

                                 BIG RAY 
                        Costume party?

                                 IZZY
                        Date.  Don’t tell the overlords.  

           Big Ray laughs.  Izzy stops him with her glare.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Who’s the future ex-boyfriend?

                                 IZZY
                        Your optimism warms my heart.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Izzy, you don’t have new relationships.  
                        You have the same one over and over.  
                        Self-Destructive girl meets self-
                        destructive boy.  Passion, fighting, 
                        implosion, repeat.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m telling you, this boy’s different.  
                        He’s... normal.  

                                 BIG RAY
                        Since when did you like “normal”?
                                 IZZY
                        It’s like alternate universe normal, 
                        where normal is interesting.  I would 
                        kill to be this kind of normal -- like I 
                        wasn’t part of this insane family.  

                                 BIG RAY
                        Izzy, you can’t change who you are.

                                 IZZY
                        I’ve got 17 fake ID’s that say otherwise.

           She gives him a peck on the cheek.

           INT. SPELLMAN KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Albert wears his reading glasses, focused on a book on 
           the Great Quake.  Olivia is surfing the internet. 

           A KNOCK.  Olivia lets in LAURA HOLT.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        My brother is a liar.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Ms. Holt?

           Laura slams a 1906 Gold Certificate on the table.

                                 ALBERT
                        Is that-?

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        One 1906 U.S. Treasury Gold Certificate, 
                        legal tender.  I found it in Peter’s 
                        things three days after the funeral.  He 
                        already has the money.

                                 ALBERT 
                        Where’s the rest?

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        I want to hire you to follow Peter.  He’s 
                        got it somewhere, and knows I’m looking.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Then why would he hire us to find it?

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Because you won’t.  And then I’ll give 
                        and he keeps my half.  He never did like 
                        to share.  I don’t know what Peter’s got 
                        cooking, reward money, black market... 
                                      (MORE)
                                      LAURA HOLT (CONT'D)
                        but it’s definitely on the wrong side of 
                        legal.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Alright, we’ll put a team on him.  And 
                        we’ll keep trying to trace the money as a 
                        backup-

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        There’s no need.  He’s got it.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We like to cover every base, Ms. Holt.  
                        If it’s out there, we’ll find it.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Please keep me updated.  You can’t 
                        imagine what it’s like to not trust your 
                        own family.

           EXT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - NIGHT

           Daniel parks in front of the Spellman house.  THE SIGN on 
           the mailbox has been ALTERED.  Instead of “SPELLMAN 
           INVESTIGATIONS”, it now reads “SPELLMAN TUTORING.”

           Laura Holt exits, doing a double-take at the sign before 
           walking away.

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Albert and Olivia are in the kitchen whipping up dinner.  
           Little Rae flails, playing TV tennis on her Nintendo Wii.

                                 ALBERT
                        We need to up our surveillance on Peter 
                        Holt.  Rae, after dinner, help your 
                        mother look for any trace of those gold 
                        certificates in historical circulation.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Check.

           Albert licks brownie batter off his fingers.  Olivia 
           scowls and swaps his bowl with hers of brussel sprouts.

           Izzy walks in wearing a trench coat to hide her dress.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m going out for a bit.  Don’t wait up.
           The doorbell rings - it’s Daniel with a bottle of wine.  
           Izzy goes white and answers it.

                                 DANIEL
                                 (smiling at her trench coat)
                        Hi.  You look great.  Will you be 
                        exposing yourself later?  

                                 IZZY
                        I told you to park down the block!

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh, that’s okay, hon. Daniel called your 
                        line today and I told him how you wanted 
                        him to meet the family for dinner.

                                 IZZY
                        My private line.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes, somehow it rang in here.  I’ll have 
                        your grandfather check the wiring.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s nice to meet you all.

           Izzy pushes him into the bathroom.

                                 IZZY
                        You should wash up for dinner.  Get all 
                        that archeology dirt from under your 
                        nails.

           She shuts the door on the surprised man.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        I am at the absolute END.  If any of 
                        you... look, we’re a family of school 
                        teachers.  Simple.  Stick to it.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        What’s my back story?

                                 IZZY
                        You don’t have one!  You’re in 6th grade.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I think I should have a heroin problem.

                                 IZZY
                        You do not have a heroin problem!!!
           INT. SPELLMAN DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daniel and Izzy sit across from Rae and Ray.  Albert and 
           Olivia at the heads.  Izzy pours herself a triple whisky.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We’re so happy to meet you, Daniel.  I 
                        hope the invitation wasn’t too off-
                        putting.  We’re a very close family.

           Izzy is already in hell.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Not at all, Mrs. Spellman.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Please, call me Livy.  Everybody calls me 
                        Livy.

                                 IZZY
                        No one calls you Livy.

           Albert gets up to pour wine.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Isabel’s never dated someone with a 
                        medical license before.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Unless you count the guy who sold medical 
                        marijuana.  Dr. Cannabis.  I think that 
                        was an alias.  

           Behind Daniel, Albert reaches down to his collar.

                                 ALBERT
                        Stray hair.  Let me get that for you.

           Albert yanks a hair OUT OF DANIEL’S HEAD.  He jumps.  
           “OUCH”.

           As Albert surreptitiously places the hair is a small 
           plastic baggy.  

                                 ALBERT (CONT'D)
                        Oops.  Sorry.  I guess that one was still 
                        attached. 

           Daniel raises an eyebrow.  Slightly suspicious.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        So, Daniel, how old are you?
                                 IZZY
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s okay.  I’m thirty-five.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        And your birthday?

                                 IZZY
                        Don’t answer that question.

                                 DANIEL
                        February 15th.  

           Izzy sighs as Olivia jots down the date.  Albert holds up 
           his wine glass.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Cheers.  To new friends.  

           Daniel reluctantly picks up his glass and cheers.  As 
           soon as he puts it down, when he turns toward Albert, 
           Olivia QUICKLY SWITCHES OUT HIS GLASS, pouring out the 
           remainder of the wine and putting the fingerprinted glass 
           into another baggy.

                                 IZZY
                        MOM!!!

           But when Daniel turns back, the switch is complete.  
           Daniel looks around uncomfortably.  Finally, he turns to 
           the youngest and the oldest at the table.  

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re both named Rae?  That must get 
                        confusing.

                                 BIG RAY
                        I had cancer when “Livy” was pregnant.  
                        Didn’t look like I was going to make it, 
                        so they stole my name.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It was a tribute, Dad.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        But then he didn’t die like he was 
                        supposed to.  

                                 IZZY
                        Rae, five bucks to get out of here now.
                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Ten.  

           Without hesitation, Izzy hands a ten dollar bill to 
           Little Rae.  As she takes her plate to eat upstairs:

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        They really shouldn’t give me money.  
                        I’ve only been off the heroin a few 
                        months now.

           Daniel smiles, not buying it.  Suddenly, the door opens 
           and David walks in, suit and briefcase.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry I’m late, tied up at the office.

                                 ALBERT
                        The school office.

           Izzy just hangs her head, shaking it.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Daniel, this is Izzy’s brother, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 DANIEL
                        Likewise.  So you’re a teacher, too?

                                 BIG RAY
                        The whole damn family, teacher, teacher, 
                        teacher!

                                 DAVID
                        Izzy’s currently teaching her class about 
                        Machiavelli. Can someone find true 
                        happiness using lies and deceit- OUCH!

                                 IZZY
                        I’m sorry, was that your shin?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wow.  You must all be very dedicated.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Not really.
                                 ALBERT
                        Teaching wasn’t really our calling.  
                                 (whispers)
                        Frankly, we don’t like children.  

                                 IZZY
                        We really should get going.
                                 (hopefully; to Daniel)
                        How about a movie?
                                 (then; angrily to parents)
                        Or would you like a urine sample first?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I have no idea what you’re talking about, 
                        Isabel.

           Izzy is about to explode.  She turns to Daniel. 

                                 IZZY
                        I’m sorry, Daniel.  I’m afraid I can’t go 
                        out with you.  Not now.  Not ever.  

           Daniel is confused.  “What the hell is going on?”

                                 ALBERT
                        Izzy, don’t be ridiculous.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Dad’s right.  You’re not exactly a spring 
                        chicken.

                                 IZZY
                                 (hard; to Daniel)
                        I’d appreciate it if you’d leave now.  

           An awkward moment as Daniel heads for the door.  A beat, 
           and then he walks out.  Izzy stares down her parents.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        You said you’d behave!

           EXT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy runs and catches up to Daniel, who is getting into 
           his car.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m really sorry -- I just needed to get 
                        us out of there.  Do you want to, I don’t 
                        know, maybe get a drink or something?

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll take a rain check.
           Izzy’s face drops as Daniel drives off.  

           Izzy stomps her feet in the driveway.  Finally, she hops 
           into her Buick and speeds off in Daniel’s direction.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy’s Buick catches up to Daniel’s Lexus as he turns a 
           corner.  She follows behind, two cars behind.  Tailing.

           A moment later, her phone rings.

           INTERCUT DANIEL’S CAR --

                                 DANIEL
                        Isabel, is that you behind me?

                                 IZZY
                        Daniel, please stop the car.  

           The Lexus speeds up.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        I should warn you, Daniel, if you’re 
                        trying to shake me, it’s not going to 
                        happen.

                                 DANIEL
                        My car is faster than your car.

                                 IZZY
                        Trust me.  It’s not that simple.  

           Daniel hangs up as he speeds through a yellow light.  
           Izzy speeds through a red light.  

           The cars maneuver quickly through a few side streets.  
           Daniel’s Lexus loses some paint on a dumpster.  

           Izzy’s phone rings again.

                                 DANIEL
                        Are you trying to kill me?

                                 IZZY
                        Kill you?  We’re setting a world record 
                        for “slowest car chase”.

           As Izzy expertly maneuvers the car with one hand, pulling 
           next to Daniel, she pleads into the phone with the other. 
                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Look, my family is crazy.
                                 (shouting out the window)
                        Please stop the car!

           Daniel skids to a stop at the side of the road.  Izzy 
           jumps out of her car and moves to Daniel.  

                                 DANIEL
                        What!?! What do you want?!

           Izzy approaches.  This is not easy for her.     

                                 IZZY
                        I don’t know.  Daniel, there’s something 
                        different about you.  Yeah, I mean, 
                        you’re hot and I want to see you naked, 
                        but that’s the icing.  It’s the cake I 
                        want.  You’re the cake.  I have no idea 
                        why I’m using a baking analogy, but I’m 
                        going to run with it.  I’ve had a lot of 
                        cake in my day and even more icing -- not 
                        that I’m some icing addict.  I’ve never 
                        even tried chocolate icing, for example.  
                        I digress.  I never find cake and icing 
                        together that I like.  Until now.

                                 DANIEL
                        Could you stop with-

                                 IZZY
                        -There’s something special about you.

                                 DANIEL 
                        And you got all this from one teeth 
                        cleaning and half an awkward dinner?

                                 IZZY
                        Plus a car chase.
                                 (taking his hands)
                        I have the worst instincts when it comes 
                        to men, and my gut tells me we’d make a 
                        terrible couple.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ooookay...?

                                 IZZY
                        It means we’d be spectacular.

           INSERT -- a shot of the entire Spellman family sitting 
           around a speaker, listening to Izzy and Daniel’s 
           conversation via a BUG.
                                 IZZY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Please.  One normal date.  What have you 
                        got to lose?

           We CUT BACK TO SCENE:

                                 DANIEL
                                 (playful)
                        What have I got to win?

           Izzy smiles back.  Then... she sticks her fingers in her 
           mouth and mumbles like she’s at the dentist.

                                 IZZY
                                 (mumbling, SUBTITLED)
                        Next Saturday, plan something for us.  
                        I’ll be there with bells on.  And by 
                        bells, I mean my thong.

           Daniel looks at her strangely... then nods.  

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re very peculiar, Isabel Spellman.

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sounds of Daniel driving off.  The family looks at each 
           other, having no idea what was just said.

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Izzy storms into the house to find the family eating ice-
           cream out of the cartons at the kitchen table.  Looking 
           innocent.

                                 IZZY
                        I quit.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Quit what, dear?

                                 IZZY
                        This job.  This family.  This F’d up 
                        life!

                                 OLIVIA
                        You can’t quit.

                                 IZZY
                        Watch me.

           Izzy turns and starts to walk out.  
                                 OLIVIA
                        Section 12, paragraph 19.  

           This stops Izzy in her tracks.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Section 12, paragraph 19 of our 
                        employment contract states that in order 
                        to quit you must solve one last case or 
                        reimburse all back rent.

                                 IZZY
                        You can garnish my wages at my next job.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Won’t you need references to get that?  
                        And since this is the only job you’ve 
                        ever had...

           Izzy turns on them all, determined.  

                                 IZZY
                        Fine.  Give me the damn case.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. SPELLMAN OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

           DUST is blown off an OLD MANILA FOLDER.  Albert and 
           Olivia smile as they open the old file.  

                                 IZZY
                        What is that from, like 1985?!

                                 (re: paperwork)
                        Last seen on Market Street.  Hey, there’s 
                        a good lead.  

                                 IZZY
                        This is unfair!

           Olivia mock “flips through” the employment contract.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m sorry?  Where in your employment 
                        contract is there a “fairness clause?” 
           INT.  LITTLE RAE’S ROOM - NIGHT  

           Little Rae unlocks the outside of her bedroom door and 
           enters to find Big Ray standing in the middle of it.  He 
           looks like the cat who ate the canary.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        What are you doing in my room? 

                                 BIG RAY
                        ... This isn’t the john?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        There’s a big “No Trespassing” sign on my 
                        door and you had to pick three locks to 
                        get in! 
                                 (then)
                        What’s behind your back?  Is that my 
                        camera?!

           Big Ray shakes his head... nothing.  She moves forward 
           and pulls his hand into view... a nifty digital camera.  

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know what they call it in the old 
                        country, but where I come from, this is 
                        called stealing.  

                                 BIG RAY
                        It’s my camera!

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You gave it to me fair and square.

                                 BIG RAY
                        You blackmailed me.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I negotiated.  You didn’t want Mom to 
                        know you used your Medicare checks to bet 
                        on the 49ers, I needed a camera.
                                 (beat)
                        Can I help it if I accidentally followed 
                        you to the bookie’s???

                                 BIG RAY
                        You’re an evil little girl.

           She takes it back and pushes Big Ray out of her room.  

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’m installing a security system.
                                 BIG RAY
                        I look forward to breaching it.  This 
                        isn’t over!    

           Little Rae hops into her race car bed, and starts to look 
           over the Holt case file.  Izzy peeks inside.  Rae fumes.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        What do you want?

                                 IZZY
                        You’re mad at me?!

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You’re trying to quit the family.  You’re  
                        ditching me.

                                 IZZY
                        Rae, I’m not quitting you.  Just the 
                        business.  Like when David became a 
                        lawyer.  It’s called “growing up”.
                                 (changing tactics)
                        You realize if I left the business, you’d 
                        get all the cool cases.

           Rae lights up.  The silver lining. 

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Hmmmm.  I have been looking for a little 
                        more responsibility.

                                 IZZY
                        But I’m never going to solve a missing 
                        persons case from 1957.  What are you 
                        working on?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        A cake walk.  Trace the 1906 gold 
                        certificates and follow Mr. Holt with Dad 
                        for a few days.  See if he’s got the 
                        goods.  But they’ll never let us swap.

                                 IZZY
                        Section 13, Paragraph 7, subsection B:  
                        With consent, any Spellman may swap cases 
                        with another for a fresh perspective.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You’re good.

           Rae hands her the Holt case file (including the journal), 
           but doesn’t let go when Izzy tries to take it.
                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        I also want 20 candy bars, mixed variety, 
                        no Heath, Mars, or Special Dark.

           EXT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy walks downstairs to her parents sitting in the 
           living room.

                                 IZZY
                        I’ve swapped cases with Rae.  She’s got 
                        your 1957 Sherlock-Holmes-Couldn’t-Solve-
                        It-Time-Waster.  And before you veto it, 
                        it’s done.  You can’t undo the swap, your 
                        own rules!  As soon as I solve this Holt 
                        deal, I’m out of here.

           Little Rae hops onto the stairs, beaming.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Finished!  I just googled the guy from 
                        1957.  He has his own blog.  He moved to 
                        Seattle where he runs a Starbucks 
                        Franchise.  

           Izzy makes a poker face, pivots, and leaves the room.

           EXT. CABLE CAR, SAN FRANCISCO STREET - THE NEXT DAY

           Izzy stands in the middle of a downtown intersection.  
           She looks up at the street signs.  Fifth and Market.

                                 IZZY
                                 (into phone mic)
                        Yes, Dad, I’ll be at the Mint to pick up 
                        Holt in 10.  I’m doing a little research.

           She hangs up and, looks annoyed at the tourist next to 
           her holding a BARKING Chihuahua.

           She looks back down at the journal.  Takes out a pocket 
           digital sound-recorder, taking notes.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        “The plan was foolproof.  That is, until 
                        fate threw a little wrench into things.”

           We PUSH IN over her shoulder at the battered journal:

           CLOSE ON -- a hand-drawn map.  Fifth Street and Market.  
           “X” marks the spot on a nearby building.  
           CGI:  The paper magically gets cleaner, then smoldering 
           ASH lands on it.  PULL OUT, we find ourselves in...

           EXT.  1906, TENEMENT - DAWN

           Cyrus is now holding the journal open.  Outside, dogs are 
           barking.  KATE, Jasper’s wife, slams a glass into it, 
           making a slice in the paper that we just saw fade.

                                 KATE
                        Not in a hundred years, Cyrus!

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                                 (to Jasper)
                        Why did you tell her?

                                 JASPER
                        Women develop magic powers when they 
                        marry you.

                                 KATE
                        You are not taking my husband into a 
                        bloody hornet’s nest.  If you had an army 
                        to back you up, the answer wouldn’t 
                        change.

                                 JASPER
                        Maggie-

                                 KATE
                        -Maggie doesn’t need a dead fiancee any 
                        more than I need a dead husband.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        A family not worth risking your life for 
                        doesn’t deserve to be called a family.

           Kate bows her head, she can see Jasper has made his mind 
           up.  Oswald, still a little drunk, gets up to pee.

                                 KATE
                        Please-

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        I’ve planned for every possible thing.

           All three STUMBLE. 

                                 OSWALD
                        I’m drunker than I thought.

           They stumble again.
                                 JASPER
                        That’s not the booze.

           A DEEP RUMBLE STARTS.  BUILDINGS SHAKE.  BRICKS ARE 
           FALLING.  All four are knocked to their asses as the 
           floorboards BUCKLE.  The ceiling half caves in.  Out the 
           window, the building next door collapses.  Then another.

           It is the GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE.  9.0 on the 
           Richter scale.  Epic.

           When the dust finally settles, they slowly stand in the 
           half-caved-in tenement.  Screaming and crying can be 
           heard coming from every direction.

                                 KATE 
                        Did you prepare for that?

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Is everyone okay?

                                 OSWALD
                        I think so.  The city... it’s-

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        -flattened.  Forget next week -- we’re 
                        taking the Mint right now. 

           EXT.  1906, SAN FRANCISCO STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Cyrus, Oswald, and Jasper walk briskly down a steep hill, 
           passing the ruins of buildings.  They talk as fast as 
           they walk.

                                 CYRUS HOLT 
                        Jasper, I need you to get transportation.  
                        Anything that can carry our haul.  I 
                        don’t care if it’s a toy wagon.  

                                 JASPER
                        Done.

           He peels off.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Oswald, the Mint is made of granite so 
                        it’s probably partially standing.  This 
                        is good, less rubble to dig through.  
                        Hopefully, we can get to the vaults in a 
                        few hours.
           Cyrus stops short.  In the distance, EVERY BUILDING IS 
           COMPLETELY FLATTENED -- Except the Mint.  It’s PERFECT.  
           UNTOUCHED.  MASSIVE.  IMPERVIOUS.

                                 CYRUS HOLT (CONT'D)
                        You gotta be shitting me.

           A MODERN DAY IZZY walks across the frame, in front of the 
           Mint.  As she walks, we MATCH WIPE TO:

           EXT.  OLD MINT, PRESENT DAY - DAY

           Izzy walks to the corner, eyes flittering across the 
           pedestrians.  Searching.  

           CAMERA fast-motion rockets 2 blocks away where we see a 
           RED-HEADED MAN walking down the street.

           ON SCREEN - “SUBJECT: PETER HOLT. UNDER SURVEILLANCE.”

           RACK FOCUS:  Albert is about 15 feet behind in the crowd,  
           following him, unnoticed.  He whispers into his lapel.

           BACK TO IZZY.  A tiny ear piece crackles in her ear.

                                 ALBERT (V.O., ON EARPIECE)
                        In visual range.  Subject is heading your 
                        way.  South on Mission.  2 blocks out.

           She speaks into her collar -- a transmitter.

                                 IZZY
                                 (into lapel)
                        Holding at Mission and 5th for transfer.

           Izzy stops, leans against a building, and starts reading 
           the paper.  Suddenly, Little Rae rolls up on her roller-
           sneakers.  She speaks into a digital tape recorder.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                                 (to tape recorder)
                        Subject is heading North on Mission.  
                        Bought Jamba Juice, medium orange with 
                        energy boost.  Window shopping.

                                 IZZY
                                 (not looking at her, annoyed)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Tailing a suspect.
                                 IZZY
                        What suspect!?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Fat guy in the blue suit.

                                 IZZY
                        What case is that for?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        It’s not for a case.  I’m honing my 
                        skills.

                                 IZZY
                        Rae, you know what Mom and Dad said about 
                        following strangers!  You could get hurt.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I could get hurt playing squash.  

                                 IZZY
                        You don’t play squash.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Not the point.  

                                 IZZY
                        Shouldn’t you be in school?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Field trip: ditched.
                                 (off Izzy’s look)
                        Stevie Mehlman won’t stop shooting 
                        spitballs at the back of my head.  

           In the distance, we see a class of 6th graders lined up 
           outside the S.F. Chronicle office.  We see FUGLY-LOOKING
           STEVIE MEHLMAN eyeing Little Rae.  Izzy eye-balls him 
           right back.  The Fat Man moves on.

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        Subject moving.

           Rae covers her face with a comic book and glides her 
           wheel-sneakers out of frame.  

           Izzy lifts her newspaper again.  A MOMENT LATER... PETER 
           HOLT appears in the crowd.  He looks over his shoulder.

                                 ALBERT (V.O., ON EARPIECE)
                        Potentially made by subject.  Dropping 
                        tail.
                                 IZZY
                                 (into collar)
                        I’ve got the package.  Following into the 
                        Old Mint.

                                 ALBERT (V.O., ON EARPIECE)
                        Roger that.

           Izzy drops the newspaper, now wearing a BLONDE WIG.  

                                 OLIVIA (V.O., ON EARPIECE)
                        Izzy, I’m making pork chops for dinner.

                                 IZZY
                                 (into collar)
                        Mom, get off the line!  I’m working!

                                 OLIVIA (V.O., ON EARPIECE)
                        I just wanted to know if you were going 
                        on a date tonight or-

           Izzy rips out her earpiece in disgust and heads into:

           INT.  OLD MINT - CONTINUOUS

           The Old Mint of San Francisco is a monument to a grander 
           era.  Doric Columns peer down at the street, a stunning 
           Greek Revival.  Now “The Granite Lady” is the home The 
           United States Currency Museum.

           The Curator, KARL MÜELLER (mid 40s), leads two dozen 
           bored tourists through the exhibits.  His muscle-bound 
           body tests his Zegna suit.  There’s an old press, a 
           bullion smelting machine, a giant photo of the mint from 
           1906 surrounded by absolute devastation, etc.

                                 KARL
                        Money.  It’s the blood that keeps society 
                        alive.  It starts wars and ends them.  It 
                        cures disease and built the atom bomb.  
                        Collectors will pay millions for a rare 
                        penny that you might pass on the street.  

           Izzy follows PETER HOLT from a distance as he joins the 
           tour.  Karl leads everyone to a large exhibit.

                                 KARL (CONT'D)
                        We conclude our tour on April 18th, 1906.  
                        The greatest and worst day in this 
                        building’s history.

                        The Granite Lady withstood the worst 
                        Mother Nature had to offer, yet not the 
                        worst of man, as millions in gold 
                        certificates went missing.  Please feel 
                        free to donate to the museum on your way 
                        out.

           Peter approaches Karl; Izzy keeping a shallow distance.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        They ALL went missing?

                                 KARL
                        To this day.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        Peter Holt.

           Peter stands next a life-size photo of CYRUS HOLT in the 
           exhibit.  The resemblance is uncanny, down to the hair.

                                 KARL
                        Look at that.  Please, come to my office.

           IZZY quickly takes the gum out of her mouth, and pulls 
           the transmitter from her collar.  IN ONE FLUID MOVE, Izzy 
           “DROPS” her purse at Holt’s feet, bends over to pick it 
           up, sticks her gum/transmitter on the back of Holt’s 
           shoe, unnoticed, and slips away.  She’s that good.

           Peter Holt heads into the office with Karl.  Izzy puts 
           the earpiece back in -- she can now hear them.

           As she listens, she watches them through the glass window 
           while pretending to study the exhibits.

                                 KARL (ON EARPIECE) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Yes, your sister contacted me recently, 
                        and I’ll tell you what I told her.  As 
                        far as the money, there’s no conclusive 
                        proof your grandfather even stole it; and 
                        certainly no way to know  what became of 
                        it.

                                 PETER HOLT
                        You’re certain she didn’t know where the 
                        money was?  I have reason to believe-

           Right then, IZZY’S CELL PHONE RINGS.  She looks at the 
           number -- It’s Daniel.  Damn.  She answers quickly.

                                 IZZY (TO CELL PHONE)
                        Hi you!
                                 DANIEL (V.O., ON PHONE)
                        Okay to talk?  I tried to time it during 
                        recess.

                                 IZZY
                        Actually I’m... my class is on a field 
                        trip right now.
                                 (she shouts at a kid standing 
                                  next to her)
                        Toby, stop climbing on that!

           The kid just stares at her.  She mouths “sorry”.  He 
           gives her the finger.

                                 DANIEL (V.O., ON PHONE)
                        Can you meet me at the San Francisco 
                        Tennis Club tomorrow, say eleven?

                                 IZZY
                        Sounds great.  Toby!  Stop--  I have to 
                        go.  And Daniel, I’m excited to see you.

                                 DANIEL
                        Me, too.  You.  Not me.  I can see me 
                        anytime.

           She hangs up, smiling, and pushes the earpiece in.

                                 PETER HOLT (ON EARPIECE)
                        One last question.  Hypothetically, if 
                        the bills did exist, what would they be 
                        worth?

                                 KARL (ON EARPIECE)
                        Nothing.  They’re government property.

                                 PETER HOLT 
                        What about to a private collector?  

                                 KARL 
                        Well... a fortune.  But if you have 
                        information about the where-abouts of 
                        stolen government property-

                                 PETER HOLT 
                        Thank you for your time.

           Izzy speed dials her phone.

                                 IZZY (TO CELL PHONE) 
                        Grandpa?  The transmitter-

                                 BIG RAY (ON PHONE)
                        -on it.  I’ve been listening.
           Peter walks past briskly.  Karl following.

                                 KARL
                        Mr. Holt, if you know anythi--

           EXT.  OLD MINT - CONTINUOUS

           Peter Holt hurries down the steps... Big Ray, at the 
           bottom, “accidentally” collides with him.

           Ray snatches the gum/transmitter from Holt’s shoe.  Holt 
           hurries off and Grandpa smirks, pocketing the bug.  

           Albert strolls up, along with Olivia (who drags Little 
           Rae by the collar).  Izzy joins from inside.

                                 ALBERT
                        It’s so nice when the family gets to 
                        visit the museum together, don’t you 
                        think?

           Something catches Izzy’s attention off-screen.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           A class of 11-year-olds board a school bus.  As bully 
           Stevie Mehlman passes, a hand PULLS HIM OUT OF LINE.

                                 IZZY
                                 (threatening)
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 STEVIE MEHLMAN
                        You’re Gay Rae’s sister. 

                                 IZZY
                        Call her that again and...

           Izzy holds up a ball-point pen.

                                 STEVIE MEHLMAN
                        You’ll draw on me?

                                 IZZY
                                 (hushed)
                        This isn’t a pen.  My grandfather built 
                        advanced FBI technology for 30 years.  
                        This is a delivery system for a 
                        classified neurotoxin.  It’s like mace 
                        for your bowels.  At 5 seconds it makes 
                        you poo and pee uncontrollably.

                        projectile vomiting out someone’s nose?

                        One more spit-ball, call her “Gay Rae” 
                        one more time...

           Izzy starts to click open the pen.  The terrified boy 
           runs post-haste into the bus.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        I’m glad we had this little talk!

           As Izzy pockets her pen, she’s stopped by Little Rae.

           INT. SPELLMAN KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Olivia and Albert make breakfast.  Albert slathers butter 
           on his pancakes.  And more butter.  And more... 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Big break on that insurance fraud case.  
                        I got shots of Joe Neck-Brace playing 
                        beach volleyball yesterday.  
                                 (unable to contain herself)
                        I thought Dr. Schneider put you on a 
                        diet.  

                                 ALBERT
                        She did. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Does it have a butter-and-pancake-theme?

                                 ALBERT
                        Can I have a little latitude?  A pinch?  
                        I have been so good lately.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You haven’t cheated today?
                                 ALBERT
                        Not once.

           Olivia then opens the cabinet -- a little black and white 
           TV and DVR is in there, with wires running into the 
           fridge.  She flips it on the TV and BLACK AND WHITE 
           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE from INSIDE THE FRIDGE COMES ON.  
           The time stamp says 2:13am.

           ON TV:  The fridge door opens and we see Albert in his 
           bathrobe eyeing a slice of chocolate cake.  In one motion 
           he shoves the entire huge piece in his mouth.

           Albert slides the pancakes away in disgust.  He bites 
           into an apple from the centerpiece.

           Olivia sorts through the mail, pleased with herself.

                                 ALBERT (CONT’D)
                                 (mouth full of apple)
                        You are such a shrew.

           Olivia stops on a MANILA ENVELOPE... Inside are 
           PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALBERT IN BED WITH A NAKED BLONDE.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Wow.

           Albert looks at the pictures, munching his apple.  
           Neither bats an eye.

                                 ALBERT
                        Would you look at that.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (squinting)
                        Izzy is getting incredibly good with 
                        Photoshop. You barely see the jagged 
                        pixels where she attached your head.

                                 ALBERT
                        Beautiful work.

           A beat as Olivia looks torn.  They both turn serious.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maybe she has a right to be angry.  Did 
                        we go too far with Daniel?

                                 ALBERT
                        She makes bad choices.  I could argue 
                        that other parents don’t go far enough.
           INT.  SAN FRANCISCO TENNIS CLUB - LATER  

           Izzy is standing in the lobby wearing an adorable tennis 
           outfit holding a racket.  Daniel arrives wearing heavy 
           construction-style clothes.  He carries a tool box.

                                 DANIEL
                        What are you wearing?

                                 IZZY
                        Ummm... Tennis clothes?

                                 DANIEL
                        I said to meet me here, not... it’s my 
                        mistake.  I’m sorry.

                                 IZZY
                                 (teasing)
                        It’s my fault.  Tennis clothes, tennis 
                        courts -- crazy leap in logic.

           Daniel smiles and takes her hand sweetly, leading her 
           down a service corridor to the boiler room, then to an 
           ancient door guarding a stairwell down.

                                 DANIEL
                        You know what’s even better than sports?  
                        Time travel.

           INT.  DECREPIT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel turns on his flashlight -- beyond the filth and 
           debris are broken gambling tables, ancient casino signs, 
           and ornate woodwork.

           Two UNIVERSITY GRAD STUDENTS are carefully digging in a 
           corner.  They nod to Daniel, who waves back.

                                 DANIEL
                        Welcome to 1856.  The El Dorado, hottest 
                        gambling hall of the Gold Rush.

                                 IZZY
                        Soooo freaking cool.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m working with Urban Archeologists at 
                        Stanford to excavate on the weekends.

           Izzy is poking around.
                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        People are walking right on top of their 
                        own history without realizing it.

                                 IZZY
                        You are one weird dentist.

                                 DANIEL
                        No, my love of oral hygiene is weird.  My 
                        - this - I think everyone else is weird 
                        for NOT loving it.

           She looks at him with sweet, comprehending eyes.

                                 IZZY 
                        The tricky part is finding your “this”.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Exactly.  C’mon lets get out of here 
                        before our date ends with a tetanus shot.

                                 IZZY
                        Are you kidding?

           Izzy scurries over to the Grad Students, getting onto her 
           hands and knees, joining them in the dirt.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        So, guys, what are we digging up?

           Daniel can’t keep his smile buried.

           EXT.  21ST AMENDMENT BREWERY CAFE, SF - NIGHT

           Izzy and Daniel stumble out of the bar, laughing.  They 
           are covered in dirt and grime and couldn’t be happier.  
           The great afternoon has stretched into a great night.

                                 DANIEL
                        For a school teacher, you drink more like 
                        a sailor.  Do you think sailors drink a 
                        lot?  Where does that expression come 
                        from anyway?  Maybe there was one sailor 
                        80 years ago who was such a raging 
                        alcoholic they started saying that.

                                 IZZY
                        Do you think 80 years from now they’ll 
                        say “You’re drunkenly analytical like a 
                        dentist-archeologist”?
                                 DANIEL
                        Hey!  2nd and Federal.  Did you know in 
                        the 1820’s, the largest cannery west of 
                        the Mississippi was right here?

                                 IZZY
                        Really?

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

           He laughs hard at his own joke.  Izzy swats him.

                                 IZZY
                        I would so have kicked your ass in Jr. 
                        High.  You are such a dork.  

                                 DANIEL
                        A dork who took you to 1856.

                                 IZZY
                        Next time can we go to 1906?  I’m trying 
                        to solve a mystery.
                                 (catching herself)
                        For my class.  Class report.

                                 DANIEL
                        You know, the Stanford research database 
                        is incredibly deep.  Genealogy for the 
                        whole Bay Area, history, public records, 
                        financials. You’re welcome to log into 
                        my account there with the kids.

           She kisses his cheek.  He doesn’t pull back.  They’re 
           about an inch apart.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        Am I so different from the guys you 
                        usually date?  

                                 IZZY
                        You’re so much less damaged.  

           Daniel moves to kiss her when a SKETCHY GUY bumps him.  
           Izzy pulls back from the kiss, radar going off.

                                 SKETCHY GUY
                        Sorry.

                                 IZZY (V.O.) 
                        Here’s a P.I. trick you can take home: 
                        when it’s a wide sidewalk and someone 
                        still bumps into you?  DANGER WILL 
                        ROBINSON. 
           Izzy makes a decision, she TAKES OFF AFTER THE MAN into 
           the bar.  Daniel, confused, chases after her.

                                 DANIEL
                        Izzy?

           INT.  MEN’S ROOM, BAR - A MOMENT LATER

           The Suspicious Man is using the URINAL.  Izzy storms in, 
           Daniel a few steps behind.

                                 IZZY
                        Okay, asshole, hand it over.

                                 SKETCHY MAN
                        Lady, you’re in the men’s room.

                                 IZZY
                        From where I stand, you’re a few inches 
                        short of qualifying, too.  Hand it over.

                                 DANIEL
                        Izzy-?

           Izzy reaches for the man’s jacket pocket and he slaps her 
           hand away.  In about 3 seconds, Izzy unleashes a fierce 
           KRAV MAGA martial arts ASSAULT on the guy.  He slumps 
           into the urinal,  barely conscious.  

           Izzy pulls DANIEL’S WALLET FROM THE MAN’S JACKET.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        That’s my-!

           Izzy hands it to him.  She looks expectantly.  She’s 
           blown it.  The jig is up.

           Daniel grabs her and gives her an awesome, intense, 
           passionate KISS.  Izzy’s eyes are wide with shock.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        That was the hottest thing I’ve ever 
                        seen.

           He kisses her again.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        What was that?  Jujitsu?

                                 IZZY
                        Krav Maga.  It’s an Israeli martial art.  
                                 DANIEL
                        You handed that guy his ass!

           BEAT.  Izzy handles Daniel’s ass as she kisses him back, 
           stumbling INTO A STALL.  THE DOOR CLOSES, but we see 
           intermingling feet. 

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        This is good.  You’re a little damaged.

           INT. SPELLMAN CAR - AFTERNOON 

           Ray and Rae are staking-out Mr. Holt’s house.  They share 
           a tin of mixed nuts.  Little Rae uses her digital camera 
           (the one that Big Ray tried to swipe) to spy on Peter.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I can see Holt in the window.  This is so
                        pimp.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Stakeouts should be quiet, not “pimp”.

           He turns down the teeny-bop music and closes his eyes.

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        Wake me if Holt makes a move.

           INT. IZZY’S GARAGE STUDIO APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Izzy is on the computer.  David tries cleaning up her 
           stray clothing.  Her studio would not be featured in 
           Better Homes and Gardens.

                                 DAVID
                        This room smells different from when I 
                        lived here.  Is that microwaved broccoli? 

           Izzy ignores him.  Pinned to every wall are dozens of 
           index cards with notes, maps, each page of the journal 
           photocopied and blown up.

                                 IZZY
                        If Cyrus Holt stole the money in 1906, 
                        and his grandkids have the only known 
                        certificate in 2008, then it stands to 
                        reason that the rest of the loot was or 
                        is somehow still in the Holt family.
                                 DAVID
                        Look, I didn’t say anything to Mom and 
                        Dad, but I called up a friend at police 
                        records.

                                 IZZY
                        I have no convictions, only indictments!

                                 DAVID
                        Iz, forensics thinks the Holt’s parents 
                        car accident was deliberate.  It wasn’t 
                        conclusive, but... be careful.

           Izzy’s touched.  She gives him a peck on the cheek.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        So, what’s going on with the boy?  Did we 
                        drive him off.

           She rolls her eyes and ignores him deliberately.

                                 IZZY 
                        Help me run this:  None of the Holts ever 
                        had a penny saved, let alone earned.  
                                 (pacing in front of cards)
                        Records show that Cyrus fled to Mexico 
                        after the earthquake, supposedly with the 
                        gold certificates.  But he lived a modest 
                        life down there, and didn’t send for his 
                        fiancee for 2 years.  If he had the 
                        money, why did he wait?

                                 DAVID
                        Laying low?

                                 IZZY
                        Family was everything to this guy, you 
                        should read this journal.  The whole 
                        robbery was to get his girl over from 
                        Ireland.  He risks his life to be with 
                        her, then waits 2 years?
                                 (beat)
                        But that’s not all.  After they have a 
                        kid, they went back to the states so the 
                        kid would know his relatives.
                                 (holding up court records)
                        The Feds grabbed Cy two seconds over the 
                        border and sent him up to Alcatraz.  
                        Money never recovered.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe it was stolen from Cyrus?
                                 IZZY
                        Not one bill has ever turned up.  Until 
                        yesterday.

           Looking over her shoulder at the computer printouts.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you doing hacking into the 
                        Stanford University historical database?

                                 IZZY
                        I was invited to peruse.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, you perused into a dead end.

                                 IZZY
                        Literally.  Cyrus died escaping from 
                        Alcatraz in ‘62.

           She throws down a newspaper photocopy with a picture of 
           an old Cyrus and a headline detailing his death.  

                                 DAVID
                        Square one.  Wait-

           David leans over the computer and starts typing.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        It looks like Cyrus’ cellmate is still 
                        alive, trailer park up North.

                                 IZZY
                        I was JUST ABOUT to do a search on that.  
                        Hate you.  Why do you have to be perfect?

           David goes to leave.

                                 DAVID 
                        Trust me, perfect ain’t all it’s cracked 
                        up to be.  And Iz-

                                 IZZY
                        I know.  Be careful.

           Izzy walks to the photocopied journal blown up, covering 
           the walls.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                                 (to the pages)
                        Cyrus, old buddy, you can run, but you 
                        can’t hide.
           MATCH CUT:  A DANK BASEMENT, the same photocopied pages 
           adorn the walls.  A map with push-pins tracking all the 
           Holts movements trough the 20th Century.  Someone else is 
           looking just as hard as Izzy.

           A MAN’S HAND traces the photocopied journal.  A PHOTO OF 
           THE SPELLMANS IS ALSO ON THE WALL.

                                 MAN’S GRUFF VOICE
                        ...No, you can’t hide.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car is quiet, Grandpa Ray is fast asleep.  Little Rae 
           watches the building’s front door through binoculars.

           Score!  The door opens and out walks Peter Holt.  He 
           walks to his car.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Grandpa.  Wake up!

           Peter Holt starts up the car; Rae nudges Grandpa again.

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        Grandpa!  Get up!!!  He’s getting away!!!

           Ray doesn’t move.  Rae starts to get scared.  Is he DEAD?

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        Grandpa?
                                 (beat, sad realization)
                        Grandpa...

           SUDDENLY, Grandpa starts SNORING LOUDLY as Peter Holt 
           drives away.  Rae SMACKS him.

           INT. SPELLMAN OFFICE - THAT NIGHT

           Albert and Olivia are both working on the Holt case.  
           Albert stands in front of a map of San Francisco, with 
           push pins marking all of Peter Holt’s movements.  

           Olivia is at a drafting table, working on splicing 
           together a fake San Francisco Chronicle I.D. for Izzy.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Matching Peter’s credit card history with 
                        his visits this week, the Mint is the 
                        only place that’s unusual. 

           Little Rae bursts in, Big Ray sheepishly follows.
                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I can’t work with him!  He’s 
                        unprofessional!

                                 BIG RAY
                        I nodded off.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        On a stake out!  On a stake out!  I 
                        thought he was dead until he started 
                        snoring.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Sorry to disappoint.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Dead at least I can still respect you!

           Little Rae picks up her iPod and storms outside, bumping 
           into Izzy as she exits.     

           Olivia puts the finishing touches on the fake I.D. and
           hands it to her.

                                 IZZY
                        Looks good.  
                                 (then, seeing the name)
                        Fudrucker?  Really?  Sally Fudrucker?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Snotty daughters get unpleasant names.

           Annoyed, Izzy clips on the I.D. and walks out.

           EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAWN

           The rocky coast 100 yards below, Izzy sings Johnny 
           Paycheck’s “Take This Job And Shove It” along with the 
           radio as she pulls off the freeway.

           A moment later, a BLACK SUV pulls off behind her.

           EXT.  TRAILER PARK, NORTHERN CA COAST - DAY

           Izzy sits outside a disgusting, dilapidated trailer in an  
           equally sad trailer park.  This is where vehicles -- and 
           people -- go to die.  She wears her faux reporter’s I.D. 
           around her neck.  

           Across from Izzy is HERMAN DUPONT, an ancient man on the 
           wrong side of 100.  He uses an oxygen mask and smokes a 
           cigarette at the same time.
                                 HERMAN
                        Fortune in gold?  Cyrus Holt?
                                 (then; suspicious)
                        What did you say your name is again?

           She holds up her I.D.

                                 IZZY
                        Sally Fudrucker.  With the Chronicle.  
                        I’m doing an article about the 1906 
                        quake.  

                                 HERMAN
                        Fudrucker, huh?

                                 IZZY
                                 (deeply annoyed at Olivia)
                        That’s the name my mother gave me.

           Herman warms, feeling a bond toward her fake identity.  
           He takes another long drag.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Did Cyrus ever mention gold certificates?  
                        Maybe a robbery during the Earthquake?

                                 HERMAN
                                 (smiling a toothless grin)
                        You know how fisherman exaggerate fish, 
                        boys exaggerate their Friday night dates?  
                        On The Rock, people spin tales about 
                        their “big scores”.

                                 IZZY
                        But if it were true, what happened to the 
                        money?  Would Cyrus have told his son 
                        where he hid it?

                                 HERMAN
                        Twenty years in lock-up and his boy never 
                        visited the old man once.  Kids ain’t got 
                        no respect anymore.
                                 (then)
                        You got kids?
                                 (Izzy shakes her head)
                        You want ‘em?  

           Izzy humors him with a smile, still needing more info.  

                                 HERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Well, Cy did talk a lot about his lottery 
                        ticket.
                                 IZZY
                        “Lottery ticket”?

                                 HERMAN
                        Cy was an odd duck... he’d go on and on 
                        how his jackpot was waiting for him when 
                        he got out.  That’s why he swam for it in 
                        1962.  Poor bastard could dream better 
                        than he could breaststroke.

                                 IZZY
                        Do you have any idea where or what this 
                        “ticket” was?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

           Izzy speeds down the highway, back toward San Francisco.

                                 HERMAN (V.O.)
                        Best I can do is point you to Alcatraz, 
                        back of our cell.  Cy had some nonsense 
                        he carved into the wall.  Broadway

                        Daniel?  I know we talked about digging 
                        up dinosaur bones or something--

                                 DANIEL (ON SPEAKER)
                        A DINER.  The group is excavating a diner 
                        built over from the 40s.  It’s urban

                                 IZZY
                        I still think that name sounds like a hip-
                        hop clothing store.  Can we push our date 
                        a few hours?  I have to make a pit stop 
                        on Alcatraz Island, don’t ask.

                                 DANIEL
                        I love Alcatraz!

                                 IZZY
                        Of course you do.  Wait - hold on, call 
                        waiting.
           The number reads “PRIVATE”, Izzy switches over.

           An ELECTRONICALLY SCRAMBLED VOICE is on the other end.

                                 VOICE (O.S., CELL PHONE)
                        Drop the case before someone gets hurt.

                        Nice try, Mom.  So I drop the case and 
                        stay under your thumb forever?

                        Daniel?  Dress warm.

           EXT.  FERRY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY - LATER THAT DAY

           Daniel, Izzy, and Little Rae ride a choppy ferry. 

                                 DANIEL
                                 (to Little Rae)
                        It’s awfully nice of your sister to take 
                        you to Alcatraz for your class report.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Oh yeah, Izzy’s the best.  I can’t 
                        imagine a better role model.

           Without missing a beat, we see Izzy slip a twenty to 
           Little Rae behind her back, out of Daniel’s view.

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        Did you know Izzy once raced into a 
                        burning building to save a litter of 
                        puppies?

           Izzy squeeze’s Rae’s arm... enough!

           EXT.  ALCATRAZ - DAY

           As they get off the ferry, Izzy whispers to Little Rae:
                                 IZZY
                        I need you to keep Daniel busy while I do 
                        some digging.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        What is he even doing here?

                                 IZZY
                        I’m multi-tasking.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Daniel?  Do you know anything about 
                        Alcatraz?

                                 DANIEL
                        Do I?  Rae, before Alcatraz became a 
                        prison, it was a Military Fort, later 
                        used to hold Civil war deserters.  And 
                        underneath is the dungeon where they 
                        locked ‘em up.

           Rae takes Daniel by the arm and drags him off.  She 
           sneaks a thumbs up to Izzy, who slips into a closed off 
           section of the Prison.

                                 LITTLE RAE (O.S.)
                        Tell me some more weird things.

           INT.  ALCATRAZ CELL BLOCK - DAY

           Izzy is going down an abandoned cell block, looking for 
           #57.  It’s eerily quiet.  Ghosts of criminals past.

           Finally she finds it and steps in -- all the doors are 
           open.  Inside is just a rusted bed frame.  She moves the 
           frame and examines the wall until she sees it:

           CARVED IN TO THE CONCRETE:  “M -- Tá an stór faoi cheilt
           ar chúl mo chuid focal”

                                 IZZY
                        What is that, Esperanto?  You couldn’t 
                        draw a nice map with an “x”?

           Izzy  writes it down... suddenly ALL THE CELL BLOCK DOORS 
           BEGIN TO SLIDE CLOSED.  Thinking fast, Izzy kicks the bed 
           frame, JAMMING THE DOOR.

           She hurries out of the cell... FOOTSTEPS ECHO, GETTING 
           LOUDER. 

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Mom!  This isn’t funny!
           She sees a figure appear in the shadows at the end of the 
           hall.  MUCH too big to be her mother.  She sees the 
           shadow of a knife drop down into his hand.   

           Izzy runs.

           INT.  ALCATRAZ CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy is rushing through this closed off part of the 
           prison, in the distance she can hear a tour nearby.

           The heavy footsteps are gaining on her.  

           Izzy reaches a door, she’s almost back with the tour... 
           LOCKED!

           Behind her, she hears the sound of the KNIFE SCRAPING 
           AGAINST THE CONCRETE WALL.  

           The footsteps getting louder, she spies an open access 
           hatch in the floor and a ladder, leading down.

           INT.  ALCATRAZ UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS - CONTINUOUS

           This is the “dungeon” of Alcatraz, were Civil War 
           deserters were imprisoned.  The light is dim as Izzy runs 
           past ancient cells.

           She stops for a moment and looks back at the light from 
           the access hatch being opened.  Someone is coming.

           IZZY DUCKS INTO A CELL AND PUSHES THE SOLID DOOR CLOSED.  
           SHE KEEPS HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE DOOR, HYPER-
           VENTILATING.

           STEPS APPROACH... CLOSER... CLOSER... 

           ... they pass the cell... STOP... then DOUBLE BACK.

           SUDDENLY, the FOOD SLOT IN THE DOOR OPENS, right where 
           Izzy is pushing.  A man’s hand, wearing a large Panerai 
           watch, grabs her wrist and pulls it through the slot.

           Izzy tries to pull her hand back, but the man is too 
           strong.  She freezes when a hunting knife is pressed 
           against her wrist.

           As the man talks, he makes lazy circles with the knife 
           point over her wrist... palm... fingers...
                                 MAN’S GRUFF VOICE
                        Do you think you’re the only ones looking 
                        for this?  I warned you to walk away.  
                        Now do I take your hand?  Or do I take 
                        Olivia’s?  Or maybe your sister’s?

                                 IZZY
                        No.  Please stop.

           He purposely slices her palm, drawing blood.  She yanks 
           her hand back through the slot.

                                 MAN’S GRUFF VOICE 
                        I wouldn’t stick your neck out. 

           Izzy quickly reaches into her purse for a mirror.  She 
           thrusts it through the opening, hoping for a better look.

           But the ATTACKER is GONE.  

           INT.  OLIVIA & ALBERT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Olivia and Albert lie in bed.  She’s reading a TYPED 
           REPORT, he’s watching “The Rockford Files” on television.  

           Izzy walks in, shaken up.  Her hand is bandaged.  

                                 IZZY
                        Truce.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What happened?  

                                 IZZY
                        A man held a knife to me today and told 
                        me to drop the case.

           They shoot up in bed.

                                 ALBERT
                        Oh my God.  I’m calling the department.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Are you okay?  What did he look like?

           Albert is dialing, but Izzy hangs up.

                                 IZZY
                        Already filed a report.  No good I.D., 
                        though. Just his watch: He was wearing a 
                        Panerai, a fake. The bezel wasn’t 
                        titanium. 
                                 (then)

                                      IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Here’s the deal.  I’m dropping the case 
                        and I’ll keep working here.  But if I 
                        still want to leave in a year, you let me 
                        go?  Good references?  Full support?

                                 OLIVIA
                        You’re our daughter.  You always have our 
                        full support.

           Izzy give her mother a hug.  Albert pats her back.  From 
           the hug, Izzy sees the REPORT her mother was reading:

           “RECONNAISSANCE:  ISABEL SPELLMAN AND DR. DANIEL 
           CASTILLO, ALCATRAZ ISLAND by RAE SPELLMAN, Private Eye”.

           Izzy grabs the report and recoils.

                                 IZZY
                        You had Little Rae spy on me?

                                 OLIVIA
                        We just... don’t want you to blow it, 
                        honey.  We like this Daniel.  

                                 IZZY
                        You’re impossible, both of you!  I’m 
                        going to finish the Holt case, and then 
                        I’m done.  You won’t have to worry about 
                        me ever again.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No, Izzy, someone attacked you!

                                 IZZY
                        Ever better.  When someone threatens to 
                        cut off your thumb, it usually means 
                        you’re close.  I’m going to crack this 
                        and then I’m out! 

           Izzy storms out.  A beat. 

           INT.  LITTLE RAE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rae is reading a comic book when Izzy bursts in.

                                 IZZY
                        What did they pay you?  30 pieces of 
                        candy?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        10 trips to Pinkberry, 3 toppings/per.
                                 IZZY
                        We’re finished.  As co-workers AND as 
                        sisters.

           With that, she storms out of the room.

           INT. IZZY’S STUDIO GARAGE APT. - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           A cowed Little Rae creaks open Izzy’s bedroom door.  

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Izzy-

                                 IZZY
                        No!  You sold me out for frozen yogurt.  
                        It would be funny if it wasn’t my life.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        But I want to help you with the case-

                                 IZZY
                        NO!  No matter what, you are not to do 
                        anything on the Holts.  It’s not safe, 
                        and I don’t trust you.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                                 (hopeful)
                        You can have the yogurt.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s yours.  You earned it.

           Izzy grabs Cyrus’ journal and climbs out the window onto 
           the garage roof.  She slams the window shut behind her.

           Izzy tucks her legs under for warmth, looking at the 
           water-damaged journal.  She examines FAINT TEETH MARKS on 
           the binding.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                                 (reading)
                        “There I was standing ten feet of granite 
                        between me and my dreams...”

           EXT.  1906, US MINT - DAWN

           Cyrus and Oswald stand at the foot of the steep granite 
           steps.  The huge metal doors are bolted.  The metal 
           security shutters are sealed over the windows.

                                 OSWALD
                        How were we going to get in before?
                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        I bribed the watchman at the building 
                        across the street for roof access.  We 
                        were going to slide down a cable to the 
                        top of the Mint.

           They turn around.  The building (like all the others) is 
           GONE. 

                                 CYRUS HOLT (CONT'D)
                        Go home.  It’s over.  I’ll need to get 
                        the money for Maggie some other way.

                                 OSWALD
                        But-

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        But what?  This place was built to 
                        withstand an army.  The only weak spot is 
                        a roof access hatch!

                                 OSWALD
                        Maybe-

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        What?  Maybe they’ll just open the front 
                        door and invite us in!?

           As if on cue, THE FRONT DOOR OF THE MINT SWINGS OPEN.

                                 GUARD
                        You there!  I need men!  We need to water 
                        down the roof before the fire gets here!

           Cyrus and Oswald stare at the guard.

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Get in here!  Now!!!

           Cyrus and Oswald share a look and a smile.

           EXT. OLD MINT, ROOF - 1906 - LATER

           From the roof, the city looks like something out of  
           Dante’s Inferno.  A red glow on the horizon, smoke, ash, 
           dust and distant screams fill the air.

           Cyrus and Oswald are hosing everything down as 12 other 
           ramshackle volunteers work the manual water pumps.  The 
           Lead Guard oversees it, holding a RIFLE.  The Holt boys 
           eye the access hatch.
                                 LEAD GUARD
                        Faster boys!  We need to wet the roof 
                        before the fire reaches us.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                                 (whispering)
                        All I wanted was to get on this roof and 
                        now we can’t get off it.

           Oswald looks over the edge.

                                 OSWALD
                        Is that what I think it is?

           Down below, we see guards loading pallets of Gold 
           Certificates onto a FEDERAL POLICE CAR (a Model-T).

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                                 (to Lead Guard)
                        What’s going on down there?

                                 LEAD GUARD
                        We’re moving the flammables to the harbor 
                        in case the fire jumps across Mission.

           Cyrus looks over the edge, six armed guards jog alongside 
           the POLICE CAR as it slowly drives away, maneuvering 
           around the rubble.  Cyrus looks around, frustrated.

                                 OSWALD
                        What do we do?

           Cyrus makes an executive decision.  He walks his hose 
           behind the Lead Guard and CLOCKS HIM in the back of the 
           head with it.  Oswald grabs the man’s rifle and turns 
           toward the other men, daring them to approach.

                                 OSWALD (CONT'D)
                        We’re never going to catch them.  

           Cyrus stands at the edge of the building.  

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        We will if we take the short cut.  

           With that, Cyrus BITES DOWN on the journal to hold it, 
           holding rifles in his hands.  He then JUMPS OFF THE THREE 
           STORY ROOF.
           EXT.  OLD MINT - CONTINUOUS

           CYRUS’ BODY SPLASHES DOWN IN WATER.  He surfaces.  We 
           REVEAL that he is wading in a STOLEN S.F. FIRE DEPARTMENT 
           HORSE DRAWN WATER TRUCK, courtesy of his brother Jasper. 

           He climbs out of the water as Oswald MAKES THE JUMP FROM 
           THE ROOF.  SCREAMING all the way down.  Cyrus takes the 
           reigns as everyone boards the wagon.

                                 JASPER
                        Where’s the haul?

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        One minute ahead of us.  Heading toward 
                        the bay.  HEYAA!!!

           Cyrus lashes the horses as the wagon lurches forward.  
           Oswald, still wading in the water, almost spills out.   

           It looks like all is well until a GIANT TELEGRAPH POLE 
           falls down directly in front of them, blocking the way.  

           An angry Cyrus watches as the money and his dreams 
           disappear toward the wharf.  He shoots both of the 
           shotguns off into the air in anger. 

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           A sketch of the phone pole blocking the wagon.  A glob of

           Izzy is passed out on the floor, drooling into the 
           journal.  All the photocopies are everywhere, along with 
           a dry erase board filled with letters and numbers.

           The ALARM goes off, and Izzy shoots up.  She’s late for:

           INT.  SHOOTING RANGE - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           KA-BLAM!  We are in one of those shooting ranges like the 
           FBI training center -- cardboard bad guys pop out of 
           windows.  Occasionally, an old lady or dog pops out to 
           keep you on your toes.

           Izzy wears protective glasses and wields a Baretta.

           A CUT-OUT BANK ROBBER pointing a gun pops out from behind

           A CUT-OUT MUGGER pops out from a faux-doorway.  IZZY 
           MISSES AGAIN.  David takes it down.

                        How did you get Mom’s sharpshooting skill 
                        while I got Dad’s love of pastry?

           They both reload.

                                 DAVID
                        Just lucky.  So you’re not talking to 
                        them?
                                 (no response)
                        They both seem to like Daniel.  

                                 IZZY
                        His one drawback. 
           INT.  SPELLMAN KITCHEN - DAY

           Little Rae is throwing a TANTRUM at Albert and Olivia.  
           Through the window, Grandpa Ray is spraying a solution on 
           a pair of slacks in the yard.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        It’s not fair!

                                 OLIVIA
                        This is not a debate.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        But I can help her.  Even if Izzy doesn’t 
                        want it.  I can follow everyone around.  
                        Take notes.  Wait for someone to slip up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No recreational surveillance!

                                 ALBERT
                        Honey, we’re sorry your sister is mad at 
                        you.  She’s mad at us, too.  But this is 
                        not a safe situation anymore.  We don’t 
                        even want your sister investigating.

           Suddenly, Rae gives up.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Fine.  Oh, I almost forgot -- I have a 
                        sleep over at Julie’s house.  Gotta run!

           Rae picks up her backpack and heads out.  Albert and 
           Olivia shake their head.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (disappointed)
                        You’d think she’d be better at lying by 
                        now. 

           RACK FOCUS out the window: Grandpa Ray’s latest formula 
           fails and his test pants GO UP IN BALL OF FLAME.

           EXT.  PRESIDIO PARK - LATER   

           Laura Holt is walking a dachshund.  About 30 feet behind, 
           Little Rae glides along on her roller sneakers.  She 
           speaks into her mini-tape recorder.

                        Dachshund, possible mastermind of dog 
                        fighting ring.  Investigating further.

           She continues watching as Laura sits down for lunch with 
           a man we don’t see.

           About 30 feet behind Rae, a certain Ford with tinted 
           windows follows the girl...

           INT.  FORD - CONTINUOUS

           Albert and Olivia are following their little girl.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you think she’s made us?

                                 ALBERT
                        Not a chance.

           Suddenly, THERE IS A GLINT OF LIGHT from behind a bush.  
           They get a better look to find a SKEEVY PHOTOGRAPHER 
           taking secret pictures of Little Rae.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you see that?

           Albert is already taking the safety off his .38 revolver.

           EXT.  PRESIDIO PARK - A MINUTE LATER

           The Photographer is snapping photos of a clueless Rae in 
           the distance.  A GUN ENTERS FRAME, POINTED TO HIS HEAD.  
           “CLICK”, it’s cocked.

                                 ALBERT
                        You have three seconds to tell me who 
                        hired you to trail my daughter, or your 
                        brains fertilize this bush.

           The guy drops his camera.  Terrified.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        She did.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Who?

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Her.  The little girl.  She gave me 20 
                        bucks to follow her and take her picture.    
                        She said I could stop when two lunatics 
                        came up to me.
           Olivia and Albert look up:  Sure enough, LITTLE RAE IS 
           GONE.  They’ve been scammed.

           Albert holsters his gun.  He tries to hide a tear that 
           rolls down his face. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Are you okay?

                                 ALBERT
                        I’m just so... proud of her.

           INT.  KRAV MAGA STUDIO - DAY

           Daniel stands on a mat, head to toe in heavy padding.  
           Izzy just wears gloves.

                                 DANIEL
                        This is your version of a fun date?

                                 IZZY
                        What’s more fun than kicking ass and 
                        taking names?

                                 DANIEL 
                        Could you put on some pads or something?  
                        I don’t want to hurt you.

                                 IZZY 
                        That’s cute.  Now come at me.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Really.  You don’t want to go bowling or 
                        something?

           Izzy pokes him in the face with a quick jab.  

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                                 (playfully)
                        Okay... now you’ve done it.

           Daniel gets into a fighting stance.  

                                 IZZY
                        You’ve been watching too many Rocky 
                        movies.  Let’s go.  Give me a beat down.

           Daniel runs at her, half-hearted.  Izzy pivots and hits 
           him four times in the padding before he can blink.  

           This just gives Daniel more fire in his eyes.  
                                 DANIEL
                        Oh, now you’re in it.  Oh yeah-

           She kicks a roundhouse to his padded head.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        Is that the best you got?

           She plants and hits him in the solar plexus with all her 
           strength.  He’s laid on his back.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m so sorry.  Stressful day.

           Izzy leans over to check on him, he pulls her down and 
           straddles her.  Still wincing.  

                                 DANIEL
                        I let you do that, you know.

                                 IZZY
                        I know. 

           She flips him over and now she’s straddling him.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Can I tell you something stupid?
                                 (he nods)
                        When we first went out, I think I was 
                        running away from something.  But the 
                        more time we spend together... I feel I’m 
                        running toward something.
                                 (embarrassed)
                        Okay, that’s the gayest thing ever said.  
                        Even in San Francisco.  I take it ba-

           He takes advantage of her awkwardness to flip her.  She 
           play-struggles; now they’re laying his front to her back.

                                 DANIEL
                        Let’s do something special.  Spontaneous.

                                 IZZY
                        I think I can get behind that.

           He presses into her.

                                 DANIEL
                        I think I can get behind your behind.

           She cranes her neck around and they kiss... when IZZY 
           EYES FLY OPEN.  
                                 IZZY
                        The key is behind the words!  It’s 
                        literal!  I could kiss you!

                                 DANIEL
                                 (unhappy)
                        You were kissing me.

           SHE EFFORTLESSLY FLIPS FREE AND LANDS ON HER FEET.

                                 IZZY
                        I’ll call you later.
                                 (she turns, then turns back)
                        And I think you are the most wonderful 
                        man I’ve ever met.

           And she’s gone.  Calling after her:

                                 DANIEL
                        Not the “spontaneous” I was going for.

           INT.  IZZY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

           Izzy bursts in and beelines for the Cyrus Holt journal.  
           She flips through the book, nothing.  She examines the 
           binding... Is that a bump?

           She grabs a letter opener and slices the binding off.

                                 IZZY
                        Sorry Cyrus.

           Sure enough, she pulls out a LONG BRASS KEY (the kind 
           used for safety deposit boxes).  Printed in the metal is 
           “BANCO CSL”.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The gate reads “CABO SAN LUCAS” and the flight is 
           boarding.  Distressed, Izzy peers down the terminal -- 
           then she sees him, Daniel running with a small suitcase.

           As they board the plane:

                                 IZZY
                        What took you so long?

                                 DANIEL
                        You called me 29 minutes ago!  Honestly, 
                        Mexico?  Out of the blue?
                                 IZZY
                        You wanted spontaneous.

           Albert paces around the room as Olivia works the phones.

                                 OLIVIA (TO PHONE)
                        Thank you, Julie, if you hear from Rae, 
                        have your parents call us immediately.

                        And tie her up until we get there!

           David walks in, taking in the chaos.  

                                 DAVID

                        Your baby sister’s picked a bad day to go 
                        rogue on us.

           David’s cell phone rings.  He sees caller I.D. and
           answers.  We see an ever-so-slight change in his demeanor 
           as he listens to the line.

                                 DAVID
                        Um-hmmm... okay... sure thing, Liz.  Call 
                        me if you need anything... Bye.

           He hangs up the phone as his parents stare him down.  
           David tries to avoid a confrontation.  

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        So Rae is missing.  What can I do?

                        Increased pupil size.  No eye contact.  
                        Do I need to dust off the lie detector, 
                        or are you going to fess up?

                        Add to the fact that it has the “Iz” in 
                        it, which is why it came to you.  I’d bet 
                        my first born son that was your sister

                        insane control-freak parents on her and 
                        use your investigative powers for evil.

           They don’t answer, clearly not agreeing to the terms.  
           David sighs -- what choice does he have?

                                 DAVID
                        Daniel’s with her.  She figures she can 
                        make a date of it.

                                 ALBERT
                        DAD, GET DOWN HERE-!

           Big Ray comes downstairs WEARING HEADPHONES.

                                 BIG RAY
                        I heard everything.

                                 ALBERT
                        You and David need to go to Mexico to 
                        look after Izzy.  Olivia and I will stay 
                        here and find Rae.  

                                 BIG RAY
                        I put out an APB on her.  Called in some 
                        favors.  She’s slippery, like an eel, 
                        that one.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (to David and Big Ray)
                        Go.  Go!!!  What are you waiting for?  
                                 (to Albert; furious and 
                                  scared)
                        When she comes home, we can’t leave any 
                        marks on her.  Don’t need to give her any 
                        ammunition to put child services on us.
           Albert gives his wife a comforting hug.

           EXT.  CABO SAN LUCAS, MEXICO - THE NEXT MORNING

           Sun.  Surf.  Sand.  Hotels line the beaches, cruise ships 
           tower off shore, it’s a magical escape.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you’re 
                        thinking, I’m nuts for bringing my boy.  
                        But come on!  It’s Mexico!  I just need 
                        to fold him into the mission.  And the 
                        secret to telling a believable lie?  Make 
                        it 98% true.

           INT.  LA CUCARACHA BEACH HOTEL, CABO - CONTINUOUS  

           Daniel is sitting on the bed in swim trunks, head to toe 
           in sunblock, staring at the closed bathroom door.

                                 DANIEL
                        Come on, Iz.  Get your bathing suit on!

           She peeps her head out of the door.

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        I have something better.

                                 DANIEL
                        Birthday suit?

           Izzy opens the door, she’s fully dressed.  Daniel frowns.  
           She holds up Cyrus’ BRASS KEY.

                                 IZZY
                        We’re going on a treasure hunt.

           INT.  CAB, CABO SAN LUCAS - DAY  

           David and Big Ray ride in a taxi toward town.

                                 DAVID
                        How’d you know which hotel?

                                 BIG RAY
                        I ran the dentist’s credit.

           David nods, looking out the window.  He’s in a thought.
                                 DAVID
                        When Dad was younger, did you put him 
                        through this?

                                 BIG RAY
                        Does a psychologist use his profession to 
                        be a better parent?  How is that any 
                        different?  

                                 DAVID
                        Fewer felonies.

                                 BIG RAY
                        A family not worth committing a felony or 
                        two for is a family not worth having.

           EXT.  LA CUCARACHA BEACH HOTEL, CABO - CONTINUOUS  

           Big Ray and David pull up to the hotel.

           As they get out of the cab, Izzy and Daniel EXIT the 
           hotel.  Ray and David both quickly and expertly hide 
           their identities, as...

                                 DANIEL
                        Let me get this straight.  Your mother’s 
                        great uncle left her this key which she 
                        thinks is for a safety deposit box key in 
                        Cabo.  From, like, 70 years ago.

                                 IZZY
                        Treasure hunt!

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s why we’re here?

           She melts into Daniel and kisses him, sensuously.

                                 IZZY
                        That’s why we’re here.  But I promised my 
                        mom I’d look into it.

                                 DANIEL
                        How many banks?

           She pulls out a sheet of paper.

                                 IZZY
                                 (proud)
                        My research.  There’s only two old enough 
                        and one doesn’t have deposit boxes.
                                 DANIEL
                        Who’s my little urban archeologist?!

                                 IZZY
                        Wait ‘till you see me do a root canal.

           She playfully hipchecks him as they walk down the street. 

                                 DAVID
                        What’s the plan?

                                 BIG RAY
                        We stick to her like glue.  Distant, 
                        silent glue.

           Daniel and Ray quickly tip the bellman to watch their 
           bags and follow after the love-birds.  

           EXT.  “DAY OF THE DEAD” STREET CELEBRATION - DAY  

           Izzy and Daniel walk through the festive street party.  
           Celebrating lost relatives and friends, it’s a giant 
           memorial party.  Kids and adults alike wear SKULL MASKS.

                                 IZZY
                        What is this?

                                 DANIEL
                        El Día de los Muertos, The Day of The 
                        Dead.  Mardi Gras meets Memorial Day.

           Izzy heads to one of the many vendors and plops a giant 
           sombrero on Daniel’s noggin.

                                 IZZY
                        How much for the sombrero?

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh, no.  I’m getting it for you.

           Just to her left, the hand of a man standing nearby with 
           the FAKE PANERAI WATCH.  He wears a SKULL MASK and seems 
           to be watching her.

                                 IZZY
                                 (under her breath)
                        Fuuuudge.

                                 DANIEL
                        What’s wrong?
                                 IZZY 
                                 (covering)
                        Fine -- I’ll wear the sombrero.  But I 
                        get 10 minutes to buy something for you.  
                        And you have to wear it.

           Daniel plops the oversize hat on her with a grin.

                                 DANIEL
                        Deal.

           EXT.  MARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy leaves Daniel in the stand and pretends to peruse 
           the market, peripheral vision trained on the gleam of the 
           fake watch.  She’s so focused, she doesn’t notice David 
           and Ray following her as well.

           David notices the Skull Mask guy tracking Izzy.

                                 DAVID
                        Is that guy-

                                 BIG RAY
                        Following your sister?  She’s made him, 
                        though, see how she’s moving laterally?  
                        Get ready to move in.

           Izzy disappears into a Spice Tent then slips out the back 
           moments later.  Her tail and tail’s tail in hot pursuit.

           Izzy goes into a T-Shirt stall and buys a t-shirt.  As 
           she pays, IZZY STEALTHILY REMOVES A PAPER BAG from her 
           backpack.

           She hides the bag underneath the pile of shirts, then 
           moves on.  As IZZY leaves, she WHISPERS something to a 
           POLICEMAN.  His eyes light with ALARM.

           SKULL MASK moves toward the stall to intercept whatever 
           she’s hidden... BUT DAVID AND RAY GET THERE FIRST.

           PANERAI GUY CURSES and fades into the crowd, as David 
           removes the bag, opening it.

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 DAVID
                        Smells like oregano, looks like mari--

           SUDDENLY, they are SURROUNDED BY POLICE.  GUNS DRAWN.
                                 MEXICAN POLICE
                        ¡Parada! ¡Ponga sus manos para arriba!

           They raise their hands.  The lead policeman looks at them 
           with disgust.

                                 MEXICAN POLICEMAN
                        You think you can use our market to 
                        peddle your drugs?  Not so smart, gringo.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m with you there.

           Izzy looks back at the commotion and smiles, not seeing 
           WHO was being arrested.  Relaxing, she doesn’t notice the 
           Panerai Man still following her.

                                 IZZY
                                 (smug)
                        Sometimes the mouse catches the cat.

           For the 1st time, she looks at the shirt she bought.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Daniel now wears a very long tourist t-shirt with LARGE 
           WOMAN’S BREASTS drawn on, with outlined bikini panties 
           where it hangs past his waist.

                                 DANIEL
                                 (very unhappy)
                        This is not equal to the sombrero.

                                 IZZY
                        Deal’s a deal.  
                                 (jumping on him piggy back)
                        To the bank, Señor Juggs!

           She doesn’t see FAKE PANERAI keeping further back now.

           INT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - AFTERNOON

           Olivia and Albert are both getting off the phone.

                                                        ALBERT
                           OLIVIA
           Thank you Detective Stone, 
           I appreciate you sending 
           out the bloodhounds-
                                             No luck so far, Mrs. 
                                             Patrozzi.  Thank you for 
                                             looking.

           They hang up, exhaustion on both their faces. 

           Little Rae strolls in, nonchalant.  She starts foraging 
           through the freezer for food.
                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Hey guys?  We have any fish sticks?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  LITTLE RAE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rae is inside as the door is closed and we hear locks 
           being turned.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I just went to a movie!  You can’t lock 
                        me in here!  What if there’s a fire?

           A minute later we hear the locks open.  Olivia cracks the 
           door and tosses in a bottle of BBQ sauce.

                                 OLIVIA
                        If there’s a fire, make sure to season 
                        yourself properly.  We like our truants 
                        medium-well.

           They re-lock the door.

           EXT.  ALLEY, CABO - AFTERNOON

           POV:  From the shadows, someone is watching Izzy and 
           Daniel look for an address.

                                 MAN’S GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
                        Change of plans.  I actually think she’s 
                        getting close.  I’ll put the bullet in 
                        her head after she finds the money. 

           The Panerai watch appears, hanging up the cell phone.

           Across the street is a storefront:

           BANCO DEL CABO

           EST. 1903

           Izzy dismounts from Daniel’s piggyback.

                                 IZZY
                        Honey, when I get the box, would you mind 
                        terribly if I opened it alone?  
                                 (kissing his ear)
                        Who knows what family skeletons are in 
                        there?
                                 DANIEL
                                 (sighing)
                        Women and their secrets.

           She kisses him sweetly as he holds the door for her.  

           INT.  BANCO DEL CABO - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy and Daniel approach the TELLER.

                                 IZZY
                        If you speak English, I will bear your 
                        children.

                                 TELLER
                        I speak English.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m barren.

                                 TELLER
                        How can I help you?

           She puts the key on the counter.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m here to open my safety deposit box.

                                 TELLER
                        With... that?

                                 IZZY
                        Is there a problem?

                                 TELLER
                        That’s not our key.  We use fingerprint 
                        scanners now, and before that it was a 
                        double-titanium keyed Vormundschaf system 
                        from Zurich.

                                 IZZY
                        So this doesn’t unlock anything?

                                 TELLER
                        A dollhouse?

           Izzy walks back to Daniel in shock.

                                 DANIEL
                        Izzy, this isn’t the Banco del Cabo.

                                 IZZY
                        What are you talking about?  The sign-
                                 DANIEL
                        No, what I mean is, this isn’t the 
                        original bank.  Look at the floorboards?  
                        You see how they change color right 
                        there?  That’s aged walnut, it changes to  
                        an engineered wood here.  That’s a modern 
                        composite.  And look at the base of the 
                        wall.  You can see where it shifts from 
                        the original foundation.  

                                 IZZY
                        So where’s the real Bank?

                                 DANIEL
                        I’d say about 15 feet below us.

           Daniel takes the brass key from Izzy and goes up to an 
           ELDERLY SECURITY GUARD sitting in a chair.  He looks like 
           he hasn’t moved in 30 years -- one can almost imagine a 
           fine layer of dust on his gun.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                                 (subtitled from Spanish)
                        Excuse me, have you seen one of these 
                        before?

           The Guard studies the key.

                                 IZZY
                        You speak Spanish?

                                 DANIEL
                                 (dry)
                        My last name is Castillo.

           The guard answers in Spanish and Daniel translates:

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        He says he hasn’t seen one of these since 
                        the flood in ‘62.  The waterline must 
                        have risen over the last century.

           The guard continues in Spanish.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        They were building a new sewer line and 
                        it flooded the old deposit box room... 
                        they built the new bank on top of it.

                                 IZZY
                        Ask if we can see the old room.

           He does, and the Guard laughs.  He explains...
                                 DANIEL
                        The floor is four feet of concrete and 
                        galvanized steel.  Impossible.
                                 (Izzy’s face falls)
                        I’m sorry Iz.  We gave it a shot.

                                 IZZY
                                 (staring down)
                        People are walking right on top of their 
                        own history without realizing it.

           They head out.

                                 IZZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And I have a midnight date with a sewer 
                        line into the thick of it.

           INT.  JAIL, CABO SAN LUCAS - NIGHT

           David and Big Ray sit at opposite ends of a jail cell, 
           clearly not talking.  A chubby MEXICAN CRIMINAL is also 
           in the cell, with his two small children.  A GOAT wanders 
           around the room.  This is not your typical jail cell.

           David tries to attract the attention of the guards.  

                                 DAVID
                        Por Favor.  I’m a lawyer!  Americano!!! 
                        Where’s my phone call!?
                                 (to Big Ray)
                        I’m going to kill her.  

           Big Ray is more relaxed.  Like he’s been in this 
           situation a million times before.  He makes faces at one 
           of the kids.  

                                 BIG RAY 
                                 (to the kids)
                        Knock knock.

           They just stare at him.  He tries again.   

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        Knock knock. 
                                 (still nothing)
                        What did the Mexican fire-firefighter 
                        name his two kids?
                                 (blank faces)
                        Hose A and hose B.  

           The kids stare: no comprende. David shakes his head. 
                                 DAVID
                        Izzy’s in trouble and I’m supposed to be 
                        in court in 48 hours.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Izzy can take care of herself and... 
                        you’ll be in court sooner than that.

           INT.  HOTEL ROOM, CABO - NIGHT

           Izzy comes out of the bathroom after a shower, Daniel is 
           in bed reading on his laptop.

                                 IZZY
                        Whatcha reading?

                                 DANIEL
                        Emails.

           She climbs in next to him and he puts his laptop on the 
           night stand facing away.  Izzy draws on him with her 
           finger, something is bothering her.

                                 IZZY
                        Daniel, do you think you can love a 
                        person without really knowing who they 
                        are?

                                 DANIEL
                        I think you can love someone 
                        instinctively and then fill in the 
                        details later.

                                 IZZY
                        What if you don’t love the details later?

                                 DANIEL
                        Well, I think family is the only love 
                        that’s unconditional.  Even yours.  But 
                        if you can’t trust someone enough to 
                        share who you really are, then it was 
                        never love from the start.

           Izzy is silent.  A moment of truth, literally.  Finally 
           she breaks it.

                                 IZZY
                        Tomorrow, we’re going to cover each other 
                        with coconut tanning oil.  And I don’t 
                        plan on leaving the room.
           CAMERA SWINGS AROUND TO SEE HIS LAPTOP SCREEN.  He was 
           reading a PROFESSIONAL LOOKING DOCUMENT LABELED “DOSSIER -
           - ISABEL SPELLMAN”.

           Multiple hidden-camera photos of Izzy and a complete bio, 
           professional and personal.  There is more to Daniel, as 
           well.

           He pushes the laptop closed, and the room is dark.

           INT.  LITTLE RAE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Little Rae is splayed out on her bed, locked in her room.  
           She reads “Crime and Punishment” surrounded by her Teddy 
           Bears.

           One bear looks a little off... One of the EYES has been 
           swapped out for a tiny security camera.

           INT. BIG RAY’S SURVEILLANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Albert and Olivia observe Rae reading ON THE MONITOR.

                                 ALBERT
                        Liv... Are we good parents?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t be absurd.

                                 ALBERT
                        Isn’t part of being a parent letting your 
                        kids fall and pick themselves up?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maybe we go a touch over the line.

           On the monitor:  Little Rae finds a wire sticking out of 
           the bear’s butt which disappears into the wall.  

           She holds the bear up in front of her again.

                                 LITTLE RAE (ON MONITOR)
                        What have you done to Teddy Ruxpin!?!  
                        Have you no decency?  

           With that, she YANKS the wire out of the bear’s butt and 
           the screen goes BLACK.
           EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, CABO - MIDNIGHT

           Izzy is laying in bed next to Daniel, who’s snoring 
           lightly.

                                 IZZY
                        Daniel?  Are you awake?  Daniel?
                                 (nothing)
                        I’ll do that thing you were begging for 
                        earlier.
                                 (nothing)
                        You’re asleep.

           Izzy gets up and silently dresses.  She’s going to WORK.    
           Boots, jeans, jacket, flashlight, map of cabo... and with 
           a shudder, she picks up Daniel’s snorkeling mask.

           She slips out the bathroom window, leaving it propped 
           open.

           EXT.  DESERTED CABO STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We are half a block from the bank.  All the “Day of the 
           Dead” decorations are still up, and they cast very creepy 
           shadows in the moonlight.  Izzy hurries along scouring 
           the ground... then, she sees it --

           A SEWER GRATE.

           Izzy looks around her and finds a metal bar.  THREE HITS 
           AND THE LOCK IS BROKEN.  Flashlight on, she crawls in.

                                 IZZY
                        Oh my God.  The smell.

           INT.  SEWER - CONTINUOUS

           The sewer isn’t in good shape.  A half century of roots 
           puncture the concrete, leaving it a crumbling mess.  Izzy 
           is standing waist deep in some inconceivably horrible 
           liquid/solid.  She puts on the snorkeling mask to block 
           the smell; her pinched nose makes her nasal.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s mud.  It’s mud.  It’d just mud.
                                 (new mantra)
                        Free of my family.  Free of my family.

           She continues to trudge in the direction of the bank 
           until she reaches a spot where the support system is made 
           of metal instead of concrete.  
           Izzy looks up, surveying the spot where the state-of-the-
           art bank was constructed ON TOP of the sewer.

           She takes the metal bar and starts tapping the crumbling 
           wall beneath the metal structure.  After a minute, a 
           hollow THUNK.  THUNK, THUNK.

           Izzy starts whacking at the wall with the bar at its 
           weakest point.  

           Slowly it cracks and clumps of stone fall into the muck.  
           She drops the metal bar and begins pulling at the debris.

           ... SHINING HER FLASHLIGHT IN THE HOLE, SHE SEES THE 
           ANCIENT FLOODED DEPOSIT BOX ROOM.  She widens the hole.

           INT.  FLOODED DEPOSIT BOX ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy climbs through.  It’s incredible.  Overturned, 
           broken furniture, signs in Spanish on the walls... a 
           broken staircase leading nowhere.

           And on the far wall, the boxes.  Half are above the muck 
           line.

           Izzy begins trying keys.

           EXT.  SEWER GRATE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, a hand with a Fake Panerai Watch opens the 
           grate.

           INT.  FLOODED DEPOSIT BOX ROOM - LATER

           Izzy is on the last row of boxes over the “water”-line.  
           Finally she gets to #17, the third to last.

           CLICK.

           She smiles.

                                   IZZY
                         Come to momma...

           She opens it -- it’s a lock-box.  About a foot long.  She 
           shakes it: it’s full of something.  But she can’t get it 
           open.

           Izzy takes THE LOCK-BOX and hurries out.
           INT.  SEWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy climbs out of the hole, legs first, back into the 
           sewer.  She’s clutching a LOCK BOX under her arm.

           When her head pops out, she finds a PANERAI WRIST holding 
           a blade to her throat.

                                 PANERAI MAN
                        Hand it over.

           Izzy slowly turns to face her skull-masked nemesis.

           Izzy moves to give it to him... but then KRAV MAGA 
           roundhouse kicks the SWITCHBLADE OUT OF HIS HAND.  She 
           falls into a strike pose.  

                                 IZZY
                        That’s called six years of Krav Maga
                        training, asswipe.
                                 (then)
                        And your watch is a fake.

           He pulls out a handgun and aim it at her head.

                                 PANERAI MAN
                        That’s called a Glock 19.  And it’s very 
                        real.

           He motions for the box.  She slowly holds it out with one 
           hand.  As he reaches out, she quickly pulls a pen from 
           her pocket.  The same pen she threatened Rae’s bully 
           with.  

           Her assailant looks at her holding the pen and laughs.

                                 PANERAI MAN (CONT'D)
                        A pen?  Are you going to write on me?

           She double-clicks it.  A CLOUD OF INCAPACITATING 
           NEUROTOXIN shoots out at his face.

           He doubles over in pain, dropping everything.  Baaaad 
           things are happening in his stomach.  Izzy lunges for the 
           box as he staggers off into the sewer.

           She considers chasing him, but looks back at the box.  
           It’s more important.  Plus, he still carries his gun.  
           Izzy lets him go.
           INT.  BATHROOM, LA CUCARACHA HOTEL - LATER

           Izzy quietly opens the bathroom window and climbs inside 
           the dark room.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        Twenty minutes to shower and detox, take 
                        a look in the box, and then climb into 
                        bed with-

           She turns the light on -- Daniel is there watching her.  
           His demeanor is COLD.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        -Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        Welcome back.

                                 IZZY
                        Thanks.  I, uh, used the window, because-

                                 DANIEL
                        -what?  What lie are you about to tell?  
                        Got a good one for why you’re covered in 
                        shit? I’d love to hear it.

           His laptop sits on the vanity, open to her file.  Izzy 
           sees it, she snatches the computer.

                                 IZZY
                        Where did you get this?!  Who are you 
                        working for?

                                 DANIEL
                        Your little sister sold it to me for a 
                        duffel bag of Hostess products.  She 
                        thought knowing the truth might make me 
                        like you more.

                                 IZZY
                                 (scrambling)
                        I can explain-

                                 DANIEL
                                 (angry)
                        No more explanations!  I open my heart to 
                        you and what do I get back?  A character 
                        designed to make me trust you.  Bravo.  
                        Take a bow!  You should be very proud.   

                                 IZZY
                                 (barely audible)
                        How long have you known?
                                 DANIEL
                        A few days.  I kept hoping you’d come 
                        clean with me-

                                 IZZY
                        I wanted to!  Daniel, I was afraid.  I 
                        got in too deep.

                                 DANIEL
                        Izzy, you are an amazing, bright, 
                        talented, beautiful girl.  

                                 IZZY
                        And you forgive me?

                                 DANIEL
                        And I never want to see you again.

           Her legs buckle and she sits on the toilet.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        There’s a taxi outside waiting to take me 
                        to the airport.  I’m going home.  I don’t 
                        want to be chased.  I just want to go 
                        back to my “normal” life before I met 
                        you.  Can you let me do that?  Please?

           The hardest word she’s ever had to say:

                                 IZZY
                        Yes.

                                 DANIEL
                        The sad thing is, Rae was right.  The 
                        truth would have made me like you more.  
                        If it only came from you.  

           We stay on Izzy as we hear Daniel get his suitcase from 
           the other room and close the door.  A minute later, the 
           sound of a CAR pulling away.

           For the first time, Izzy’s poker face doesn’t hold up.

           INT.  BATHROOM - DAWN

           Six hours later and the sun is streaming through the 
           windows.  Izzy is soaking in the tub, fully clothed, the 
           water brackish.

           She has been sitting in there for hours, in shock, just 
           staring at the lock box.
           Finally, with pruned fingers, she pulls out a hair pin 
           and carefully picks the lock.

           We hear a CLICK.  As she opens it, we...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT.  1906 SAN FRANCISCO, FISHERMAN’S WHARF - DAY

           Establishing.  Guards load Gold Certificates onto an ARMY 
           BOAT.  Seeing the devastation around them, they work 
           double-time.

           EXT.  BAY - CONTINUOUS

           Cyrus, Jasper, and Oswald break the surface of the water 
           from below.  We see the far side of the ARMY BOAT, a 
           short swim away.

                                 JASPER
                        This is insane.

           EXT.  ARMY BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           The three men scale the side of the boat.  They reach the 
           railing -- a lone Guard is aboard, loading certificates.

           Cyrus silently hand-signals, as his brother slides over 
           the rail, boarding.

           INT.  FURNACE ROOM, ARMY BOAT

           One SOLDIER is shoveling coal into the furnace.  His back 
           is to Cyrus, who picks up a shovel and knocks him out.

           EXT.  DECK, ARMY BOAT

           Cyrus and Oswald wait until the last of the certificates 
           are loaded, then RUSH the remaining GUARD on board.  He 
           looks up in shock, just as the Holts knock him over the 
           railing into the bay.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        Oswald, hit the engine!

           Cyrus grabs a MACHINE GUN TURRET, as the GUARDS on the 
           dock realize something is wrong.  He SPRAYS THE DOCK WITH 
           BULLETS, forcing them to dive for cover.
                                 CYRUS HOLT (CONT'D)
                        Oswald!!!

           Oswald mashes the controls and starts the propeller.  The 
           boat slowly pulls away from the dock...

           ... but it’s still TIED TO THE MOORING.  The Guards begin 
           to return fire.  

           Cyrus turns the machine gun to the ROPE, shredding it, 
           BULLETS ARE WHIZZING AND RICOCHETTING EVERYWHERE.

           Jasper emerges from the FURNACE ROOM.

                                 JASPER
                        We’re all clear below!  Cy-

           Cyrus turns.  A GUNSHOT rings as he is clipped in the 
           shoulder.  He falls to the deck as the boat quickly 
           breaks away from the docks.

           Cyrus falls behind the Gold Certificates for cover, as 
           the boat escapes into the bay.  

           The HUGE PILE OF MONEY is theirs.  

                                 OSWALD
                        That wasn’t so hard, actually.

                                 CYRUS
                        You didn’t get shot. 

           CYRUS cringes in pain as he pulls out his JOURNAL.

                                 JASPER 
                        You’re going to have a hell of a book 
                        there.

           Cyrus RIPS the last four pages out.  Then gets his pen.

                                 CYRUS
                        If I don’t make it, you get this to 
                        Maggie.  You hear me?  She has to know 
                        everything I did for us.

                                 JASPER
                        Shut your Irish pie hole, and try not to 
                        bleed on the pages.  Melodrama.

           They all share a smile as Cyrus starts to write.
           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - BACK TO PRESENT

           Izzy has been reading.  The ripped up journal is next to 
           her the four pages fit in perfectly.

                                 IZZY
                                 (reading)
                        “assault on the boat... robbery... 
                        gunfire...”  Here we go!  Last page, of 
                        course...

           She reads the final page:

                                 IZZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        “My darling Mags, I have something to 
                        give to you.  But I regret that I may not 
                        get the opportunity.  As I float away, 
                        bleeding...blah blah blah... love... blah 
                        blah forever...?”  That’s it?

           Izzy rummages through the lock box --  dried flowers, a 
           school ring, and other sentimental knick-knacks, 
           searching for any clue as to the where the treasure may 
           be hidden.  Nothing. 

                                 IZZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It is at this point I realize I am 
                        holding a love letter that tells me 
                        nothing where the stolen gold 
                        certificates are, if they even still 
                        exist, who the bad guy is, what he wants, 
                        why I’m going to die single and alone, 
                        plus I have dried poo in my hair.  Things 
                        could not possibly get worse.

           The phone rings.  She perks up momentarily.  Could it be 
           Daniel?

           EXT. JAIL, CABO SAN LUCAS - DAY

           Izzy, David, and Big Ray walk out of the jailhouse.

                                 IZZY
                        The silver lining to a horrible day.  My 
                        perfect big brother in a Mexican jail for 
                        drug smuggling?

                                 DAVID 
                        You’re just lucky it was oregano.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re just lucky it was oregano.
                                 BIG RAY
                        The minute we get back, we’re calling 
                        Laura Holt and dropping this case.

           As they load their bags into a taxi:

                                 IZZY
                        There is no case.  And I quit.  
                        Bankruptcy is better than this.

           INT.  KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Albert is drinking coffee and reading the paper when he 
           hears a SCREAM from upstairs.

           On the Monitor: Rae’s room is empty.

           He hurries out of the room as we see a SHAPE fall past 
           the kitchen window and land with a THUD.

           INT.  LITTLE RAE’S BEDROOM

           Olivia is already at the door, unlocking it.  They rush 
           into the empty room.  A sheet tied to the bed, extending 
           out of the window.  A make-shift escape rope.  They rush 
           over to the window, looking down.

           POV:  On the ground, a lot of laundry.

           Little Rae emerges from hiding behind the door and slips 
           out, pad-locking it behind her.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Open this door right now!

                                 LITTLE RAE (O.S.)
                        There’s barbecue sauce next to the bed if 
                        you’re hungry!

           Little Rae happily straps on her backpack and opens the 
           FRONT DOOR... 

           A SHADOW falls over her -- someone is standing there.  
           Upstairs, the Spellmans hear their daughter SCREAM.

                                 ALBERT
                        Rae?  Rae!?  Open the door!  Rae!!!

           EXT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - AFTERNOON

           A cab pulls up and the three of them get out.
                                 IZZY
                        Tell ‘em they’ll have their garage back 
                        as soon as I can pack.

           THERE ARE THREE POLICE CARS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

           INT.  SPELLMAN INVESTIGATIONS - CONTINUOUS

           Albert and Olivia look horrible, wracked with anguish.  
           Several officers take up space as DETECTIVE STONE (43) 
           writes in a notepad.

           Big Ray, Izzy, and David burst in...

                                 IZZY
                        What happened?

           They see Little Rae’s BACKPACK on the table.  One of the 
           STRAPS IS RIPPED OPEN.  Horror washes over their faces.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                                 (calling to the empty house)
                        Rae?  RAE!?!  

           INT. POLICE STATION - A SHORT TIME LATER

           Izzy sits in the “interrogation” chair.  Detective Stone 
           sits across from her.  Under the short-cropped hair, he 
           wears a mask of cold professionalism.

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        When was the last time you saw your 
                        sister?

                                 IZZY
                        Just before we left on our trip.  

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        Can you describe her mood for me?

                                 IZZY
                        Do you have any leads?

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        We don’t even know if she’s been taken.  
                        Please answer my question, Isabel.

                                 IZZY
                        What question? 
                                 DETECTIVE STONE 
                        Do you think it was wise for your parents 
                        to allow an admitted gambling addicted 
                        alcoholic into the home of an 
                        impressionable adolescent girl.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m not a full-fledged alcoholic.

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        I was talking about your grandfather.

                                 IZZY
                        He’s been in Mexico!  

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        Yes, you said.  In jail on drug charges.  
                        Do you know any of his associates?  

                                 IZZY
                        He’s retired FBI-

                                 DETECTIVE STONE
                        -Fired for illegal wire tapping.

                                 IZZY
                        Damn it, the clock is running.  Why are 
                        you wasting time on us?

           He drops a heavy file in the desk, labelled “Spellman”.

                                 DETECTIVE STONE 
                        I know from your mother how much your 
                        sister idolizes you.  I also know you 
                        used to knock over trash cans with your 
                        car on garbage night.  I know about the 
                        14 misdemeanors in your file, and the 22 
                        more sealed in your juvie records, I know 
                        about the drinking, I know that you can’t 
                        keep a boyfriend, and I know about the 
                        Neighborhood Watch meetings in your 
                        honor.  Shall I go on?

           Izzy stares him down defiantly.  Thinking of only one 
           thing.  Rae.  

           INT. DARK MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The CAMERA FINDS Little Rae, tied to a chair.  We see her 
           little hands trying to work the knot in the rope.  No 
           luck.  
           The DOOR SLAMS.  A figure approaches.  In the dim room, a 
           FAKE PANERAI WATCH reflects the hanging light-bulb.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Who’s there?   

           The man flips on the fluorescents.  It’s KARL MÜELLER,  
           the curator of the Currency Museum.  They’re in a 
           basement surrounded by huge machines.  But the room has 
           been transformed into a CYRUS HOLT HISTORY ground zero.  
           It’s the room we saw earlier:

           Corkboards with flow charts tracing Holt genealogy, maps 
           with yarn tracing the post-robbery locations of Cyrus and 
           his family.  The Gaelic translation, photos of Alcatraz, 
           Cabo San Lucas, the Spellmans, etc.  

                                 KARL
                        It’s a pleasure to meet you Ms. Spellman.
                                 (motioning around the room)
                        I’ve spent the last year tracking every 
                        step of Cyrus Holt -- Six months stuck on 
                        that stupid line of Gaelic on Alcatraz.  
                        And your sister cracks it in a week.  

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        She’s gonna rip out your gizzards.
                                 (suddenly, a look of 
                                  recognition)
                        Wait a minute, I know you... I saw you 
                        having lunch with--

           She hears the clacking of high heels on concrete.  

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                        --Laura Holt?  

           LAURA HOLT strolls into the room, clapping her hands 
           scornfully.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Very good.  It appears the apple doesn’t 
                        fall from the tree.  You’re a regular 
                        Nancy Drew.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Nancy Drew was a wuss.  I’m Oprah.

           Laura sits down next to her.  Almost conspiratorial.  

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        You know, at first, I thought my idiot 
                        brother was going to ruin everything by 
                        hiring your family.
                                 KARL
                        If you let me take care of him-

                                 LAURA HOLT
                                 (flashing anger at him)
                        Dammit Karl, he’s still my brother.  You
                        bludgeon when circumstances call for 
                        finesse.
                                 (to Rae)
                        Karl tried so hard to stop your sister 
                        when it was so much wiser to let her find 
                        the money for us.  Voilà.

           Laura stands and gently pats Karl on the back.  

                                 LAURA HOLT (CONT'D)
                        Of course, we didn’t even know about the 
                        journal until last month so your sister 
                        had a little advantage.  

           Karl looks at his watch, anxious.

                                 KARL
                        They’ve had the lock box for over a day.  
                        They must have found the certificates by 
                        now.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Then you won’t be needing me, which is 
                        just as well, as I have the mother of all 
                        book reports due.  Tom Sawyer-

           Laura SLAPS Rae’s face.  Not hard, but she’s stunned.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Shhhhhhhh.  I have something else for you 
                        to write.

           Wearing gloves, Laura slides a pen and paper in front of 
           Little Rae, who sees a MENACING GUN in her purse.  

           INT. SPELLMAN KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           The police have left.  

           The Spellmans sit around the breakfast table.  Little 
           Rae’s seat conspicuously empty.  The mood in the room is 
           heated and frustrated.  

           Izzy is going through Little Rae’s diary, taking notes.   
                                 DAVID
                        Did anyone think of padlocking Little 
                        Rae’s window?  

                                 OLIVIA
                        She figured out how to use bolt cutters 
                        in 2nd grade.

                                 IZZY
                        Rae has to be the only 10-year-old who 
                        encrypts her diary with a CIA-level 
                        algorithm.

                                 DAVID
                        How could you fall for the “fake escape”? 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Izzy’s the one who taught her to use 
                        windows more than doors!

                                 IZZY
                                 (re: her notes)
                        Back off!  I’m the only one who’s making 
                        a constructive effort to find her.

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        What the hell is wrong with you people?    

           The family looks up to find Daniel standing at the door.

                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                        You know, I’ve never seen a family care 
                        so much about each other and express it 
                        in such an unhealthy way.  

           Daniel pushes open the kitchen door a little more to 
           REVEAL an ENVELOPE taped to the outside of the door with 
           the handwritten name “Spellman” on it.

           Every member of the family immediately stands.

                                 ALBERT
                                 (re: the envelope)
                        How long has that been there?

                                 IZZY
                        That’s her handwriting!  

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Albert studies the note under a black light filter.
                                 IZZY
                                 (to Daniel)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DANIEL
                        I was interrogated in my office this 
                        morning by two detectives.  Happy to give 
                        you an alibi.

           Izzy brushes her hand against Daniels.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry about a lot of 
                        things.  

           He pulls his hand away.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m only here for Rae. 

           Albert pulls the sign out from under the black light.

                                 ALBERT
                        It’s clean.  No prints but Rae’s.  

           Olivia holds it up next to Rae’s diary.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s her handwriting.  I don’t see any 
                        anomalies in the style.

                                 IZZY
                                 (explains to Daniel)
                        By altering her handwriting, she could 
                        have sent a secret message.

                                 BIG RAY 
                        She must have been too panicked.  Poor 
                        kid.  

           Everyone leans over to read the note: 

           Midnight, center of the Golden Gate Bridge.
           If you call the police, they’ll kill me.
           No FBI (Grandpa, that means you).
           They’ll trade me for the gold certificates.

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        What gold certificates?  No one has them!

                                 DAVID
                        That’s in 14 hours.
                                 IZZY
                        They must think we have them.  From Cabo.

                                 ALBERT
                        Izzy, what was in the box.  There had to 
                        be some clue where Cyrus hid the money.

                                 IZZY
                        It was nothing.  Crap.  Love notes.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maybe you missed something.

                                 IZZY
                        Mom, you taught me better than that.

                                 DANIEL
                        I have that police detective’s card here, 
                        somewhere.

                                 EVERYONE
                        No.

                                 IZZY
                        By the time the police get their heads 
                        extricated from their asses, this is 
                        going to be over.

           Everyone is thinking.  Suddenly, Olivia lights up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Who’s in the mood for counterfeiting?

           MUSIC UP as the family comes together.  Everyone scatters 
           leaving Daniel standing there.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        In addition to passports, visas and 
                        Starbucks’ 10th-latte-free-cards, 
                        apparently my mom can also forge money.

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - A LITTLE LATER

           Big Ray and David walk through the “RARE BOOKS” stacks of 
           the San Francisco Public Library, pulling specific 
           editions off the shelves from a list.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        The paper from the supplier of the U.S. 
                        Mint in 1906 was also used in hundreds of 
                        turn-of-the-century books.  All with 
                        blank liner pages.
           We CUT TO Ray and David surreptitiously cutting the blank 
           pages out of hundreds of books (we see the copyright 
           pages all read 1906).  

           The LIBRARIAN eyes them suspiciously, but it looks like 
           they’re reading “TEEN PEOPLE”.

           INT. SPELLMAN HOUSE, BIG RAY’S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel stands in the workshop, surrounded by literally 
           hundreds of bottles of dyes and chemicals.  He mixes 
           different combinations, trying to get an exact match to 
           the shade of dye on the gold certificate.  

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        Daniel’s eye for color was honed by ten 
                        years of matching veneers to teeth.  The 
                        dye needs to be just right...

           INT. OLIVIA’S “ARTS AND CRAFTS” ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Olivia works over a drafting table, studying the 
           photocopy of Laura’s Gold Certificate.  She pushes away 
           the fake passports and fake I.D.s on the desk and starts 
           to draft up a duplicate copy of the bill.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        Suddenly, I question why they couldn’t 
                        afford to send me on the class trip to 
                        Paris in seventh grade.

           INT. SPELLMAN ROOF - LATE NIGHT

           Izzy sits on the roof going through Cyrus’ bank box.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        And me?  I’m combing over Cyrus’ bank box 
                        for the 20-umpth time, looking for any 
                        clue to the real money.

           She doesn’t look up as Daniel climbs out the window and 
           wobbles over to her.  He nearly falls off the roof -- 
           saved by Izzy’s quick hands.

                                 DANIEL
                        Didn’t mean to sneak up on you.    

                                 IZZY
                        I heard you coming last Thursday. 
           He warily sits next to her, holding the first counterfeit 
           bill.  Izzy scans it up and down.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Looks good.

                                 DANIEL
                        She’s going to be all right.

           Izzy nods.  Not really believing it. 

                                 IZZY
                        I treated you so horribly.  If I could 
                        take it back--

                                 DANIEL
                        What you did was treat our relationship 
                        like some case you were working.  Love 
                        shouldn’t involve aliases and DNA 
                        testing.

                                 IZZY 
                        It does in my family.

                                 DANIEL
                        But it doesn’t have to in you.  Be who 
                        you are, who I know you can be.  Look at 
                        your name.  Izzy comes before Spellman.

           Izzy nods.  Understanding.  

                                 IZZY
                        Can you forgive me? 

                                 DANIEL
                        Can you grovel?  

                                 IZZY
                        Like a dog.  

           He laughs.  She tentatively takes his hand.  

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        You remember when you told me about 
                        finding your “this”?  I think I found 
                        mine.

           She nuzzles into him.  Suddenly, Albert sticks his head 
           out the window.

                                 ALBERT
                        We have enough bills to make the drop.
           INT. DANK MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura sits three feet from tied-up Little Rae.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I gotta tell you, even including the 
                        Hungarian lady who screamed all the time, 
                        you are my least favorite client.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        And you are the most annoying little girl 
                        on the planet.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Unless you’ve met every little girl, you 
                        can’t say that.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Karl will be back soon.

           Rae knows what’s going to happen when Karl comes back.  
           She looks around at all the research scattered about, 
           hoping to make a connection with Laura.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 LAURA HOLT 
                        Eleven months ago, Karl got a call from 
                        one of the wealthiest collectors in the 
                        world.  A Russian.  Karl was offered a 
                        fortune if he could deliver the lost 1906 
                        haul.  His research led him to me... and 
                        I love money just as much as he does.  
                        And so here we are...

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Not all of us by choice.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Well, some things can’t be helped.  Like 
                        after we spend months trying to figure 
                        out what Cyrus’ stupid gobbley-gook
                        phrase meant, I asked my parents.
                                 (beat)
                        That’s when they told me about the 
                        journal.  Of course they wouldn’t let me 
                        see it.  Family shame.  Ridiculous.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Did Karl-
                                 LAURA HOLT
                        I told him to get it.  He asked very 
                        nicely, they said over our dead bodies, 
                        he complied.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        He killed your parents.

           Her look says it all.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        At least I’ve protected Peter.  After the 
                        lawyer gave the journal to him, he became 
                        obsessed with the treasure.  I tried to 
                        get him to drop it, but that's only made 
                        him distrust me more -- especially after 
                        he found Karl’s number in my purse.  Damn 
                        fool.

           Karl enters, loading a revolver.

                                 KARL
                        Kazakhstan is ready to wire the payment 
                        on receipt.  I’m going to the drop point.

                                 LAURA HOLT 
                        I’ll be here with our little insurance 
                        policy.

                                 KARL
                                 (to Little Rae)
                        You be good and you just might live to 
                        see double digits.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’m already ten, pinhead.

           EXT. SPELLMAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy, Olivia and David load the money into David’s Prius.

                                 DAVID
                        Izzy, they want me to make the exchange.  
                        Cooler heads-

           She gets into the driver’s seat and starts the car.

                                 IZZY 
                        Makes sense.  Are you coming with me?

           David sighs and gets into the other seat.  Izzy peels out 
           before David can even get the door closed.
           INT. SPELLMAN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Albert, Olivia, Big Ray, and Daniel all hover over the 
           note.  Studying it.

                                 ALBERT
                        I ran the note under black light and 
                        scanners.  No secret watermarks.

                                 OLIVIA
                        The handwriting is normal.  No secret 
                        codes imbedding within the style.

                                 BIG RAY
                        I checked it against her diary 
                        encryption.  Nothing jumped out.

           A beat as Daniel looks at it.  He takes a blank piece of 
           paper over the body of the note, covering everything 
           except the first letter in each sentence.

           It clearly reads:  “MINT”.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Welcome to the family.

           INT. DAVID’S PRIUS, GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT 

           Izzy and David drive toward the middle of the bridge.

                                 IZZY
                        As soon as we make the swap, they’re 
                        going to need a rocket-car to lose me. 

           They pull over at the middle of the bridge.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s no one here.

           Izzy’s phone rings.

                                 KARL (O.S., CELL PHONE)
                        Twenty feet to the right.  Attach the 
                        suitcase to the rope with the carabineer. 

                                 IZZY
                        I want to talk to her.

                                 KARL (O.S., CELL PHONE)
                        The money.
                                 IZZY
                        If anything happens to her, the Spellmans 
                        are going to have a competition to see 
                        who can kill you the slowest.

                                 KARL
                        If you know what’s good for you-

                                 IZZY
                        -Mister, if there’s one thing this family 
                        doesn’t know, it’s what’s good for us.

                                 KARL (O.S., CELL PHONE)
                        Slide the case down, and we’ll release 
                        your sister.  

           CLICK.  The line goes dead.

           Izzy and David step out of the car and walk toward a rope 
           tied snugly to the protective fence on the bridge.  A 
           lone carabineer is pinned to the rope.

           Peering over, they can see a SMALL FISHING BOAT in the 
           darkness below.  Just under the rope.  No car chase.

                                 IZZY
                        Crap.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s just get Rae back.  We’ll catch ‘em 
                        soon enough.

           David threads the rope through the suitcase handle.

           INT. MINT MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura sits next to Little Rae.  Her cell phone in one 
           hand, a gun in the other.  She waits for the call.  It’s 
           a tense moment.  

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’ve put a lot a thought into it and I 
                        think I’ve come up with a solution for 
                        what to do with me.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        And what’s that?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’m prepared to put my morals aside and 
                        become partners with you and Karl.  Just 
                        like 5%, enough to make me an accessory.
           Laura checks the gun barrel.  Fully loaded.

                                 LITTLE RAE (CONT'D)
                                 (nervously)
                        I’m willing to negotiate.

           INT. OLD MINT - CONTINUOUS

           A LOCK IS PICKED.  We watch as Albert, Olivia, Old Ray 
           and Daniel all slip in through the front door of the 
           Currency Museum.

           They silently signal to one another to split up as they 
           quickly and stealthily scour the building for Rae.  

           INT. MINT MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura is checking and re-checking her phone.  Waiting for 
           confirmation that Karl has the money.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                                 (tearing up)
                        C’mon Ms. Holt.  I’m sorry I’m a bad kid 
                        sometimes.  I really want my Mom right 
                        now.

           SUDDENLY, THE OLD MINT PRESSES START-UP.  Gears spinning, 
           wheels whirring - it’s deafening.

           Laura GRABS RAE, looking around.  No one.

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy nods to David, “lower the money”.  He lets the 
           suitcase drop off the bridge.  Attached to the rope by 
           the carabineer, it zips toward the fishing boat.

                                 IZZY
                        Give me your belt.  

                                 DAVID
                        What are you talking about?

                                 IZZY
                        Your belt, damn it!  Now! 

           Izzy looks over the edge to see a dark figure unlatching 
           the suitcase below.  She quickly loops his belt over the 
           rope to use as a make-shift carabineer.  
                                 DAVID
                        That’s a Gucci belt.

           He quickly whips off his designer jacket and throws it 
           around the rope (to help protect her hands). 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        You might as well have a Prada harness to 
                        go with it.

                                 IZZY
                        Times like this, I feel bad that I wish 
                        you were never born.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re a horrible, horrible person.

                                 IZZY
                                 (sincere)
                        I love you, too.

           She JUMPS OVER THE EDGE OF THE GOLDEN GATE.

           Izzy zips down the line toward the San Francisco Bay.

           Below her, an unsuspecting Karl has just finished 
           inspecting the bills.  He nods at their authenticity, 
           dialing his cell phone.

           INT. MINT MACHINE ROOM

           Laura is paranoid, looking around the room at the humming 
           machines.  She almost jumps out of his skin when her CELL 
           PHONE RINGS.

           The caller I.D. reads:  KARL.

                                 KARL (O.S., CELL PHONE)
                        They’re good.  The bills are goo-

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - WATER - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly Izzy comes CRASHING DOWN ON TOP OF HIM.  The 
           phone goes in the water.

           They both pop up and face off.  

                                 KARL
                        Are you insane?

                                 IZZY
                        Yeah, that’s kind of my M.O.
           She kicks him so hard, his Panerai watch flies off into 
           the water.  Izzy takes a few more menacing steps toward 
           him when Karl pulls out a GUN. 

                                 KARL
                        Stand back!

           Izzy stops.  She backs away, suddenly kicking the open 
           suitcase of bills over the edge and into the water.

           Karl SCREAMS “NO”, rushing to save his precious booty.

           In 3.5 seconds, Izzy has Karl’s face slammed against the 
           bottom of the boat.  She flips open her cell and dials.

                                 IZZY (INTO CELL PHONE)
                        David, stop sightseeing and get down 
                        here!

           Karl looks at a bill he’s fished out of the water TO SEE 
           THE INK RUNNING.  He’s shocked.  What the...?

           INT. OLD MINT - BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           LAURA SPRINTS DOWN A DILAPIDATED HALLWAY.  Little Rae 
           dragged behind like a sack of potatoes. 

                                 LAURA HOLT (CELL PHONE)
                        Karl?  Hello?  You have it?  Hello?

           SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THE MACHINES STOP.  SILENCE.    
           Emergency lights come on, a haunted RED GLOW.

           Laura hurries past row after row of deserted vaults.

           She starts to turn down one hallway, but sees Daniel and 
           Albert rushing toward her.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        DAD!  DAD!  Here!

           Laura kicks off her heels and jumps down an ancient 
           elevator shaft, clutching Rae.  They drop half a floor 
           onto debris.

           It looks like Laura might make it to the exit.  She 
           passes a HUGE FURNACE, Big Ray jumps out in front of her. 

                                 BIG RAY
                        End of the road.
           Laura hangs her head, defeated.  Then suddenly SHOOTS AT 
           HIM.  Big Ray DIVES OUT OF THE WAY, jumping half-in the 
           glowing furnace.  Little Rae SCREAMS.

           When Big Ray pops out, his ASS IS ON FIRE.  He starts to 
           jump around in shock.  Then pauses.  

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        Hey!  They work.  The fire-pants work!  
                        Doesn’t hurt!

           As Big Ray rips off his still-burning pants, Laura uses 
           the distraction to drag Little Rae toward the EXIT.  Big 
           Ray announces into a walkie-talkie.  

                                 BIG RAY (CONT'D)
                        Livie, I bought you some time.  She’s 
                        coming your way.  Lock and load.  

                                 OLIVIA (V.O.; OVER TALKIE)
                        The safety is already off.  

           EXT. OLD MINT - CONTINUOUS

           Laura, still dragging Little Rae, bursts through the 
           doors of the back only to find Olivia standing there 
           holding a shotgun.  Laura stops short as Olivia pumps the 
           weapon.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Let my daughter go!

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        Take it easy, lady.

           Behind Laura, Daniel and Albert appear.  The family 
           starts to surround her, but Laura continues to hold her 
           gun to Little Rae’s gut. 

                                 ALBERT
                                 (warning)
                        You don’t wanna mess with momma bear.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        I’ll let her go when I reach the car.  If 
                        you promise not to follow me. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        I won’t even promise not to kill you. 

           Laura starts toward her SUV.  As she moves, she keeps the 
           gun poking into Little Rae, who is crying.  
                                 ALBERT
                        Be careful, Ms. Holt.  My wife can shoot 
                        the fuzz off a peach from 200 yards.

           Laura digs the gun into Little Rae’s gut even more.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        And I can gut-shoot a 5th grader from 
                        three inches.   

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I’m in 6th.

           As she backs into her SUV, she sees Daniel’s Lexus parked 
           nearby.  

                                 LAURA HOLT 
                        Is that your ride?  

                                 DANIEL
                        Technically, it’s a lease. 

           Laura takes refuge in the driver’s seat, then...

           ...she SHOOTS the Lexus’ tires and the engine full of 
           lead.   As she does, Olivia fires at her, SHOOTING THE 
           GUN OUT OF HER HAND.  A perfect shot! 

           Laura yells in pain as Little Rae uses the distraction to 
           squirm away... She sprints to her parents as Laura peels
           out of the parking lot, making a break for it.

           Albert and Olivia sandwich Little Rae, on the verge of 
           tears.  Anger and relief coursing equally. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t you ever sneak out of the house 
                        again!  Do you hear me?!?

           Albert and Olivia’s car SUDDENLY CAREENS around the 
           corner.  Big Ray, in the driver’s seat, opens the door...

           As the pile in, Daniel looks at his bullet-ridden car...

                                 DANIEL
                        My insurance isn’t going to pay for that.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Daniel, if you’re going to be part of 
                        this family, you’re going to need to get 
                        full coverage.

           Olivia -- now driving -- slams the gas after Laura.
           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - SEA-WALL - CONTINUOUS

           David’s Prius careens up to the ocean-front as Izzy 
           pushes Karl (who she has tied up with the rope from the 
           bridge) onto the pier.  David swings the door open.

                                 DAVID 
                        Mom just called.  Rae’s safe and they’re 
                        chasing Laura Holt down Mission.  

                                 IZZY
                        Laura Holt!?!  When you can’t even tell 
                        who the bad guy is, it’s time for a 
                        refresher course.

                                 DAVID
                        You up for a car chase?  

                                 IZZY
                        In your hybrid?  I love a challenge.

           Izzy shoves the trussed-up Karl into the backseat as 
           David jumps back to control him.  

           They PEEL OUT and AWAY.  

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Meanwhile, Olivia maneuvers adeptly through the busy 
           traffic.  Albert, Daniel, Big Ray and Little Rae all hold 
           on tight.  They try not to get thrown from the car as 
           they approach Laura’s SUV.  

                                 ALBERT
                        There she is!  Take the outside-

                                 BIG RAY
                        No, turn on Main.  You can cut her off-

                                 DANIEL
                        No, Main will be packed with the club 
                        crowds.  Take Lexington.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Step on the gas and ram her!

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (annoyed)
                        Anyone else?  Any more suggestions?  
                        Because this is my first car chase.

           They speed up a hill, closer.  Closer.  CLOSER.  
           ON THE PHONE SPEAKER --

                                 IZZY (ON PHONE)
                        Dad!!!  I see you!  What car is she in?

                                 EVERYONE
                        White SUV!!!

           Izzy swerves, expertly bumping Laura’s car, causing it to 
           weave and CRASH into a CABLE CAR -- forcing that vehicle 
           to HOP off its tracks.  

           Bruised, Laura scrambles out the SUV and jumps onto the 
           cable-car, which skids to the TOP OF A STEEP HILL.

           SLOWER, SLOWER... The cable car gets past the top of the 
           hill and starts speeding up again.

           Izzy is the first out the Prius.  She jumps, grabbing 
           hold of the cable-car’s back pole just as it starts 
           speeding out of control.  Izzy fights her way through the 
           crowd jumping OFF the trolly.  

           We PULL OUT to REVEAL that the cable car is about to take 
           a trip down the impossibly curvy LOMBARD STREET.  And 
           with no steering mechanism and no cable, it’s STRAIGHT 
           DOWN THE CENTER, rolling over curbs and bushes.

           Meanwhile, the family’s car screeches to a halt at the 
           top of the hill.  

           Laura makes her way to the front of the cable car.  Izzy 
           follows.  Both try not to get thrown off the trolly.

           FROM ABOVE -- the family runs down the street, watching 
           Izzy and Laura’s cable-car fly down the hill.

                                 DANIEL
                        I couldn’t have met a nice librarian or 
                        something?

                                 BIG RAY
                        Full coverage.  I wasn’t kidding.

           Just as Izzy reaches Laura, the cable-car STRIKES a 
           telephone pole at the bottom of the hill and our hero and 
           villain FLY INTO thick bushes.  Izzy lands beside Laura.

           Laura tries to stagger away, then collapses.  Izzy 
           saunters over.

                                 LAURA HOLT
                        I think my ankle is broken.
           Izzy turns her back to Laura who picks up a piece of 
           metal debris like a bat.  She swings it at Izzy’s head...

           ...who spins and ROUNDHOUSE KICKS her in the stomach, 
           Laura flies back against a tree-trunk.

                                 IZZY 
                        We’re keeping your retainer!

           Spinning the opposite direction, she ROUNDHOUSE KICKS her 
           in the face.  Teeth go flying as she drops, unconscious.

           Above, Daniel just shakes his head, amazed at his 
           girlfriend’s mad skills.  

                                 DANIEL
                        Your daughter is so HOT.

           EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER

           We watch as Laura and Karl are loaded into a squad car 
           and police ambulance.  

           Olivia, Albert, David, Izzy, Little Rae and Big Ray all 
           watch from nearby.  They stand together as a family for 
           the first time in a long while.   

           EXT. LITTLE RAE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Rae is sitting on her bed writing in a journal.  There is 
           a knock on the door.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Come in.

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        It’s locked.

           Rae just keeps writing.  CAMERA CLOSE on the 3 LOCKS on 
           the door.  Over the 15 seconds we TILT down as they are 
           PICKED OPEN in succession.

           The door opens and Izzy stands there with a hair pin.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Whatcha doing?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Writing my memoirs.  They’re surprisingly  
                        action-packed for a 10-year-old.
                                 IZZY 
                        Come here.  I want to show you something.

           Off Little Rae’s inquisitive look...

           EXT. IZZY’S GARAGE ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Izzy’s oasis.  Her safe place.  She sits next to Little 
           Rae, who steals glances at her sister.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You never let me out here before.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re growing up.

           After a long beat.

                                 LITTLE RAE 
                        You know, Mom says there’s only one 
                        difference between you and me.

                                 IZZY
                        Oh, really.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Don’t you want to hear what it is?

                                 IZZY
                        Not especially.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        I don’t hate myself.  That’s the 
                        difference.

                                 IZZY
                        Give it time, kid, give it time.
                                 (beat)
                        Listen, I just want you to know, I’m not 
                        the kind of person you should be looking 
                        up to.  You shouldn’t be copying me.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Copy you?  You’re a case study in 
                        everything I want to avoid.  You’re a 
                        road map of bad decisions.  And it’s 
                        great.  I mean, how many older sisters 
                        give such great examples of how not to 
                        grow up?

           Izzy smiles wryly and kick-nudges Little Rae 
           affectionately.  We see she’s wearing army boots... 
           the exact same kind as Little Rae.  The more things 
           change, the more they stay the same.

           From below, we hear SCREAMING:

                                 OLIVIA’S VOICE
                        Office everyone!  Client meeting, five 
                        minutes!

           INT. SPELLMAN OFFICE - 5 MINUTES, 5 SECONDS LATER

           Olivia calls the meeting to order.  PETER HOLT sits at 
           the table, too.  The safety deposit box in front of him.

           Izzy and Little Rae slip in, Olivia glares at their 
           tardiness.  David smiles, pointing to his watch.

                                 PETER
                        I want to thank all of you for 
                        everything.  I’m so sorry about Laura, if 
                        I had any idea-

                                 OLIVIA 
                        Part of the job, Mr. Holt.  Now, first 
                        order of business.  The contents of the 
                        Cabo safety deposit box.  No gold 
                        certificates.

                                 PETER
                        What about the missing journal pages?

                                 IZZY
                        In the box.

           Peter opens the box and thumbs through the contents.  
           Romantic knick-knacks.  He picks up the slightly charred, 
           bloodstained journal pages.

                        It’s a letter from your grandfather to 
                        his fiancée, Maggie.

                                 PETER
                        Does he tell her where he hid the 
                        treasure?  

                                 ALBERT
                        Not exactly the treasure you were 
                        expecting. 

           Izzy knows the note by heart.  As Peter reads, on top of 
           Izzy’s voice we hear Cyrus speak the words with her:
                                 IZZY & CYRUS (V.O.)
                        “My darling Mags, I have something to 
                        give to you.  But I regret that I may not 
                        get the opportunity.  As I float away, 
                        bleeding, sitting next to more material 
                        wealth than one man deserves, I realize 
                        that the greatest treasure I’ve ever 
                        known, or ever will know, is you.”

           As they continue, we FADE to see Cyrus, floating in the 
           water, writing in the dark, the fire from the city 
           illuminating his pages.  

                                 IZZY & CYRUS (CONT'D)
                        “And as I look up into the sky, I smile 
                        thinking that you may be looking up at 
                        that same night sky, the light from the 
                        stars making those beautiful eyes sparkle 
                        even brighter, if that’s at all possible.  
                        And I pray, more than anything, that God 
                        gives me another chance to see you again.  
                        To hold you in my arms.  You are my love, 
                        my soul... my family.  I realize, 
                        hopefully not too late, family isn’t just 
                        the most important thing on this Earth... 
                        it’s the only thing.” 

           We’re back in the Spellman kitchen.  A long beat as the 
           family lets these words sink in.  Big Ray’s arm now on 
           Little Rae’s shoulder.  Mom and Dad holding hands.  David 
           smiling over at Isabel.  

           The kitchen almost seems to have grown a little smaller, 
           and our family, a little closer.  

                                 PETER HOLT
                        There’s no money?

           Big Ray shakes his head.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Only the one bill, as far as we can tell. 

           Peter takes this in.  His disappointment tempered by a 
           genuine appreciation for the prize he holds in his hands.  

           INT. SPELLMAN LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           After dinner at the Spellmans’.  The gang, including 
           Daniel, is all here.  Shockingly, there’s no fighting.

           Olivia enters with hot chocolate that she hands out.  
                                 OLIVIA
                        Izzy, we never got to the second order of 
                        business.  The Holt case is closed...  
                        You’re free to leave the agency.

           An uneasy mood comes over the room.  Everyone sips their 
           cocoa, except Big Ray who pours most of his in the plant 
           and fills the cup with 90% schnapps.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Izzy’s not going anywhere.

                                 IZZY
                                 (amused)
                        Oh, I’m not?

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        Think about it.  You don’t know how to do 
                        anything else.

           For once, Izzy has no snappy comeback.  Silence.

           FREEZE FRAME.

                                 IZZY (V.O.)
                        She’s right, of course.  At 28, I’ve 
                        lived here and worked for my parents my 
                        whole life.  I try to picture a future 
                        without Spellman Investigations and it 
                        comes up blank.  I’m damn good at it.  So 
                        I only have one option:  Bluff.

           UNFREEZE.

                                 IZZY (CONT'D)
                        Remember Mrs. Peterson, from the 
                        embezzlement case about six years ago?  
                        She agreed to front me the money to start 
                        my own agency.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You wouldn’t.

                                 IZZY
                        I’d consider telling Mrs. Peterson 
                        “no”... if you gave me a new contract.

                                 ALBERT
                        What kind of contract?

                                 IZZY
                        No surveillance, no bugging, no GPS 
                        tracking. 
                                 ALBERT
                        You’re taking all our parenting tools 
                        away.

           Olivia smiles sweetly, holding up her hand to Albert.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’s right, honey.  We need to learn to 
                        trust our Izzy more.  

                                 BIG RAY
                                 (snorting)
                        Did I just hear “Izzy” and “trust” used 
                        in the same sentence?  

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll draw up the papers in the morning.
                                 (whispering to Izzy)
                        Mrs. Peterson died last year.

           Izzy mouths “Really?” and David just rolls his eyes (he 
           was testing her).

           A feeling of warmth spreads through the room again.  
           After a beat.  Until...

           Olivia starts handing out new client dossiers.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Grandpa, you’ve got the new Worker’s Comp
                        case at the Supermarket.  Albert, I’m 
                        giving you the skip-trace.  Izzy, witness 
                        location.
                                 (off Little Rae’s pleading 
                                  eyes)
                        Rae... Missing person.

           Rae nearly blows cocoa out her nose she’s so excited.  

                                 OLIVIA  (CONT'D)
                        It’s an internet assignment only.  No 
                        surveillance.

           The family starts perusing their new job files.

                                 DANIEL
                        So what did happen to the real gold 
                        certificates?  They had to go somewhere.

           Albert just shrugs.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        You know what I think?  It’s buried 
                        somewhere in Mexico.
                                 BIG RAY
                        Five gets you ten Cyrus stole the money, 
                        then he blew it on a string of women and 
                        cheap booze.

                                 LITTLE RAE
                        That’s your life.

                                 BIG RAY
                        Someone shut her up?  Please?

                                 IZZY
                        Cyrus never lost his real treasure.  Not 
                        until he went to prison, and then he was 
                        willing to die to get it back.
                                 (raising her mug)
                        To family.

           Everyone nods to the toast.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wait a second.  You’re, like, incredible 
                        detectives.  Nobody has a clue?  Nothing?    
                        The money’s just... “gone”!?

           A group shrug.  

                                 IZZY
                        If you want to retain us, it’s $300 a 
                        day, plus expenses.  But I guess we could 
                        give you a family discount.

           We PULL OUT of the living room, as we CROSS DISSOLVE...

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO WHARF -- 1906 -- NIGHT

           Cyrus Holt stands on the deck of the captured money boat.  
           Folding his love note into the journal, he pockets it and 
           look out at the BURNING BAY.

           They navigate past several schooners, on fire, floating 
           by.  

           Cyrus and his brothers look down on the deck of the boat, 
           where we see FOUR LARGE STACKS OF GOLD CERTIFICATES.  
           What must be worth millions of dollars.  

           Cyrus and his brother hug passionately.  They’ve won.  
           They are rich.  And alive.  

           Behind them, San Francisco glows in the distance. 
           Reaching freedom, they hit the open water.  In 
           celebration, Cyrus lights his cigar.  He offers a toke to 
           his brother.  As they pass the cigar back and forth, we 
           watch as a STRAY EMBER blows back onto the flammable gold 
           certificates.  

           With the glowing city behind them, they don’t notice the 
           certificates going up in flames.  

           When it’s too late, they turn and, horrified, watch ALL 
           THE MONEY BURN IN A BONFIRE.

                                 CYRUS HOLT
                        No.  No.  No. Nooo!!!!

           To save themselves, the men jump from the ship and watch 
           the flaming boat sink into the water.

                                 JASPER
                        Well, Cy, got a new plan?

           As they tread water, a gust of wind carries ONE GOLD 
           CERTIFICATE through the air.  Cyrus reaches up and 
           snatches the bill out of the a air.  

           The three men struggle as they help each other swim 
           toward the shore, Cyrus clinging to the last remaining 
           bill of the haul.

           The bill that has been passed down in his family through 
           the generations.

           And as the final flames of the loot sink into the water 
           behind them, we...

                                                                FADE OUT
