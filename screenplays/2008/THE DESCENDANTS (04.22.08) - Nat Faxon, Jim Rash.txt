           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A young, slight, bespectacled ASIAN-AMERICAN BOY is standing 
           at the front of the room, looking right into CAMERA.

           Behind him, above the black board, a BANNER hangs. It reads, 
           We Are Proud! We Are Konawaema Elementary!

           In his hand, he is holding an unremarkable ROCK, displaying 
           it.

                                 ASIAN-AMERICAN BOY
                             (robotic, almost 
                              rehearsed)
                        For Show and Tell, I brought this 
                        rock. I found it in my backyard. I 
                        like it because it is shiny. My Dad 
                        says that if I keep collecting 
                        rocks, were going to have to buy a 
                        second house.

           The Asian-American Boy smiles, proud of his rehearsed joke.

           Now, a SAMOAN GIRL is standing in the same spot, addressing
           CAMERA as well. Shes holding a LARGE CONCH SHELL.

                                 SAMOAN GIRL
                        I brought this conch shell. Its 
                        special to me because I ate what 
                        was inside of it and had to go to 
                        the hospital.

                        And if I push this button, I can 
                        just tell my phone who I want it to 
                        call.

           AN AWKWARD KID, stricken with stage fright, is holding up a 
           FEATHER. Hes not saying a thing, just displaying it. Long 
           beat of awkwardness, until...

           Beat. Nothing happens. She looks at the screen.

                        Call Tricia.

           Beat. Again, nothing.

           A POLYNESIAN BOY is playing his Playstation PSP.

                                 POLYNESIAN BOY
                             (staring at screen, 
                              concentrating)
                        See, in order to get the Key of 
                        Loganon, I have to hit the 
                        Sarganoid with my Light Rod right 
                        on his temple. 
                             (then, frustrated)
                        No! I hit it! I did hit it!

           JUMP CUT.

           The Awkward Kid is back, still just standing there, 
           displaying his feather. 

           JUMP CUT.

           The Pretty Girl is back again. This time, talking on her 
           phone.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Hey. What are you doing?
                             (beat, then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRETTY GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Nothing. Just showing my class my 
                        phone.

           JUMP CUT.

           This time, our set FRAME is empty. That is, until...

           SCOTTIE KING (10) steps into frame. Shes quite overweight. 
           But despite her size, there is a strong air of confidence
           about her and the way she carries herself. She isnt too 
           pretty yet, but its clear that could all change. 

           Shes wearing a T-shirt thats clearly two sizes too big, 
           even for her. It reads, Im not that kind of girl. But, I 
           can be!

           Scottie clears her throat, then...

                                 SCOTTIE
                        For Show and Tell today,...I 
                        brought pictures I took of my Mom 
                        in a coma.

           With that, she holds up an open SCRAPBOOK.

           CLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK PAGE. Its filled with Polaroid shots of a 
           BEAUTIFUL WOMAN lying in a hospital bed, eyes closed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MAIN TITLES: THE DESCENDANTS

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Scottie is just outside the classroom door, dancing. Yes, 
           dancing. Whatever music she is hearing in her head, its 
           clearly making her groove. Shes definitely in her own world.

           Behind her, through the open classroom doorway, we see MS. 
           MUMEA, a young Polynesian teacher, talking with Scotties 
           dad, MATT KING (40s). Although neatly dressed in a pressed 
           button-down and khakis, Matt looks exhausted, emotionally
           spent.

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        I guess what Im saying is that, 
                        maybe Scottie needs some time away 
                        from school. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        More time, you know, around her 
                        mother.

           Matt rubs his eyes. Exhales.

                                 MATT
                        Well,...the hospital suggested 
                        getting back to a normal routine, 
                        so...

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        I know. I just think that Scottie 
                        is not herself. I mean, she is, but 
                        uh...

           Ms. Mumea considers the best way to put it.

                                 SCOTTIE (O.S.)
                             (singing, a la Gwen 
                              Stefani)
                        This shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-
                        S!...

           Matt and Ms. Mumea look over at....

           Scottie, her back to them, gyrating in the doorway.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                             (singing)
                        This shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-
                        S!

           This goes on way too long, with Matt just staring at Scottie. 
           Ms. Mumea keeps glancing over at Matt, wondering if hes 
           going to step in. Finally, she...

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        Scottie, thats inappropriate.

           Scottie stops on cue. Matt, realizing that he should have 
           been the one to do that...

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, Scottie. Come on.

           Matt turns back to Ms. Mumea, slightly embarrassed. She gives 
           him a sympathetic smile. Beat.
                                 MS. MUMEA 
                        So, has Scottie been, uh,...talking 
                        about things?

           Matt gives her a Huh? look, as if he didnt hear what she 
           said.

                                 MS. MUMEA (CONTD)
                        Have you been talking with...?

                                 MATT
                             (no)
                        Oh. Yes.

                                 MS. MUMEA
                             (nodding head)
                        Good. Good.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        You mean, like...?

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        Uh, how shes feeling. Whats on 
                        her mind...

                                 MATT
                        No. Yeah. Of course.

           Matt turns back to Scottie, who is now posing for a Polaroid 
           self-portrait. She SNAPS the photo.

                                 MS. MUMEA 
                        Look, I know this must be hard for 
                        you.

           Matt scrunches his face. Hes probably heard this line from a 
           lot of people.

                                 MS. MUMEA (CONTD)
                        But, I think she needs to be around 
                        her mother...to prepare...

           Matt snaps around.

                                 MATT
                             (short)
                        For what?
                                 MS. MUMEA
                             (taken aback)
                        Oh, uh...

                                 MATT
                        Im not thinking that way.

                                 MS. MUMEA
                        No, and you shouldnt be. Im only 
                        saying...just in case...

                                 MATT
                        Im sorry. What qualifies you? 
                        Because its my understanding that 
                        youre an elementary school 
                        teacher. But, if Im wrong, please 
                        by all means, give me your 
                        prognosis.

           Ms. Mumea looks like she could cry at any second. Matt rubs 
           his eyes again. Exhales.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Im sorry. That wasnt, uh...

           Long beat. Awkward.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Okay. Well, it was nice meeting 
                        you.

           Matt starts to extend his hand to shake, but then thinks 
           better of it. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Okay.
                             (then)
                        Scottie, get your things.

           He walks off, AS WE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Matt is driving down a beautiful stretch of Hawaiian highway. 
           Scottie is in the backseat. They ride in silence. Every once 
           and a while, Matt glances into the rearview mirror, checking 
           on Scottie. 

           CLOSE ON REARVIEW MIRROR. Scotties just staring out the 
           window, but she seems content.
                                 MATT
                        So, Scottie,...whats on your mind?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (shrugging)
                        Nothing.

           Matt just nods. That got him nowhere. 

           He pulls up to a stoplight. Beat.

                                 MATT
                        And, uh...how are you feeling...?

           Suddenly, something catches Scotties attention outside the 
           window. She sits up, excited.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (calling out)
                        Dorks!

           Startled, Matt looks over at what shes yelling at. 

           Its a FAMILY OF FOUR (Two parents and two teens) walking 
           along the sidewalk. They are all wearing purple T-shirts that 
           read, Fischer Family Reunion.

           The light turns green. Unfortunately, Matt has to pass the 
           family again. This time, Scottie leans out the window, almost 
           in their faces.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        Dorks!

           Scottie sits back in her seat, laughing. Matt glances in the 
           rearview mirror.

           CLOSE ON MIRROR. We see the FATHER gesturing wildly as his 
           OLDER SON is taking off his purple T-shirt and throwing it to 
           the ground.

           Matt just looks back at his daughter, whos in hysterics.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           Matts car turns into the parking lot.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           CLOSE ON A POSTCARD - Its a beautiful, young woman in a 
           white bikini. Shes straddling a surfboard, getting splashed 
           from some unseen person. Her mouth is wide open, laughing. 
           The caption - Lifes a DAMN hot beach.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

           Matt, staring at a rack of postcards. He seems almost 
           disgusted, sick to his stomach. 

           PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL...

           Matts in the HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP. Its a very sterile 
           environment, if it wasnt for all the wall to wall stuffed 
           animals, cards, balloons, etc..

           A GUY walks behind Matt. He peers over Matts shoulders at 
           the postcard, ogling. Matt, feeling him, hurriedly empties 
           out the rack of all the remaining postcards with the young 
           woman. Shoots the guy a look, then crosses off to...

           THE COUNTER.

           Along with the postcards, Matt sets down a can of Diet Coke 
           and a Get Well card. Behind the counter is the SHOPKEEPER, 
           sitting on a stool and reading the newspaper.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                             (from behind her paper)
                        You ready?

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Okay. Let me get to good stopping 
                        place.

           This seems to take longer than it should. Matt can hear her 
           MUMBLING from behind the newspaper. She clearly reads aloud 
           to herself. Matt notices the front page headline.

           CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER. The headline reads, Shareholders Narrow 
           Down Bids For Land. Local Bidder, Holitzer, Still in Mix. 
           There is a large photo of Matt, with the caption Attorney
           Matt King, Shareholder.

           Finally, the shopkeeper emerges from her paper. Shes an 
           elderly, Asian woman, dressed in a muumuu. 
                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONTD)
                        I no want forget what happen in 
                        article.

           She wrestles with the newspaper, struggling to fold it. Matt 
           watches as his photo comes in and out of view. The woman 
           finally wins the battle, laying the paper on the counter. 
           Matt seems relieved that the photo ends up face down. 

                                 MATT
                             (re: postcards)
                        Why do you sell these?

           The shopkeeper flips through the stack.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Hey. They all the same cards. You 
                        buy like all the same cards?

                                 MATT
                        These are inappropriate for a
                        hospital gift shop.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        What? You no like girls?

                                 MATT
                        No, I like women. Not underage 
                        girls.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        How you know she underage?

           The shopkeeper picks up the postcards, starts to put them 
           under the counter.

                                 MATT
                        No, no, Im buying them. I want 
                        them.

           The shopkeeper eyes him, confused.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Yes, Ill take them!

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Okay, fine. 

           She puts everything in a bag.

                                 SHOPKEEPER (CONTD)
                        Buy underage girl all for yourself.
                                 MATT
                        Shes my daughter.

           He snatches the bag out of her hands, walks off.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                             (calling off)
                        Well, instead of snapping at me, 
                        maybe you no allow your daughter to 
                        take pictures, then!

           As Matt exits, he pulls the postcards out of the bag and 
           throws them in a nearby trash can.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt enters. Like the rest of the hospital, the room itself 
           is sterile. But, the view is all Hawaii. Just beyond the 
           window, paradise. 

           Scottie is playing hopscotch on the linoleum, using a tongue 
           depressor as a marker. 

           In the bed, asleep, JOANIE KING. (The Beautiful Woman from 
           Scotties Polaroids). Even enveloped in a sea of machines and 
           monitors, two things are obvious: Joanie is stunningly 
           beautiful and much younger than Matt.

           Matt pulls the can of soda out of the bag.

                                 MATT
                        Here. I got you this.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (off can)
                        Diet?!
                             (then)
                        Oh, you wont let me have sugar, 
                        but I can have cancer?

                                 MATT
                        You dont need more sugar.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I dont need cancer, either.

                                 MATT
                        Fine. Then, dont drink it.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        No, Im going to drink it. Im just 
                        saying. Thanks for the cancer.

           Matt just shakes his head, bemused. He walks over to Joanies 
           bed. He looks down at her, smiles, and strokes her hair.

                                 MATT
                        Did you talk to your mom?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I havent thought of a good story 
                        to tell her.

                                 MATT
                        You said you wanted to talk to her. 
                        What have you been doing in here 
                        this whole time?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Trying to think of a good story.
                        Shed want it to be a good story!

                                 MATT
                        Just tell her about school.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        She never cares about whats going 
                        on at school!

                                 MATT
                        Then, what about after-school? 
                        Shes always driving you around the 
                        island for something.
                             (then)
                        Gymnastics? Soccer? Piano?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I dont do any of those things.

           Matt seems genuinely surprised by this. Oops. He pulls the 
           Get Well card out of the bag, hands it to Scottie. 

                                 MATT
                        Okay. Well, if youre not going to 
                        say something, write her a note.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        How is she going to read it?

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, stop fighting me on 
                        everything.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        I dont know what to write!

                                 MATT
                        Say, Get well. Wake up. I love 
                        you. Dont leave me with Dad 
                        anymore!

           Scottie pouts. Matt collects himself. Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Okay, look. Well go home. Youll 
                        think of a good story. And youll 
                        tell mom tomorrow. Okay?

           Scottie nods.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Okay, grab your scrapbook.

           Scottie goes over to a chair, gets her book.

           Matt, again, turns his attention to Joanie. Takes her in. He 
           leans down, WHISPERS something in Joanies ear. But, we cant 
           hear what he says.

           He finishes, kisses her on the forehead. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt and Scottie make their way through the busy hallway. 
           Matt notices DR. JOHNSTON (late 60s), standing at the nurses 
           station, with a group of fellow doctors. 

           Matt places his hand on Scotties shoulder, hoping to pick up 
           their pace. Dr. Johnston glances over, noticing Matt. He 
           gestures for Matt to wait. Matt squints, as if to pretend he 
           doesnt even recognize him. Dr. Johnston breaks away from the 
           other doctors, starts walking toward them. 

                                 DR. JOHNSTON
                        Matt!

           Not knowing what else to do, Matt turns down the next hallway 
           they get to.

                                 MATT
                             (to Scottie)
                        Walk faster.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        Why?

                                 MATT
                        Lets race.

           Thats all Scottie needs to hear - an excuse to run. She 
           sprints down the hallway. Matt walks faster, then breaks into 
           a jog.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Matt is on his bed, working. Papers, documents are strewn all 
           over the place. Unfortunately, nothings keeping his 
           attention. He looks over at the bedside table, picks up a 
           picture frame.

           CLOSE ON FRAME. It is a photo of the three women in his life. 
           Joanie, flanked by Scottie and ALEXANDRA (the girl from the 
           postcards). They are standing on a pier, in front of a 
           speedboat. Joanie is holding a trophy over her head in 
           victory. Scottie, like her mother, is beaming. Alexandra, on 
           the other hand, looks like she wants to be anywhere but 
           there.

           As Matt sets down the picture frame, he notices the copy of 
           HONOLULU WEEKLY that was under it. He picks it up, flips to a 
           certain page.

           CLOSE ON PAGE. It seems to be a fashion advertisement. On it, 
           a PHOTO of a FAMILY OF FIVE, all holding hands. The MODEL 
           portraying the Mom in the family looks very familiar to 
           us. In fact,...

           Its JOANIE, looking radiant. 

           Shes joined by her HUSBAND and three KIDS. The kids are 
           all different nationalities. One is Asian. One is Filipino. 
           And the other, is Hapa or of mixed descent. All three kids 
           are pointing up at something that we cant see in the sky.

           Matt looks up from the magazine, smiles. Beat.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Okay. I know what I want my new 
                        thing to be...

           Just then, a DARK FIGURE walks past the foot of the bed. Matt 
           doesnt seem startled by this at all.
           Suddenly, Joanie climbs onto the other side of the bed, sits 
           beside Matt. She pulls her hair back, puts it in a ponytail. 
           Shes not wearing make-up, but looks amazingly young and 
           beautiful. She cozies up to Matt.

                                 JOANIE
                        ...Racing speedboats!

                                 MATT
                             (off magazine ad)
                        Are these supposed to be your kids?

                                 JOANIE
                        Troy, at the club, wants to put a 
                        team together. Invited me to join.

                                 MATT
                             (still into magazine)
                        What is this even an ad for?

                                 JOANIE
                        Im going to do it.

                                 MATT
                             (smiling)
                        You dont know anything about 
                        racing, Joanie.

                                 JOANIE
                        Thats the point, Matt. Its 
                        something new.

           Matt holds up the magazine.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Hilo Hattie. 

           Matt scrunches his face.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                             (off Matt)
                        What? They like to represent 
                        Asians, Filipinos, and Hapas.

                                 MATT
                        So, you and your white husband...?

                                 JOANIE
                             (laughing)
                        Adopted them.

           Matts having fun. Hes animated.
                                 MATT
                        Why not just have an Asian mom and 
                        a Filipino dad? 

                                 JOANIE
                        They like white adults with ethnic 
                        kids.

                                 MATT
                        Well then, how about throwing a 
                        black kid in there?

                                 JOANIE
                             (flustered)

                        military.

                                 MATT
                        Then, make the dad a black 
                        sergeant.

                                 JOANIE
                        Thats not a target market.

                                 MATT
                        And what the hell are these kids 
                        pointing at, anyway?

           Joanie playfully swats Matt, laughing.

                                 JOANIE
                        Their glorious future.

           They lock eyes, kiss. 

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Race boats with me.

                                 MATT
                             (smiling, emphatic)
                        No.

                                 JOANIE
                        Come on. We can put a rocking chair 
                        on deck. 

                                 MATT
                             (amused)
                        Is that so?

                                 JOANIE
                        And a defibrillator.
           Matt laughs, grabs at Joanie, playfully. She squirms, laughs, 
           and hops back out of bed.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Okay, suit yourself. But, just know 
                        Troy likes to have his shirt 
                        off...a lot.

           She smiles. Matt takes her in, as...

           ...the DARK FIGURE moves across the foot of the bed, 
           revealing...

           Matt, just sitting there. The animated side of him slowly 
           disappears. The room feels empty again. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt is cooking breakfast. This doesnt seem to be his 
           comfort zone, as the kitchen seems like a disaster area. The 
           counters are covered in what look like failed attempts to 
           make eggs.

           Scottie is sitting on a stool at the counter. She has cut out 
           the article about Matt from the previous days newspaper and 
           is pasting it into her scrapbook. 

           Matts iPhone RINGS. He looks around, but doesnt see it. It 
           RINGS again. And AGAIN.

                                 MATT
                             (flustered)
                        Where is my phone?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (not looking up)
                        Its in my bookbag.

                                 MATT
                        What? Why?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (shrugging)
                        In case I get kidnapped.

           Matt shakes his head, grabs the phone out of her bag, looks 
           at the screen.

           CLOSE ON CALLER ID. Its reads, Hugh.
           Matt makes a face. Gathers himself. Clearly, not in the mood 
           to take this call.

                                 MATT
                             (into phone)
                        Hey. I havent made a decision.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TIKIS BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The atmosphere, dark. The walls, covered in woven mats. The 
           bar and tables, stapled with skirts of raffia. The only real 
           source of light is provided with each opening of the front 
           door, which gives everyone in the bar a brief glimpse of 
           paradise. That is, if their backs werent to the door. 

           Sitting at the bar, on his phone, is HUGH KING (50s). All 
           upper body, with skinny legs. His tan skin looks even more 
           Hawaiian Tropic against his wild, white tufts of hair. Hugh 
           is the quintessential Hawaiian businessman - short-sleeved 
           shirt, shorts, and flip-flops. If it wasnt for an Old-
           fashioned and a cigarette in his hands, and the fact that 
           hes way past his prime, youd think Hugh was off to play 
           beach volleyball. 

           Next to Hugh, on the bar, a copy of the newspaper we saw 
           earlier.

                                 HUGH
                        Good morning to you, too, cousin.
                             (then)
                        Did you see yesterdays paper?

           Matt CRACKS an egg on the side of a frying pan. 

                                 MATT
                             (lying)
                        Uh, no. 

           It BREAKS badly.

                                 HUGH (V.O.)
                        Youve gotta see this photo of us.
           Matt tries to delicately pick pieces of SHELL out of the 
           frying pan. Hes unsuccessful, burning his fingers.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hugh is looking at the newspaper.

                        Jesus. We look like a bunch of 
                        fucking bums and stuntpeople.

           CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER. Its a GROUP SHOT. A bunch of men and 
           women, all tan, all in the most casual of beach-looking wear. 
           Among them, we can make out Hugh and Matt. The caption, The 
           Shareholders.

           Hugh motions to a BARTENDER, shaking his now empty glass.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Wait, are you at Tikis? Its not 
                        even 10 in the morning.

                                 HUGH
                        I know. I got a late start.

           Hugh lets out a short, loud laugh.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                        Listen, cousin, were within a week 
                        of the deadline. We need to move on 
                        this. They will pull these offers.

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Matt moves the eggs around in the pan with a spatula. 
           Clearly, he didnt coat the pan because the eggs are sticking 
           to it horribly.

                                 MATT
                        Im aware of that.

                                 HUGH (O.S.)
                        This doesnt have to be this 
                        difficult.

                        Were all thinking the same thing. 
                        Go with Holitzer. Its a lower bid, 
                        but its local money.

           The bartender drops off another Old-Fashioned. Hugh 
           immediately taps the glass with his finger.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                             (to bartender)
                        Hey. Less ice. More of what 
                        actually cost you money.

           The bartender rolls his eyes, takes the drink back.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                        Then, they put up a strip mall or 
                        Wal-Mart and everyones pissed at 
                        us.
                             (then)
                        Come on. Itll be fun.

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        Look, Hugh, this isnt a good time.

           Matt places the plate of eggs in front of Scottie.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (not looking up)
                        I dont like eggs.

                                 MATT
                        Well, why didnt you say that 
                        before I started making them?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (shrugging)
                        I thought they were for you.

                                 MATT
                             (into phone)
                        I gotta go. 

                                 HUGH (V.O.)
                        Cousin, we cant keep stalling.
           Matt hangs up. He goes over to the sink, dumps the eggs, and 
           the entire plate. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (not looking up)
                        I dont want to go to the hospital 
                        today.

           Matt, his back still to Scottie, takes a moment, collects 
           himself. Then, turns to her. 

                                 MATT
                        Okay, well, what do you want to do?

           CLOSE ON OVER-SIZED T-SHIRT. It reads, Mrs. Clooney.

           PULL BACK to REVEAL...

           Scottie, followed by Matt, walking past a row of PARKED CARS. 
           In addition to her T-shirt, Scotties ensemble includes 
           wooden clogs too big for her feet and sunglasses too big for 
           her face. Clearly, all of it belongs to Joanie.

           As they approach two large GATE DOORS...

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Okay, we cant leave until 
                        something funny, sad, or horrible 
                        happens to me.

                                 MATT
                        Sounds like a plan.

           They enter. 

           CLOSE ON GATE DOOR. It reads, South Swell Beach Club. 
           Members Only.

           INT. BEACH CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Matt and Scottie make their way down the sandy walkway that 
           runs alongside the dining room. 

           The dining room itself is a large open terrace with coral 
           pillars and ceiling fans. Its not particularly crowded, save 
           for some tables of elderly women playing bridge.
           Suddenly, Scottie stops in her tracks, and looks back at 
           Matt.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        This is where we part ways.

           Matt is taken aback, but bemused.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                             (pointing)
                        You can sit over there.

                                 MATT
                        And youre going to be...?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        At the bar.

           Matt smiles.

                                 MATT
                        Oh, you need a drink.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I could relax with one, yeah.

           Matt complies, grabs a used newspaper off of a nearby table, 
           and heads to his post, while Scottie crosses over to the...

           BAR.

           JERRY, the bartender, is cleaning up behind the counter.
           Scottie approaches. Theres a swagger to her step, like shes 
           someone else.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        Hey, Jerry baby!

           Jerry looks up. 

                                 JERRY
                        Well, well, little Miss King.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Whats wrong with this picture?

           Scottie points to her empty cupped hand.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        And what can you do about it?
           Jerrys clearly seen this act before. Hes amused.

                                 JERRY
                        How about the usual?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Shot of Cuervo Gold, please!

           Scottie hops up on the bar stool. Her legs dont reach the 
           metal footrest, so she crosses them on the seat and balances. 

           Jerry looks over in the direction of Matt, winks.

           ON MATT, who shrugs. He goes back to reading. Matts clearly 
           within earshot.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                             (singing)
                        Everybody loves me, but my husband 
                        ignores me, guess Ill have to eat

                             (then, spoken)
                        Give me two of everything, Jerry 
                        baby!

           Scottie spins around on the stool. Jerry glances over in 
           Matts direction, wondering if he caught that.

           ON MATT. He stays hidden behind the paper, but clearly he 
           did.

                                 JERRY
                        I tell you what. How about your
                        usual? A virgin daiquiri?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Just keep them coming, Jerry baby!
                             (then, singing)
                        I like it like that. Keep working 
                        that fat.

           Jerry shoots another glance over at...

           MATT, who peers from behind the paper to see...

           SCOTTIE, now standing on the metal footsteps of the stool, 
           looking over her shoulder at her butt, shaking it back and 
           forth.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                             (singing)
                        I like it like that. Keep working 
                        the fat.
           Matt cant help but smile. But, suddenly, something catches 
           his attention in the distance. 

           MATTS POV of FOUR GUYS entering from the OUTSIDE PATIO, 
           laughing. They are all young, tan. Clearly, regulars at the 
           club.

           Matts demeanor changes. The smile is gone. He jumps up, 
           hurries over to Scottie.

                                 MATT
                             (to Scottie)
                        Lets head down to the beach.

           One of the four guys notices Matt.

                                 GUY
                        Oh. Hey, Matt.

                                 MATT
                             (short)
                        Troy.

                                 TROY (GUY)
                        Hey, Scottie.

           Matt makes a point to step in front of Scottie, shielding 
           her.

                                 MATT
                        You look...awake.

                                 TROY
                             (to others)
                        Ill catch up to you, guys.

                                 MATT
                        No, please. Stay. Enjoy yourselves.

           Matts intimidating stare proves too much for Troy. He averts 
           his eyes, looks to the ground. In fact, all of the guys are 
           looking anywhere but at Matt. 

                                 TROY
                        So,...uh, whats going on?

           Even Troy realizes that was a dumb question.

                                 TROY (CONTD)
                             (flustered)
                        I mean, hows Joanie doing? 
                             (then)
                        I visited her. She looked good.
                                 MATT
                        Then, whyd you ask?

           Troy, once again, looks to the ground. Beat. Scottie leans 
           out from behind Matt.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Did you talk to her?

                                 TROY
                        Yeah, Scottie, I did...

                                 MATT
                             (to Scottie)
                        Come on. Lets go.

           Matt puts his hand on Scotties shoulder, encouraging her to 
           leave, but she wont budge.

                                 TROY
                        I talked about the boat. Told her 
                        it was in good shape. That it was 
                        ready for her...

                                 MATT
                        Thats enough.

                                 TROY
                        And her hand moved, Scottie. 

           Scottie looks up.

                                 TROY (CONTD)
                        Yeah. I really think she heard 
                        me...

                                 MATT
                        I said thats enough.
                             (then, to Scottie)
                        Lets go.

           Matt walks past Troy, hoping she will follow. But, the damage 
           is done. Scotties eyes start to well up. Troy turns to Matt.

                                 TROY
                        There were a lot of chops and holes 
                        that day, Matt. 

           Matt doesnt look back.
                                 TROY (CONTD)
                        We tried to pass the other boat, 
                        ...She wanted us to win so bad, 
                        Matt...I just...Lots of chops and 
                        holes...

                                 SCOTTIE
                        It doesnt mean anything! 

           Both Troy and Matt turn to Scottie.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        It doesnt mean anything! She 
                        always twitches! 

           Matt crosses to her, reaches out, but she steps back. 

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        Its not just for you! Shes not 
                        moving because of you!

           With that, Scottie is off. Sprinting out of the dining room 
           terrace, toward the ocean. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Scottie is sprinting down the beach, Matt a good distance
           behind her.

           As he chases after her, Matt notices MOTHERS standing on the 
           beach, yelling in the direction of the water.  He cant 
           understand them, but they seem panicked. Then, Matt notices 
           KIDS, running in the opposite direction, away from the water. 
           Theyre passing him, running into the open arms of their 
           mothers. They seem frantic and scared. 

           Matt looks ahead of him. Scottie has reached the water, but 
           that hasnt stopped her speed. She continues, breaking 
           through the smaller waves until its deep enough to dive into 
           the water. 

           Matt stops just at the edge of the water, trying to catch his 
           breath. More kids climb out of the water, frantic, as Scottie 
           swims out into the ocean. 

           A MOTHER runs up to Matt. Her KID practically clinging to her 
           thigh, crying.
                                 MOTHER
                             (frantic)
                        Is that your daughter who just went 
                        out there?!

                                 MATT
                        Scottie!

                                 MOTHER
                        You need to get her out of the 
                        water! Theyre a ton of man-of-
                        wars!

           Hearing man-of-wars, Matt realizes he needs to make more of 
           a physical effort. He runs down to the edge of the water, 
           but keeps a safe enough distance, so as not to get wet.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, get back here, right now!

           Unfortunately, the Mother moves with him. In fact, other 
           MOTHERS with their CRYING KIDS join them, surrounding Matt.

                                 MOTHER #2
                        Whose kid is that?!

                                 MOTHER
                             (pointing)
                        Its his!

                                 MOTHER #2
                        Well, you need to get her out of 
                        the water!

                                 MATT
                        Im trying.
                             (then, yelling off)
                        Scottie!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Scottie swims parallel to the shore. 

           The CAMERA dips below the water line, down into the ocean. 
           From below, we see them - the HERD of man-of-wars - floating 
           along with Scottie, as if shes their leader.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

                                 MOTHER #3
                        The swell must have brought them 
                        in! Theyre tons of them!

                                 MATT
                        Scottie!

                                 MOTHER #2
                        She has to be getting stung!

                                 MOTHER
                        Sir, you need to get her to shore!

           Matt turns to the Mothers.

                                 MATT
                        What the fuck does it look like Im 
                        doing, lady?!

           The mothers are aghast. Matt turns back to find...

           SCOTTIE COMING OUT OF THE WATER. Something seems attached to 
           her hand, but its too hard to tell from this distance. As 
           she approaches them, we see it...

           A tiny Portuguese man-of-war. The clot of its body and the 
           clear blue bubble on her palm, while its long, dark blue tail 
           is wrapped around her wrist.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh my God! 

           The sight of the man-of-war elicits SCREAMS from the other 
           kids. They clutch to their mothers. Scotties demeanor, on 
           the other hand, is the polar opposite of how she went into 
           the water. Shes calm now, almost at peace.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Dad, I was swimming with a herd of 
                        minor wars!

                                 MOTHER #2 
                        Shes in shock! 

                                 MOTHER
                        Well, shes filled with poison!

           Matt just stares at his daughters arm, in disbelief.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        Dad, did you hear me? I got 
                        attacked by minor wars!

                                 MATT
                        Why would you stay out there? How 
                        could you tolerate that?

           Matt grabs a stick out of the sand.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Because its an awesome story to 
                        tell Mom. I got attacked by minor 
                        wars!

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, theyre not called minor 
                        wars.

           Matt starts to pry the man-of-war off with the stick.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I know that. Duh. Theyre manowars.
                        But, its our joke. Mom will like 
                        it.

                                 MATT
                             (frustrated)
                        Its man-of-war. Man-of-war.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Then, why does everyone call them 
                        manowars?

                                 MATT
                        Because words get abbreviated...!
                             (then)
                        Goddamit!

           The man-of-war pops off her hand. It falls to the sand. The 
           KIDS all SCREAM again.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Weve got to get you home.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        No! I need to go to the hospital! I 
                        have a story!

                                 MATT
                        We need to clean you off. Get some 
                        ice on those stings.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        I want to see Mom.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, were going home and 
                        thats the end of it!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Matt, walking at a brisk pace, is leading Scottie by the arm. 
           They turn into the...

           HOSPITAL ROOM.

           Stop in their tracks, stare. 

           MATT/SCOTTIE POV of an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, sitting on Joanies 
           bed. On the meal tray, a bunch of cosmetics. The woman is 
           applying make up to Joanies face. She looks up at them. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                             (pleasant)
                        Hi there.

                                 MATT
                        Hey.

           Matt and Scottie look at Joanies face.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN 
                             (re: make-up)
                        Oh, I hope you dont mind. I just 
                        thought Joanie might want to look 
                        pretty.

                                 MATT
                             (short)
                        She is pretty.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                             (thrown)
                        Oh. No, I know...

                                 MATT
                             (to Scottie, impatient)
                        Okay. Tell your story.

           Scottie, her excitement subsided, just stands there, looking 
           at the Attractive Woman.
           SCOTTIES POV of the WOMAN. Her body, slender, tan, and tone. 

           Scottie looks down at her own body. She tugs on the hem of 
           her over-sized T-Shirt, stretching it out even further.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
                        Im a friend of your wife. Weve 
                        modelled together.

                                 MATT
                        No. Yeah, I know. Uh, Tia or 
                        Tara...?

           The woman scrunches her face.

                                 ATTRACTIVE WOMAN 
                             (pointed)
                        Allison.

                                 MATT
                        Oh.
                             (then)
                        Listen, my daughter has her mind 
                        set on telling her mom a story, 
                        so...

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I dont want to tell it anymore.

                                 MATT
                        Yes, you do.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        No, I dont.

                                 MATT
                        Why?! Because Taras here?!

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Because its not funny! Mom would 
                        want it to be funny!

                                 MATT
                        Then, Ill laugh while you tell it!

           Matt looks over at Allison, whos just sitting there.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (to Allison)
                        Could you start packing up, 
                        please?!
           Allison, jolted, starts to fumble with all the make-up. Her 
           eyes start to well up.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Im not telling the story!

           Scottie darts past Matt, out door. Matt, exasperated, looks 
           at Allison, whos now full on crying. 

           Beat. Its very uncomfortable.

                                 MATT
                        She looks beautiful. Thanks.

           Somehow this comment elicits even LOUDER crying from Allison, 
           and through her tears, she just nods her head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Scottie runs out of the hospital, followed by Matt.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, stop!

           But, she doesnt. Matt runs faster, catching up to her and 
           grabbing her arm. He turns her around.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I said, stop!

           Scottie stands there for a beat, silent. But then, lets out a 
           GUTTURAL SCREAM. Matt flustered, follows suit, joining in 
           with his own guttural SCREAM. Its almost as if they are 
           competing, seeing who can out scream who. That is, until...

           HONK!

           Matt and Scottie stop, look over at...

           A LARGE CADILLAC. In the drivers seat, an OLD WOMAN who can 
           barely see over the steering wheel. She just stares at them, 
           blankly. They stare back.

           Beat.

           She HONKS again.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CAR - LATER

           Matt and Scottie sit in traffic on very over-developed strip 
           of highway. A large Costco. A K-Mart Superstore. Applebees, 
           Chilis and Fuddruckers.

           Matts car is behind a huge white truck. He leans out the 
           window. Up ahead, just a sea of red lights. Theyre going 
           nowhere anytime soon. 

           Matt glances in the rearview mirror. 

           CLOSE ON MIRROR. Scottie is just staring out the window, 
           scratching her stings, which are now raised red lesions.

           Matts iPHONE RINGS. He looks at the screen. 

           CLOSE ON CALLER ID. It reads, Unavailable

                                 MATT
                             (answering)
                        Hello?

                                 DR. JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Matt. Its Dr. Johnston.

           Matt winces. Shit. He looks back at Scottie in the rearview 
           mirror. Her attention, still out the window.

                                 MATT
                        Hey.

                                 DR. JOHNSTON  (V.O.)
                        I tried to talk to you yesterday. I 
                        guess you didnt see me. 

                                 MATT
                        Oh, I, uh...Sorry.

                                 DR. JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Listen, Matt. Id rather do this in 
                        person, but...the pressure to 
                        Joanies brain has increased. We 
                        could drain the fluid. We could do 
                        surgical intervention. But,...it 
                        wouldnt help.

           Matt checks in with Scottie again. 

                                 MATT
                        Uh-huh.
                                 DR. JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        Shell never be the same, Matt. 
                        Even if she survives, she wont be 
                        her.

           Matt eyes start to well up, but he fights it.

                                 MATT
                        Okay. So,...? 

                                 DR. JOHNSTON (V.O.)
                        We need to take her off life 
                        support.
                             (then)
                        In the meantime, tell everyone, 
                        Matt. Shell hang on for some time 
                        after, but they should come as soon 
                        as possible. To say their good-
                        byes.

           Matt continues to fight - stay all business.

                                 MATT
                        Okay. Okay.

                                 DR. JOHNSTON
                        Im sorry, Matt.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

           Matt hangs up. Beat. 

           Suddenly, Scottie looks forward, right into the rearview 
           mirror.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Im just going to talk to Mom when 
                        she gets up.

           She looks back out the window. 

           This hits Matt hard, but he keeps it together. The large 
           white truck moves forward a little, just enough to expose a 
           sign on the side of the road. 

           CLOSE ON EXIT SIGN. It reads Honolulu International 
           Airport.

           Matt considers for a beat. Then suddenly, turns off road, 
           driving along the side of it and takes the exit ramp.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A RENTAL CAR turns into a driveway, passing through two LARGE 
           IRON GATES.

           CLOSE ON GATE SIGN. It reads, La Pietra - Hawaii School For 
           Girls.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

           Matt KNOCKS on a door. Scottie leans against the wall, she 
           looks exhausted. The DORM MOTHER opens it slowly, cautious of 
           this strange man at her door. Shes dressed in a hideous 
           flannel nightgown, curlers in her hair. Inside her 
           apartment, we can see that the television is on. Its 
           American Idol.

                                 MATT
                        Im here to pick up my daughter, 
                        Alex.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Dorm Mother KNOCKS on a different door. While they wait 
           for an answer, the Dorm Mother glances back at Matt, judging. 
           She then looks down at Scottie, noting that shes in shorts. 

                                 DORM MOTHER
                             (to Matt)
                        Its cold outside. And nighttime.

                                 MATT
                        Thank you.

           Beat.

                                 DORM MOTHER
                             (then, off Scotties
                              stings)
                        Is she okay?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I got attacked by a man-of-war,
                        lady.
           The Dorm Mother glances at Matt, who flashes her a quick 
           smile. Finally, the door opens. A GIRL answers. Shes clearly 
           been fast asleep.

                                 DORM MOTHER 
                        Wake up your roommate, sweetie.

           The girl takes a moment, something gives her pause.

                                 GIRL
                        Alex isnt here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt, who is holding Scotties hand, and the Dorm Mother, now 
           wearing a down coat over her nightgown, navigate the 
           darkness. Scottie seems enthralled by the look of her breath 
           as she exhales into the cold air. In the distance, we hear 
           GIRLS LAUGHING and SHOUTS OF ENTHUSIASM. 

           As they approach the sounds, what little moonlight there is 
           reveals the source...

           ALEXANDRA and her friend, EMILY, hitting golf balls in the 
           middle of the night.

                                 DORM MOTHER
                        Girls!

           Startled, the girls look over. 

                                 EMILY
                        Run!!

           With that, Emily takes off. But, she doesnt get very far 
           until falling flat on her face, golf club in hand. Alexandra 
           leans over, laughing hysterically.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Youre such a idiot! Run! Emily, 
                        you yelled, Run!

           Emily rolls over on her back, laughing as well.

                                 EMILY
                        How far did I get?!
                                 MATT
                             (to Dorm Mother)
                        I pay fifteen grand a year for this 
                        kind of crap not to happen.
                             (then)
                        Alex!

           Alex turns.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What?!
                             (then)
                        Dad?

           Alex starts laughing again.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        My fucking Dad is here!

           The girls laugh some more.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (light, pleasant)
                        Hey, Alex!

           Scottie doesnt seem to be registering the severity of the 
           moment.

                                 EMILY
                        Hey, Mrs. Murphy, did you come out 
                        to play a round with us?!

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Yeah, eighteen holes?!

           Again, more laughter. Alexandra falls to her knees.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                             (trying to catch her 
                              breath)
                        Oh, God! Oh, my God!

           Scottie starts to laugh too, as if to copy her older sister. 
           Most likely, she has no idea whats funny.

                                 EMILY
                        Eighteen holes?! 
                        Eight...een...holes!

                                 MATT
                        Alex!
           Nothing, but laughter.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Alex!

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What?!

           With that, Alex stands, leans against her golf club. Smirks.

                                 MATT
                        You need to come with us. I need to 
                        bring you home. To see mom.

           Alex takes a beat, stumbles a little. Then,...

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Fuck Mom.

           With that, she hurls the golf club into the night. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Matt carries a passed out Alex her up the stairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - ALEXS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Matt is laying Alex in her bed. He slips off her shoes, and 
           pulls the covers over her. He watches her sleep for a second. 
           She seems like a different person. Calm.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Alex is at the counter, eating a bowl of cereal. Matt enters, 
           starts to make some coffee. He looks back at Alex, who has 
           yet to look at him.

                                 MATT
                        So, whats your handicap? 

           She still doesnt look up.
                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I meant to ask you last night, but 
                        you seemed pre-occupied with 
                        vomiting.

           Alex just rolls her eyes, ignores. Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (genuine)
                        Well, its good to see you. Its 
                        nice to have you home.

           Alex gets up from the counter, grabs the bowl. She lifts her 
           spoon and circles it in the air, Whoopi!

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Put that in the dishwasher.

           Alexandra puts it all in the sink and walks away.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Id like to talk to you.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Im going swimming.

           With that, she leaves the kitchen.

                                 MATT
                             (calling off)
                        Fine, then Im going swimming, too.

                                 ALEXANDRA (O.S.)
                        Good times.

           Matt puts her bowl and spoon in the dishwasher.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MATTS HOUSE - POOL

           Matt walks out the patio doors. Alex is already in the water, 
           sitting on the steps of the shallow end. 

           Matt pulls off his shirt. Hes definitely not in the best 
           shape of his life, but even worse, hes as pasty as they 
           come. His farmers tan is VERY pronounced.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (off Matt)
                        Eww.
           Matt looks down at his body.

                                 MATT
                        Thank you.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        How are you even Hawaiian?

           Just then, Scottie runs out the patio doors. Shes dressed in 
           an over-sized black negligee. Her legs and arms are covered 
           in dabs of white ointment. She snaps a Polaroid of Alex.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        What the fuck! Get out of my 
                        underwear, dork!

                                 MATT
                        Dont yell at your sister like 
                        that.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Shes wearing my fucking underwear!

           Scottie starts to pose, like a model.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Ooo, la, la. Ive got a big shoot 
                        coming up.

           Matt definitely doesnt want to see this.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, go to your room and 
                        change!

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Into what?

                                 MATT
                        Anything thats not worn in amateur 
                        porn!

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Whats porn?

                                 MATT
                        Something I already regret saying!
                             (then)
                        Go!

           Scottie flips him off and runs inside. Alex climbs out of the 
           pool.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Youre doing a real good job.

                                 MATT
                        I need your help with her.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I can see that.

           Alex gets out of the pool, grabs her towel, dries off. 

                                 MATT
                        No, listen to me. Your mother isnt 
                        well, Alex.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Obviously.

                                 MATT
                        Watch it. Dont do that. 
                             (then)
                        She isnt going to wake up. The 
                        doctors are going to stop caring 
                        for her. Do you understand what Im 
                        saying? Were giving up.

           Alex stands still. Matt steps forward, his arms outstretched.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Come here.

           Alex steps back.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What?

                                 MATT
                        Im just, uh...

           Matts confused by this moment, too. Alex looks at Matts 
           outstretched arms.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (scoffing)
                        Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

                                 MATT
                        Look, Im trying here. To deal.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Deal with what, Dad?! What are we 
                        dealing with?!
                                 MATT
                        Were saying goodbye, Alex! 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Well, I dont want to!

                                 MATT
                        None of us do,...!

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        No, I mean, I dont want to!

                                 MATT
                        Dont say that. You dont mean 
                        that.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Oh, what do I mean, Dad?! Because 
                        you know me so well! Whats in my 
                        head right now?! What am I 
                        thinking?! Why dont I...?!

           Then, it comes. Alexs shoulders start to shake. The tears 
           follow.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        I cant...I cant talk to her.

           Matt goes to hug her, but she pulls away.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        This is so weird.

           Tears stream down her face, her breath choppy.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        And Jesus Christ, Dad! You tell me 
                        next to the goddamn pool!

           Alex storms off, back inside. Matt follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Alex walks over to the sink. Matt enters.

                                 MATT
                        Look, Im going moment to moment to 
                        here. Im not sure of the right way 
                        to do any of this.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Well, check that one off your list. 
                        Because, that wasnt it.

                                 MATT
                        Alex, we dont have to visit your 
                        mom today. But, you do need to see 
                        her and I do need to tell people. 
                        Family. Friends. They need to know 
                        whats going on. 

           Alex splashes her face with water.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Then, call them. I dont care.

                                 MATT
                        No, I want to do it in person. Out 
                        of respect for your mother.
                             (then)
                        And I want you and Scottie to go 
                        with me. But, I dont want your 
                        sister knowing everything. Not yet. 
                        Thats why I need you.

           Alex walks to the refrigerator pulls out a beer, but Matt 
           intercepts it right away and puts it right back.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Look, well at least go over to 
                        your grandparents. And then, with 
                        our close friends, well just 
                        gather them all here. At the same 
                        time. Even if we just tell them all 
                        whats happening. Thats it.

           Alex, rolls her eyes, starts to exit.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Alex.

           She stops at the patio door, turns.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Itll be nice to talk about your 
                        mother with everyone. Console one 
                        another. Honor her.

           Alex laughs, scoffs.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I know, it sounds hokey...
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Thats not what I was laughing at.

           Alex exits, as Scottie enters.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Hows this?

           Scottie displays what she is wearing. Its another over-sized
           T-shirt and very high heel shoes that are way too big for 
           her. The T-Shirt reads, Shes Fat. Im Drunk. Its On.

                                 MATT
                        Much better.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The room is dimly lit. Matt is at his desk, working. Behind 
           him, bookcases filled with what appear to be law books. The 
           walls, adorned with credentials. Matts desk is littered with 
           papers. Clearly, hes trying to get work done, but nothing 
           seems to be holding his attention.

           He glances up, takes off his reading glasses, just as...

           ...a DARK FIGURE walks past the edge of the desk. 

                                 JOANIE (O.S.)
                        So, Alex just said something 
                        interesting to me.

           JOANIE approaches, carrying a plate of food. She sets it down 
           on top of Matts pile of papers.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        She wants to model.

           Matt moves the plate of food to the side, continues to look 
           over his stuff.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        You know, we have a dining room.

           Finally, Matt looks up.

                                 MATT
                        Im sorry. Im just preparing for a 
                        case that Ive resigned to lose.
                                 JOANIE
                        So,...what do you think?

                                 MATT
                        About what?

           Joanie rolls her eyes, starts to walk away.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        What?

           Joanie stops, turns.

                                 JOANIE
                        Your daughter has taken a vested 
                        interest in modelling. Do you want 
                        to weigh in on that?

                                 MATT
                        Id say that it doesnt surprise 
                        me.

                                 JOANIE
                        Whats that supposed to mean?

                                 MATT
                        It means that if its something you 
                        do, naturally I assume shell want 
                        to, too.

                                 JOANIE
                        You say that like its a bad thing.

                                 MATT
                        No. Im simply saying that Im not 
                        surprised because Alex has always 
                        wanted to be just like you.
                             (then)
                        Both of our daughters do.

                                 JOANIE
                        Scotties not a model.

                                 MATT
                        Great. You should tell her that.

                                 JOANIE
                        Fuck you. Thats not what I meant.

           Beat. Matt goes back to his work.
                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                             (fed up)
                        I guess Ill just make the 
                        decision...again.

           With that, the DARK FIGURE swipes across the edge of the 
           desk, revealing Matt lost in that thought. Without even 
           thinking, he reaches for the plate of food. 

           But, its not there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt enters, goes to pour himself some coffee.

                                 MATT
                             (calling off)
                        Girls, lets move it! I want to get 
                        on the road!

           Behind him, sitting at the breakfast table, a strange 
           presence. A YOUNG MAN (17). Tall, lanky and odd. Hes just 
           staring at the back of Matt, waiting. Matt turns. He jumps, 
           startled. They stare at one another for a beat. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Hello.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Sup, bro? 
                             (then)
                        Im Sid.

           Sid gets up, extends his hand. Matt, reluctantly, takes it. 
           Sid pulls Matt into him, thumps him on his back, and then 
           casts him back out. 

                                 MATT
                        And, Sid, youre in my kitchen 
                        because...?

                                 SID (YOUNG MAN)
                        Alex invited me.

           This gives Matt pause.

                                 MATT
                             (cautious)
                        For breakfast or...last night?
           Sid lets out a short laugh, sits. Just then, Scottie enters. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Morning, Dad. Morning, Sid.

           Matt looks at Sid.

                                 SID
                        We met last night.

           Sid winks at Matt.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        He and Alex were making so much 
                        noise, I went in her room to 
                        complain.

           Matt looks horrified.

                                 MATT
                             (calling off)
                        Alex!

           Just then, Alex enters.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Im right here.

                                 MATT
                             (pointed)
                        Yeah, and Sids here, too.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I know. I told you he would be.

                                 MATT
                        No, you didnt.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Oh. In my mind, I did.

           Alex goes to Sid, gives him a kiss.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Howd you sleep?

                                 SID
                        On the couch? Great.

           Sid leans around Alex, winks at Matt, again. 
                                 MATT
                             (annoyed)
                        Okay, well, Sid? Im actually 
                        taking the girls to visit their 
                        mother, and then were going to see 
                        their grandparents, so...

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Hes going with us.

           Matt looks at Alex, feeling railroaded.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (to Sid)
                        Our grandmother doesnt ever 
                        remember us.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, you just have to remind 
                        her. You know that.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (to Sid)
                        A lot. Like, every second.

                                 MATT
                             (sotto)
                        Alex, this is a family matter.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        He already knows everything. I 
                        caught him up.
                             (then, to room)
                        Shotgun!

           With that, Scottie bolts from the kitchen table, down the 
           hall.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Uh-uh! You cant call shotgun 
                        unless youre on the way to the 
                        car!
                             (then)
                        Shotgun!

           Alex starts to follow, but Matt grabs her arm, gently stops 
           her.

                                 MATT
                             (sotto)
                        I dont know who this guy is.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (as if completely put out)
                        I know him from here. When I went 
                        to school at Punahou. Before I was 
                        sent away to get focused. He 
                        lives in Kailua. Hes got some shit 
                        going on, too. So, we just want to 
                        be around each other. 
                             (then)
                        There. Youre up to speed.

                                 MATT
                        Alex,...

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Trust me, Dad. Ill be more civil 
                        with him around.

           Sid passes by, winks at Matt again. 

                                 MATT
                             (off wink)
                        Is there something wrong with your 
                        eye?

           Sid lets out another short laugh. Alex smirks, follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt drives the brood down a beautiful stretch of highway. 
           Scottie has triumphed with shotgun. Sid is splayed across 
           the backseat, Alex nestled into him. Arms, legs, everything 
           intertwined.

           Matt keeps glancing at them in the rearview mirror. Hes 
           already over Sid.

                                 SID
                        Hey, Matt?

           Matts eyes widen. Really? First name terms?

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Matt, you remember E.T.? The extra-
                        terrestrial? What if E.T. was the 
                        dork of his planet? What if they 
                        just sent him here because they 
                        wanted to unload him on us?
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Ignore him. He gets like this when 
                        hes stoned.

           Sid playfully hits Alexs knee, smiling.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (excited)
                        I want to get stoned!

           Sid lets out a short laugh. And with that, Matt just reaches 
           down to the car radio, turns it on. LOUD.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Alex and Scottie stand beside Joanies bed. Matt, behind 
           them.

           As for Joanie, shes starting to look different. No make-up. 
           Her hair darker, damp.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (whispering)
                        Say something.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Hi, Mom.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Tell her you were drunk. Tell her 
                        youre an alcoholic.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I guess its in the genes.

                                 MATT
                        Girls. Be serious.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Sorry for being bad, Mom. For 
                        wasting Dads money on coke and 
                        liquor.

                                 MATT
                        Alex.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Dad makes me drink Diet Coke.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Wasting money you could have used 
                        on face lotion.

                                 MATT
                        Alex, stop talking that way.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Money you could have used to get a 
                        family that excited you.

           Suddenly, Matt grabs Alexs shoulder, pulls his hand back, 
           and SPANKS her. The moment just sits there. Alex, stunned, 
           looks up at Matt, whos stunned as well.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Did you just spank me?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Ooo, you got served!

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, step into the hall.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        But, shes the one out of line!

                                 MATT
                        Go find Sid. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Hes having a cigarette. I 
                        shouldnt be around secondhand 
                        smoke!

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, now!

           Scottie runs out. Matt is burning a whole in the side of 
           Alex, staring.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        The other day you were in tears. I 
                        know you love her. I know you have 
                        more to say.

           Beat.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Dont bring me here again.
           Alex storms out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POOL - LATER

           CLOSE ON crystal clear, blue water. Theres barely any 
           movement in it. That is, until...

           An OLD MAN, all goggles and swimmers cap, breaks the 
           surface. His face slick with water, the old man gasps for 
           air, his mouth drawn out, then returns below the surface.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

           The old man is swimming laps. Matt, with his brood, is 
           standing at one end of the pool. The old man gets to the side 
           with Matt, touches the side of the pool, and turns back for 
           another lap.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Should we tell him were here?

                                 MATT
                        He knows.

           The old man continues to swim laps and they continue to 
           watch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POOL - LATER

           Matt, Alex, and Sid are now sitting poolside with SCOTT 
           (70s), our old man swimmer. In the distance, we see Scottie 
           with their grandmother, ALICE, walking through a small 
           garden. Scott, now wearing a robe, is looking over some 
           papers.

           Sid is splayed out on one of the lounge chairs. Alex is 
           sitting on the edge, just by his legs.

           Matt watches Scott read. He mumbles as he scans the 
           documents.

                                 SCOTT
                        This is like reading Korean.

                                 MATT
                        Do you want me to walk you through 
                        it, Scott?
           Scott ignores him. Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Its basically your daughters 
                        instructions...to us. Telling us 
                        what she wants, or in this case, 
                        doesnt want.

           Still nothing from Scott. It seems like hes mulling it over, 
           but he just keeps flipping the pages, like hes just filling 
           time.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        So, you know, no mechanical 
                        ventilation...

                                 SCOTT
                             (snapping)
                        I know exactly what it says.

           He throws the papers down.

                                 SCOTT (CONTD)
                        It says the doctors cant do squat, 
                        and shed rather go on to another 
                        place.

           Scott gets up, but its not without a struggle. He tries to 
           balance, support himself on the chairs. Matt gets up to help 
           him, but is swatted away.

                                 SCOTT (CONTD)
                        I got it.
                             (then)
                        Joanie had the good sense to write 
                        this thing here. Get us prepared. 
                        Shes a smart girl. Strong.
                             (then)
                        Stronger than you, Matt. She lived 
                        more in a year than you did in a 
                        decade, sitting in your office, 
                        hoarding your cash.

           Matt just sits there, taking it. Alex glares at him, upset by 
           this fact.

                                 SCOTT (CONTD)
                        Maybe if youd let her have her own 
                        boat, some safer equipment...Maybe,
                        she wouldnt have...

           Scott is on the verge of succumbing to his emotions. Clearly, 
           not something he is comfortable with. He pushes through it.
                                 SCOTT (CONTD)
                        Shes a good girl! Joanies a good 
                        girl.

           Just then, Scottie and Alice approach.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, do we have guests?

                                 SCOTT
                        Its your family, Alice. You said 
                        hello earlier.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello, Im Alice.

                                 SCOTT
                        Alice, they know you. Theyre 
                        family.
                             (then, re: Sid)
                        Well, except this kid. I dont know 
                        who the hell this is.

                                 SID
                        Im here for Alex.

           Scott ignores this.

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Alice)
                        We need to go see Joanie today.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh. And Chachi?

           Sid lets out a short burst of uncontrollable laughter.

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Sid)
                        Watch it, punk.
                             (then)
                        No, Alice. Our Joanie. Your 
                        daughter. We need to go visit her.

                                 ALICE
                             (chanting)
                        Joanie and Chachi! Joanie and 
                        Chachi!

           Sid cant help it. He laughs again. In fact, he starts 
           chanting with her.
                                 SID/ALICE
                        Joanie and Chachi! Joanie and 
                        Chachi!

           Suddenly, Scott punches Sid right in the eye. Sid flies back 
           off the lounge chair. Alex screams, while Scottie captures 
           the moment with her Polaroid camera.

           And Alice just starts cheering wildly as if something else 
           completely different had just happened.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Matt, back at the wheel. Scottie, riding shotgun. Alex and 
           Sid, whose eye is already light blue and puffy, in the back. 
           Alex, clearly upset, keeps shooting looks at her father, who 
           doesnt seem to be catching them. No one is speaking. 

           That is, until Sid laughs to himself.

                                 SID
                        I just got cold-cocked by a fucking 
                        old man.

           He lets out a short, burst of laughter. And with that, were 
           back to silence.

           Until, once again, Sid laughs to himself. He just cant stop 
           reliving the moment.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Alex opens the freezer door, grabs a package of frozen peas, 
           slams the door shut. She walks over to...

           Sid, sitting on one of the stools at the counter, hands him 
           the peas. Scottie, sitting on the other stool, is pasting her 
           Polaroid of the fight onto an empty page in her scrapbook. 
           Alex looks out onto the patio.

           ALEXS POV of Matt, lounging by the pool, drinking a beer.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (to Sid)
                        Take Scottie into the den. Watch 
                        some TV.
           Alex heads out to the patio, making a point to shut the 
           sliding glass door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PATIO - CONTINUOUS

           Alex approaches. 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        So, whyd you take all that shit 
                        from Grandpa?

                                 MATT
                        Oh, is that why youve been 
                        shooting me looks?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Whyd you let him go on about Mom 
                        like that?

                                 MATT
                             (resigned)
                        I was just letting him be angry. 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Well, how about standing up for 
                        yourself?! Showing some balls.

                                 MATT
                             (confused)
                        Alex, what would I have gained from 
                        that?

           She turns away.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        What?!

           Matt sits up.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        You just sat there, letting him put 
                        Mom up on this fucking pedestal.
                        Just because shes dying.

           Matt gets up, goes to her.

                                 MATT
                        Jesus, Alex. What the hell is going 
                        on?! What is wrong with you?
           Alex keeps her back to him, stewing.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Okay, whatever youre mad at your 
                        mother for, however you two left 
                        things, you need to drop it. Its 
                        nothing right now.
                             (then)
                        Shes dying. And she loves you. And 
                        you love her. So, move on.

           Alex shakes her head, scoffs.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        You have no idea! You have no idea!

                                 MATT
                        Okay, what?! What dont I know, 
                        Alex?

           She whips around, her eyes full of tears.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        She was cheating on you, Dad!

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Yeah, she was fucking around on 
                        you!

           Matt looks away, still not believing.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        I caught her!

           Matt looks at Alex. Shes dead serious.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        And when I confronted her, she 
                        denied it.

           For Alex, the tears come again.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        I wanted to tell you. I wanted to 
                        tell you everything, but it was 
                        hard...

           Matt sits down on the lounge chair, stunned.
                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Then the accident happened, and...

           Matt holds up his hand. 

                                 MATT
                        Wait.

           He needs a second. He rubs his eyes, processes.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I dont...
                             (beat, then)
                        When?

           Alex doesnt answer, not quite following.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (a little more emphatic)
                        When did you see them?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I was going into Black Point to 
                        meet friends.

                                 MATT
                        And you just...saw them?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Yeah. In his driveway. I saw them 
                        walk into his house. It was last 
                        Christmas.

           Something hits Matt. He perks up. His face looks different, 
           determined.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER

           Matts car SCREECHES up to a house.

           Matt jumps out, slamming the door, and walks up to the...

           FRONT DOOR.

           Bangs furiously. Finally, a woman, KAI (Late 30s) answers. 
           Behind her, SAM (Late 30s), her husband.

                                 KAI
                        Matt?
                                 MATT
                        Who is he?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kai and Matt are sitting across from one another at the 
           kitchen table. Clearly, Sam and Kai were in the middle of 
           breakfast. There are bowls and cereal boxes on the table. Sam 
           places down a tray of custard pastries, and joins them.

                                 MATT
                        Does she love him? Who is he? 

           Kai slides her hand across the table, almost touching Matts 
           hands.

                                 KAI
                        Matt...

                                 MATT
                        I know this may be uncomfortable 
                        for both of you. But, Im sorry, I 
                        need to know.
                             (then)
                        I would very much like to know 
                        whos screwing my wife.

           Kai slides her hand back, her demeanor shifted.

                                 KAI
                        Youre angry.

                                 MATT
                        No shit. No shit Im angry, Kai.

           Matt looks like he could lose it. He grabs a pastry and 
           stuffs it in his mouth. Hes just trying to occupy himself.

                                 KAI
                             (softly)
                        This is why.

                                 MATT
                        This is why what?

           Sam looks off, anywhere but there. Hes uncomfortable. Matt 
           catches this.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Whats why, Sam?
           Kai touches Sams hand, as if to silence him. Matt takes 
           another big bite of his pastry.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        This is why she cheated on me? 
                        Because I talk with my mouth full?
                        Huh? Is that why? Or because I use 
                        curse words? Because Im a cusser 
                        with shitty etiquette?!

           Kai leans back in her chair.

                                 KAI
                        Wow.
                             (then)
                        I think we should talk another 
                        time. You need to cool it.

                                 MATT
                        Is it Troy? That tan shithead?

           Sam breaks his silence.

                                 SAM
                        No. You dont know him, Matt.

                                 KAI
                        Oh, dont you even, Sam! Youre her 
                        friend. Shame on you.

                                 SAM
                        Im Matts friend, too.

                                 KAI
                             (to Matt)
                        Listen. Its not Joanies fault. 
                        She has needs. She was lonely.

                                 MATT
                        Was it still going on up until the 
                        accident?

                                 SAM
                        Yes.

                                 KAI
                        Sam!

                                 SAM
                        I stayed out of it, Matt. Anytime 
                        Kai talked about it, I walked away.
                                 KAI
                             (to Sam)
                        Wow. Wow. Who are you?

                                 MATT
                        And I bet you just ate it up, Kai. 
                        You probably encouraged her to have 
                        an affair. Add some drama to your 
                        own life without having to take any 
                        risks.

                                 KAI
                        Youre being awful.

                                 MATT
                        Who are you guys protecting? Huh? 
                        Because Joanie doesnt need your 
                        protection. Shes going to die. 

                                 KAI
                        Dont say that!

                                 MATT
                        Shes not recovering, Kai. In fact, 
                        shes worse. Were withdrawing 
                        care.

           Kai loses it, starts to cry. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Im sorry. Im upset. Thats not 
                        how I wanted to tell you guys. I 
                        just...

           Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Does she love him?

           Kai glares up at Matt, her face red and puffy.

                                 KAI
                        Jesus, Matt. How can you...? Who 
                        cares?
                             (then)
                        Yes, she loved him. She was crazy 
                        about him. She was going to ask you 
                        for a divorce.
                             (then)
                        Does that make it better? Knowing? 
                        Does that help the fact that your 
                        wife is dying?
                                 SAM
                        Kai. Stop it.

           Kai breaks down again. Matt, lifeless, pushes back from the 
           table, gets up. He leaves, not looking back at either one of 
           them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt, back in his car, starts the engine. Suddenly, KNOCKING 
           on the drivers side window. Its Sam. Matt rolls down his 
           window.

                                 SAM
                        Brian Speers. His name is Brian 
                        Speers.

           Sam gives Matt a sympathetic look, pats his shoulder, walks 
           off. Matt sits for a moment. Over this, WE HEAR the sound of 
           PEOPLE TALKING and LAUGHING.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           CLOSE ON MATT, just staring off. He brings a cocktail up to 
           his lips, drinks. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

           Matt, now dressed in shirt and blazer, standing in the entry 
           way of his...

           LIVING ROOM. 

           Before him, a large GROUP OF PEOPLE (the source of our 
           TALKING and LAUGHING). They are spread out around the room, 
           drinking. Matt takes another swig of his drink, puts on his 
           best smile, and begins the unfortunate task of MINGLING.

           As Matt moves through the room, PEOPLE acknowledge him, 
           breaking away from their conversations just long enough to 
           console...

                                 MALE GUEST
                        Hey Matt, were thinking of you.

           ...and...
                                 FEMALE GUEST
                        Let us know if theres anything we 
                        can do.

           ...and...

                                 MALE GUEST #2
                        Joanies a fighter. Shes a 
                        fighter.

           All the while, Matt keeps up appearances, forcing a smile. 

           He rounds the corner, sees SAM and KAI. Sam gives him a 
           sympathetic nod, while Kai just looks away. 

           Just beyond them, he spots Allison. He quickly changes 
           directions, but not soon enough. She looks over at him. 
           Panicked, he just...

                                 MATT
                             (way too loud)
                        Hello!

           Allison looks away, quickly. Shes clearly now afraid of him. 
           Matt just pushes on and finally...

           ...lands at a table, covered with food. Sushi, fruit 
           platters, etc.. Leaning against the table, facing the room, 
           an AWKWARD TEEN. His face is an unfortunate road map of 
           acne. Matt joins him, leaning against the table as well.

           Beat.

                                 AWKWARD TEEN
                        Hey, Mr. King.

                                 MATT
                        Hey, Buzz.

                                 BUZZ (AWKWARD TEEN)
                        Sorry about all this stuff. It 
                        blows.

           Matt looks right at him. No truer words have been spoken.

                                 MATT
                        Yes, it does, Buzz. 

           Matt takes a swig of his drink. Just then, Buzz reveals his 
           own cocktail glass that he had been hiding behind his back. 
           He drinks, too. 
                                 BUZZ
                             (off his cocktail)
                        Please dont tell my Mom Im 
                        drinking.

                                 MATT
                        I wont.

           Beat.

                                 BUZZ
                        Sometimes I steal beers out of your 
                        garage fridge.

                                 MATT
                        I know. 

           Beat. Buzz slinks off. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt is cleaning dishes in the sink. Sam enters, tentatively.

                                 SAM
                        Hey, Matt,...?

           Matt keeps his back to Sam, his head down.

                                 SAM (CONTD)
                        I think people are starting to 
                        wonder whats going on. Maybe, you 
                        want to say something?

                                 MATT
                        Oh, Im just trying to figure out 
                        what to lead with, Sam. The fact 
                        that Joanies dying. Or that she 
                        fucked around on me.

           He turns around, takes another swig of his drink. Beat.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I want to take this anger out 
                        there. I do. I want to be a selfish 
                        prick. Make it all about me.
                             (beat)
                        I mean, thats what I want to do.

           Matt finishes off his drink, puts the glass in the sink.
                                 MATT (V.O) (CONTD)
                        Joanies coma is permanent. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt is addressing the group. Matt seems emotionless, just 
           very matter-of-fact.

                                 MATT
                        Were going to honor her wishes and 
                        unhook her from the machines.
                        Shes not going to make it through 
                        this.

           Matt looks out a nearby window.

           CLOSE ON WINDOW. Outside, we see Sid playing with Scottie, 
           occupying her. Alex is sitting nearby.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        So, please, visit her. Soon. Say 
                        your good-byes.

           With that, a few WOMEN make moves toward Matt, as if wanting 
           to console, but hes quick to turn, escape.

           He passes by Sam, whos standing in the entry way.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I need to get out of here.

           As he exits, we hear LOUD THUNDER.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - THAT NIGHT

           Matt is parked on the side of the road. Its pitch black 
           outside, save for the light from the cars headlights. Its 
           pouring down rain.

           Matt just stares straight ahead, as...

           ...the DARK FIGURE passes in front of the car.

           WE HEAR the CAR DOOR OPEN. Joanie, soaking wet, gets in. 
           Slams the door. Shes wearing a festive holiday dress, very 
           Christmas-y.
           They sit in silence. Joanie just staring at Matt, who wont 
           look at her.

                                 JOANIE
                        Weve been here all of 45 minutes, 
                        Matt.

                                 MATT
                        Stay as long as you want. 

                                 JOANIE
                        And youre just going to sit out 
                        here?

           Matt doesnt answer, just shrugs. Joanie, shakes her head, 
           exasperated.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Kai and Sam are your friends, too. 
                        Its not like you dont know 
                        anyone.

                                 MATT
                        Im not having a good time.

                                 JOANIE
                        Well, I am.

                                 MATT
                        Then, stay.

                                 JOANIE
                        Fine.

           She starts to get out, but then stops. She looks at Matt, who 
           has made no effort to stop her. Beat.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Im not happy.

                                 MATT
                        Well, have another drink.

                                 JOANIE
                        Please, Matt. Im trying here. 
                        Listen to me.

           Beat.

                                 JOANIE (CONTD)
                        Im not getting what I need from 
                        this. Youve been distant...for a 
                        long time. And,...I dont know. 
           Beat. Matt just looks straight ahead. Joanie, like before, 
           stares at him, hoping for something. But, it doesnt come.

           She gets out of the car, and...

           ...the DARK FIGURE moves across the front.

           Matt, opens his mouth to speak, but realizes shes gone.

           Matt TURNS THE CAR back onto the road, making a U-TURN. As he 
           does, the headlights shine on a sign.

           CLOSE ON REAL ESTATE SIGN. It reads, Diamond Head Real 
           Estate. Underneath that, a PHOTO of a MAN, good-looking.
           Under the photo, a phone number and a NAME...

           ...BRIAN SPEER.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Matt is standing in the middle of Joanies room, looking at 
           her. The room is different this time. Before it was stark and 
           sterile, now its been filled with the signs of visitors - 
           flowers, balloons, cards, etc.. But, beyond that, there are 
           more personal items. On the bureau, picture frames, plants.
           On Joanies bed, a quilt. 

           From behind, we see Matt look down at his hand. Hes holding 
           something, but we cant see what it is.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Matt is sitting on his bed. On his lap, a phone. In his hand, 
           a slip of paper with a phone number. He considers for a 
           moment, then picks up the phone, starts to dial. But, caves. 
           He hangs up. A beat. 

           He tries again. This time, he lets it ring. And ring. And 
           ring again. Then he panics, starts to hang up, but...

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Hello, this is Brian.

           Matt lifts the phone to his ear, almost starts to respond, 
           but...
                                 BRIAN (O.S.) (CONTD)
                        Sorry, I missed your call. But, Im 
                        probably out making someones 
                        dreams of owning a home come true. 
                        Hope I can do the same for you. 
                        Leave a message.

           BEEP. Matt hangs up quickly, grimaces.

                                 MATT
                        Dork.

           Feeling a presence, Matt looks up. Its Alex, standing in the 
           doorway.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Hey.

                                 MATT
                        Close the door.

           Alex does, steps into the room.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I need to talk to him.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Who?

                                 MATT
                        Brian.
                             (then)
                        Thats his name. The guy you saw 
                        with your mom.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What? Why?

                                 MATT
                        Because I feel like I should give 
                        your Mom what she wants, and 
                        apparently, she wanted him.

           Alex scoffs.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Alex, he gave her 
                        something...Because I stopped. 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        So, youre going to find this 
                        fucking loser?
                                 MATT
                        I cant just be angry...

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Yes, you can. I am. Im fucking 
                        pissed. And you should be, too!

                                 MATT
                        I dont want to leave it like that. 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Its her fault! Its her fault 
                        were here!
                             (then)
                        And, as far as Im concerned, 
                        thats how shes decided to leave 
                        it!

           Alex opens the door, slamming it on the way out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Matt is on the phone, pacing.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, hi. Im interested in the 
                        home on Palms. 3520.

           INT. DIAMOND HEAD REAL ESTATE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A young, bubbly POLYNESIAN WOMAN sits behind a desk, working 
           on her computer. In fact, shes navigating her own MySpace
           page.

                                 POLYNESIAN WOMAN
                        Oh my God. I love that house!

           CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. We see photos of the Polynesian 
           Woman and friends playing laser tag, hanging out on the 
           beach, etc.. Shes really personalized her page with 
           decorative stuff. 

                                 POLYNESIAN WOMAN (CONTD)
                        Im going to be so mad if you buy 
                        it. Im serious. No, Im kidding.

                        Its four bedrooms, three and a 
                        half baths...

           Alex exits the house, approaches.

                                 MATT
                        Actually, is Brian Speer there? I 
                        believe hes covering this 
                        property.

           Alex gives him a What the fuck are you doing? look. Matt 
           averts.

           The Polynesian Woman, still navigating, CLICKS her mouse.

                        Hes on Kauai on vacation.

           CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. Shes checking her MAIL from a 
           Friend. Shes opened a MESSAGE that reads, Would U like 2 
           meet sometime?

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                        How would I get in touch with him? 
                        Does he have a cellphone?

           The Polynesian Woman starts typing again.

           CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. Shes replying to the MESSAGE. 
           She types, OMG! Totally! Send me a photo! 

                                 POLYNESIAN WOMAN
                        Oh, we cant give out that

           Matt hangs up. He looks at Alex.

                             (off Matt, wary)
                        What?

           INT. PLANE - LATER

           Matt is seated on the aisle. Scottie and Alex are in the 
           seats next to him, asleep. Matt looks over, and we PAN...

           ...to find SID, sitting across the aisle, looking at the 
           laminated safety card.

                                 SID
                        Look at these passengers, bro.

           He holds out the brochure for Matt to see.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        They arent even wet.

           Matt looks.
           CLOSE ON BROCHURE. Its an animated panel with a group of 
           passengers, getting into a raft. Their life vests are 
           inflated and behind them the airplane, floating on the water.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        And this Asian dude. Hes smiling.
                        The plane just crashed and hes 
                        fucking smiling. Probably, because 
                        he just got his bag worked from 
                        some hot stewardess...

                        Youre only here because that was 
                        the only way to get Alex to come.

           Beat.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Does that mean I cant ask you a 
                        question?

                                 MATT

                        Alex tells me your Hawaiian 
                        royalty.

                                 MATT
                        Thats a statement.

           Sid laughs, realizing. 

                                 SID
                             (in a questioning tone)
                        Alex tells me your Hawaiian 
                        royalty?

           Sid smirks, chuckles, at his own cleverness. Matt just pushes 
           through.

                                 MATT
                        No.

                        Its complicated.
           Matt opens a magazine, hoping that will satisfy Sid. But, 
           alas, Sid just stares. Hes got nothing better to do.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        My great-grandfather...

                        Yes.
                             (then, quickly, rote)
                        He married Princess Kekipi, who was 
                        the last direct descendant of King 
                        Kamehameha...

                                 SID
                        Nice.

           Matt shoots him a look. Sid takes the hint. Zips it.

                                 MATT
                        Kekipi died first. My great-
                        grandfather got all the land. And 
                        now, me and my cousins, have it 
                        all.

                                 SID
                        And, now, you guys want to sell it.

           Matt shrugs. Well see. Sid just nods his head, sinks back 
           into his chair.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Fucked up people with power, huh? 

           Matt looks at Sid.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                             (off Matt, smirking)
                        Im just giving you shit.

           Matt leans back into his chair. Who the fuck is this guy? 
           Over this we hear INCESSANT CAR HONKING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Matt and the brood stand curbside, their bags beside them. 
           Matt is looking up the road at the source of the RANDOM 
           HONKING. Its a Jeep Wrangler, swerving its way through 
           traffic. Matt sighs. Unfortunately, this is their ride.

           The Jeep screeches to a stop right in front of them. At the 
           wheel...

                                 RALPH
                        Yo, Mattie!

           RALPH (40s), a man-child with a grin from ear to ear. Ralphs 
           very white teeth are framed by his very tan face. Another 
           example of the Hawaiian business man. Khaki pants, a Reyns 
           spooner shirt, rubber slippers, and a briefcase. Hes a 
           bundle of energy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Ralph drives his Jeep Wrangler along paradise-filled 
           landscape. Its a stark contrast to the over-developed city 
           of Honolulu we saw earlier. Matt is in the passenger seat, 
           uncomfortable, with his bags on his lap. The kids are crammed 
           in the back. Scottie is on cloud nine, thrilled by it all - 
           the speed, the wind in their faces.

                                 RALPH
                             (to Matt, yelling over the 
                              wind)
                        Were you surprised that I was on 
                        time?

                                 MATT
                        You werent.

           Ralph laughs.

                                 RALPH
                        Okay, well, were you surprised I 
                        arrived?

           Matt just politely smiles, nods.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        Yeah, its my new thing. Being on 
                        top of stuff.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        Work in progress. But gotta get 
                        serious, you know? 

           Again, a polite nod.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        You here to talk to some of the 
                        cousins? Make sure theyre happy 
                        with your choice?

                                 MATT
                        No. To be honest, I want to make a 
                        decision without being influenced 
                        by the majority.

           Ralph laughs, shakes his head.

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah, right.

           Matts confused by this reaction.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        Hows Joanie?

                                 MATT
                        The same.

                                 RALPH
                        Strong lady.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.

                                 RALPH
                        Shell be fine.

           Ralph slaps Matts back. Matt just smiles. He doesnt have a 
           better response.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        I saw her a few months ago at the 
                        last shareholders meeting.

           Matt looks over, again confused. This is news.

                                 MATT
                        Joanie?

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah, remember?
                                 MATT
                             (no)
                        Oh, sure. I remember.

                                 RALPH
                        Youre lucky you have someone that 
                        fired up speaking on your behalf.

           Matt still feigns understanding.

                                 MATT
                        Right.
                             (beat, then)
                        So, what did she say? At the 
                        meeting?

                                 RALPH
                        I thought you remembered?

                                 MATT
                        Oh, I, uh...

           Ralph playfully slaps Matts again.

                                 RALPH
                             (laughing)
                        Im just fucking with you!

           Ralph instantly makes a face, catching himself for cussing.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                             (to backseat)
                        Sorry about the language, girls.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        We can say fuck.

                                 MATT
                        So, what did she say again?

                                 RALPH
                             (joking)
                        Who?

           Ralph laughs. Matt is not amused, but he manages a courtesy 
           laugh.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        Joanie was saying how it was 
                        ridiculous not to accept Holitzers
                        offer. He had a solid plan and he 
                        was going to open up so many 
                        opportunities and so on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        And as the largest shareholder and 
                        last direct descendant, youd 
                        appreciate everyones support 
                        because it was going to happen with 
                        or without our consent.

           Matt just looks off, confused.

                                 RALPH (CONTD)
                        Im surprised you dont remember. 
                        It kind of pissed people off.
                             (then)
                        Oh, thats right. You dont want to 
                        be influenced by the majority.

           Ralph laughs, slaps Matt on the back again. 

           As they head over the crest of hill, we see...

           HANALEI. A valley of taro plantations. In the distance, the 
           deep, blue ocean. They race down the hill. Scottie holds up 
           her hands, screams,  like its a roller coaster. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt is hanging up the phone. He walks over to the sliding 
           glass doors, looks out onto the beach below. 

           MATTS POV of Alex, Sid, and Scottie walking out onto the 
           beach. They have chairs, beach gear, etc.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt approaches the kids, all stretched out on their towels, 
           soaking up the sun. 

                                 MATT
                        I just got off the phone with Dr. 
                        Johnston. Your moms doing well.

           Alex doesnt even flinch, she just lays there, stoic. Hidden 
           by her sunglasses. Matt notices that Scottie has stuffed her 
           bikini top with two lumps of wet sand. Like her sister, 
           Scottie is wearing shades. Shes even copying Alexs sun 
           tanning position.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Scottie, take those out.
                                 SCOTTIE
                        Theyre my beach boobs.

                                 MATT
                        Get up. Throw a ball or something.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I need some color.

                                 MATT
                        Its not good for you. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Ive already got cancer from your 
                        diet soda.

           Alex lets out a laugh. Scottie, smiles, excited that she 
           entertained her sister. 

                                 MATT
                             (to Scottie)
                        What happened to your scrapbook? 
                        Why arent you working on that 
                        anymore?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Its stupid.

                                 MATT
                        No, its not. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Well, Im over it.

           Matt gives up. He looks at the long stretch of beach, and the 
           equally long stretch of houses. A lot of possibilities. Brian 
           could be anywhere.

                                 MATT
                        Who wants to go for a walk?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Not me.

                                 SID
                        Ill go, bro.

           Matt grimaces, not the person he was hoping for.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        You know what? I feel like I should 
                        stretch my legs.
           Scottie gets up, the lumps of sanding spill out of her suit. 
           Alex doesnt move.

                                 MATT
                        Alex?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        No thanks.

                                 SID
                        Come on, babe. Lets walk.

           Alex takes a beat, then ties the straps of her bikini while 
           on her stomach, flips over. She joins them. Matt rolls his 
           eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt leads the brood down the beach. The way they follow 
           him, one after the other, makes him look like a mother duck, 
           leading them. Sid is clearly taking a hit of weed. His 
           hands clasped around the pipe, partly to shield from the 
           wind, partly just to shield.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Dad?

                                 MATT
                        Mm-hmm.

           Matt is fixated on the houses he passes. Brian could be 
           anywhere.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        What do you love about Mom?

           Matt looks back at Scottie. Then Alex, her face expectant.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (taunting)
                        Yeah, Dad. What do you love about 
                        her?

           Matts on the spot.

                                 MATT
                        Well, I love...I dont know. I love 
                        the things we love together.
                                 SCOTTIE
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh.

           Matt looks back at Scottie, shuffling her feet in the sand.

                                 MATT
                        Did I ever tell you guys about the 
                        time that your mom was almost a 
                        sharks dinner?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (perking up)
                        Really?

                                 MATT
                             (nodding)
                        We were camping on the beach with 
                        the Mitchells. Youre mom had gone 
                        out surfing on Molokai. And, while 
                        riding a wave, she saw a shark 
                        beneath her. She said it was wide 
                        and dark under the water so she 
                        knew it wasnt a dolphin.

           Scotties hooked. Alex is reluctantly paying attention.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        She got down on her stomach, so she 
                        wouldnt fall. Started paddling 
                        toward shore. But, when she looked 
                        down, she didnt see the shark. It 
                        was gone. That is, until she looked 
                        behind her. There it was. A giant 
                        fin. The shore was too far, so she 
                        decided to paddle toward a sharp 
                        peninsula. When she got close 
                        enough, she paddled right up onto 
                        the rocks.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        And the shark bit the board!

                                 MATT
                        No. She never saw the shark again. 
                        But, that night at camp, we had 
                        fish for dinner. Your mom sank her 
                        teeth into the tuna and said, I 
                        could have been dinner tonight. 
                        And then, she told us that story.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (challenging)
                        How come she never told us?

           Matt eyes Alex.

                                 MATT
                        I guess she got new stories.

           Scottie runs ahead of the pack. She seems rejuvenated.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Moms not afraid of anything!

                                 MATT
                        How about you, Scottie? What do you 
                        love about Mom?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Lots of stuff. Shes not old and 
                        ugly, like most moms.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        This is stupid.

           Matt glares back at Alex, who has turned back.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Come on, Sid. 

           Sid complies, and heads back with her. Matt stops.

                                 MATT
                             (calling, to Scottie)
                        Scottie, thats far enough for 
                        tonight. Lets get back.

           Scottie sprints back toward him. Shes in the mood for a 
           race, but Matt doesnt have it in him. He just follows, 
           slowly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT/EXT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Alex is smoking a cigarette out on the balcony. The sun is 
           just about to set. Matt slides open the glass door, joins 
           her.

                                 MATT
                             (re: cigarette)
                        Put that out.
           Alex looks at Matt, takes one last, long drag. Then, rubs the 
           cigarette out on the bottom of her sandal.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        You could at least smoke Lights. 
                        Like Sid.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Oh, is that your favorite thing 
                        about him? His healthy choice in 
                        cigarettes?

           Alex sits in one of the chairs, puts her feet up on the 
           railing and leans back.

                                 MATT
                        Listen. Im sorry. That you knew 
                        this about your mom. That you felt 
                        like you had to hold onto it. To 
                        protect me. 
                             (then)
                        If thats what you were doing. I 
                        dont know.
                             (then)
                        But, I am sorry. And you have every 
                        right to be angry. At her and at 
                        me. Weve put a lot on you,...for a 
                        long time. And that wasnt fair. 

           Beat. Matt attempts to make eye contact with his daughter, 
           see where he sits with her. But, she keeps her gaze averted.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        She wouldnt end it. She didnt 
                        even care enough about me, about 
                        any of us, to end it. Even after I 
                        told her I knew.

           Alexs eyes well up, but she looks away, hiding. 

                                 MATT
                        I dont think she ever meant to 
                        hurt you. I just think she wasnt 
                        getting what she needed.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Well, its still shitty.

                                 MATT
                        I know.

           Beat.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I want to meet him. 

                                 MATT
                             (concerned)
                        Alex, I dont know...

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I want to see who she chose.

           For the first time, she looks up at Matt. She means it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - THAT NIGHT

           Matt is in bed, unable to sleep. He looks over at the alarm 
           clock.

           CLOSE ON CLOCK. It reads, 1:10 AM.

           He glances down the hall of the suite. He notices the 
           bathroom light on and the door slightly cracked. He gets up, 
           heads down the...

           HALLWAY.

           As he gets closer, Matt can hear MOVEMENT in the bathroom. 
           Matt makes a point to walk lightly as he peeks through the 
           crack of the door.

           MATTS POV of Scottie, standing on top of the bathroom 
           counter, her legs on either side of the sink. Shes striking 
           poses in the wall-to-wall mirror. Shell hold one for a few 
           seconds, then move on to a different pose.

           Matt is just about to walk in, tell her to go to bed, when 
           Scottie pushes her arms against the sides of her breasts to 
           form cleavage. Matt steps back, too embarrassed to enter 
           having seen that. But, he cant walk away. He watches his 
           strange daughter.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (to herself)
                        Have you been thinking about me?
                             (then, slightly different 
                              voice)
                        What do you mean?
                             (then, back to other 
                              voice)
                        What do I mean? Come here, you 
                        bastard.
           With that, Scottie leans in, pressing her hands against the 
           mirror, and starts kissing it. An open-mouthed kiss, her 
           tongue on the glass.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        Ooh, baby. Put your junk in my 
                        trunk. I want to go all night 
                        long.

           Startled, Matt steps back, hitting a hallway table. To him, 
           the sound is louder than it is. He panics, scurrying down the 
           hallway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt approaches Sid, who is asleep on a cot in the common 
           area. Matt shakes him awake. Hes not being delicate about 
           it at all. Sid rolls over, squinting.

                                 MATT
                        I dont want you and Alex doing 
                        anything physical around Scottie. 
                        At all. You got me?

                                 SID
                             (confused)
                        ...Okay.

                                 MATT
                        Im serious. Dont touch each 
                        other. Dont talk about touching 
                        each other. Dont...

                                 SID
                        Relax, bro. 

                                 MATT
                        I just saw Scottie in the bathroom. 
                        Playacting. I hope. And I swear to 
                        God if shes imitating something 
                        that she saw you two doing...

                                 SID
                        Dude, its not like that between 
                        us. Trust me. Were just here for 
                        each other.

           Matt rubs his eyes. Hes all over the place right now.
                                 MATT
                        Well, does Scottie know about her 
                        mom and Brian? Is that it? Is that 
                        what shes...?
                             (then)
                        Has she said anything to you?

                                 SID
                        No.

           Beat. Matt just exhales.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Im sure its nothing, bro. Kids 
                        just do some fucked up, weird 
                        things. I know I still do.

           Beat.

                                 MATT
                        Sorry. I just,...

           Matt sits on the edge of the couch. 

                                 SID
                        Its going to get worse. After your 
                        wife dies. Dealing with them.

           Matt looks over.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Sorry, bro. It just does.

           Sid reaches into his bag, pulls out a one-hitter. 

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Whoo, man. That was intense. You 
                        shaking me and shit.
                             (then, imitating)
                        Do you...? Does she...? Stop 
                        touching...
                             (then)
                        I gotta bring it down after that.

           He lights up, takes a hit. Offers it to Matt, who considers, 
           then shrugs. Why not? He sits on the edge of the couch, 
           lights up. Matts good at this, takes a hit like a pro.

                                 MATT
                             (off Sid)
                        Joanie taught me.
                                 SID
                        Well, you should do it more often. 
                        You clearly need it.
                             (then)
                        And I deal, too. If you like the 
                        product.

                                 MATT
                        Your parents must be proud.

           For the first time, something seems to give Sid pause.

                                 SID
                        Its possible.

           Sid pulls his knees up to his chest, stares down at them.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        My moms kind of busy right now. 
                        Getting my dads things organized. 
                        He died a few months ago.

           Sid sort of smiles, as if hes okay with it. Matt senses that 
           Sid doesnt want to go further with this. Matt hands him back 
           the one-hitter, gets up.

                                 MATT
                        Well, we should get some sleep.

           Sid toasts him with the one-hitter.

                                 SID
                        Nice chat, bro.

           Matt nods, starts back down the hallway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt is jogging along the edge of the ocean. Its early, so 
           the beach seems deserted save for some SURFERS checking out 
           the swell, a couple of FISHERMEN planting their poles in the 
           sand, and a lone MAN jogging toward Matt. As the man gets 
           closer, Matt realizes...

           Its BRIAN SPEER.

           They pass one another. Matt continues for a moment, then 
           turns, following Brian. The back of Brians T-shirt reads, 
           Stanford Lacrosse and hes wearing those serious runner 
           shorts - thin with large slits on the sides.
           Matt struggles to keep up with Brians pace. Hes clearly in 
           better shape. A wave crashes onto the shore, causing Brian to 
           sprint away from it. But, Matts too focused on Brian to 
           notice. He runs right through the water, letting it splash up 
           on his legs.

           Suddenly, as they approach the pier, Brian stops in his 
           tracks. Matt, trying so hard to keep up with Brians speed, 
           almost doesnt have enough time to stop. He gets a little too 
           close for comfort.

           Brian checks his pulse with his watch. Matt walks in small 
           circles in the sand, filling time. He keeps glancing over at 
           Brian. Should he do this now? Confront him? 

           Just then, Brian turns around. Matt, quickly faces the water 
           and starts to stretch in some odd position. Brian runs past 
           Matt, heading back in the direction they just came. Matt lets 
           him get ahead, then starts up after him.

           After a while, Brian cuts up away from the water, jogging 
           toward a row of small blue cottages. Matt stops, watches as 
           Brian heads up the porch steps of one and starts to stretch.

           Matt considers for a moment, takes a deep breath, then starts 
           to walk toward the cottage, trudging through the deep soft 
           sand.

                                 MATT
                             (rehearsing, to himself)
                        Hi. You dont know me, but I know 
                        you...

           Matt stops, judges this rehearsal. Just then, TWO YOUNG 
           BOYS run out of the screen door of Brians cottage, and hug 
           him. After them, a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in a white bathing suit, 
           and large white sun hat. She kisses Brian on the cheek. Matt 
           takes this in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           From a distance, Matt is now seated in the sand, watching the 
           beautiful woman in the white bathing suit. She is now sitting 
           on a beach chair, reading. Her boys are in the ocean, body 
           surfing, waiting for a big wave to come in. Every now and 
           then, she glances up, keeping an eye on them. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                             (yelling, to the boys)
                        Chris! Billy! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Stay in the zone, please! I want to 
                        be able to see you!

           The beautiful woman looks over in the direction of Matt. 
           Quickly and awkwardly, Matt looks to the sky. He even 
           randomly points at nothing in particular, trying to make 
           himself look engaged in something. The woman looks up in the 
           sky to see what Matt could be pointing at, but then returns 
           to her reading.

                                 ALEXANDRA (O.S.)
                        There you are.

           Matt looks behind him. Alex and Scottie, walking up, carrying 
           beach stuff - towels, magazines, etc.. Trailing them, Sid, 
           once again, toking up.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Sid said he heard you get up to go 
                        jog, so I assumed wed better find 
                        out where you collapsed.

           Scottie, dressed in another over-sized T-Shirt, runs ahead of 
           Alex. Sid parks himself in the sand.

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (accusatory)
                        Alex ordered room service, Dad! Are 
                        you going to spank her...?

                                 MATT
                             (snapping)
                        Who keeps buying you these God-
                        awful things?!

           CLOSE ON T-SHIRT. It reads, I Only Have Sex On Days That End 
           in Y.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Theyre Moms.

                                 MATT
                        Well,..when we get back, were 
                        buying you appropriate clothes.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I wont wear them!

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Scottie, Ill take you shopping. 
                        Well get cool stuff.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Well,...it better be cool.
           Matt looks at Alex, smiles. Matt turns his attention back to 
           the Beautiful Woman, whose boys are waving to her to join 
           them. She gets up and starts to walk toward the water.

                                 MATT
                        Lets go for a swim.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt wades in the water, watching the woman, who is wading as 
           well. Scottie has moved over toward the two boys, CHRIS and 
           BILLY. They all watch the incoming waves, looking for a good 
           one. Sid and Alex have swam out to a floating dock, and are 
           sunbathing.

           Suddenly, a BIG WAVE.

                                 CHRIS
                        I got dibs!

           Chris takes off, thrashing at the water. Scottie goes after 
           the same wave. She catches it, riding it to the shore. But
           for Chris, the wave just passes under him, and he sails down 
           its back.

                                 CHRIS (CONTD)
                             (to Scottie)
                        You got in my way! Go find your own 
                        lineup!

           Scottie is now swimming back out.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I wasnt in your way! You didnt 
                        swim hard enough!

                                 BILLY
                        My brother called dibs!

           The woman looks over at Matt, who takes the moment to 
           parent.

                                 MATT
                        I think you can all manage to share 
                        an ocean.

           The woman smiles, and Matt returns the sentiment. 
                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (to Chris, off incoming 
                              wave)
                        Here comes a set that has your name 
                        on it, buddy.

                                 CHRIS
                        Catch this one, Mom!

           The woman seems almost thrown that shes been put up to the 
           challenge. She starts to backstroke. Clearly, a novice to 
           body surfing. Scottie, who takes a stab at this wave too, 
           starts thrashing at the water, picking up speed. The woman, 
           noticing Scotties technique, flips over and makes a more 
           concerted effort to stay ahead of the incoming wave. But just 
           as the woman looks back, the wave SLAMS down on top of her. 
           Shes gone, swallowed by the sea. 

           Scottie, on the other hand, catches the same wave, rides it 
           to shore. Matt swims toward shore, looking for the woman. As 
           he approaches the shore, Scottie is already standing. The 
           woman is on her side in the sand, her long hair wrapped 
           around her head, and the bottom part of her swimming suit is 
           hiked up, revealing her ass. Even in this awkward position, 
           the woman is laughing, hysterically.

           Matt approaches.

                                 MATT
                        You okay?

           Just then, another wave CRASHES into the woman, and she 
           slides down the shore, receding with it. Matt helps her up. 
           She steadies herself, placing her hands on Matts shoulders. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                             (still laughing)
                        My God. I feel like Ive gone 
                        through a car wash.

           Matt laughs too hard at this. The woman realizing her hands 
           are still on his shoulders, quickly removes them. Beat.

                                 SCOTTIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, look at me!

           They both do.

                                 SCOTTIE (CONTD)
                        Im a boy!

           They look down. Sand has gotten into the bottom of Scotties 
           suit, creating a huge bulge.
                                 MATT
                        Scottie, take that out.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I got a huge wiener. 

           Scottie adjusts herself, runs back into the water. Matt, 
           embarrassed, looks down at the sand.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Shes funny.
                             (then)
                        I mean, you know, entertaining.

                                  MATT
                        No, shes crazy.

           Matt looks at Scottie, who is now just sitting in the sand, 
           letting the waves toss her around.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Is that your other daughter out 
                        there?

           The woman motions toward the raft. Matt looks out.

           MATTS POV of Sid leaning over Alex, putting his mouth to 
           hers. Alex raises her hand to his head. They make-out.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. Im doing a real great job.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Its hard.
                             (then)
                        Are you on your own?

           Matt takes a moment. Should he?

                                 MATT
                        Not exactly. Their, uh...mother is 
                        in the hospital right now.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh, Im sorry. Its none of my 
                        business.

                                 MATT
                        No, I didnt mean to...
                             (then)
                        She was in a boating accident.
                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh, no. Sailing? Or was she on one 
                        of those with a motor?

           Matt cant help but laugh at this.

                                 MATT
                        One with a motor.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                             (embarrassed)
                        Sorry, Im just trying to...make 
                        this less awkward.

           Beat.

                                 MATT
                        So,...are you staying in one of the 
                        these cottages?

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Yes. My husband had to come for 
                        work. So, we thought wed make a 
                        vacation of it. 
                             (then)
                        He knows the owner, Hugh, so...

           Matt perks up.

                                 MATT
                        Hugh King?

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh, do you know him?

                                 MATT
                        Uh, yeah. Hes my cousin.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh. Okay. So, you probably know my 
                        husband, then. Brian Speer?

           Matt looks back out at the ocean, considers. He notices that 
           Chris has drifted farther out into the water. He seems to be 
           fighting the current, unsuccessfully.

                                 MATT
                        Uh, no, I dont think so.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh. I just assumed...
                                 MATT
                             (yelling)
                        Scottie, tell her son to swim 
                        parallel to the beach.

           The woman now looks out at Chris, struggling in the water.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Is he okay?

                                 MATT
                        Hes fine. Currents just tricky.

           Matt looks at the woman. Her face is full of worry. Matt 
           takes a beat, then...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Chris has his arms around Matts neck. Matts tugging him 
           back to shore. They climb out of the water. Chris runs over 
           to his mother, hugs her. 

           Matt darts off in the opposite direction, hes got other 
           things on his mind now. Questions.

                                 MATT
                        Alex! Scottie! Lets go!

           The Beautiful Woman notices that Matt is leaving.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                             (yelling)
                        Oh. Uh, thank you! 

           Matt turns only to wave, never breaking his stride.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TIKIS BAR - LATER

           Matt storms in, followed by the brood. 

           Unlike the first time we saw the place, there is life beyond 
           the bar area. The tables are full, people milling about. More 
           festive. On stage, a GROUP OF OLD HAWAIIANS, are playing 
           ukuleles and singing.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Dad, what are we doing here?
           Matt is preoccupied. Hes scanning the bar area.

                                 MATT
                        Were eating dinner.

           Finally, he finds what hes looking for. Or rather, who.

           MATTS POV of HUGH, sitting on a stool. His back is to us, 
           but the white tufts of hair, tan skin - theres no mistaking
           him.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Get a table. Order me something.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What do you want?

                                 MATT
                        It doesnt matter. It all comes out 
                        fried.

           With that, Matt walks off, approaching...

           THE BAR.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Since when do you own property in 
                        Hanalei?

           Hugh turns, focuses his eyes. Hes clearly been hitting the 
           Old-Fashioneds.

                                 HUGH
                        Cousin!
                             (then)
                        If Id have known you were coming 
                        to Kauai, I would have picked you 
                        up at the airport.

                                 MATT
                             (impatient)
                        I called Ralph.

                                 HUGH
                             (smiling)
                        Good. Because Im just saying that.
                             (then, pointing at 
                              himself)
                        Guess whos not allowed to drive a 
                        car anymore?
                                 MATT
                             (more impatient)
                        Hugh, your cottages. By the bay...

                                 HUGH
                        What, are you surprised, cousin?
                             (then)
                        Youre not the only one with a day 
                        job. Unlike the rest of them, Im 
                        not sitting around waiting for you 
                        to determine our fate.

           Hugh takes a swig of his drink. The band finishes a song. 
           Hugh looks over his shoulder toward the stage.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                             (yelling, to band)
                        Hana Hou!

           With that, the band starts playing again.

                                 MATT
                        I just want to know about the guy 
                        youre renting to. Brian Speer?

                                 HUGH
                        Who?
                             (then)
                        Oh. Yeah, hes a determined son-of- 
                        a-bitch. Hes, ah, Lous 
                        sisters...No, wait. Lou has a 
                        sister, and the sisters 
                        husband...Lous brother-in-law is 
                        cousins with that guys wife.

           Matt is confused. Hugh somehow seems to be getting drunker 
           just sitting here.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                        No, wait. Which cottage are you 
                        talking about? 

                                 MATT
                        Brian Speer. The guy with the wife 
                        and two boys.

                                 HUGH
                        Oh, yeah. Determined son-of-a-
                        bitch. Im doing some business with 
                        this guy and this guy is that guys 
                        friend.
                             (then)
                        Wait. What am I saying?
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGH (CONT'D)
                             (then, indicating Matt)
                        Were doing business with him.

           Matt is still confused, trying to navigate Hughs train of 
           thought.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                        Yeah. Don Holitzer. Dons friend is 
                        staying in the cottage.
                             (then, to band)
                        Hana hou!

           But, the band is still playing. 

                                 MATT
                             (re: band)
                        Hugh, theyre still in the middle 
                        of a song. 

                                 HUGH
                        So?

                                 MATT
                        So, stop telling them to play it 
                        again!
                             (then)
                        Now, Dons friend...?

                                 HUGH
                        Is a Realtor.

                                 MATT
                        Right.

                                 HUGH
                        Yeah, so if we sell our land to 
                        Holitzer to redevelop, then this 
                        guy will be in charge of all the 
                        real estate transactions.

           The moment of epiphany for Matt.

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                        Hes going to make a shitload of 
                        money.

                                 MATT
                        Not if we dont go with that bid.

                                 HUGH
                        Matt, we all want Don.
                             (then)
                        So did Joanie.
           Matts fuming. He downs the rest of Hughs old-fashioned. 

                                 HUGH (CONTD)
                             (off drink)
                        Hey!

           Matt storms over to...

           A TABLE. Alex, Scottie, and Sid are looking over menus.

                                 MATT
                             (determined)
                        Were out of here.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        But, weve only gotten drinks.

           But, Matts on a different wave-length. He makes a bee-line 
           for the door. The brood takes the hint, follows.

           As they all exit, WE HEAR...

                                 HUGH (O.S.) 
                        Hana hou!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Matt exits the restaurant, followed by the brood. He is 
           lost in thought. Alex catches up to him.

                                 MATT
                        That woman on the beach today. That 
                        was his wife.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        What? Why didnt you say anything?
                             (then)
                        Did you say anything? To her?

                                 MATT
                        Thats what were going to do now.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Were?

                                 MATT
                        Youre going to talk to her, while 
                        I talk to him.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt is down the beach, a safe distance from the cottage. The 
           lights are on and theres clearly movement inside. Matt 
           notices that Chris and Billy are out front, playing with a 
           small group of other boys. Behind Matt, we can see Alex 
           talking in private to Sid. Scottie, as usual, is running 
           around, in her own world.

           Alex and Sid approach Matt. 

                                 SID
                        Giveem hell, man.
                             (then, calling off)
                        Hey, Scottie. 

           Scottie runs over, joins them. Sid motions to the boys 
           playing.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Lets go hang with those guys from 
                        today.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        You mean the retard who almost 
                        drowned? I dont want to play with 
                        him.

                                 SID
                        I do.

           Sid starts to walk off.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Mmm, I guess I could play a little 
                        bit.

           She runs after them. Matt and Alex walk up to...

           THE COTTAGE.

           Just as they approach, the beautiful woman from the beach 
           backs out of the screen door, carrying a platter of hamburger 
           patties and a spatula.

                                 MATT
                        Hello!

           The woman turns, a bit startled.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Oh. Uh, hello.
                                 MATT
                        I am such an idiot. I do know your 
                        husband. I just put it together. We 
                        were walking back to the hotel from 
                        Tikis, and I saw your boys down on 
                        the beach. I thought wed drop in 
                        and say howdy to you. And to 
                        Brian...who I know.

           Alex looks at Matt, mouthing the word, Howdy?

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        This is my daughter, Alex. 

           Matt motions to the woman.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (to Alex)
                        This is, uh...

           The woman starts laughing.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Yeah, I was just going to say, we 
                        never exchanged names.
                             (then)
                        Im Julie.

                                 MATT
                        Oh. Matt.

                                 JULIE
                        I actually was telling my husband 
                        earlier about meeting you, but 
                        realized I didnt know your name. 
                        Even after all that.
                             (then)
                        Please, come up on the porch.

           They do. Matt leans against the railing, while Alex stands on 
           the edge on the top step, rocking back and forth. Julie sits 
           in a chair, setting the spatula on the railing.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        I have to admit that I thought you 
                        might be mistaken when you said you 
                        didnt know Brian. I figured you 
                        must have crossed paths. Hes been 
                        so involved.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. I dont know what I was 
                        thinking.
                                 JULIE
                        Yeah. So,...in a couple of days, 
                        right?

           Matt looks at her, quizzical.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        Youll know soon. You and your 
                        cousins vote, right?
                             (then, catching herself)
                        Im sorry. Thats a conflict of 
                        interest. That was stupid of me.

                                 MATT
                        Thats okay.
                             (then)
                        Yeah. It will be over in couple of 
                        days.

           Julie smiles. An awkward beat of silence.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh. Offering you a drink might be 
                        nice, right? 

                                 MATT
                        Sure.

           Julie gets up, knocking the spatula off the railing, onto the 
           ground below. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Let me get that.

           Matt goes down the porch stairs, retrieves it. At this 
           moment, we hear the SCREEN DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE. Matt looks 
           up. Silhouetted against the door, its....

                                 BRIAN
                             (very friendly)
                        Hi. Im Brian.

           Brian looks just like his real estate sign photo, except now 
           hes in casual clothes. Hes spotless, hair slicked back with 
           heavy gel, clean shaven. Its a nice contrast to Matt, who 
           having been out all day, looks weathered by the sun and sand. 
           Matt seems proud of this, feeling rough and in power. Its a 
           stark contrast to how we first met him.

           Brian extends his hand. Matt moves to take it. 
                                 MATT
                             (smiling)
                        Brian.

           Matt pumps Brians hand vigorously, then releases it. Brian 
           gives his own hand a tiny shake, massages it.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Weve actually met before. Matt 
                        King. My wife is Joanie. 

           Brians smile wilts.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I think we met at a shareholders 
                        meeting.
                             (then)
                        This is my daughter, Alex.

           Brian stays locked on Matt.

                                 JULIE
                        Matts the one I was telling you 
                        about. He saved Christopher.

           Beat. No movement. Its almost a staring game between three 
           people - Brian, Matt and Alex.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        I was just going to get drinks.

           Brian loses the staring contest, breaking away.

                                 BRIAN
                        Good.
                             (then)
                        Good, good.

           Julie walks past Brian. He, oddly, pats her on the back. Once 
           shes gone...

                                 MATT
                        Joanies dying. 

           Brians body tenses.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Oh, wait. Fuck you.
                             (then)
                        And my wife is dying.
                                 BRIAN
                        I cant...Im sorry. I never 
                        thought it would come to this.
                             (then)
                        I cant have you here...

           Just then, Julie exits the screen door, carrying a glass of 
           red wine and a soda for Alex.

                                 JULIE
                        I hope this is okay.

           Matt takes the wine, sips.

                                 MATT
                        Perfect.

           Julie notices Brian, withdrawn.

                                 JULIE
                        Everyones so serious. Please dont 
                        tell me youre talking business.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        No. We were talking about love.

                                 JULIE
                        Well...

           Julie playfully bumps her shoulder against Brian, who looks 
           at her with a furrowed brow.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        What about love?

           No one answers. Brian just looks at Matt. Hes getting 
           pissed. Matts enjoying it.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                             (to Alex)
                        Is this about the boy on the raft? 
                        Are you in love?

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        No, hes my friend. We have things 
                        in common, thats all.

           Julie wraps her arms around Brians waist, presses into him.

                                 JULIE
                        Sometimes thats how it starts.
                                 ALEXANDRA
                        No. We have a friendship that we 
                        dont have to work on.

                                 JULIE
                        But, I saw him kiss you.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Oh, please. Were friends, but of 
                        course hes going to try to get 
                        laid.

           Alex locks eyes with Brian.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Every guy wants to get laid.

           Julie squeezes Brian.

                                 JULIE
                             (smiling)
                        Were in for it, arent we?

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

           Julie is slightly put off by Brians abrupt behavior.

                                 JULIE
                        Our boys, sweetie. Our boys.

                                 MATT
                             (enjoying, off cottage)
                        What a great old place. 

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, well, you should see the 
                        inside.

                                 MATT
                        I was just going to say itd be 
                        nice to see the inside.
                             (then)
                        Brian, will you show me around?

           Matt smiles at Brian, who is even more angry at this point.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                             (quickly)
                        Yes, and Julie, you and I can talk 
                        about love.
                                 MATT
                        There you go.

           Matt smiles even bigger, enjoying.

                                 BRIAN
                             (reluctant)
                        Sure. But, theyre pretty much all 
                        alike along here.

                                 MATT
                             (very cheery)
                        Well, lets see, Brian.

           Matt walks up to the door, makes a point to let Brian open it 
           for him. Matt enters the...

           COTTAGE.

           Followed by Brian, who sweeps his arms out, displaying the 
           room.

                                 BRIAN
                        Here it is.

           The cottage itself is quaint and small, with low ceilings. 
           The decor is old-fashioned with furniture of questionable
           comfort. The room is filled with decorative sewing baskets, 
           Hawaiian quilts, etc..

                                 MATT
                        So, Brian, Im curious. Howd you 
                        meet?

                                 BRIAN
                        I cant do this.

                                 MATT
                        Well, I cant very well ask her all 
                        the details, so I need to ask you. 
                        I want to know.
                             (then)
                        Howd you meet?

           Brian exhales.

                                 BRIAN
                        At a party...I think...

                                 MATT
                        Last Christmas. It was last 
                        Christmas.
                                 BRIAN
                        Then, why ask me?

                                 MATT
                        Hey. Im doing you a favor here. I 
                        could go out there right now and 
                        fuck up your life for good. So, get 
                        a better attitude.

           Matt takes another sip of his wine, grimaces.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Can I get a beer? This could be the 
                        worst wine Ive ever tasted. 

           Brian takes the wine glass, shuffles into the kitchen.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        So, what makes a person cross that 
                        line? Huh? What made you ask her 
                        out?
                             (then)
                        I mean, Joanie was a model who 
                        watched football and raced boats. 
                        So, its not that amazing, I guess.

           Brian returns with the beer, hands it to Matt. He also got 
           one for himself.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Or was it about business? Because, 
                        apparently, Joanie loved the idea 
                        of Don. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Its not what you think.

                                 MATT
                        Oh, what do I think, Brian?

                                 BRIAN
                        Me and Joanie. It just happened.

                                 MATT
                        Now, when you found out her 
                        connection to me, did you decide 
                        then to commit the adultery, or 
                        were you already committed? Did you 
                        ask her to sway me? Because, boy, 
                        she was hot for Holitzer. That
                        doesnt just happen.

           Brian doesnt say anything, ignoring Matts questioning face.
                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Was she going to leave me?

                                 BRIAN
                        What do want from me?!

                                 MATT
                        Right now, I want you to answer my 
                        question.

                                 BRIAN
                        But, what do you want from me? What 
                        do you want from this?
                             (then)
                        I get it. Youre pissed...

                                 MATT
                        Was she going to leave me?

                                 BRIAN
                        She would have. But it wouldnt 
                        have happened.
                             (then)
                        I love Julie. I would never leave 
                        her.

           Brians stance seems to soften. His anger gives way to 
           anguish. He looks sunken. Finally, and maybe for the first 
           time, he looks Matt in the eyes.

                                 BRIAN (CONTD)
                        Please dont tell her. Please. I 
                        dont know what Ive done.

           Beat.

                                 MATT
                        Did she love you?

           Brian nods, sips his beer.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Did you love her?

           No response. Brian just looks down.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        You used her. To get to me.

           Brian sighs.
                                 BRIAN
                        It was an affair. An attraction. 
                        Sex.
                             (then)
                        She suggested everything beyond 
                        that, and I went with it.

           Matt starts to well up. He turns away, wipes his eyes. Hes 
           not wasting tears in front of Brian.

                                 BRIAN (CONTD)
                        I love Julie very much. I love my 
                        family.

           Matt locks eyes with Brian. 

                                 MATT
                        I love my family, too.

                                 BRIAN
                        Then, why are you here?
                             (then, indicating Alex)
                        Bringing them into this?

           Matt looks back at...

           ALEX, laughing with Julie.

                                 BRIAN (CONTD)
                        Im sorry. Thats all I can give 
                        you.
                             (beat)
                        It doesnt change what 
                        happened...Or whats happening.

           Matt cringes. The bastard is right.

           Matt, exhales, gets up. Brian extends his hand, offering to 
           take the beer from Matt. Matt, purposely, sets it down on a 
           table himself. 

                                 MATT
                        Say good-bye to her. She, at 
                        least, deserves that.

           Matt opens the screen door, steps out onto...

           THE PORCH.

           He makes sure the door closes before Brian gets to it. No 
           need to make it easier for him. 
           Julie and Alex are still laughing, enjoying their company. It 
           seems very genuine. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        We should go. 

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, alright. Well, thanks for 
                        stopping by.

                                 MATT
                        Say good-bye, Alex.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Bye, Julie.

           Alex looks over her shoulder, back at Brian.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                             (almost taunting)
                        Bye, Brian.

           Alex runs down the porch, toward Sid and the others playing 
           on the beach.

                                 JULIE
                             (smiling)
                        Good night, Matt.

           With that, Matt takes Julies hand, pulls her into him. He 
           leans in, parts his lips, and kisses her. Although stunned, 
           Julie accepts the moment, leaning in a bit.

           Matt pulls away, slowly. Julies eyes are still closed, lost 
           in the moment. It was a damn good kiss.

                                 MATT
                        Good night.

           Matt doesnt look back. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt, reserved, stoic, is walking along the edge of the 
           water. Alex catches up to him. In the background, Sid is 
           occupying Scottie, playing tag.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        That was so awesome! 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEXANDRA (CONT'D)
                        What did he say? Was he fucking 
                        freaked? Did he totally cry and 
                        shit?

                                 MATT
                        That was a mistake, Alex. 

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        Uh, I dont think so...

           Matt stops, looks right at her. Hes conscious that Scottie 
           and Sid are getting closer.

                                 MATT
                        I shouldnt of brought you. I 
                        shouldnt be giving you more 
                        reasons to hate your mother.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        They deserved...

                                 MATT
                        No. Its over.
                             (then)
                        That got us nothing.

           Alex pulls away, just as Sid and Scottie approach. Sid, 
           sensing the mood, looks at Alex. Without missing a beat, she 
           takes his hand, and pulls him off for some private time. Matt 
           can only watch. Hes feels even more distant to her than 
           ever.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. PLANE - THAT NIGHT

           The plane is quiet, and dimly lit. Not many people on the 
           9:15 flight. Outside the windows, pitch black. Matt is seated 
           next to Scottie, who is asleep, resting on his shoulder. 
           Across the aisle, Alex is asleep, leaning on Sid. Matt seems 
           drained, lost in thought. He looks down at Scottie...

                                 MATT (V.O.)
                             (gently)
                        Do you know whats happening?

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt is standing beside Joanies bed. Scottie is seated in a 
           chair. Its a different Scottie. Her hair is brushed, neat. 
           Very put together. Her clothes are now appropriate by the 
           standards of a girl her age, but somehow it doesnt seem to 
           fit her. She seems uncomfortable. Not Scottie.

           As for Joanie, she looks very different, too. Gaunt and 
           pasty, vacant-looking. She is no longer attached to any 
           machines. Her breathing, weak and infrequent.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, I asked you a question. Do 
                        you know whats happening?

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Yes, Dad, God.

           Scottie looks up at him for a second, then its back to 
           pulling on her clothes, trying to make them work for her.

                                 MATT
                             (gently)
                        Come here.

           Scottie, reluctantly, goes to her dad. Matt takes her hand.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I want you to talk to your mother. 
                        You dont need a good story. Just 
                        talk to her.

           Scottie tries to pull away, but Matt wont let go. She 
           struggles.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Put your hand on her. I need to 
                        know that you understand whats 
                        happening, Scottie.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I do.

                                 MATT
                        Then, tell me!

           Matt unclenches Scotties fist and stuffs it into Joanies 
           hand. He makes Joanies hand grip Scotties. Suddenly, Joanie 
           breathes loudly, like shes trying to catch her breath.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Mom cant breathe!

                                 MATT
                        She can breathe, Scottie! Shes not 
                        struggling! Shes not suffering! 
                                 ALEXANDRA (O.S.)
                        Dad!

           Matt turns, sees Alex standing in the doorway. Scottie breaks 
           away from Matt, goes right to Alex. Scottie wraps her arms 
           around her sisters waist. Alex strokes her hair.

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Go find Sid.

           It takes a moment, but she complies. 

                                 ALEXANDRA (CONTD)
                        Youre yelling at her for not 
                        knowing, for not behaving the way 
                        you want her to, but she doesnt 
                        know whats going on. You made that 
                        choice for her.

                                 MATT
                        She needs to do this, Alex. You
                        need to do this.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        I could say the same thing to you.

           She leaves. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Matt enters. Sid is watching television. In fact, the TV is 
           the only thing illuminating the room. And the room itself, 
           filled with plenty of residual pot smoke.

           Feeling his stare, Sid looks up at Matt.

                                 SID
                             (re: television)
                        Have you ever noticed actors 
                        smoking in movies?

           Matt looks.

           ON THE TV. Some movie with characters smoking cigarettes.

                                 SID (CONTD)
                        They always overdue it. Its so 
                        exaggerated. They always pick 
                        something off their tongue and try 
                        to talk while holding in the smoke. 
           He imitates it, showing Matt, as...

                                 SID (CONTD)
                             (as movie character)
                        I have no idea who murdered him.
                             (then)
                        Its so lame.

                                 MATT
                        Brian didnt love her. He didnt 
                        love my wife.

           Sid just sits there. He doesnt know what to say. However, he 
           starts to open his mouth, feeling like he should.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (waves him off)
                        No. Im not looking to have 
                        a...conversation with you. No 
                        offense.
                             (then)
                        I just needed to say that out 
                        loud...to someone. At least, 
                        someone I know can hear it. 

           Sid just sits there, following orders.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Ive failed my daughters. Im 
                        failing. I just want them to have a 
                        better impression of their mother. 
                        To protect them. But, Ive managed 
                        to do nothing but the opposite of 
                        that. And now,...who is their 
                        mother? Who should she be to them? 
                        The one who was in love and loved 
                        passionately and recklessly by 
                        someone else? Or the one who was 
                        deceived and desperate? The one who 
                        will never know the mistakes that 
                        she made.

           Matt sits there for a beat, pondering to himself. Sid just 
           watches him. A long silence. Then, Matt starts out the room.

                                 SID
                        Just get them to love their mother 
                        again.

           Matt looks back.
                                 SID (CONTD)
                        Sorry, if that constitutes as a 
                        conversation.

           Matt takes it in, walks off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matt walks down the hallway. He stops in front of Scotties 
           bedroom door. We know its hers by the fact that its heavily 
           decorated - magazine clippings, Polaroids, etc..

           Matt listens for a moment, then lightly taps on the door.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie, sweetie. I need you to get 
                        up now. Weve got people coming 
                        over.

           He taps again. Nothing. 

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Scottie?

           Matt opens the door. Although the bed has been slept in, 
           Scottie is nowhere in sight. Matt, growing concerned, heads 
           down the hallway to...

           ALEXS ROOM.

           He knocks and enters. Alex, startled, sits up in her bed. No 
           Scottie.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATTS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matt, followed by Alex, run down the stairs and turn into 
           the...

           LIVING ROOM. No Sid or Scottie.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           Matt and Alex run down the hall. As they approach Joanies 
           room, Sid is sitting in a chair outside her door, which is 
           closed.

                                 SID
                        She woke me up. Wanted to see her.

           Matt looks in through the doors window.

           MATTS POV of Scottie, curled up on the bed with Joanie.

           Matt slowly opens the door, Alex starts to follow, but Matt 
           motions for her to stay. He enters...

           JOANIES ROOM.

           Matt can see Scottie better now. Shes under her moms arm, 
           her head resting on Joanies chest. Her back is to Matt.

                                 MATT
                             (softly)
                        Scottie?

           Scottie doesnt move. 

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I still dont know what to say to 
                        her.

           Matt approaches, gets down on his knees, resting his head on 
           Scotties back.

                                 MATT
                        Scottie,...forgive me.

           Matt tears up.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Dad,...whats happening?

           With that, Matt exhales. He could lose it for real, but now 
           is not the time. Scottie is showing her strength. He needs to 
           do the same. He wipes his eyes, puts his hand on Scotties 
           back, and..

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Were back outside the door window. Alex and Sid watch from 
           outside. We cant hear anything, but we can tell that Matt 
           has started to talk. Hes started to tell Scottie everything.

           Alex opens the door, approaches. Seeing her, Matt takes 
           Alexs hand, pulling her in.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MATTS HOUSE - POOL - LATER THAT DAY

           A large group of PEOPLE are gathered, mingling and drinking.
           Its all of Matts COUSINS, including Hugh and Ralph. And 
           like those two, they really do all look like a bunch of very 
           tan beach bums and stunt people.

           Matt is seated in a folding chair on the lawn. In his lap, a 
           thick contract. In the pool, Alex and Sid splash around with 
           Scottie.

           Hugh approaches Matt, cocktail and contract in hand.

                                 HUGH
                        Will this thing hold me?

           Hugh points to an empty folding chair next to Matt.

                                 MATT
                        It should.

           Hugh sits, tentatively. The plastic cords of the chair 
           STRETCH, but ultimately, they hold.

                                 HUGH
                        Its like a goddamn ass hammock.

                                 MATT
                        Im not going to sign. I cant.

           Hugh considers. Then, shakes his drink, takes a swig, and 
           spits out an ice cube.

                                 HUGH
                        We need your approval to move.

                                 MATT
                        I know. Im sorry. I cant do it.
                                 HUGH
                        Youre going to piss off a lot of 
                        people.

                                 MATT
                        I know that.

           Matt smiles at Hugh, who reciprocates.

                                 HUGH
                        Can I ask why?

                                 MATT
                        Well,...the less dignified reason? 
                        Revenge.
                             (then)
                        I dont want Brian to profit from 
                        my failure.

           Hugh gives him a quizzical look, What? Matt just waves it 
           off. He doesnt want to get into it.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        This is our responsibility, Hugh.

           Matt looks over at the pool.

           MATTS POV of Alex and Scottie, splashing around.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        And,...I want to take care of it.

           Hugh places his hand on Matts shoulder, takes another swig.

                                 MATT (V.O.) (CONTD)
                        We didnt do anything for this 
                        land. It was given to us by someone 
                        who entrusted us with its care.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. MATTS HOUSE - POOL - A LITTLE LATER

           Matt is now addressing his cousins. 

                                 MATT
                        I look around me. Our once flat 
                        faces have sharpened. Our hair has 
                        straightened. Evidence of our 
                        ethnicity, all but erased.
                             (then)
                        But, we are Hawaiians. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATT (CONT'D)
                        And its a miracle that we own this 
                        much of Hawaii. So, lets do right 
                        here. Because once we vote to sell, 
                        thats it. Something that was given 
                        to us, to protect, will be gone. 
                        Something that was ours to pass on, 
                        will be gone.
                             (then)
                        Ive taken a lot of things for 
                        granted in my life...

           Matt locks eyes with Alex and Scottie, who are standing by 
           the pool. He doesnt need to say more than that. They know.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                             (then, to Group)
                        And weve taken a lot of things for 
                        granted.
                             (then)
                        We are descendants...of something 
                        greater than us.

           Matt motions to his daughters.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        And they are descendants. And I 
                        want to do right by them. 

           Matt smiles. The girls, reciprocate.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Although Joanie is still in bed, hanging on, Matt has started 
           packing up the personal belongings.

                                 WOMANS VOICE (O.S.)
                        Matt?

           Matt turns toward the door. Its JULIE SPEER. Shes carrying 
           a large vase of flowers.

                                 MATT
                             (taken aback)
                        Oh, hi. Julie.

           Julie has a faint smile on her face, but its clear that she 
           is nervous. She looks over at Joanie. 
                                 JULIE
                        I, uh,...I just thought Id...
                             (then)
                        I brought some flowers.

           Matt snaps to, goes to take the vase from her.

                                 MATT
                        Sorry, let me get those...

                                 JULIE
                        I know we just met, but...

                                 MATT
                        No, I just...didnt expect you. 
                        But, its nice of you to visit.

           Matt goes to set the vase with the other flowers, but the 
           counter is full. He looks for another spot, but theres only 
           one place for them...the floor. He awkwardly sets them in the 
           corner, looking to Julie as if to apologize for the lack of 
           space.

                                 JULIE
                             (off placement of vase)
                        No, thats fine. She seems very 
                        popular.

           Another awkward beat. Julie wonders where to stand.

                                 MATT
                        So, uh...

                                 JULIE
                        I know, Matt.
                             (then)
                        Ive come because my husband 
                        wouldnt.

           Julie again looks over at Joanie.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        I know he was sleeping with her. I 
                        know shes...not well.

                                 MATT
                        Shes dying.

           Julies eyes well up. She turns toward the door.

                                 JULIE
                        I dont know what Im doing here.
           She fumbles with her purse, meandering in a small circle. She 
           doesnt know where or what to do or how to carry herself.

                                 MATT
                        I shouldnt have come to your house 
                        like that. I didnt know he had a 
                        family.

           Julie fans the air in front of her face, trying to control 
           herself.

                                 JULIE
                        The fact that he wouldnt come. It 
                        didnt feel right.

           Julie approaches Joanies bed. Matt moves a little toward 
           her, as if to protect Joanie. Julie looks down at Joanie, who 
           now seems like a ghost of her former self.

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        Shes beautiful.
                             (beat, then)
                        I feel awful, but Im just so 
                        angry. Angry at both of them.

           Julie just stares at Joanie. Its a stark contrast - one 
           woman, healthy and the other, dying. 

                                 JULIE (CONTD)
                        I wanted to come here. I thought I 
                        was doing something noble, but...
                             (then, to Joanie)
                        I forgive you...for trying to take 
                        him. For tearing my family apart.

           Matt grabs Julies hand.

                                 MATT
                        Stop. Dont do that.

           Julie looks right at Matt, a mixture of anger and sadness.

                                 JULIE
                        He didnt love her!

                                 MATT
                        Well, he didnt love you for a 
                        while, either.

           Julie pulls away, walks toward the door.
                                 JULIE
                        I didnt mean to act this way. I 
                        just...love my family, thats all. 
                             (beat)
                        Theyre all I have.

           Julie stands there, looking at Matt, his back to her. His 
           attention is on Joanie, now holding her hand. Beat.

                                 MATT
                        This is my wife. And shes leaving 
                        me.

           Julie steps forward, as if thinking she should hug Matt or 
           something. But,...

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        Go home. Because you can.

           Julie starts to say something, but thinks better of it. She 
           still has her husband. She leaves. The door closes.

           Matt sits on Joanies bed. He touches her face, rubs his palm 
           over her forehead and into her hairline.

           THE SCREEN FLASHES WHITE.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Were back to days before, the moment that Matt leaned down 
           to WHISPER something in Joanies ear. But, this time, we hear 
           it.

                                 MATT
                             (whispering)
                        If you wake up, Ill do things 
                        differently.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRESENT

           Matts eyes well up. Those words mean even more now.

           He collapses over the bed, balling.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. OCEAN - LATER THAT DAY

           Matt and the girls are sitting in a canoe, floating just 
           outside the waves. Although isolated at this moment, the 
           ocean is not without activity. In the distance, sailing 
           boats, motor boats, jet skis, people swimming, etc..

           They sit for a beat, just floating in silence. The small 
           waves SMACK against the side of the canoe, THUMPING.

                                 MATT
                        Should we put them here?

           Alex looks to Scottie, letting her decide. Scottie takes a 
           beat, then nods. She reaches into her backpack, pulling out a 
           canister.

                                 SCOTTIE
                        I never told her a good story. I 
                        should have told her a good story.

           Scottie seems depressed, disappointed in herself. Matt 
           considers, then...

                                 MATT
                        Your mom cried. After that shark 
                        almost got her, she was a mess.

           Scottie and Alex look at Matt.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        I was by the fire that night. The 
                        Mitchells were hiking when I saw 
                        your mom maneuvering over the black 
                        rocks. I knew something was wrong 
                        because it wasnt your mother. She 
                        seemed collapsed, unsure of her 
                        steps. I ran over to her. Her face 
                        was white. There were scratches on 
                        her knees and thighs. Her body was 
                        shaking. And she sank down into the 
                        sand, pulling me with her. And she 
                        just leaned into my chest and 
                        cried. She thought she was going to 
                        die. She was angry that it was her 
                        time. She was scared.
                             (then)
                        Everything I told you about the 
                        shark was true. It pursuing her. 
                        Her escape. Just her reaction was 
                        different. For me, anyway.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        That night around the fire, for the 
                        Mitchells, the bravado was back. I 
                        could have been dinner. But, 
                        thats all it was,...a performance.

           Matt has tears in his eyes, but theyre different this time. 
           They are joyous, as if realizing something that he had 
           forgotten.

                                 MATT (CONTD)
                        And that, Scottie, is what I loved 
                        about your mother. That she shared 
                        that with me. That the truth was 
                        ours. That she was fragile. That 
                        she needed me. That I knew she 
                        needed us.

                                 ALEXANDRA
                        That makes it a better story.

           Scottie and Alex wipe tears from their faces. As does, Matt. 
           Scottie looks down at the canister. A moment, then...

                                 MANS VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! Show us your tits!

           The three of them, undoubtedly startled, look over at...

           A BOOZE CRUISE.

           The boat, filled with drunk GUYS and GIRLS, has drifted over. 
           Loud music pumps. People are dancing, their drinks spilling
           all over the deck. FOUR GUYS are standing at the front of the 
           boat, leaning all over each other for support. And as the 
           boat passes by...

                                 DRUNK GUYS
                        Whoo! Whoo! Show us your tits!

           Matt looks over at the girls. They look at him. Beat. And 
           then,...

           Theyre LAUGHING. How can they not?

                                 SCOTTIE
                             (to canister)
                        Hey, mom? The day we spread your 
                        ashes, you flashed some drunk guys 
                        your boobs.

           And with that, Scottie opens the canister, and tosses the 
           ashes into the sky. Matt and Alex laugh more. 
           Alex places four plumeria leis in the water. The three watch 
           as they float out toward the horizon.

           Scottie looks at her hands, noticing theyre covered in 
           ashes. Her palms, under her nails, grey. She pulls her 
           scrapbook out of her bag, opens it to the back - the last 
           page. She presses her hand onto the paper, making a print. 

           CLOSE ON ash handprint.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BEACH

           We are still CLOSE ON the handprint.

           PULL BACK to reveal Matt, now sitting in a beach chair, 
           looking at Scotties scrapbook.

                                 SCOTTIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Dad!

           Matt looks up, closing the scrapbook.

           MATTS POV of Scottie and Alex, dressed in wet suits and 
           holding surfboards, standing side by side. 

           Matt waves. They wave back, then run out into the ocean. 

           Just then, the DARK FIGURE moves in front of Matt, and...

           JOANIE sits beside him in the sand. She, too, is in a wet 
           suit. Shes beaming, full of life.

                                 JOANIE
                        Okay, I know what youre going to 
                        say. That its dangerous and there 
                        are a thousand other reasons not 
                        to, but...I want to teach the girls 
                        to surf.

           She winces, wondering what Matt will say.

                                 MATT
                        And if I say no?

                                 JOANIE
                             (smiling)
                        Id do it anyway.

           Joanie smiles. They kiss. She gets up and,...
           ...as the DARK FIGURE passes back in front...

                                 JOANIE (O.S.) (CONTD)
                        Dont worry, Ill take care of 
                        them.

           With that, shes gone.

           Matt just looks out at the ocean.

           MATTS POV of the girls surfing, showing off what they had 
           learned.

           Matt smiles, AS WE...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
