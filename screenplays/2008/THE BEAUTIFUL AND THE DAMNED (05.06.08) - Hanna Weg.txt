           LAUGHTER.   The  CRASH  of  WAVES.   WHOOPS  of  DELIGHT.  

                                                                  FADE  IN:

           THE  BLACKNESS  TAKES  SHAPE,  RACKING  BACK  AND  FORTH  INTO  FOCUS:

           A  cliffside,  through  binoculars.  The  gaze  moves  down  the 
           jagged  scape,  as  if  searching.  

           It  stops.  TWO  SMALL  FIGURES  creep  into  view,  clad  in  bathing 
           suits.  They  are  10  or  12  feet  above  the  water,  their  DISTANT 
           VOICES  just  audible  over  the  WIND  and  WATER.   The  Man,  SCOTT 
           FITZGERALD,  26,  pauses,  looks  up:

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda!   This  is  high  enough!

           But  the  Woman,  already  a  body’s  length  ahead,  climbs  on: 
           swift,  effortless,  animal-like:   this  is  ZELDA  FITZGERALD,  24.  

                                 ZELDA
                                  (without  pausing)
                        There is  no  such  thing!

           Scott  cannot  help  but  smile.  After  a  beat,  he  follows  in  her 
           wake,  but  with  a  considerably  healthier  sense  of  caution.

           CLOSE  ON  A  HAND

           As  it  grips  the  rock.  

           CLOSE  ON  A  FOOT

           As  toes  clench  to  get  purchase. 

           CLOSE  ON  A  PAIR  OF  EYES

           Bright  blue,  as  they  squeeze  shut  with  the  strain  of  effort. 

           CLOSE  ON  A  MOUTH

           The  bottom  lip  tucked  beneath  front  teeth  with  concentration. 

           Masculine  or  feminine?   The  line  between  them  here  is  thin. 

                                 GERALD’S  VOICE
                                  (near)
                        Sara,  Dear?   Take  a  look:  should  we  be 
                        alarmed?

           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  CAP  D’ANTIBES  -  AFTERNOON

           SUPER:   FRENCH  RIVIERA,  JUNE  1924

           A  small  GATHERING  of  MEN  and  WOMEN  gaze  toward  the  cliffs.  
           In  the  b.g.,  at  the  water’s  edge,  a  CLUTCH  of  CHILDREN  build 
           a  sand  castle. 
           CONTINUED:

           GERALD  MURPHY,  36,  very  trim  and  slightly  effete,  passes  a 
           pair  of  binoculars  to  his  wife,  SARA,  40ish.   Sarah  raises 
           the  binoculars  to  her  eyes: 

                                 SARA
                        And if we were?   

           Gerald  shrugs:   “You’re  right.  Nothing  to  be  done.”  Sara 
           glances  at  her  watch. 

                                 SARA  (CONT’D)
                        It’s  only  five  o’clock.   Scott  doesn’t 
                        take  his  first  drink  before  six.

                                 GERALD
                        I  was  referring  to her. 

                                 SARA
                        Zelda?   Oh  no.   She’s  been  at  this  for 
                        a week  now.  

           Sara  flashes  Gerald  an  intimate  and  sardonic  grin... 

           The  Murphys  are  the  nucleus  of  this  GROUP  that  is  watching 
           the  progress  of  the  Couple  on  the  cliffs:  young  and 
           glamorous,  bronzed  bodies  lambent  under  the  Mediterranean 
           sun.    

           Among  these  are  faces  we  will  see  again:   CHILDREN,  ages  4-8, 
           the  Murphys  and  their  FRIENDS,  and  a  distinct  GROUP  of  FIVE 
           YOUNG  NAVAL  AVIATORS. 

           For  the  moment,  their  expressions  range  from  aghast  to  awe-
           struck,  along  with  their  AD-LIBBED  COMMENTARY.

           EXT.  CLIFFSIDE  -  SAME

           Zelda  scrambles  from  rock  to  rock,  footing  to  footing,  nimble 
           as  a  cat:  UP  AND  UP  AND  UP.  Her  face  beams  with  the  challenge 
           of it.  

           ON  THE  MAN  -  FROM  ABOVE

           He  has  found  his  rhythm  now,  climbing  to  keep  pace  with  her. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Just  another  few  feet!

           The  Man  pauses,  looks  up  at  her  with  his  bright  blue  eyes:  he 
           is  beautiful.   Fair  haired,  with  a  face  sculpted  as  if  by  the 
           hands  of  gods:  this  is  F.  SCOTT  FITZGERALD,  26.  

           ANOTHER  ANGLE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Zelda  and  Scott  stand  side  by  side  on  a  small  outcropping  of 
           rock  along  the  cliff  face,  30  feet  above  the  water.  

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Oh Goofo!   We  are  going  to  be  so  happy!  
           CONTINUED:

           She  reaches  for  his  hand.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        So  happy  away  from  the  things  that 
                        almost  got  us  but  couldn’t  quite  -- 
                        because  we  were  too  smart  for  them!

           Her  voice  is  raspy,  and  conspires  with  a  slightly  Southern 
           cadence  to  make  her  speech  altogether  enchanting  --  Siren-
           like. 

           CLOSE  ON  THEIR  HANDS

           As  their  fingers  weave  together,  so  tightly  knit  it’s  hard  to 
           say  whose  hand  is  whose... 

           EXT.  CLIFFSIDE  -  ZELDA  &  SCOTT  -  LONG  LENS

           Zelda  gives  him  one  ebullient  glance,  then  faces  the  ocean.

           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  SAME

           The  cluster  of  Friends,  watching. 

           EXT.  CLIFFSIDE  -  SAME

           They  are  in  motion  --  taking  a  synchronous  leap  off  the 
           cliff,  chasing  the  sun  and  the  sea...  Both  flush  with  belief 
           in  the  promise  of  their  own  bright  spark.

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           CLOSE  ON  A  GIRL’S  YOUTHFUL  FACE

           Rising  from  the  depths  of  a  swimming  pool,  it  shatters  the 
           surface  of  the  clear  blue  water,  excessively  buoyant  and 
           spirited:  this  is  Zelda  at  17... 

           The  same  physical  splendor,  the  same  striking  eyes,  lit  from 
           within  by  an  uncanny  blend  of  wisdom,  mischief,  and 
           passionate  detachment. 

           But  there  is  something  else,  something  her  face  at  24  will 
           lose:   innocence.

           CLOSE  ON  THE  RUNGS  OF  A  LADDER

           RISING  with  Zelda’s  hands  and  feet  as  they  take  to  the  rungs 
           like  a  monkey’s  limbs...   Gripping,  releasing,  and  rising 
           with  unflinching  rhythm.

           Higher.   Higher.   Higher  still... 
           INT.  HUNTINGTON  COLLEGE  SWIMMING  POOL  -  DAY

           Zelda  at  17  and  the  only  girl  among  a  crew  of  YOUNG  MEN,  all 
           enamored  of  her.   She  stands  at  the  end  of  a  diving  board, 
           that  is  the  highest  of  three,  at  20  feet.

                                 ZELDA
                        Do  you  dare  me?!

           Up  on  the  high  dive,  she  is  a  sight:  skin  tanned  and  flaw-
           less,  high  cheekbones,  golden  hair,  those  gray-green  eyes.

           Behind  her,  the  wall  is  plastered  with  U.S.  ARMY  RECRUITMENT 
           POSTERS...  YOUNG  MEN  alternately  HECKLE  and  GOAD  her  to  take 
           the  plunge,  among  them  JOHN  SELLERS,  JR.,  athletic, 
           confident,  a  bit  older  than  the  others:

                                 JOHN
                        For  dinner  and  a  movie!

           Zelda  pulls  a  face:  "You've  got  to  be  kidding."

                                 ZELDA
                        For that  --  I  wouldn’t  jump  off  a  curb!

           And  she  begins  to  head  back  toward  the  ladder.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay!   Okay.  How  'bout  an  invitation  to 
                        the  Country  Club  dance?

           Zelda  stops,  turns  on  the  board  and  walks  back  to  the  edge.

                                 ZELDA
                        Next  week  --  ?

                                 JOHN
                        That's  right. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  --  I'm  not  18  til  the  24th  --  They 
                        won't  let  me  in  --

                                 JOHN
                        You  take  that  belly-flop,  and  let  me 
                        worry  'bout  the  technicalities.

           The  other  YOUNG  MEN  give  WHISTLES  and  HOOTS  to  spur  them  on.

                                 ZELDA
                        John-Sellers-Junior  --  since  when  have 
                        you  seen  me  take  a  leap  I  couldn't 
                        manage?

           With  that  she  flies  off  the  board  --  a  winged  creature,  all 
           grace  and  control  --  arcing  toward  the  water,  and  slicing 
           into  it  with  a  noiseless  finish.

                                                                   CUT  TO:
           CLOSE  ON  THE  TIP  OF  A  FOUNTAIN  PEN

           The  handwriting  is  graceful,  educated,  and  feminine.   We 
           FOLLOW  the  nib  of  the  pen: 

                  “I don’t want to live -- I want to love first, and live 
                                     incidentally.”

           EXT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  LATE  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  is  perched  on  the  high  branch  of  a  large  tree  in  the 
           front  yard:  her  back  against  the  trunk,  her  legs  dangling  off 
           to  either  side,  she  resembles  nothing  less  than  a  languid 
           leopard  in  the  afternoon  sun.  

           Her  focus  is  on  a  small  black  diary  propped  against  her 
           knees,  in  which  she  is  writing  feverishly.  

                                 WOMAN  (O.S.)
                        Zelda  Sayre!

           Only  now  does  Zelda  hear  the  voice.  She  turns  to  see  her 
           mother,  MINNIE  SAYRE,  57,  round  and  matronly,  standing  on  the 
           porch.  She  beckons  Zelda  with  an  ivory,  silk  chiffon  dress 
           that  she  is  waving  about  on  a  hanger.  

                                 MINNIE
                        What  about  this?   For  the  dance  next 
                        week?

           Zelda  squints  at  the  dress... 

           INT.  SEWING  ROOM  -  SAYRE  HOME  -  MONTGOMERY  -  EARLY  EVENING

           The  dress  hangs  on  a  mannequin,  and  Zelda  is  at  work  on  it 
           with  a  pair  of  sheers,  cutting  and  snipping  away  with  an 
           intuitive  sense  of  purpose. 

           ON  the  RHYTHMIC  SOUND  of  a  SEWING  MACHINE. 

                                                                   CUT  TO:
           CLOSE  ON  THE  HEAD  OF  A  NEEDLE

           Making  tracks  as  nimble  fingers  push  the  fabric  along.  

           CLOSE  ON  ZELDA

           Her  focus  so  complete,  lost  in  the  creative  zone,  unaware 
           that  she  is  biting  down  hard  on  her  lower  lip  with  her  front 
           teeth. 

                                                                   CUT  TO:
           ZELDA'S  MULTIPLE  REFLECTIONS  -  MORNING

           In  the  mirror,  as  she  models  the  finished  work  for  herself.

           The  once-matronly  dress  has  been  transformed:   the  three-
           quarter  sleeves  are  shorn  to  the  shoulders;  the  buttoned  up 
           collar  drapes  low  and  loose;  the  hem  has  been  raised  to  just 
           above  the  calf;   a  small  slit  on  one  side  stops  above  the 
           knee.  The  piece  has  an  air  of  being  before  its  time.

           Zelda  gives  herself  the  once  over  and  then  launches  into 
           perfectly  executed,  balletic  pirouette. 

           ON  THE  BLURRED  IMAGE  OF  ZELDA:  spinning  like  a  top.

           ON  the  BEAT  as  a  BAND  plays  Eubie  Blake’s  CHARLESTON  RAG.

           INT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  BALL  ROOM  -  SAME

           Zelda  dances  a  fast  fox-trot  with  Sellers,  distinguishing 
           herself  in  sea  of  YOUNG  WOMEN  in  pastel  Organza,  and  YOUNG 
           MEN  in  Black  Tie  or  Officers'  Uniforms. 

           Her  grace  is  unfaltering,  her  smile  radiant,  her  hands  are 
           bare  (other  girls  wear  gloves),  and  her  dress  --  a  Zelda 
           Sayre  Original  --  is  the  only  one  like  it  in  the  room  (more 
           freedom  of  movement).  Together,  the  effect  is  dazzling.

                                 JOHN
                        So  how  many  times  do  I  have  to  ask?

                                 ZELDA
                        If  I  tell  you  that  --  it'll  take  all 
                        the  fun  out  of  it  --

                                 JOHN 
                        Wish  I  could  say  you  were  wrong  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Which  is  exactly  why  I  don't  want  to 
                        marry  in  the  first  place  --

           As  she  says  this,  her  eyes  fix  on  something  across  the  room: 
           it  is  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald,  barely  20,  blond  and  radiant  with 
           fine,  aristocratic  bones.   He  is  staring  right  at  her,  lifts 
           his  glass  of  champagne  to  her.

           Zelda,  unflinching,  stares  back  at  him,  and  cocks  her  head 
           slightly,  with  a  smile.

           Then  John  turns,  so  that  her  gaze  is  swept  to  the  other  side 
           of  the  room.  But  she  is  the  better  dancer,  so  when  she  moves 
           to  turn  again,  John  doesn't  resist  her.

           The  room  moves  past  her  in  a  blur  of  noise  and  color,  then 
           stops:   Scott  comes  into  sharp  focus.   He  smiles  --  and  the 
           room  is  brighter  for  it  --  aware  that  her  maneuver  had  less 
           to  do  with  the  dance  than  with  him.
           CONTINUED:

           John  gazes  down  at  Zelda,  smitten.  But  the  spell  is  broken 
           when  someone  taps  gently  on  John's  shoulder.   John  steps 
           away,  and  in  his  place  steps  Scott.

           ON  ZELDA  &  SCOTT

           We  see  them  now  face  to  face,  luminous:  fair  haired,  with 
           profiles  like  twin  ivory  cameos,  eyes  fixed  on  the  other  and 
           enchanted  by  what  they  see  --  an  infinite  reflection  of 
           themselves.

           The  dynamic  between  them  has  shifted:  he  leads,  NOT  her.   Far 
           from  straining  to  keep  up  with  her,  his  sense  of  movement  and 
           grace  are  equal  to  hers.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT’D)
                        Slow  as  honey  on  a  cold  day.

                                 SCOTT
                        Things  that  move  slow  live  long.  Like 
                        the  tortoise.

                                 ZELDA 
                        That  might  make  us  incompatible.   I'm 
                        most  definitely  a  hare.   And  they  don't 
                        live  long  at  all.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Surely  longer  in  captivity  --

                                 ZELDA 
                        Then  I  wouldn't  call  that  living  --
                                  (beat)
                        Anyway  --  I  don't  think  I'd  want  you  to 
                        see  me  grow  old  and  ugly  --  you'll  be  a 
                        beautiful  old  man  --  all  romantic  and 
                        dreamy  --  and  I'll  be  wrinkled  and  dull 
                        like  your  tortoise...
                                  (beat)
                        I  guess  we'll  just  have  to  die  at 
                        thirty!

           The  statement  alone  is  unsettling;  her  exuberance  even  more 
           so  --  the  way  a  child  wants  to  go  for  a  picnic...

           Scott  LAUGHS  out  loud,  until  he's  interrupted  by  a  tap  on  the 
           shoulder:  John  is  cutting  in:

           Zelda's  body  moves  along  with  Sellars’,  but  her  eyes  are  on 
           Scott...  

           Who  cuts  in  on  John,  much  to  Zelda's  delight.

                                 SCOTT
                        So  are  you  going  to  tell  me  your  name, 
                        or  do  I  have  to  guess?

           His  speech  is  Northern,  clipped  and  polished...
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        I  just  knew  you  weren't  bred  on 
                        biscuits  --

           He  smiles...  She  notices  the  college  ring  on  his  finger.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        A  Princeton  boy...  You  stationed  here 
                        at  Sheridan?

                                 SCOTT
                        Transferred  from  Camp  Gordon  about  four 
                        weeks  ago.

                                 ZELDA 
                        So  you've  been  here  a month...?

           He  nods.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Well.  Then  you  know  exactly  who  I  am  -- 
                        And  if  you  don't,  you  should  go  right 
                        back  to  Princeton  and  demand  a  refund!
                        I mean  if you  were  famous  all  over  the 
                        world,  I'd  know  a  little  something 
                        about  you  too  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Give  me  some  time:  I  may  be  yet... 

           Zelda  raises  her  eyebrows  in  teasing  skepticism.  And  ANOTHER 
           BEAU  --  PERRY  ADAIR,  21,  and  very  college  prep  --  cuts  in.

           ON  ZELDA  &  PERRY:  as  he  takes  her  for  a  very  practiced 
           spin...  Nonetheless,  she  glances  around  the  room;  her  eyes 
           lite  on  Scott...

           ON  ZELDA  &  SCOTT:  he  cuts  in  on  Perry,  gives  her  a  most 
           graceful  turn.

                                 ZELDA
                        And  what  will  you  be  famous  for...?

                                 SCOTT
                        My  novels...

           He's  apparently  serious  --  almost  earnest  --  and  it  catches 
           her  off  guard...  She  gives  him  a  curious  look.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        I  just  finished  one.  My  first.  It's 
                        sitting  on  an  editor's  desk  at 
                        Scribner's  even  as  we  speak...

           Scott  gazes  at  her,  visibly  awestruck... 

                                 ZELDA
                        What?
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCOTT
                        It's  just  --  Well  the  women  I  write... 
                        They're  just  like  you.  Or  you're  like 
                        them...

           This  appeals  to  Zelda.

                                 ZELDA 
                        And  what  am  I  like  exactly...?

                                 SCOTT
                        Smart.   Smarter  than  any  man  who  wants 
                        you.   More  courageous  too.   And  just  a 
                        little  audacious. 

                                 ZELDA 
                        Alright  then.  Does  it  have  a  title?

                                 SCOTT
                        "The  Romantic  Egoist."

           She  lets  out  a  lush,  deep  throated  LAUGH.

           Scott  is  about  to  add  something  when  a  THIRD  BEAU,  PETE 
           BONNER,  19,  steps  in  to  take  his  place.

           ON  ZELDA  &  PETE:  they  spin  away  from  Scott,  who  calls  out 
           after  them:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        My  name  is  Scott!   Francis  Scott  Key 
                        Fitzgerald!

           Zelda,  dancing  with  Pete,  calls  back  over  his  shoulder:

                                 ZELDA
                        I  hardly  need  a  name!  You've  just  told 
                        me  everything  I'll  ever  really  need  to 
                        know  about  you...!

           Bold,  frank,  and  utterly  spontaneous:  her  lines  are  cast.  

           And  Scott,  spellbound  as  she  floats  and  flashes  past  him  on 
           the  dance  floor,  is  hooked  by  every  last  one.

           INT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  SITTING  ROOM  -  DUSK

           Zelda,  CLOTHILDE  (TILDE),  20,  Zelda’s  older  sister,  and 
           Minnie  are  there,  awaiting  their  escorts.  Zelda  is  in  another 
           dress,  more  elaborate  and  sophisticated  than  the  first. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Francis  Scott  Fitzgerald...?

           Minnie  gestures  to  Zelda,  who  is  leaning  back  in  her  chair, 
           to  sit  up  straight.
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                                  (sitting  up)
                        --  It’s  Scott Key  Fitzgerald  --  Related 
                        somehow  to  the  Mr.  Key  who  wrote  the 
                        "Star  Spangled  Banner..."

                                 MINNIE 
                        A  Unionist...

                                 TILDE
                        Mama,  the  song  was  written  in  1814.

                                 MINNIE 
                        Anyway  --  "Fitzgerald"  --  that's 
                        Irish...  He's  Catholic  --

           Zelda,  reflexively,  shifts  in  her  seat  and  crosses  her  legs.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  haven't  any  idea  what  he  is,  and 
                        neither  do  you  --

           Minnie  gestures  for  Zelda  to  un-cross  her  legs...

                                 MINNIE 
                        the  Irish  Catholic  have  Whiskey  for 
                        breakfast,  lunch,  and  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Mama  --  You  haven't  even  met  the  man!

                                 MINNIE
                        Some  things  don't  need  a  meeting  for  --

                                 ZELDA
                        He’s  known  me  a  week  and  he’s  gone  to  
                        all  sorts  of  trouble  to  throw  me  a 
                        party.   And  John  Sellars,  Jr.  ?   The 
                        boy  didn’t  even  recall  my  birthday  --

           A  KNOCK  on  the  door  cuts  short  the  conversation.  Minnie  moves 
           to  answer  it,  and  there  stands  Scott  in  all  his  blond  and 
           lissom  glory,  a  bountiful  bouquet  in  hand.

           Minnie’s  immediate  expression  suggests  even  she  cannot  deny 
           his  nearly  Dionysian  glow.  Zelda  flashes  her  mother  a  look: 
           "I  told  you  so..."

           CLOSE  ON  A  BIRTHDAY  CAKE

           A  thing  frothy  and  ornate,  bedecked  with  18  candles.  In  the 
           b.g.  an  enthusiastic  rendition  of  HAPPY  BIRTHDAY.

           INT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  DINING  ROOM  -  EVENING

           A  long,  banquet  style  table,  swathed  in  linen  and  flowers, 
           and  the  remains  of  a  feast. 
           CONTINUED:

           Eighteen  birthday  candles  are  the  only  light  in  the  room. 

           Zelda  is  at  the  head  of  the  table,  in  front  of  the  cake.   She 
           chews  girlishly  on  her  bottom  lip. 

           Zelda  looks  down  the  table,  laying  eyes  on  the  dozen  MALE 
           ADMIRERS,  their  faces  variously  ripe  with  hope,  expectation, 
           fear,  longing... 

           During  this  Scott  alone,  is  moving  around  the  table,  topping 
           off  people’s  drinks:  a  gentleman.  

           Zelda  watches  him,  as  he  moves  from  guest  to  guest,  then 
           leans  to  the  GIRLFRIEND  next  to  her:  

                                 ZELDA
                                  (under  her  breath)
                        Just  look  at  him...  It’s  like  there’s 
                        some  heavenly  support  beneath  those 
                        shoulder  blades... 
                                  (beat)
                        And  that  smile  like  a  secret:  you  know  -- 
                        that  all  he’d  have  to  do  is  lift  his  feet 
                        and  he’d  be  flying,  but  chooses  to  walk 
                        as  a  concession  to  the  rest  of  us... 

           The  Girlfriend  rolls  her  eyes,  then  smiles...   The  SONG  winds 
           down,  giving  way  to  the  CHANT:  “WISH,  WISH,  WISH.” 

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                        You  better  make  that  wish  before  one  of 
                        those  boys  has  a  set  of  kittens... 

           Zelda  beams,  then  closes  her  eyes,  and  the  room  goes  still.  
           She  leans  into  the  candlelight,  takes  a  deep  breath,  and  on 
           the  sound  of  ZELDA’S  EXHALE...

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           EXT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  LAWN  -  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  hangs  upside  down  from  the  branch  of  a  giant  Sycamore. 
           Scott  is  stretched  out  on  the  grass  just  beneath  her,  reading 
           what  appears  to  be  Zelda’s  little  black  diary... 

           He  rolls  over  now  on  his  back  and  looks  up  at  her.  

                                 SCOTT 
                        You  don’t  like  women  very  much,  do  you?

           Zelda,  still  upsidedown,  shrugs:  “I  don’t  know...”

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        In  this  journal  you've  mentioned  only 
                        two...

                                 ZELDA
                        Now  that  I  think  about  it,  I  suppose 
                        I've  always  been  inclined  toward 
                        masculinity...  It's  such  a  cheery 
                        atmosphere  boys  radiate... 

           She  pulls  herself  up  so  that  she  is  now  seated  on  the  branch.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Though  men  think  I'm  purely  decorative, 
                        and  they're  just  fools  for  not  knowing 
                        better,  and  I  love  being  rather 
                        unfathomable...  Still  --  here  I  am  with 
                        the  brains  to  do  everything  --  well 
                        maybe  not  everything  --  And  yet  the 
                        only  thing  that  people  really  want  from 
                        me  --  what  they  expect  --  is  a  good 
                        marriage...

                                 SCOTT 
                        So  what do  you  want?

                                 ZELDA
                        I  know  what  I don't  want  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (as  if  reading  her 
                                   mind)
                        "To  be  one  of  those  women  who  crawl  on 
                        their  bellies  through  colorless 
                        marriages...  What  grub  worms  they  are!  
                        No...  Mine  --  if  I  marry  --  is  going  to 
                        be  outstanding...  "

           She  swings,  and  releases  herself  from  the  branch,  such  that 
           she's  straddling  Scott  when  she  lands  on  her  feet.

                                 ZELDA
                                  (prompting)
                        “It  can't  be  the  setting...”

                                  (quoting)
                        "It's  going  to  be  the  performance.  The 
                        live,  lovely,  glamorous  performance.”

                                 ZELDA
                        You’ve  read  the  whole  thing?

           She  plops  down  so  that  she  is  now  seated  across  Scott’s 
           torso.

                                 SCOTT
                        Over  and  over...  You  write  just  the  way 
                        you  speak.  And  I  could  listen  to  you 
                        speak  for  the  rest  of  my  life  and  not 
                        be  bored...

           Her  eyes  shine  in  the  high  beam  of  his  praise.

                        Even  gave  me  an  idea  for  a  short  story.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  then  keep  it.   If  it'll  help  you 
                        even  just  a  little  bit.  Take  it  with 
                        you  when  you  ship  out.  I  can  sort  of 
                        keep  you  company  on  the  boat  ride  over. 
                                  (beat)
                        Tell  me  you'll  keep  it...

           Then  much  to  Scott’s  surprise,  Zelda  bends  forward,  planting 
           her  lips  firmly  on  his...  After  a  beat,  he  is  as  engaged  in 
           the  kiss  as  she  is...   

           But  they  are  interrupted  by  the  SOUND  of  MALE  VOICES  in  the 
           b.g.  Zelda  quickly  looks  up  and  waves.

           John,  Pete,  and  a  couple  of  other  YOUNG  MEN,  are  tooling 
           about  in  a  golf  cart...

                                 JOHN
                        Want  to  join  us? 

                                 ZELDA 
                        Not  today!   How  ‘bout  next  week!?

           The  cart-full  of  Young  Men  is  passing  beside  them  now,  as 
           they  head  toward  the  green.

           They  head  off,  and  Zelda  looks  back  down  at  Scott,  ready  to 
           pick  up  where  they  left  off.  But  he  is  not.   He's  sitting  up 
           now,  his  face  suddenly  tight  with  annoyance.

                                 SCOTT
                        I  don’t  believe  it... 

           Zelda  is  thrown  by  the  shift  in  his  manner...  Scott  rises, 
           and  begins  to  walk  down  the  slope  toward  the  road. 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (following)
                        You're  not  going  all  jealous  on  me.
                                  (beat)
                        Oh  good  God  --  I've  known  these  boys 
                        all  my  life!

           Scott  walks  on...  Zelda  yells  after  him:

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Francis  Scott  Fitzgerald!  I've  kissed 
                        thousands  of  boys,  and  I  intend  to  kiss 
                        thousands  more.   But  what  makes  you 
                        think  I'd  stop  loving  you? 

           There  it  is:  she’s  dared  to  say  it  first... And yet -- she is 
           also  unafraid  of  --  even  stirred  by  --  the  harsh  and  naked 
           truth.  And  he's  drawn  to  that  despite  himself.  He  stops  now, 
           and  stares  up  at  her  uncomprehending...  After  a  beat:

                        If  I  were  clever,  I’d  lie  about  it.  But 
                        I’d  rather  be  stupid  than  craven.  I 
                        know  very  well  I’m  self-regarding,  and 
                        a  child-woman  of  the  worst  kind  --  but 
                        I  just  refuse  to  be  a  coward.

           Zelda  watches  as  Scott  takes  this  in.  He  is  falling  in  love 
           despite  himself.  Then  he  turns  to  head  down  the  rest  of  the 
           hill  alone.

                                                              CUT  BACK  TO:

           water’s  edge. 

           UNDERWATER  -  SAME

           Zelda  and  Scott,  fingers  still  entwined,  gaze  at  one  another 
           beneath  the  surface,  in  the  wordless,  twilit  calm... 

           Then  they  swim  for  the  light  above.

           Zelda,  Gerald,  Sara,  and  OTHERS,  now  familiar  from  the  beach, 
           are  milling  about,  nursing  drinks.

           Scott  is  on  a  chair,  CLINKING  his  glass  with  a  fork...  The 
           whole  room  goes  SILENT,  and  turns  to  him... 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (clearing  his  throat)
                        Good  evening  everyone!

                        My  wife  and  I  are  looking  for  something 
                        to  do  this  evening  --  and  being  new  in 
                        town,  I  thought  I  might  impose  upon  you 
                        all  to  suggest  a  pastime  --  something 
                        lively  and  engaging  --

           There  a  few  who  react  with  disdain  for  the  vulgar  way  in 
           which  Scott  interrupted  conversation.   But  by  and  large,  the 
           reactions  range  from  mildly  amused  to  utterly  intrigued... 

           There  is  one  set  who  are  particularly  charmed  by  the  display:  
           a  GROUP  of  FIVE  French  NAVAL  AVIATORS,  in  uniform.  They  too 
           were  on  the  beach  earlier  in  the  afternoon. 

           Scott  scopes  the  room  for  any  takers.  

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                                  (French  accent)
                        I’m  having  maybe  an  idea  -- 

           It’s  ONE  of  the  Aviators,  26,  tall,  athletic,  and  deeply 
           tanned,  he  is  a  French  echo  of  the  boys  in  Montgomery.    His 
           very  bearing  is  confidence  incarnate,  laced  with  a  dash  of 
           European  chivalry  --  altogether,  an  irresistible  brew.  

           We  will  come  to  know  him  as  EDOUARD  JOZAN. 

                                 JOZAN
                        Is  anyone  having  a  deck  of  cards?

           Scott’s  expression  says  he  likes  this  man  --  someone  game... 
           Scott  glances  at  Zelda...  Zelda  shrugs:  “Why  not?”

           ON  the  BEAT  of  BIX  BIEDERBECKE’S “Fidgety Feet.” (2/1924):

           CLOSE  ON  A  PAIR  OF  FEMININE  LIPS

           As  they  near  an  Ace  of  Hearts:  with  a  sharp  inhale,  card  and 
           lips  come  together,  the  one  adhering  to  the  other  through 
           suction.  

           Then  whipping  about,  the  card  is  brought  around  to  a  second 
           pair  of  lips  --  these  masculine  --  which  “sucks”  the  card 
           away  from  the  first  pair... 

           A  SERIES  OF  QUICK  SHOTS

           mouth,  until  Gerald  drops  the  card  and  steps  out  of  the 
           circle.

           INT.  MONTGOMERY  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  COCKTAIL  HOUR

           SUPER:  NOVEMBER  18,  1918

           The  American  Flags,  and  the  wilted  Victory  banners  tell  us 
           that  the  town  has  been  celebrating  since  Armistice  Day.

           Zelda  is  on  the  crowded  dance  floor  with  one  of  her  many 
           Beaux.  He  twirls  her  about,  and  as  he  does  so,  something 
           catches  her  eye  across  the  room.

           Amid  the  CROWD  at  the  bar,  is  an  OFFICER,  medium  height  and 
           build,  with  a  head  of  sleek  blond  hair.  His  face  is  turned 
           away.

           Zelda  continues  to  dance,  but  is  now  distracted,  searching 
           the  sea  of  people...

           The  BLOND  OFFICER,  his  drink  in  hand,  steps  away  from  the 
           bar,  and  is  now  obscured  from  view.  Zelda  stops  dancing, 
           cranes  her  neck  to  catch  sight  of  that  BLOND  HAIR...

                                 PARTNER
                        Zelda?

           She  is  wading  into  the  thicket  of  dancers  to  cross  the  room. 

           Zelda  replies  over  her  shoulder:

                                 ZELDA
                        I'll  only  be  a  minute...

           And  she  disappears  into  the  human  tide.

           ANOTHER  ANGLE  -  ON  ZELDA:  with  mounting  urgency,  she  makes 
           her  way  across  the  room.

           Then  a  glimpse:  that  shock  of  Blond  hair...

           She  darts  to  catch  up  with  it,  zig-zagging  her  way  through 
           the  crush  of  People.  As  she  steps  clear  of  the  Crowd:

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Scott!

           The  Blond  Officer  turns  in  her  direction;  her  face  falls. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                                  (blushing,  flustered)
                        Sorry...  I  thought...  A  different  Scott 
                        is  all... My  Scott...

           She  turns  away  embarrassed,  and  disappointed.  She  takes  one 
           step  and  all  but  collides  with her  Scott...

           And,  in  an  unusual  display  of  vulnerability,  she  lets  out  a 
           spontaneous  YELP  of  DELIGHT,  throws  herself  around  him, 
           buries  her  face  in  his  neck.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                                  (muffled)

           EXT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  -  NIGHT

           Zelda  and  Scott  walk  hand  in  hand  across  the  lawn.

                                 SCOTT
                        Never  even  left  the  continent...  It  was 
                        all  over  before  I  got  my  orders...   So 
                        the  only  wound  I've  got  to  show  for  my 
                        trouble  is  the  one  to  my  ego...

           Zelda's  unclear:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        They  rejected  the  novel...  They  said:
                        "The  story  does  not  culminate  in 
                        anything  as  it  must  to  justify  the 
                        readers'  interest."

           He  removes  a  small  flask  from  the  pocket  on  the  inside  of  his 
           jacket.   He  offers  it  to  Zelda.

                                 ZELDA
                        They're  scared...

           She  says  this  without  a  trace  of  irony;  and  Scott  adores  her 
           for  it...  She  takes  a  swig  from  the  flask,  and  hands  it  back.  
           He  takes  a  longer  draught...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        People  are  scared  of  things  they  can’t 
                        understand.

           Scott  is  less  buoyant  than  we've  seen  him.   There's  a  trace 
           of  fear  and  vulnerability  that's  showing  itself  here.

                                 SCOTT
                        I'm  thinking  about  writing  for  a 
                        newspaper  --  I  could  do  that  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh  no  --  you  can't!  I  mean  I'm  sure  you 
                           can,  but  --  You  can't  give  up!
           CONTINUED:

           The  urgency  in  her  voice  is  laced  with  self-interest:   he  has 
           to  succeed  to  fulfill  her  dreams...

                                 SCOTT
                        Or  maybe  advertising  --

                                 ZELDA 
                        What  happened  to  the  man  who  was  going 
                        to  write  the  Great  American  Novel  --  ?

                                 SCOTT
                                  (sheepish)
                        Chastened  a  bit.  Maybe  even  humbled.

                                 ZELDA
                        Say  that  again,  and  keep  a  straight 
                        face.

           Scott  laughs  despite  himself.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        You're  not  a  coward  Scott...  You  just 
                        can't  be  a  coward...

           After  a  beat,  he  nods...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Alright  then...  Now  come  with  me...

           EXT.  MADAM  HELEN  ST.  CLAIR'S  -  NIGHT

           Zelda  climbs  the  iron  ladder  on  the  back  wall  of  the  building 
           like  she  was  born  to  it.   She  beckons  Scott  to  follow.

                                 SCOTT
                        What  are  we  --  !?

           Zelda  HUSHES  him,  gestures  to  the  ladder.   He  obliges,  but  is 
           less  agile  than  she...

           EXT.  ROOFTOP  -  SAME

           Zelda  lies  down  flat,  and  peers  over  the  edge.  Scott  joins 
           her.   Below,  MEN  enter  and  exit  the  establishment.

                                 SCOTT
                                  (musing)
                        We're  on  the  roof  of  a  whore  house  --
                                  (to  Zelda)
                        Do  you  care  to  tell  me  what  we're  doing 
                        on  the  roof  of  a  whore  house?

                                 ZELDA
                        "Beckoning  the  Muse..."

           He  marvels  at  her  as  she  retrieves  a  flashlight  from  what  is 
           clearly  a  cache  of  items  from  previous  outings.  Then  she  
           turns  the  "high  beam"  on  the  in-  and  out-going  CLIENTELE...
           CONTINUED:

           Immediately  the  MEN  scatter  in  a  panic,  YELLING  EXPLETIVES  in 
           the  general  direction  of  the  roof...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Lizzy  Calhoun's  daddy.  He's  a  lawyer... 
                        Mrs.  Calhoun  runs  the  Country  Club 
                        Charity  Drive...  Oh  --   And  there's  her 
                        little  brother!

                                 SCOTT
                        Marry  me  Zelda...

                                 ZELDA 
                        You  don't  mean  that  --  There's  my  high 
                        school  civics  teacher!

                                 SCOTT
                        Then  call  my  bluff  --

           Zelda  looks  at  him  now...

                                 MADAM  ST.  HELEN  (O.S.)
                        Ten  seconds,  or  I'll  send  up  my  boys  to 
                        throw  you  down!

           Zelda  and  Scott  look  down  to  see  MADAM  ST.  HELEN,  55,  and  a 
           faded,  porcine  beauty  caked  in  make  up.

           Zelda  cuts  the  flash  light,  and  tosses  it  into  the  corner, 
           then  scrambles  down  the  back  of  the  building,  with  Scott  just 
           behind  her.

           ON  THE  GROUND

           They  take  off  at  a  run...

           EXT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  GOLF  COURSE  -  A  BIT  LATER

           The  lawn  shimmers,  undulant  and  steely  blue  beneath  the  full 
           moon.   The  air  is  thick  with  the  scent  of  Magnolias,  and  the 
           last  of  summer.  And  they  are  alone.

           They  catch  their  breath,  slowing  from  a  jog  to  a  walk... 
           Scott  is  more  winded  than  Zelda...

                                 ZELDA
                        I  could  say  "Yes"  --  but  it's  more 
                        complicated  than  that  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Very  simple:  one  syllable  -- 

           Scott  leans  against  the  trunk  of  a  lone  Magnolia  tree,  the 
           moonlight  bouncing  off  its  large  waxy  leaves.

                                 ZELDA
                        How  will  you  earn  a  living  --  ?
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        So  you  don't  believe  in  my  work  --

                                 ZELDA
                        The  question  is  do  you  --  ?

                                 SCOTT
                        I  can  make  money  if  that's  what  you 
                        want  --

                                 ZELDA
                        It's not  what  I  want  --  All  the 
                        material  things  are  nothing.   I'd  just 
                        hate  to  live  a  sordid  existence  because 
                        you'd  soon  love  me  less  and  less  --

           Scott  makes  no  denial.

                                 SCOTT 
                        I'll  go  to  New  York.   I'll  get  a  job  as 
                        a  journalist.   And  --

                                 ZELDA
                                  (a  finger  on  his  lips)
                        You'll  stop  talking...  And  then  you'll 
                        kiss  me...

           Zelda  faces  him,  just  a  foot  away.

                                 SCOTT
                        You  are  one  shameless  Thoroughbred.

                                 ZELDA
                        And  Goofo  --  you  wouldn't  like  me  if  I 
                        were  anything  less.

                                 SCOTT
                        "Goofo -- ?"

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  you  are,  just  a  bit,  of  a  goof  I 
                        mean.   Beneath  all  that  Italian 
                        Herringbone  and  those  cap-toed  Oxfords.  
                        Which  is  not  to  say  you  don't  take  a 
                        certain  pleasure  in  making  trouble.   I 
                        know  an  exhibitionist  when  I  see  one  --

                                 SCOTT
                        It  takes  one  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Which  is  exactly  why  I  know  just  how 
                        different  we  are:  you  put  on  a  show 
                        because  you  want  to  be  admired  --

                                 SCOTT
                        And  you  --  ?
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        --  Because  I  don't  give  a  damn  what 
                        people  think.

           He  gives  her  a  long  look,  then  nods  just  enough  to  let  her 
           know  that  he  knows  she's  right.  Then  he  kisses  her...  And  she 
           returns  it  in  kind.

           There  is  an  awkward  hunger  in  the  way  these  two  come 
           together:  if  he's  more  experienced  than  she,  it’s  not  by 
           much.  He  pauses  now,  pulls  back:

                                 SCOTT
                        Right  now?   Here  --  on  the  grass?

           There's  trepidation  in  his  voice,  as  if  he  might  be  put  off 
           by  the  idea  of  having  sex  on  the  ground...

                                 ZELDA 
                        It  beats  some  downtown  motel  with  a 
                        concierge  who  won't  think  twice  about 
                        taking  a  tip  from  the  local  gossip 
                        columnist.  Think  of  how  much  nicer 
                        it'll  be  to  remember  the  grass  and  the 
                        moonlight  tripping  over  your  sweet 
                        face.

                                 SCOTT
                        And  yours...

           And  she  kisses  him  again,  drawing  him  in.   His  hands  fumble 
           with  the  buttons  of  her  linen  jacket.   Her  hands  work  along 
           with  his  at  the  buttons  of  the  back  of  her  skirt.

           Her  jacket  and  skirt  fall  to  the  ground  revealing  the  silken 
           half-slip  and  garter-held  stockings  beneath...

           Now  she  poses  her  leg,  dancer  like,  around  his;  his  hands 
           work  up  the  inside  of  her  slip.  Then  he  crouches  to  lift  her, 
           and  cradling  her,  he  lays  her  gently  down  on  the  grass.

           There  is  an  authenticity  to  the  way  they  grope  and  grab  at 
           one  another,  and  in  that  late  summer  grass,  try  to  disappear 
           into  one  another...

           EXT.  COUNTRY  CLUB  GOLF  COURSE  -  LATER

           Zelda  and  Scott,  happily  spent,  lie  head  to  head,  staring  up 
           at  the  sky.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  feel  like  you  had  me  ordered  --  and  I 
                        was  delivered  to  you  --  to  be  worn.  I 
                        want  you  to  wear  me  like  a  watch  charm, 
                        or  a  button  hole  bouquet  --  to  the 
                        world.   And  then,  when  we're  alone,  I 
                        want  to  help  --  to  know  that  you  can't 
                        do  anything  without  me.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        As  soon  as  I  get  to  New  York,  I'll 
                        start  looking  for  a  place...

                                 ZELDA 
                        I  wish  New  York  were  a  little  tiny 
                        town,  so  I  could  imagine  how  it'll  be. 
                        I  haven't  the  remotest  idea...

                                 SCOTT
                        New  York  is...  Unfathomable.   A  little 
                        like  you.  

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  then  we  might  just  get  along.  And 
                        I'll  find  something  to  do.  I  can  dance.  
                        I  always  feel  so  self-reliant  when  I'm 
                        dancing.  

           She  rolls  over  on  her  stomach  now,  looking  down  at  Scott.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Or  even  better:  you’ll  create  the 
                        version  of  me  that  is  everything  I 
                        couldn't  possibly  be...  That's  what 
                        I'll  do  with  myself:  I'll  be  your 
                        fictional  girl...

           And  as  if  she's  just  said  the  magic  words,  Scott  reaches  into 
           his  pocket,  and  produces  a  small  box.

                                 SCOTT
                        Maybe  you'd  be  my  real  girl  too?

           He  offers  her  the  box.  Zelda  opens  it  to  reveal  a  beautiful, 
           "antique"  engagement  ring.   And  the  sight  of  it  unravels  all 
           that  bravado;  her  mask  falls,  her  eyes  brim  wet.

           Scott  takes  some  small  satisfaction  in  seeing  this.  He 
           removes  the  ring  from  the  box.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        May  I?

           And  Zelda  extends  the  ring  finger  of  her  left  hand,  tucks  her 
           bottom  lip  beneath  her  teeth,  and  bites  down  hard.

           EXT.  MANHATTAN  STREET  -  MORNING  -  ESTABLISHING

           The  soft,  undulant  shapes  and  colors  of  the  South  give  way  to 
           straight  lines,  shades  of  gray,  and  bustling  streets. 

           In  the  biting  cold,  Scott  huddles  into  his  coat  as  he  walks 
           down  the  street.  His  face  is  ashen,  his  eyes  bleary  from  lack 
           of  sleep.  He  comes  to  a  high  rise:  CONSOLIDATED  STREET 
           RAILWAY  ADVERTISING  CO.;  he  jerks  open  the  door,  and  heads 
           inside.
           INT.  PRINCETON/YALE  CLUB  -  BAR/LOUNGE  -  EARLY  EVENING

           Leather  club  chairs,  dark  wood,  crystal  glasses,  no  women... 
           This  is  Scott’s  world.  

           He  is  there  with EIGHT  YOUNG  MEN  whose  faces  we  will  come  to 
           know  well:  LUDLOW  FOWLER,  LAWTON  CAMPBELL,  a  Younger  John 
           Peal  Bishop  ("BISHOP"  -  future  editor  of  Vanity  Fair)  EDMOND 
           ("BUNNY")  WILSON  future  literary  critic),   ALEX  MCKAIG,  JOHN 
           BIGGS  ("BIGGS"  -  future  attorney),  STEPHEN  (PEEVIE)  PARROT, 
           and  PORTER  GILLESPIE.   

           They  are  well  past  merry  and  on  their  way  to  seeing  double. 
           Nonetheless,  between  slurs,  Scott  manages  to  read  to  them 
           from  what  we  now  recognize  as  Zelda's  journal...

                                 SCOTT
                        "I  think  I  like  breathing  twilit 
                        gardens  and  moths  more  than  beautiful 
                        pictures  or  good  books  --  "

           He  looks  up  at  his  friends,  as  drunk  with  love  as  with 
           whiskey... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Is  that  not  the  most  --  the  most 
                        lyrical  voice  you've  ever  heard?

           His  friends  look  back  at  him,  baffled  at  best. 

                                 PEEVIE
                                  (venturing)
                        Well.  It's  a  very  human  document.  But  --
                        I  don't  altogether  understand  it.

           Scott  looks  to  the  others:  Don’t  they get it?   They don’t.  
           These  are  men  for  whom  a  woman  like  Zelda  is  utterly  opaque. 

                                 SCOTT 
                        The  lot  of  you  --  So  educated  you 
                        wouldn't  know  an  authentic  feeling  if 
                        it  sat  on  your  face  --

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           EXT.  COUNTRY  ROAD  -  DAY

           Perry  Adair  is  at  the  wheel  of  a  convertible  roadster;  Zelda 
           is  in  the  seat  next  to  him,  her  bare  feet  propped  on  the 
           dashboard.  Another  COUPLE  is  tucked  in  the  back.  

           And  the  four  of  them  are  SINGING  at  the  tops  of  their  lungs.  

           CLOSE  ON  A  REJECTION  LETTER

           "Dear,  Mr.  Fitzgerald,  we  regret  to  inform  you  that  we  cannot 
           publish  your  submission  at  this  time..."
           CONTINUED:

           The  CAMERA  MOVES  ALONG  to  reveal  another  letter  of  rejection, 
           and  yet  another.

           INT.  SCOTT'S  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

           Small,  but  well  appointed.   Scott  takes  a  swig  from  his 
           flask,  then  posts  one  more  rejection  letter  on  a  wall 
           plastered  with  them. 

           INT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  MORNING

           Zelda  shuffles  in,  a  little  worse  for  wear.   Her  Father  is 
           just  leaving  to  go  to  work.   He  tosses  the  local  paper  across 
           the  table  in  her  direction  without  a  word.   Zelda  glances  at 
           the  headline:

           "PRETTY  MONTGOMERY  GIRL  CREATES  STIR  AMONG  ATLANTA  YOUTHS"

           Zelda  MOANS  with  annoyance...

                                 MINNIE
                        Don't  look  here  for  sympathy.  Coming 
                        home  last  night  wearing  Perry  Adair's 
                        pin  --

                                 ZELDA
                        I  assure  you,  Mamma,  I  did  not 
                        appreciate  that  fact  until  I  woke  up 
                        this  morning  -- 

                                 MINNIE
                        Who  knows  --  you  might  be  better  off 
                        with  Perry  than  with  Scott...

           Zelda  fidgets  slightly,  her  thumb  absently  reaching  for  her 
           ring  finger,  from  which  her  engagement  ring  is  notably  absent.

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott  is  sweet.

           Judge  Sayre  peers  in  as  he  puts  on  his  coat  to  leave.

                                 JUDGE  SAYRE
                        He's  never  sober.

                                 MINNIE
                        If  your  sisters  had  it  their  way  --

                                 ZELDA
                        I  know  very  well  what  way  they'd  have 
                        it  --  but  it's  not  their  life  to  have 
                        --  is  it?

           Zelda  slips  a  piece  of  stationary  from  her  robe  pocket.

                        Anyway,  I’ve  already  written  Perry  a 
                        note  telling  him  I  can’t  accept  the 
                        pin.   But  I’m  out  of  envelopes...  If 
                        you  have  one  to  spare,  I’ll  put  it  in 
                        the  post  this  afternoon. 

           INT.  PRINCETON/YALE  CLUB  -  LOUNGE

           Scott  is  on  the  window  ledge,  swigging  from  a  flask  in  one 
           hand,  and  reading  from  a  letter  in  the  other.  Biggs,  Peevie, 
           Ludlow,  and  Porter  are  there,  but  unmoved.

                                 SCOTT

                        Perry.   Very  fairy.  Dingle-berry.

                        "The dance was most everything you 
                           promised it would be and then some, and 
                           not one square inch of myself regrets

                        Nothing!   The  letter  wasn't  meant  for

           EXT.  NEW  YORK  CITY  STREET  -  DAWN

           Scott,  in  the  suit  he  was  wearing  the  night  before,  shirt 
           untucked,  his  tie  long  gone,  rolls  empty  champagne  bottles 
           down  the  empty  avenue  with  Ludlow.

                                 LUDLOW
                        So  what  now?

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh  Luddie  --  I  know  what  people  say 
                        about  her.   And  I  don’t  care.

                        I’m  in  love  with  her  courage,  her 
                        sincerity,  and  her  flaming  self 
                        respect.   I  love  her  and  that's  the 
                        beginning  and  end  of  everything.  I 
                        guess  there  was  a  moment  when  I  was 
                        still  a  Catholic  --  and  there  was 
                        meaning  in  that.  But  now?   Zelda's  the 
                        only  God  I  have  left.

                        Without  her  I'll  never  write  a  thing 
                        worth  the  paper  it's  printed  on.

           Ludlow  is  sympathetic,  but  skeptical.

                                 LUDLOW
                        She’s  a  whirlwind,  Scott.  And 
                        whirlwinds  can  become  hurricanes... 

                                 SCOTT
                        So  maybe  she’ll  wreck  me.  Is  it 
                        possible  to  be  more  wrecked  than  I  am 
                        now?   I'm  a  failure:  mediocre  at 
                        advertising,  unable  to  get  started  as  a 
                        writer,  and  losing  my  girl  all  at  once.

           EXT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  MONTGOMERY  -  AFTERNOON

           Scott  walks  up  the  steps  to  the  porch. 

           He’s  dressed  as  he  was  when  we  last  saw  him  --  though  more 
           rumpled  and  sweat  stained  for  the  journey.  His  eyes  are  red 
           from  lack  of  sleep,  his  face  unshaven.

           He  approaches  the  front  door,  makes  a  few  half-hearted 
           gestures  at  tidying  himself  up  --  then  gives  up.   Every 
           gesture  is  ripe  with  desperation...

           He  KNOCKS.  Zelda  answers:  the  short  GASP  suggests  just  how 
           unsettled  she  is  by  the  sight  of  him  in  such  a  state.

           Zelda  and  Scott  are  in  the  thick  of  it.

                        I  was  losing  my  mind!  I  couldn't  think,

                        Scott  don't  be  silly!   You're  the  only

                        Why  does  that  feel  so  much  like  "I'll 
                        never  love  you  enough..."

                                 ZELDA
                        We  just  can't  get  married...

                                 SCOTT 
                        Why  not?

                                 ZELDA
                        So  we  can  live  in  some  squalid  little 
                        one  room  apartment  and  be  miserable 
                        together  --  ?

           The  detachment  is  giving  way  to  sadness...  Her  eyes  tear  up, 
           but  these  are  tears  of  loss,  not  desperation.

                                 SCOTT
                        We'll  make  a  start  of  it...

                        dreams  fade  away  in  some  washed  out 
                        version  of  a  life...

                        I  can't,  Scott.  I  can't  be  shut  away 
                        from  the  trees  and  the  flowers,  and  the 
                        water  --  cooped  up  in  a  little  flat, 
                        waiting  for  you  to  come  home  from  a  job 
                        you  can't  stand.   You'd  hate  me  in  a 
                        narrow  atmosphere.   I'd  make  you  hate 
                        me.

                        You  love  me  Zelda...

                        Which  is  why  I  can't  marry  you  and  turn 
                        us  both  into  hateful  creatures.

           Scott  reels  from  the  blow...  Then: 

                                 SCOTT
                        You  don’t  believe  I  can  do  it,  do 
                        you...

           Without  another  word,  Zelda  removes  the  engagement  ring  from 
           her  finger,  and  offers  it  up  to  Scott.

           Scott's  tear-stained  face  goes  slack,  as  if  her  gesture  has 
           just  snapped  the  string  that  was  keeping  him  together...   He 
           begins  to  shiver  --  but  not  from  cold...  From  anguish.  
           Expressionless,  and  quaking,  at  last  he  takes  the  ring.

                                 ZELDA
                        You  should  go  now...

           By  contrast  her  tears  have  a  serenity  to  them  --  the  calm  of 
           acceptance...  Saying  nothing  more,  Scott  backs  out  the  door, 
           and  then  he's  gone.

                                 ZELDA  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        Like  this:  just  let  the  sand  flow.

                                                              CUT  BACK  TO:

           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  CAP  D’ANTIBES  -  DAY  -  1924

           Zelda,  Scottie,  and  two  other  CHILDREN,  are  ensconced  in 
           building  an  elaborate  drip  castle.   It  is  a  work  of  art:  with 
           turrets,  towers,  a  moat,  etc... 

           Zelda  works  with  the  sand  like  an  artist:  utterly  absorbed, 
           complete  unto  herself  --  not  unlike  the  Children  around  her.

           EXT.  MEDITERRANEAN  SEA  -  DAY

           Zelda  swims  Off  the  shore:  a  strong,  steady  stroke,  all  alone 
           in  the  vast  blue.   She  rolls  on  her  back,  and  floating  looks 
           skyward:  

           A  bi-plane  performs  stunts  high  up  in  the  air... 

           Her  small  figure  waves  up  at  the  plane,  then  turns  over 
           again,  and  swims  on... 

                                 ZELDA  (V.O.)
                                  (repeating)
                        Un  boisson:  a  drink.   Je  voudrais  un 
                        boisson  s’il  vous  plait... 

           EXT.  TERRACE  OF  CAFE  DE  LA  FLOTTE  -  AFTERNOON

           Zelda,  damp  from  a  swim,  nurses  a  Cinzano,  while  studying  her 
           French  book.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                                  (French  accent)
                        It  is  my  experience  that  to  learn  a 
                        language  --  it  is  easier  to  be  speaking 
                        it  than  reading  it  -- 

           Zelda  looks  up  and  is  pleased  to  see  that  it  is  Jozan.

           EXT.  TERRACE  OF  CAFE  DE  LA  FLOTTE  -  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  is  with  Jozan  and  the  Aviators.  Jozan  is  seated  next  to 
           her,  doting  on  her  visibly.   She  has  a  cigarette,  and  looks 
           for  a  set  of  matches.   Jozan  reaches  for  his  lighter,  and 
           Zelda  is  about  to  lean  in  --  then  stops:

                                 ZELDA
                        Wait,  wait... 

           He  cuts  the  flame.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        How  do  you  say:  “Can  you  give  me  a 
                        light?”

                                 JOZAN
                        Est-ce  que  tu  peux  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Ess-kuh  chtew  puh  -- 

                                 JOZAN
                        This  is  perfect!   Okay  now:  Est-ce  que 
                        tu  peux  m’allumer? 

           And  this  gets  a  LAUGH  from  his  compatriots,  to  whom  he  shoots 
           an  admonishing  look. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Why  are  they  laughing...?

                                 JOZAN
                        This  is  nothing.   Ignore  them  --  They 
                        are  being  children... 

                                 ZELDA
                        You’re  teaching  me  something  just  a 
                        little  bit  wicked,  aren’t  you  --

                                 JOZAN
                                  (conceding)
                        “Est-ce  que  tu  peux  m’allumer?”  is  just 
                        one  of  the  many  ways  we  have  to  say 
                        “Will  you  light  me  up?”  --  and  we  are 
                        not  referring  in  this  case  to  your 
                        cigarette.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  now  -- that’s what  I call 
                        motivation.

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           EXT.  CHARLES  SCRIBNER'S  SONS  PUBLISHING  -  NEW  YORK  -  DAY  (1918)

           Scott  is  shaved  and  suited,  with  tie  &  hat  --  but  nonetheless 
           cloaked  in  despair.   He  enters  the  building.

           INT.  PERKINS'  OFFICE  -  SAME

           Scott  is  seated.  MAX  PERKINS,  mid  30’s,  and  handsome,  stands 
           behind  his  desk,  looking  over  Scott's  manuscript.

                                 PERKINS
                        I'm  dealing  with  a  very  traditional 
                        group  of  gentlemen  --  This  isn't  the 
                        first  time  --  or  last  --  that  we 
                        haven't  seen  eye  to  eye.   This  is 
                        however  the  first  time  I'm  going  to 
                        push  back.

           For  just  a  flash,  Scott's  face  brightens.

                                 PERKINS  (CONT'D)
                        It  was  there,  in  your  very  first  draft  -
                        -  more  originality  and  voice  than  I've 
                        ever  seen.   And  this  draft  is  stronger 
                        still.  But  I  had  a  thought:  do  you 
                        think  you  could  re-write  the  whole 
                        piece  in  the  third  person?

           Scott  considers  this  a  moment,  then  slowly,  nods:

                                 SCOTT
                        I  suppose.  I  don't  see  why  not.

                                 PERKINS
                        Somehow  I  think  it  will  make  the 
                        material  more  accessible  to  them 
                        without  compromising  your  literary 
                        intentions...

           Scott  nods  more  emphatically  now,  as  he  thinks  it  through.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes...  I  see  that.   And  I  have  some  new 
                        material  now  which  might  flesh  out  the 
                        relationships  between  the  characters  -- 

           Perkins’  face  lights  up  with  a  generous  smile.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        I'll  do  it...
           CONTINUED:

                                 PERKINS
                        I  am  honestly  grateful  to  you  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh  please,  Mr.  Perkins  --

                                 PERKINS
                        It's  true:  I’m  grateful  for  not 
                        giving  up  on  them  --  us  -- 
                        conservative  as  we  are.

                                 SCOTT 
                        The  gratitude  befits  me  more  -- 

           Scott  rises  from  his  chair,  suddenly  hopeful  again. 

                                 PERKINS
                        And  Scott...  Please  call  me  Max.  

           INT.  SCOTT’S  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

           Scott  is  at  work  in  front  of  the  wall  where  the  rejection 
           letters  used  to  be.   Now,  the  wall  is  papered  with  a  frenzy 
           of  chapter  headings,  outlines,  and  narrative  "graphs.   On  his 
           desk:  a  carafe  of  water  and  a  half-eaten  sandwich.  Nothing 
           more. 

           A  SERIES  OF  CUTS  as  Scott  alternately  pastes,  removes,  and 
           rearranges  bits  of  paper  on  the  wall.

           The  CUTS  are  fast,  so  as  to  the  give  the  impression  of  a man 
           in  a  manic  state,  engaged  in  the  process  of  writing  as  if  it 
           were  a  contact  sport.

           CLOSE  ON  TYPED  LETTERS

                  "T-H-E-R-E   W-A-S   N-O   G-O-D   I-N   H-I-S   H-E-A-R-T   H-E

                                       K-N-E-W--  "

           He  slips  the  pen  from  behind  his  ear,  goes  to  the  desk,  and 
           jots  something  down  on  the  paper  in  his  hand.

                                 SCOTT 
                                  (creating  it  as  he 
                                   goes)
                           The faint stirring of old ambitions and 
                           -- and unrealized dreams.  But -- oh, 
                           Rosalind! -- Rosalind!...

           He  looks  it  over,  then  barely  audible,  involuntary:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Zelda...
           EXT.  SCOTT’S  APARTMENT  BLDG  -  NEW  YORK  -  MORNING

           Scott,  on  his  way  out,  holds  the  door  open  for  the  POSTMAN, 
           who  hands  him  his  mail.  The  Postman  heads  in,  and  Scott 
           rifles  through  his  mail  as  he  steps  out  to  the  sidewalk.  Then 
           he  stops  walking:  it’s  an  envelope  from  Scribner’s...

           ON  SCOTT:  thrilled  beyond  words.

           INT.  NY  POST  OFFICE  -  LONG  DISTANCE  PHONE  ROOM  -  NIGHT

           Scott  is  in  one  of  the  booths,  exhuberent,  yelling  into  the 
           phone:

                                 SCOTT
                        I  didn't  mean  to  interrupt  your  dinner, 
                        Sir...  But  if  Zelda's  there...  I'd 
                        rather  speak  to  her  now  if  she's... 
                        Tell  her  it's  important...  Please... 

           But  the  line  has  gone  dead.  Scott  heads  for  the  exit. 

           EXT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  MONTGOMERY  -  DAY

           Scott  is  standing  at  the  door  as  Minnie  answers.  

                                 MINNIE
                        Scott...

                                 SCOTT
                        Mrs.  Sayre...  I  have  to  see  Zelda  --

                                 MINNIE
                        Well  --  I  don’t  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        With  all  due  respect:  I’m  not  asking.

           After  a  beat,  Minnie  steps  aside  to  let  him  in.  

           INT.  SAYRE  HOME  -  HALLWAY/STAIRS  -  DAY

           He  makes  his  way  up  the  stairs,  and  down  the  hall  to  the  door 
           of  her  room.

           He  pauses  a  moment,  gets  his  bearings:  he's  a  long  way  from 
           the  broken  creature  he  was  the  last  time  he  made  an 
           appearance,  and  he  knows  it.

           He  KNOCKS  lightly,  and  the  door  gives  way.   He  peers  in.

           Zelda  is  on  the  bed,  half-way  through  his  manuscript,  tears 
           in  her  eyes.   He  enters;  she  looks  up  as  if  out  of  a  revery:

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott...!
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        I'll  come  back  later  --  so  you  can 
                        finish  --

                                 ZELDA 
                        This  is  my  fourth  time  through...!  The 
                        book  is  just  so  fine...  And  I  am 
                        miserably,  and...  And  completely  and  -- 
                        a  little  unexpectedly  --  I  am  yours...

           Scott  is  beside  himself...  Unable  to  find  his  tongue  until  he 
           manages  the  only  thing  that  comes  to  mind.

                                 SCOTT
                        So  you  liked  it?

                                 ZELDA 
                        I'm  a  good  long  way  past  "like"  --  I 
                        mean  --  Rosalind:  she's  altogether  me!

                                 SCOTT
                        You  don't  mind  --  ?

                                 ZELDA
                        Mind   ?

                                 SCOTT
                        I  used  your  diary  --  and  a  few  of  your 
                        letters  too  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo,  I'm  so  proud  of  you...  You 
                        really  can  do  things  --  anything  --  And 
                        I  love  to  feel  that  maybe  I  can  help 
                        just  a  little...

           He  pulls  a  box  from  inside  his  jacket  pocket  and  sets  it  on 
           the  bed.  Zelda  looks  at  it,  curious.

                                 SCOTT 
                        Just  a  token...

           Zelda  picks  up  the  box,  undoes  the  ribbon  and  opens  it:   a 
           delicate  platinum,  diamond  studded  watch,  on  a  black  silk 
           cord.  The  back  of  the  watch  is  engraved:

                                 ZELDA
                                  (under  her  breath)
                        “From Scott to Zelda -- “

                        My  God  Scott  --  We  can't  keep  this   -- 
                        we'll  need  the  money  --

                        I  sold  a  story  to  the  Saturday  Evening

                        the  Metro  Company.

           With  a  GASP  she  launches  into  a  girlish  twirl  of  celebration.

                        Let’s  have  a  big  wedding!  I  want  to 
                        tell  the  world!  
                                  (breathless, 
                                   rambling)
                        Oh...  And  can  we  make  sure  we  get  a 
                        place  with  a  bathtub  --  a  big  one  -- 
                        since  I'll  need  to  swim  around  in 
                        something  or  I  just  won't  be  happy...

           EXT.  ST.  PATRICK'S  CATHEDRAL  -  DAY

           SUPER:  APRIL  2,  1921

           The  wedding  party  is  just  exiting  the  church:  Zelda,  Scott, 
           Ludlow  Fowler  as  Best  Man,  Marjorie  &  her  husband,  MINOR 
           BRINSON,  ROSALIND  SAYRE,  30,  Zelda's  Middle  Sister  &  her 
           husband,  NEWMAN  SMITH,  and  an  officiating  PRIEST,  60.   And 
           that’s  it...  No  one  else... 

           Tilde  and  her  husband,  JOHN  PALMER  are  arguing  with  Zelda. 

                                 TILDE 
                        It’s  bad  enough  Mama  and  Daddy  aren’t 
                        here  --  but  he  couldn't  wait  ten 
                        minutes  so  at  least I  could  see  my 
                        little  sister  get  married...  ?

                                 ZELDA
                        He  gets  impatient  -- 

           There  is  something  forced  in  Zelda's  attempt  at  levity  here. 
           Something  almost  sad.

                                 ROSALIND
                        Tilde  honey,  you  didn't  miss  much  --

           Zelda  flashes  a  look  at  Rosalind.

                                 ROSALIND  (CONT'D)
                        What  I  mean  is  that  it  was  nearly  a 
                        civil  ceremony  --  nothing  elaborate.  
                        I'm  sure  the  luncheon  --

           Zelda's  face  wrinkles  at  the  mention  of  a  luncheon...  She 
           looks  to  Scott.   Rosalind  eyes  the  exchange...

                                 ROSALIND  (CONT'D)
                                  (to  Scott)
                        There is  a  luncheon  --  ?

                                 SCOTT
                        No  --  not  exactly... 
                                  (with  enthusiasm,  to 
                                   offer  a  solution)
                        But  I  got  rooms  for  everyone  at  the 
                        Biltmore  --  !
           CONTINUED:

           The  enthusiasm  is  lost  on  Tilde,  Marjorie,  and  Rosalind 
           alike...  They  turn  to  Zelda,  as  bewildered  as  they  are 
           insulted.   Zelda  smiles  awkwardly  and  shrugs.  

           EXT.  BILTMORE  HOTEL  -  AFTERNOON

           Tilde,  Marjorie,  and  Rosalind  are  about  to  get  into  a  waiting 
           cab,  just  as  the  revolving  door  of  the  hotel  spills  a  giddy 
           Zelda  onto  the  sidewalk.  

                                 ZELDA 
                        Oh,  please  don't  go...

                                 MARJORIE
                        Baby,  we're  just  spent...

           Tilde  gives  Zelda  a  kiss  good  bye.

                                 MARJORIE  (CONT'D)
                        You  know  we  want  you  to  be  happy.

                                 ZELDA
                        It's  the  happiest  I've  ever  been!

           She  is  19  years  old  and  she  means  it  in  the  way  that  only 
           youth  can:  with  her  whole  being.  Her  sister  can’t  possibly 
           understand  it,  but  ends  it  there  with  a  peck  to  Zelda’s 
           cheek.

           INT.  ROOM  2109  -  BILTMORE  HOTEL  -  DUSK

           Zelda  is  enchanted  with  the  room,  which  has  an  unobstructed 
           view  of  Central  Park...

           In  the  b.g.,  a  BELLBOY  hauls  Zelda's  numerous  trunks  and 
           suitcases  in  from  the  hallway.

           The  elegant  geometry  the  muted  tones,  and  understated 
           formality  of  the  room  are  new  to  Zelda...

           She  takes  it  all  in,  chewing  reflexively  on  her  bottom  lip, 
           as  if  fighting  off  a  wave  of  melancholy...

                                 ZELDA
                        Just  think  how  different  things  will 
                        be!   No  parents  telling  me  what  to  do  -- 
                        not  that  I  ever  listened.   Still...  I 
                        can  put  out  the  light  when  I'm  good  and 
                        ready.   No  power  on  earth  can  make  me 
                        do  anything  any  more,  except  myself.

           As  light  and  airy  as  those  words  may  be,  her  voice  is  laced 
           with  something  like  fear...  And  maybe  loss.

           She  places  their  very  first  --  and  only  --  wedding  gifts  on 
           the  dressing  table:  a  chocolate  set  with  a  Tiffany  urn,  and  a 
           fading  Easter  Lily...
           CONTINUED:

           After  a  beat,  she  moves  them  to  the  other  side  of  the 
           dresser...  Still  dissatisfied,  she's  about  to  move  them 
           again,  when  Scott  appears  behind  her,  embracing  her  --  warm 
           and  protective...

                                 SCOTT
                        There'll  never  be  just  the  two  of  us 
                        again  --  from  now  on  we'll  be  three: 
                        you,  me,  and  us...

                                 ZELDA
                        Why  does  that  sound  so  sad  when  in  fact 
                        we're  safer  and  closer  than  ever?

           Scott  responds  with  a  kiss  to  the  back  of  her  neck.   Then 
           another...  She  turns  now,  meets  his  lips  with  hers... 

           EXT.  CENTRAL  PARK  -  HANSOM  CABS

           Zelda  and  Scott,  ensconced  in  the  bubble  of  their  romance, 
           her  hand  in  his.   He  glances  down  at  the  watch  he  gave, 
           glinting  on  her  wrist,  then  frowns  slightly:

                                 SCOTT
                        How  can  you  tell  the  time  --  ?

           Zelda  looks  at  him,  uncertain: 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        The  watch  is  face  down... 

           She  glances  down,  and  we  see  that  indeed  the  watch  face  is 
           twisted,  clock-side  down,  and  the  inscription  is  up  side. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh  --  I  must’ve  turned  it  over  four 
                        hundred  times  just  to  read  “From  Scott 
                        to  Zelda...” 

           She  takes  such  comfort  in  those  words... 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        I  figure  it’s  easier  just  to  leave  it 
                        that  way... 

           EXT.  LORD  &  TAYLOR  -  FIFTH  AVENUE

           Zelda  and  Scott  walk  along  the  stretch  of  display  windows.

           Their  body  language  alone--he  leads,  she  follows--more  than 
           hints  at  the  shift  in  the  dynamic  between  them:  they  are  in 
           HIS  world  now...  The  novelty  of  it  all  is  exhilarating  to 
           them  both.

           Their  reflections  bounce  off  the  glass,  offering  a  glimpse  of 
           the  difference  between  Zelda's  pedestrian  clothes,  and  what 
           she  is  seeing  in  the  store...
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        I’m  not  afraid  of  anything...  Besides, 
                        I  know  you  can  take  much  better  care  of 
                        me  than  I  can...

           Zelda's  outfit  looks  terribly  provincial  by  comparison.

                                 SCOTT
                        What  makes  you  so  sure?

           EXT.  WASHINGTON  SQUARE  PARK

           They  stroll  through  the  park.  The  banter  is  playful,  uniquely 
           theirs.  It  is  in  this  endless  verbal  game  playing  that  they 
           are  so  completely  bound  to  each  other.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  just  know  I'm  going  to  be  happy  with 
                        you  --  always  --

           Then  they  come  upon  the  fountain  at  the  center  of  the  park:

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Well  now there's  the  first  public  pool 
                        I've  seen  so  far!

           Scott  laughs...

           EXT.  GOTHAM  BOOK  MART  -  LATE  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  and  Scott  stand  at  the  window  of  the  book  store,  where 
           THIS  SIDE  OF  PARADISE  is  prominently  displayed,  along  with  a 
           handwritten  sign:

                      “YOUNGEST  WRITER  EVER  PUBLISHED  BY  SCRIBNER'S."

                                 ZELDA
                        Let's  go  in  and  buy  one...

                                 SCOTT
                        We  can  get  as  many  as  we  want  for  free.

                                 ZELDA 
                        It'll  be  fun...  We'll  pretend  we're 
                        just  regular  people...

           She's  just  about  convinced  him,  when  a  CLERK  appears  in  the 
           window,  and  places  a  second  sign  next  to  the  first:

                                       "SOLD  OUT."

           Zelda's  disappointment  is  by  far  outweighed  by  her  sense  of 
           pride  in  Scott  --  and  in  being  Mrs.  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald.

           And  it  is  Zelda  who  is  first  to  realize  that  CUSTOMERS 
           leaving  the  store  pause  to  stare  at  Scott:  he's  being 
           recognized:  he’s  suddenly  famous.
           CONTINUED:

           THREE  YOUNG  WOMEN,  who  look  like  they  might  have  stepped  out 
           of  one  of  those  windows  at  Lord  &  Taylor,  exit  the  shop,  with 
           their  fresh  copies  of  PARADISE.

           Zelda  watches  as  they  head  up  the  street,  glance  at  the  photo 
           on  the  back  of  the  book;  after  a  beat,  they  begin  to  return.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                                  (quietly)
                        Would  you  look  at  that...

           Scott's  unclear...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Those  women  --  they're  coming  to  get 
                        your  autograph  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Don't  be  ridiculous  --

           No  sooner  does  he  finish  the  word  when  one  YOUNG  WOMAN  steps 
           up  behind  him.

                                 YOUNG  WOMAN  #1
                        Excuse  me...  Mr.  Fitzgerald...

           He  pivots  about,  his  expression  caught  between  delight  and 
           disbelief:  all  three  Young  Women  standing  there  with  their 
           books  open  to  the  front  page,  pens  in  hand...

                                 YOUNG  WOMAN  #2
                        You are  Mr.  Fitzgerald  --  ?

           Scott  nods,  beaming...

                                 YOUNG  WOMAN  #1
                        If  it's  not  too  much  trouble  --

           Scott  and  Zelda  exchange  a  knowing  look  as  he  reaches  for  the 
           pen.

                                 SCOTT
                        Not  at  all.

           As  he  signs  each  of  the  books,  the  three  Young  Woman  take  the 
           moment  to  eye  Zelda,  looking  her  up  and  down.

           And  Zelda  for  the  first  time  in  her  life,  is  suddenly  self-
           conscious  --  uncomfortable  in  her  skin...

           Signing  the  last  of  the  three  books,  Scott  glances  from  the 
           Women  to  Zelda.   As  the  Young  Women  take  their  leave,  Zelda 
           sees  the  look  on  Scott's  face:  he's  embarrassed.  By  her...

           He  turns  to  hail  a  cab  as  Zelda  digests  the  fact  that  she 
           isn't  measuring  up  to  the  image  of  his  newfound  celebrity.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           As  she  turns  she  catches  her  reflection  in  the  store  window:  
           after  a  moment  of  self  scrutiny,  she  lifts  her  hair  to  her 
           jaw,  as  if  to  see  what  it  would  be  like  to  cut  it...  A  smile 
           blooms  on  her  lips...  

           Scott  beckons  for  her  to  follow  him,  they  disappear  around  a 
           corner  onto  a  side  street,  alone.  He  kisses  her.

           And  then  she  realizes:  he  wasn’t  doing  it  only  to  reassure 
           her. 

           Tears  spill  down  his  cheeks...

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo  --  You  can't  possibly  be  unhappy  -
                        - ?

           Scott  smiles  through  his  tears:

                                 SCOTT
                        No.  Of  course  not...  It's  just  --  well 
                        I'm  fairly  certain  I'll  never  be  this 
                        happy  again...

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           MONTAGE:   TO  JELLY  ROLL  MORTON'S  "BOOGIE  WOOGIE  BLUES"

           NOTE:  the  scenes/shots  portray  Zelda's  very  deliberate  self-
           transformation  into  the  ultimate  Flapper:  the  dresses  get 
           shorter,  straighter,  and  sexier.   The  make  up  becomes  more 
           "stage-like."

           * ZELDA  bobs  her  hair.

           INT.  DEPARTMENT  STORE  -  DAY

           *  ZELDA  shopping  with  SCOTT,  as  she  actively  transforms 
           herself  from  Southern  Belle  to  New  York  sophisticate.  Scott 
           picks  items  that  are  stylish,  but  staid;  Zelda  puts  these 
           back  on  the  rack,  and  picks  pieces  that  have  more  flair. 

           INT.  BILTMORE  HOTEL  -  KITCHEN  -  DAY

           *  ZELDA  dances  on  the  tables  of  the  Biltmore  kitchen  in  a 
           dress  that  will  earn  her  the  title  of  America's  First 
           Flapper.  Scott  swipes  a  Chef's  hat  from  the  staff,  tosses  it 
           to  Zelda,  who  dons  it...

           INT./EXT.  BILTMORE  HOTEL  -  LOBBY/AWNING  -  DAY

           *  THE  BILTMORE  CONCIERGE  escorts  Zelda  and  Scott  out  of  the 
           hotel,  happy  to  see  them  go...
           EXT.  COMMODORE  HOTEL  -  DAY

           *  ZELDA  &  SCOTT,  trailed  by  their  baggage  and  a  host  of 
           JOURNALISTS  &  PHOTOGRAPHERS,  enter  THE  COMMODORE  HOTEL  and  on 
           the  FLASH  of  a  camera  bulb: 

           EXT.  COMMODORE  HOTEL  -  NIGHT

           *  The  IMAGE  FREEZES  on  Zelda  and  Scott,  in  all  their  luster 
           and  glory,  leaving  the  hotel,  for  a  night  on  the  town. 

           INT.  WALDORF  ASTORIA  HOTEL  -  ROOM  -  MORNING

           The  room  is  bedlam:   breakfast  dishes  everywhere,  the  bed 
           unmade,  books  and  papers  scattered  about,  trays  filled  with 
           cigarette  butts,  liquor  glasses  from  the  night  before.  

           Scott,  in  his  robe,  is  rummaging  among  piles  of  laundry... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda!  
                                  (still  rummaging)
                        Have  you  seen  my  boxers?  
                                  (under  his  breath, 
                                   slight  exasperation)
                        Jesus...  There  must  be  at  least  one 
                        fresh  pair... 

                                 ZELDA  (O.S.)
                        Yes,  yes!

                                 SCOTT
                           Where  then? 

           Scott  turns  to  see  Zelda  in  the  doorway,  fresh  from  the 
           bathtub.   She  is  towel  drying  her  hair,  in  nothing  but  a  pair 
           of  Scott’s  boxers  --  and  she  wears  them  well. 

           Despite  his  annoyance,  Scott  cannot  help  but  LAUGH... 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (shrugging,  sheepish)
                        They  were  the  last  clean  thing  in  the 
                        whole  place!

                                 SCOTT
                        Thief!

           Scott  launches  himself  at  her,  crossing  the  room  like  he 
           would  an  obstacle  course.  

           And  with  the  delighted  SQUEAL  of  a  child,  Zelda  gives  chase, 
           leaping  over  the  bed,  and  around  the  room. 

           Scott  feints  to  the  right. 

           Zelda  dodges  left  --  nimble  as  a  cat.   Back  onto  the  bed.
           CONTINUED:

           But  Scott  has  size  and  sheer  power  in  his  favor,  and  he 
           lunges  for  the  bed,  trapping  his  finger  in  the  back  of  the 
           boxers,  pulling  downward... 

           Zelda  wriggles  and  SHRIEKS  with  joyful  abandon,  as  he  gains 
           purchase,  and  in  a  moment,  straddling  her,  has  her  pinned  to 
           the  bed... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT’D)
                                  (beaming  down  at  her)
                        A  man  has  a  right  to  be  interviewed  in 
                        a  pair  of  clean  skivvies... 

                                 ZELDA
                        And  dutiful  as  I  am,  I’ll  make  the 
                        sacrifice  and  wear  no  skivvies  at  all!

           Scott  delights  in  the  very  image  of  it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Though  it’s  a  shame...  As  I  never  seen 
                        a  woman  wear  them  like  you  do... 

                                 ZELDA
                        And  you  better  not... 
                                  (beat)
                        Not  ever...!

           Then  he  bends  to  kiss  her...  Then  again,  lower.   Then  lower 
           still,  inching  the  boxers  down  her  thighs,  and  off  her  legs.

           INT.  TAXI  CAB  -  NIGHT

           A  YOUNG  WOMAN  JOURNALIST,  26,  is  seated  in  the  back  of  the 
           car  with  Scott  and  Zelda. 

                                 JOURNALIST
                        How  does  it  feel,  Mr.  Fitzgerald,  to  be 
                        the  spokesperson  for  our  generation?

           Zelda  is  attentive  but  dutifully  quiet  as  he  fields  the 
           questions.  It  helps  that  of  the  two  woman,  Zelda  is  by  far 
           the  more  striking... 

                                 SCOTT
                        All  I  do  is  write  in  a  style  that  to  my 
                        mind,  is  commensurate  with  the  subject 
                        matter.  And  my  subject  is  what  I  know  -- 
                        what  I've  lived.  

           The  Reporter  jots  short  hand  as  he  responds.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        And  if  somehow  that's  made  me  the  voice 
                        of  a  generation  --  well  then  it's 
                        simply  a  happy  accident.
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda’s  face  lights  up  all  at  once,  then  turns  to  WHISPER 
           INAUDIBLY  in  Scott’s  ear.   And  like  a  contagion,  the  light  in 
           her  face  passes  to  his,  and  he  nods  emphatically.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        And  how  you  feel  about  having  a  flapper 
                        for  a  wife?

           EXT.  THE  ROYALTON  -  MOMENTS  LATER  -  NIGHT

           A  CLUSTER  of  REPORTERS  and  PHOTOGRAPHERS  are  milling  about 
           the  entrance... 

                                 JOURNALIST  (V.O.)
                        Do  you  think,  for  instance,  that  she 
                        should  have  her  own  career?

           Then  all  at  once,  the  group  reacts,  FLASHES  go  off.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)
                        Well  --  I  think  just  being  in  love  -- 
                        doing  it  well,  you  know  --  is  work 
                        enough  for  a  woman...

           Scott's  Car  is  approaching:  Scott  is  riding  on  the  roof,  and 
           Zelda  is  on  the  hood...

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        If  she  keeps  her  house  the  way  it 
                        should  be  kept  --  And  loves  her  husband 
                        and  helps  him  with  his  work  and 
                        encourages  him  --

           INT.  GEORGE  NATHAN'S  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

           It's  a  fine  swath  of  the  New  York  Society  Set:   DOROTHY 
           PARKER,  H.L.  MENCKEN,  GEORGE  NATHAN,  MAX  PERKINS,  Bunny 
           Wilson,  Alex  McKaig,  John  Bishop,  Actresses  ANITA  LOOS,  30,  
           RUTH  FINDLAY,  TALLULAH  &  JEAN  BANKHEAD,mid  20's,  HELEN  HAYES, 
           20,  theater  producer,  JOHN  D.  WILLIAMS,  RING  LARDNER,  etc.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.) 
                        --  I  think  that's  the  sort  of  work  that 
                        will  save  her...

           By  contrast  with  the  gathering  at  Ludlow's,  which  felt  almost 
           collegiate,  there's  a  real  whiff  of  decadence  here,  in  which 
           Zelda  is  notably  more  at  ease...  Not  only  has  she  found  a  way 
           to  capitalize  on  her  exoticism,  but  the  flirtatiousness  of 
           the  environment  in  general  is  second-nature  to  her...  So,  far 
           from  being  the  awkward,  Southern  bumpkin,  she  is  now  the 
           source  of  much  masculine  fascination  and  interest...

           Scott  introduces  Zelda  to  a  near  receiving  line  of  Men,  and 
           she  goes  out  of  her  way  to  kiss  each  one  of  them.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        The  host,  George  Nathan,  H.L.  Mencken, 
                        Ring  Lardner,  John  Williams,  Dorothy 
                        Parker,  Tallulah  and  Gene  Bankhead  --

           Scott  appears  utterly  tolerant  of  Zelda's  manner:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Yes  --  they  really  all  have  kisses 
                        coming  to  them,  because  they  weren't  at 
                        the  wedding,  and  everybody  at  a  wedding 
                        always  gets  a  kiss  --

           As  he  says  this,  Alex  McKaig  and  Bunny  Wilson,  sneak  up  to 
           get  in  line,  and  Zelda's  moves  right  along  to  kiss  them  too:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Alex,  Bunny:  I  believe  you  are  already 
                        well  enough  acquainted  --

                                 ALEX  &  BUNNY
                                  (all  in  good  fun)
                        But  we  weren't  at  the  wedding!

           They  get  kisses  too.   But  she  returns  to  Scott,  and  beaming, 
           meets  his  lips  with  hers  with  a  lingering  gift  of  a  kiss. 

           INT.  GEORGE  NATHAN’S  APARTMENT  -  LIVING  ROOM  -  NIGHT

           ANOTHER  ANGLE  -  LATER  STILL

           A  group,  including  Alex,  George,  Zelda,  Anita  Loos,  Dorothy 
           Parker,  John  Williams,  and  a  few  others  are  engaged  in  heated 
           debate.  Zelda  studies  the  WOMEN,  whose  clothing,  manners,  and 
           speech  are  so  very  different  from  her  own.

                                 ALEX
                        It  boggles  the  mind  the  way  foolish 
                        women  run  circles  around  intelligent 
                        ones  when  it  comes  to  men  --

                                 GEORGE
                        That's  because  the  intelligent  ones 
                        pretend  they  want  to  be  more  than  a 
                        pretty  and  desirable  toy  --

                                 ZELDA
                        It  has  never  occurred  to  either  one  of 
                        you,  that  half  those  foolish  women  are 
                        just  the  clever  ones  in  disguise?

                                 ANITA
                        She  has  a  point  --  when  my  father  found 
                        out  I  was  writing  for  a  living,  his 
                        advice  to  me  was  to  dress  like  a  whore 
                        if  I  ever  wanted  to  find  a  husband  --
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA 
                        What  I  really  want  is  a  bath.  George  -- 
                        would  you  care  to  come  and  help  me 
                        think  about  what  I  should  do  for  a 
                        living  while  I  take  a  bath?

           ANOTHER  ANGLE

           Scott  is  on  the  other  side  of  the  room,  pen  and  notebook  in 
           hand:  ever  the  constant  observer... 

           He  is  watching  Zelda  drag  George  by  the  hand  through  the 
           room,  and  down  the  hall:  ever  in  motion  --  unfettered, 
           oblivious.   And  Scott  is  in  awe  of  it:   that  lack  of  self-
           consciousness  which  he  will  never  know.  

           Alex  approaches  with  a  bottle  of  gin,  as  Scott  slips  his 
           notebook  back  into  his  jacket  pocket. 

                                 ALEX
                        It  doesn't  bother  you?

                                 SCOTT
                        What  --  Zelda?   I  suppose  seeing  her  in 
                        action  like  that  inspires  me. 

           He  knocks  back  his  glass.

           EXT.  UNION  SQUARE  -  LATER  THAT  NIGHT

           Zelda  and  Scott  are  hand-in-hand,  walking  together  with  Alex, 
           Bishop,  John  Williams  and  George.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  think  we  should  do  it  Scott!  Or I 
                        should  anyway  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (to  the  Group)
                        Zelda  wants  to  star  in  the  movies  -- 
                        Metro  asked  us  to  play  the  leads  in 
                           This Side of Paradise.
                                  (to  Zelda)
                        Dear  --  What  makes  you  think  you  can 
                        act?

                                 ZELDA
                        I  wouldn't  have  to  --  I'd  be  playing  my 
                        own  self!
                                  (to  John  Williams)
                        John  --  Tell  him  you  think  I  can  do  it  -- 

                                 JOHN  WILLIAMS
                        I  wouldn't  be  lying,  if  I  said   she's 
                        got  a  better  sense  of  the  dramatic  than 
                        most  of  the  actors  I  work  with  --
           CONTINUED:

           And  no  sooner  does  he  say  this,  than  Zelda  is  stripping  off 
           her  clothes  and  running  down  the  street  toward  the  Union 
           Square  Fountain.

           Scott  and  the  other  Men  tear  down  the  street  after,  arriving 
           just  in  time  to  see  her  take  a  flying  leap  into  the  water.

           Before  she  comes  up  for  air,  the  whole  Group  finds  themselves 
           surrounded  by  a  half-dozen  POLICEMEN,  ready  to  arrest  Zelda 
           for  indecency...

                                 SCOTT
                        Gentlemen!   Gentlemen  there's  no  need  --

                                 OFFICER  #1
                                  (thick  Irish  accent)
                        Hey  wait  a  minute...

           He  turns  to  one  of  his  partners.   All  Six  of  the  Policemen 
           speak  with  Irish  Brogues  to  a  greater  or  lesser  degree.

                                 OFFICER  #1  (CONT'D)
                        Don't  you  recognize  him!?

           Scott  puffs  up  slightly  with  pride...

                                 OFFICER  #2
                        Yeah...  He's  the  comic  --

           Scott's  face  falls  for  a  flash,  but  George  manages  to  stage 
           whisper:

                                 GEORGE
                        Play  along...

                                 OFFICER  #3
                        The  Paddy  --

                                 OFFICER  #4
                        That's  right...

           And  the  Officers  are  now  almost  embarrassed.

                                 OFFICER  #1
                        Sorry  to  have  disturbed  you  --  have  a 
                        lovely  rest  of  your  evening...

           At  last,  Zelda  pokes  her  head  out  of  the  water:

                                 ZELDA
                        My  God  --  it's  been  ages  since  I've  had 
                        a  swim  in  anything  but  my  own  gin  and 
                        tonic!

           Scott  cannot  help  but  burst  out  laughing...  Struck  by  her 
           audacity,  her  oblivion  to  rules  --  he  falls  in  love  all  over 
           again.
           INT.  JUNGLE  CLUB  -  LATE  NIGHT

           Zelda  and  Scott,  and  the  Group  are  there  with  others:  
           Tellulah,  Ludlow,  Ruth  Findlay,  Dorothy  Parker.

                                 RUTH
                        Did  I  hear  they're  writing  a  script  for 
                           This Side of Paradise...?

                                 ZELDA
                                  (nodding,  thrilled)
                        They  want  us  to  play  the  leads  --  !

                                 SCOTT
                        We've  decided  against  it...

           Zelda  all  but  chokes  on  her  drink:  Scott  can  be  difficult, 
           but  he’s  never denied  her  anything... 

                                 ZELDA
                        We're  still  thinking  it  over  --

                                 SCOTT 
                                  (to  Zelda)
                        We're  not  doing  it  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Just  like  that?

                                 SCOTT
                        You  heard  what  Max  said:  it  could 
                        confuse  my  readership  --  make  me  out  to 
                        be  a  dabbler  -- 

           Zelda's  not  as  angry  as  she  is  demoralized.  Her  voice  is 
           calm.

                                 ZELDA 
                        Tell  me  something:  what  would  be  so 
                        terrible  about  my  having  a  little 
                        success  of  my  own  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Could  you  possibly  have  any  more 
                        success  than  you  do  as  the  heroines  of 
                        my  work  --  ?

           He  is  serious...  Zelda  looks  at  him  in  disbelief:  the  echo  of 
           her  own  words...

           INT.  THE  PALM  COURT  -  THE  PLAZA  HOTEL  -  DAY

           Scott  is  there  with  Max  Perkins,  a  little  worse  for  wear...  

                                 PERKINS
                        We're  looking  forward  to  getting  the 
                        new  manuscript...
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                                  (a  chortle)
                        Me  too...

           A  FEMALE  FAN  approaches  with  a  copy  of  Scott’s  book...  

                                 FAN
                        Mr.  Fitzgerald? 

           Scott  rallies  to  the  call  of  his  name.   Turns  to  the  fan. 

                                 FAN  (CONT’D)
                                  (blushing)
                        I’m  so  sorry  to  bother  you,  but  --

           Scott  is  happy  to  oblige:  and  with  a  practiced  hand,  uses  his 
           own  pen  to  sign  the  inside  page  of  the  book... 

           When  the  Fan  moves  along,   Max  picks  up  the  conversation. 

                                 PERKINS
                        It's  not  going  well  --

                                 SCOTT
                        It's  not  that  so  much...  I'm  just 
                        distracted  -- 

           INT./  EXT.  MARMON  -  TRAVELING

           On  the  open  road,  flanked  by  dense  wood  of  Flowering  Dogwoods 
           and  Red  Maples,  in  a  sports  coupe  that’s  on  it’s  last  legs...  
           Scott  is  at  the  wheel,  and  Zelda  has  the  wind  in  her  hair,  as 
           the  car  lurches  along...

                                 PERKINS  (V.O.)
                        Maybe  get  out  of  town  for  a  while... 
                        Change  the  scenery  --  something  quiet.

           EXT.  COMPO  ROAD  -  WESTPORT  -  LATE  AFTERNOON  -  LONG

           The  Marmon  heads  down  a  two  lane  road,  acres  of  farmland 
           unfurling  in  every  direction.  On  the  horizon,  the  last  of  the 
           sun  bounces  off  the  water  of  the  Long  Island  Sound.

           Over  this,  we  hear  Zelda,  eager  like  a  child  for  a  pony  ride, 
           clearly  parroting  what  a  real  estate  agent  told  her:

                                 ZELDA  (V.O.)
                        The  beach  is  out  the  back  door. 
                        Westport  is  a  two-minute  drive.  And  at 
                        50  miles,  Manhattan  is  still  an  easy 
                        week-end  commute.
                                  (then)
                        It's  sort  of  the  best  of  all  worlds... 
                        And  I  can't  remember  the  last  time  it 
                        was  quiet  enough  to  hear  the  swallows.
           CONTINUED:

           At  the  end  of  the  road  stands  a  small,  pale  gray,  Colonial-
           style  house:   Wakeman  Cottage.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)
                        And  I  suppose  we  could  always  invite 
                        people  up  for  the  weekend  --

                                 ZELDA  (V.O.)
                        I'm  not  "people"  enough?

           He  laughs.  So  does  she.

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  DAY

           Scott  is  at  his  desk,  writing  --  or  attempting  to.   Zelda 
           hovers  about  like  an  insistent  child,  chomping  on  an  apple.

           It  is  so  quiet,  that  every  CRUNCH  of  the  fruit  seems 
           disproportionately  loud...  In  the  b.g.  TANA,  their  Japanese 
           Houseman,  pads  silently  through  the  halls,  collecting 
           laundry.   She  pauses  in  front  of  the  desk.   He  ignores  her.

                                 ZELDA
                        It's  two  o'clock...

                                 SCOTT
                                  (not  looking  up)
                        And?

                                 ZELDA 
                        You  said  you'd  be  done  by  lunchtime.

           There's  a  beat  as  he  finishes  a  thought.  Now  he  looks  up.

                                 SCOTT
                        It  may  be  stating  the  obvious  --  but 
                        I'm  not  done...

           Zelda  rifles  through  the  scattered  notes  and  pieces  of  paper 
           on  the  desk  top.

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo  --  you  promised:  we  were  going  to 
                        get  into  the  city  early  enough  to  have 
                        a  drink  with  Lawton  before  meeting  my 
                        parents  at  the  hotel.  

           Scott  puts  his  hand  on  hers  to  stop  the  RUSTLING  of  paper...

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda,  please...

           She  yanks  her  hand  away,  taking  the  paper  with  it...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (bursting)
                        Zelda!

           She  looks  at  him,  admonishing...
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (reeling  himself  in)
                        It  may  not  seem  like  it  to  you  --  but 
                        those  papers  are  in  a  very  particular 
                        order.  Please  leave  them  that  way...

           But  Zelda  is  already  reading  from  the  notes  on  the  page:

                                 ZELDA
                                  (reading)
                        "There was for example her stomach.  
                           She was used to certain dishes, and she 
                           had a strong conviction that she could 
                           not possibly eat anything else.  There 
                           must be a lemonade and a tomato 
                           sandwich late in the morning -- "
                                  (a  look  at  Scott)
                        Goofo  --  My  food  habits?   I  can't  wait 
                        to  see  what  you'll  do  with  the  way  I 
                        roll  my  toilet  tissue...

           Her  tone  is  blasé  rather  than  angry,  as  she  sets  the  paper 
           back  down  on  the  desk...  Scott  smiles  despite  himself.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well  I'm  not  ever  going  to  do  anything 
                        with  it  if  you  don't  let  me  work...

           Zelda  purses  her  lips, reflexively  she  flips  her  watch  face 
           to  glance  at  the  engraving  on  the  back,  and  then,  with  a 
           playful  look,  she  relents.

           INT.  BILTMORE  HOTEL  -  LOBBY  -  EVENING

           The  place  is  a  beehive  of  night  time  activity:  GUESTS  dressed 
           for  an  evening  out,  others  just  arriving...  Scott  is  there 
           with  Zelda’s  family:  Minnie,  the  Judge,  Rosalind,  and  Newman.

                                 MINNIE
                        I'm  so  sorry  Scott  --  She's  running  as 
                        late  as  ever  -- 

           Scott,  lighting  a  cigarette.

                                 SCOTT
                                  (smiling)
                        Mrs.  Sayre  --  I  assure  you,  she  has 
                        always  been  more  than  worth  the  wait... 
                        In  fact,  I  bet  you  don't  know  half  what 
                        you  should  about  Zelda...

                                 MINNIE
                        Why  Scott  --  what  a  thing  to  say!  I 
                        know  all  there  is  to  know  about  Zelda. 
                        I'm  her  mother...

                                 SCOTT
                        Well,  you  couldn't  possibly  know  how 
                        beautiful  she  is,  could  you?

                        You  just  watch  that  elevator,  because 
                        Zelda  will  be  down  in  a  minute,  and 
                        then  watch  all  the  men  in  the  lobby... 

           A  moment  later,  Zelda  appears  from  between  the  elevator 
           doors,  and  Scott's  face  blooms  with  pride:  she  is  a  splendor, 
           and  as  she  moves  across  the  lobby  to  greet  him,  there's  not  a 
           MAN  in  the  room  who  fails  to  notice...

           Scott  and  Zelda  walk  up  the  path  to  the  house  with  Minnie  and 
           the  Judge  in  tow.  Biggs  and  another  MAN,  are  there  passed 
           out:  one  in  the  hammock,  the  other  on  the  lawn.

           Zelda  shoots  Scott  a  look...  He  shrugs...  They  keep  walking 
           til  they  get  inside...   Minnie  and  the  Judge  follow,  but  not 
           without  a  glance  of  disapproval...

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  SAME

           The  house  is  in  disarray,  even  as  Tana,  the  houseman  goes 
           about  picking  up  dirty  glasses  and  empty  bottles.

           Zelda  blanches  with  shame  at  the  reflection  of  her  own 
           lifestyle  in  the  eyes  of  her  disapproving  parents.

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott  --  will  you  show  them  upstairs  to 
                        their  room.  I'll  be  just  a  minute.

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  ZELDA  &  SCOTT'S  BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

           Zelda  wakes  to  the  sound  of  POUNDING  on  the  front  door.

                                 ZELDA 
                                  (nudges  Scott  awake)
                        Your  friends  are  back  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Why my  friends  --  ?

           Scott  rises,  gropes  about  for  his  robe,  and  puts  it  on.

                                 ZELDA 
                        'Cause  if  I  have  to  go  down  there 
                        myself,  they  won't  survive  long  enough 
                        to  be  anyone's  friends  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright...

                                 ZELDA
                        Just  tell  them  to  go  away  --  Papa  can't 
                        bear  the  goings  on...
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        Which  is  why  you  didn't  marry  your 
                        father.   We  live  our  life  the  way  we 
                        want  --

                                 ZELDA
                        Yes,  yes.  But  just  for  tonight.  
                        Please.

           He  heads  out  of  the  room.

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  DOWNSTAIRS

           Zelda  is  at  the  foot  of  the  stairs,  glaring  in  the  direction 
           of  THE  KITCHEN:  the  LAUGHTER  and  COMMOTION  coming  from  behind 
           the  door  is  enough  to  wake  the  neighborhood...

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  KITCHEN  -  SAME

           Scott,  Biggs,  and  his  Friend  are  caught  off  guard  as  Zelda 
           blows  through  the  door,  in  a  full  blown  rage,  sweeping 
           bottles  of  liquor  and  tomato  juice  from  the  counter...

                                 ZELDA 
                        It's  4  in  the  morning!

           She  hurls  a  glass  across  the  Kitchen;  it  SHATTERS  against  the 
           wall...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        What  is  this  --  ?  The  Irishman's 
                        cocktail  hour!

           Scott  lurches  in  her  direction,  and  grabs  hold  of  her, 
           pinning  her  arms  to  her  sides.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Let  go!

           She  thrashes  about,  but  drunk  as  he  is,  he's  still  stronger 
           than  she,  and  he  pushes  her  out  through  the  swinging  door...

           No  sooner  does  he  release  her,  than  she  pushes  back  through.

           But  Scott  is  there  to  block  it,  so  that  the  door  SNAPS  back 
           and  SLAMS  into  her  face...

           She  lets  out  a  CRY  like  something  PRIMAL.  Scott's  face 
           crumples  in  anguish.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh  God...!

           He  jerks  the  door  open  to  see  Zelda  holding  her  a  face  in  her 
           hands,  blood  spilling  over  her  fingers  from  her  nose...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Oh  no,  no,  no,  no...  Forgive  me...
           CONTINUED:

           He’s  trying  to  think  clearly,  struggling  against  his  liquored 
           fog,  holding  Zelda  tight  to  him...

           Together,  they  slip  down  against  the  wall,  his  tears  mixing 
           freely  with  her  blood...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Okay...  It's  going  to  be  okay... 
                        Shhhh...  I'm  so  sorry...  Shhhh.

           INT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  KITCHEN  -  EARLY  MORNING

           Zelda,  her  face  still  bruised  from  the  night  before,  makes  a  
           nervous,  inept  attempt  at  cleaning  up,  when  the  Judge  appears 
           at  the  door,  hat  in  hand,  ready  to  depart.

                                 ZELDA
                        Mornin'  Daddy!   I  was  just  getting 
                        ready  to  make  brunch  --

           She  doesn't  turn  to  greet  him...

                                 JUDGE  SAYRE
                        We'll  be  on  our  way  in  just  a  few 
                        minutes  --

           Zelda  shuts  off  the  faucet,  and  turns  to  face  him,  revealing 
           now  her  black  eye,  and  swollen  nose...  Her  bottom  lip  too,  is 
           raw  from  her  compulsive  chewing.

           The  disdain  on  her  Father's  face  leaves  no  room  for  sympathy. 
           And  with  that,  he  takes  his  leave.  

           EXT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  PORCH  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Zelda  watches  her  parents  get  into  a  waiting  cab,  and 
           something  inside  her  breaks:  tears  make  their  tracks  down  her 
           bruised  and  purple  face.

           Scott  steps  up  behind  her  and  wraps  himself  around  her, 
           protective,  almost  paternal...

           CLOSE  ON  LIPS

           As  they  are  painted  with  bright  red  lipstick.

           EXT.  WAKEMAN  COTTAGE  -  PORCH  -  NIGHT

           We  see  now  that  those  LIPS  were  MASCULINE. 

           And  that  Zelda,  well  beyond  tipsy  at  this  point,  is  wielding 
           the  lipstick.

           She  is  at  the  center  of  a  mostly  MALE  GROUP,  going  from  Man 
           to  Man,  applying  the  make  up  to  their  lips.   Working  now  on 
           George,  she  gives  his  lips  particular  attention...
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                                  (finishing  up)
                        Alright...   Now...
                                  (beat  -  thinking)
                        I  want  each  and  every  one  of  you  to 
                        kiss  me!

           A  QUICK  SUCCESSION  OF  SHOTS

           We  see  half  a  dozen  pairs  of  lips  press  up  against  Zelda's 
           cheeks...

           Zelda  glances  at  her  own  reflection  in  the  window:  every  kiss 
           has  left  a  perfect,  bright  red  "mark"  on  her  face,  by  which 
           she  is  thoroughly  tickled...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Where's  Scott!   I  must  show  Scott!

           She  turns  to  look  for  him,  and  then  goes  still:

           Scott  is  on  the  beach,  cradling  Jean  Bankhead  in  his  arms,  as 
           he  spins  them  both  around...

           Zelda  moves  down  the  stairs,  and  toward  the  beach...

           EXT.  BEACH  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Zelda  stomps  past  Scott  and  Gene,  heading  down  the  beach, 
           away  from  the  party...   This  gets  Scott's  attention...

                                 SCOTT
                        Where  are  you  going?
                                  (getting  no  response)
                        Don't  you  take  another  step!

           She  traipses  on...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        And  you  wonder  why  I  can't  get  any  work 
                        done!   Worried  all  the  time  about  where 
                        you're  off  to  --

           And  there,  before  an  audience  of  the  entire  party,  they  enter 
           into  a  full  blown  fight:

                                 ZELDA
                        If  I  had  my  own  work,  you  wouldn't  have 
                        to  wonder  how  I  spent  my  time!

                                 SCOTT
                        Work!?   You  want  to  work!?   You  can't 
                        even  manage  the  fucking  laundry!

                                 ZELDA
                                  (over  him)
                        What  am  I  supposed  to  do?!   I’m  home:  you 
                        can’t  work!  I  leave:  you  still  can’t 
                        work!  It's  enough  to  put  a  person  out! 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        If  anyone’s  “putting  out”  it’s  you  -- 
                        what  with  the  way  you  flirt  with 
                        everything  in  sight!

                                 ZELDA
                        You  won't  let  me  do  anything  else!  As 
                        it  is,  flirting  is  the  one  thing  for 
                        which  I  still  have  an  aptitude!  But  if 
                        I  tried  to  make  a  living  from  it, 
                        they'd  call  me  a  whore!  You  make  a 
                        living  from  it,  and  they  call  it 
                        literature!

           She  practically  spits  the  word.   And  then  she's  moving  down 
           the  beach  at  a  run...

           Scott  moves  to  run  after  her,  but  is  so  drunk,  he  stumbles 
           face  first  into  the  sand.

           EXT.  RAILROAD  TRACKS  -  PRE-DAWN

           Zelda  cuts  an  incongruous  figure  as  she  walks  down  the  middle 
           of  the  tracks,  her  feet  bare,  still  wrapped  in  her  silk 
           kimono.

           Her  eyes  are  swollen  and  red  from  crying.  She  chews  so 
           compulsively  on  her  lip,  that  she  does  not  even  realize  that 
           it's  bleeding...   The  TRAIN  WHISTLES  in  the  distance.   She’s 
           oblivious.

           The  light  from  the  train  appears  from  around  the  hillside.  
           Zelda  continues  to  walk  straight  into  it  --  unaware  of 
           anything  but  herself.   And  then:

                                 SCOTT  (O.S.)
                        Zelda!

           As  if  she  were  deaf  to  all  but  his  voice,  she  looks  up.

           He  is  bounding  toward  her;  before  she  can  react,  he  sweeps 
           her  from  the  path  of  the  train.  The  two  tumble  and  roll  in 
           the  dirt  beside  the  tracks,  until  he’s  wrapped  around  her, 
           protectively... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo  --  you've  got  to  try  to  feel  how 
                        much  I  love  you  --  how  much  of  nothing 
                        I  am  when  you're  gone  --

           He  adorns  the  back  of  her  neck  with  a  tender  flurry  of 
           kisses.

           ON  the  WAIL  of  an  INFANT:

           INT.  HOSPITAL  -  DAY

           SUPER:  OCTOBER  1921   ST.  PAUL,  MINNESTOA
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda  has  just  given  birth,  and  is  coming  out  of  the  stupor 
           of  her  efforts.   The  baby  girl  is  swaddled  in  her  arms;  Scott 
           gazes  at  them  with  terror  and  joy  in  equal  measure.

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh  God,  Goofo  --  I'm  drunk... 
                                  (the  baby  hiccups)
                        Isn't  she  smart  --  she  has  the  hiccups.  
                        I  hope  it's  beautiful  and  a  fool  --  a 
                        beautiful  little  fool.

           Scott  reaches  for  the  pen  on  Zelda's  medical  chart,  tears  a 
           piece  of  paper  from  it,  and  jots  down  her  words...

           CLOSE  ON  ZELDA’S  HAND

           With  an  ink  pen,  she  sketches  the  image  of  a  nude  woman 
           kneeling  in  a  champagne  goblet.

           Above  the  drawing  are  the  words:    THE  BEAUTIFUL  AND  DAMNED

           HOTEL  ROOM  -  THE  COMMODORE  -  ST.  PAUL

           Zelda  cradles  the  phone  between  shoulder  and  ear  while  she 
           sketches;  Scott  looking  at  a  series  of  drawings.   A  NANNY 
           tends  to  the  infant  Scottie  (now  almost  5  months  old)  in  the 
           b.g. 

                                 ZELDA

                        This  damn  place  is  18  below...

           She  pauses,  then  to  Scott:

                        doesn't  like  the  one  they've  got  now. 
                        He  thinks  the  man  on  the  cover  is  sort 
                        of  a  "debauched  edition"  of  himself...

                        He  wants  to  know  if  there's  any  other 
                        edition  of  you?

                                 SCOTT
                        Tell  him  I  dare  him  to  ask  me  that 
                        again  in  person.
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                                  (into  the  phone)
                        Scottie?   She's  awfully  cute  and  I  am 
                        very  devoted  to  her  -- 

           In  the  b.g.  the  Nanny  calms  the  infant,  who  has  begun  to  CRY.

           EXT.  PLAZA  HOTEL  -  NEW  YORK  CITY  -  MARCH  3RD  1922

           Zelda  and  Scott  emerge  from  a  cab,  as  the  BELLHOP  unloads  the 
           luggage.  Scottie  is  NOT  with  them.

           INT.  PRINCETON/YALE  CLUB  -  LOUNGE  -  EARLY  EVENING

           Scott  reads  from  THE  BEAUTIFUL  AND  DAMNED  to  a  standing-room 
           only  CROWD  of  SOCIETY  MEN  and  their  WIVES.  Zelda  stands  in 
           the  far  corner  of  the  room,  unaccompanied... 

                                 SCOTT
                           "What grubworms women are to crawl on 
                           their bellies through colorless 
                           marriages.  Marriage was created not to 
                           be a background, but to need one."

           These  are  shocking  words  for  the  time,  and  the  effect  on  some 
           MEMBERS  of  the  audience  is  unsettling. 

           The  effect  on  Zelda  is  equally  disturbing,  if  for  entirely 
           different  reasons:   these  are her  words,  nearly  to  the 
           letter,  yet  the  world  will  know  them  henceforth  as  the  work 
           of  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                           "Mine is going to be outstanding.  It 
                           can't, shan't be the setting -- it's 
                           going to be the performance, the live, 
                           lovely, glamorous performance and the 
                           world shall be the scenery.  I refuse 
                           to dedicate my life to posterity."

           Members  of  the  audience  exchange  disconcerted  looks.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                           "Surely one owes as much to the current 
                           generation as to one's unwanted 
                           children.  What a fate -- to grow 
                           rotund and unseemly, to lose my self-
                           love..."

           Scott  closes  the  book.  The  audience  is  SILENT.   Then,  a  beat 
           later,  one  PERSON  dares  to  CLAP,  joined  quickly  by  another, 
           then  more,  until  the  whole  room  stands  and  applauds...

           And  Zelda  is  suddenly  struck  by  the  full  weight  of  her 
           realization:  far  from  enjoying  the  spotlight  as  Scott’s  Muse, 
           she  is  about  to  be  eclipsed  by  the  shadow  of  his  fame  --  fame 
           that  is  built  at  least  in  part  on her  gift  with  words... 
           INT.  ALGONQUIN  HOTEL  -  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

           Zelda  and  Scott  wade  through  a  tied  of  anonymous  FANS  and 
           JOURNALISTS.   Scott  pauses  to  sign  a  book,  before  stepping 
           into  the  elevator  with  Zelda... 

           ALGONQUIN  HOTEL  -  H.L.  MENCKEN'S  SUITE  -  NIGHT

           It's  the  private  party  to  celebrate  the  release  of  the  book: 
           a  bigger,  more  elaborate  affair  than  the  party  at  George 
           Nathan's  place.   The  GUESTS,  all  part  of  the  Fitzgerald 
           Circle,  are  a  virtual  Who's  Who  of  the  Social  Register.  
           There  are  the  familiar  faces,  but  also  an  additional 
           smattering  of  CELEBRITIES  and  PHOTOGRAPHERS,  giving  the  party 
           a  whole  new  sheen. 

           Scott,  well  lubricated,  and  in  heated,  if  slurred,  discussion 
           with  Bunny  Wilson,  pulls  Perkins  into  the  debate:

                                 SCOTT
                        You  have  to  talk  to  him.   He  believes  --

                                 BUNNY
                                  (jumping  in)
                        The  three  major  influences  on  his  work 
                        are  the  Midwest  --  specifically  the 
                        society  of  St.  Paul  and  country  clubs. 
                        His  Irishness.   And  liquor  --

                                 SCOTT 
                        --  And  he  wants  to  print  that  in  the 
                           Bookman!   Not  only  is  he  wrong  --  but 
                        he's  altogether  failed  to  recognize  the 
                        most  enormous  influence  on  me  in  the 
                        four  and  half  years  since  I  met  her  --

           He  glances  across  the  room  at  Zelda  with  a  look  of  attachment 
           beyond  love  --  a  distortion  of  love  in  its  neediness.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        --  The  complete,  fine,  and  full-hearted 
                        selfishness  and  chillmindedness  of 
                        Zelda!

           His  face  is  infused  with  gin  and  adoration...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (suddenly  distracted)
                        In  fact  she’s  reviewing  the  book  in  the 
                        Tribune!   Zelda!   Why  don't  you  read  it 
                        for  the  group?

           Zelda  is  more  embarrassed  than  flattered  by  Scott's  display.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  would  Dear,  but  I  did  the  appropriate 
                        thing  and  left  it  at  home.

           Scott  pulls  her  type-written  piece  from  his  jacket  pocket.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ve  got  it  right  here!

           Zelda  flushes  red  with  shame  and  frustration.  Scott  unfolds 
           the  paper,  and  steps  up  onto  the  nearest  chair.

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott  --  please  --  don't  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (reading  the  title)
                        "Friend  Husband's  Latest"
                                  (beat)
                           “I note on the table beside my bed this 
                           morning a new book with an orange 
                           jacket entitled THE BEAUTIFUL AND 
                           DAMNED.  It is a strange book, which 
                           has for me an uncanny fascination.  It 
                           has been lying on that table for two 
                           years. I have been asked to analyze it 
                           carefully in the light of my brilliant 
                           critical insight, my tremendous 
                           erudition, and my vast impressive 
                           partiality.  Here I go!"

           To  Zelda's  surprise,  the  room  is  LAUGHING;   Scott's  reading 
           only  underscores  her  sense  of  irony,  which  of  course  begs  the 
           question:    much  of  what  people  attribute  to  her  as 
           eccentricity,  may  in  fact  be  irony  that  goes  unobserved...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                           "Its value as a manual of etiquette is 
                           incalculable.  Where could you get a 
                           better example of how NOT to behave 
                           than from the adventures of Gloria?"

           Even  in  Scott’s  boozed-up  diction,  this  paragraph  gets  a  more 
           enthusiastic  round  of  LAUGHTER  than  the  last.  Zelda’s  face  is 
           a  complex  map  of  pride,  guilt  and  vindication. 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                           "It's a wonderful book to have around 
                           in case of emergency.  No one should 
                           ever set out in pursuit of unholy 
                           excitement without a special vest 
                           pocket edition dangling from a string 
                           around the neck. For this book tells 
                           exactly, and with compelling lucidity, 
                           just what to do when cast off by a 
                           grandfather or when sitting around a 
                           station platform at 4 a.m., or when 
                           spilling champagne at a fashionable 
                           restaurant, or when told that one is 
                           too old for the movies.  Any of these 
                           things might come into anyone's life at 
                           any minute..."

           This  gets  an  UPROAR  of  LAUGHTER.  The  Guests  are  not  only 
           impressed,  but  surprised  by  Zelda's  humor  and  voice.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           George  Nathan,  standing  next  to  Zelda,  whispers  to  her:

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm  telling  you  --  if  we  could  publish 
                        that  diary  of  yours  --

           Zelda  shakes  her  head,  and  gestures  for  him  to  listen,  as  the 
           edge  in  Scott’s  voice  seems  to  bloom  with  spite  --  though  for 
           himself  or  for  Zelda,  it’s  not  clear...

                                 SCOTT 
                                  (still  reading)
                           "It seems to me that on one page I 
                           recognized a portion of an old diary of 
                           mine which mysteriously disappeared 
                           shortly after my marriage."

           George's  face  falls  with  disappointment...

                                 GEORGE
                        Please  tell  me  that  line  was  merely  for 
                        effect  --

                                 ZELDA
                        The  diary’s  been  misplaced  --

                                 GEORGE
                        You  think  he  scrapped  it?  Deliberately?  
                        So  no  one  would  know  just  how  much  of 
                        it  he  "borrowed."

                                 ZELDA
                                  (shrugs)
                        I  was  inclined  toward  a  more  generous 
                        explanation:  that  he  was  drunk  when  he 
                        set  it  down  somewhere,  and  by  the  time 
                        he  was  sober,  he  couldn't  recall...

                                 SCOTT
                                  (still  reading)
                        "... Scraps of letters which, though 
                           considerably edited, sound to me 
                           vaguely familiar.  In fact, Mr. 
                           Fitzgerald -- I believe that is how he 
                           spells his name -- seems to believe 
                           that plagiarism begins at home..."

           Now  the  LAUGHTER  is  accompanied  by  APPLAUSE...  And  George 
           Nathan  wraps  a  sympathetic  arm  around  Zelda...

           lions...

           AT  THE  SURFACE 

           Zelda  rises  from  the  sea  like  a  Venus  in  the  flesh,  luminous.  

           Jozan  appears  next  her,  then  plunges  down  again,  beneath  her, 
           teasing  her  to  join  him...

                        Scott  has  only  himself  to  blame  if  they 
                        are...

           HER  POV

           Jozan  and  Zelda  playing  a  game  of  “Trust”  in  the  surf  like 
           two  children:   he  stands  behind  her,  while  she  falls  backward

           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  DAY

           The  Murphys  are  watching  the  two  of  them  from  their  spot  on 
           the  beach.  

                                 GERALD
                        To  be  fair,  Zelda  would  be  a  handful 
                        for  any  man...

                                 SARA
                        That  my  dear,  is  not  necessarily  a

                        “handfuls”  go,  his  rivals  hers  any 
                        day...  

           Gerald  has  to  concede  this  with  a  smile.

                        At  dinner  the  other  night,  Scott  was 
                        watching  the  two  of  them  across  the 
                        table  as  if  from  behind  a  glass:  he  had 
                        that  beastly  little  notebook  of  his  on 
                        his  lap,  beneath  the  table.   And  I  saw 
                        him,  Gerald.  I  swear,  he  was  taking

           SUPER:  GREAT  NECK,  NEW  YORK,   AUTUMN  1922

           It  is  a  large,  rambling  home,  more  impressive  and  spacious 
           than  the  place  in  Westport... 

                                 ZELDA  (V.O.)
                        I love  Scott's  books  and  heroines. 
                        Rosalind  in This Side of Paradise --

           INT.  GREAT  NECK  HOUSE  -  SAME

           Zelda  is  seated  in  a  plastic,  overstuffed  chair,  speaking 
           with  A  REPORTER,  30ish,  from  The  Baltimore  Sun...

           She  is  nervous,  her  bottom  lip  raw  again  from  chewing. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I’ve  always  liked  her...  You  see,  I 
                        read  everything  he  writes.  
                                  (to  the  next  room)
                        Scott!  Why  don’t  you  come  in  and  join 
                        us... 

           The  Reporter  acknowledges  Scott  as  he  enters  with  a  nod; 
           Scott  takes  a  seat,  beaming  with  a  certain  pride.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Its  spoils  the  fun,  the  surprise,  I 
                        mean,  a  bit...  But  Rosalind!  I  like 
                        girls  like  that...  I  like  their 
                        courage,  their  recklessness  and 
                        spendthriftness.  Rosalind  was  the 
                        original  American  Flapper!

                                 SUN  REPORTER
                        Can  you  define  the  term,  "American 
                        Flapper?"

           Zelda  looks  to  Scott  as  if  for  encouragement.  He  nods:  “Go 
           ahead.”   There’s  an  uncertainty  about  her  now  --  so  very 
           different  from  the  girl  she  was  in  Montgomery.
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  --  the  word  “Flapper”  is  sorter’ 
                        like  code  for  “living  well.”   I  know 
                        some  people  must  think  of  it  as  a 
                        synonym  for  a  lack  of  respectability  -- 
                        but  you  see  --  once  a  girl  perceives 
                        that  boys do  dance  most  with  the  girls 
                        they  kiss  most,  and  that  men will  marry 
                        the  girls  they  could  kiss  before  they 
                        asked  papa  --  Well  then  she  has  no 
                        choice  but  to  wake  from  that  lethargy 
                        of  sub-debism,  bob  her  hair,  put  on  her 
                        choicest  pair  of  earrings  and  a  great 
                        deal  of  audacity  and  rouge  and  go  into 
                        battle.  A  Flapper  flirts  because  it’s 
                        fun.  And  she  refuses  to  be  bored 
                        chiefly  because  she  herself  isn’t 
                        boring.

           Where  there  used  to  be  a  spontaneity  and  conviction  in  her 
           voice,  there  is  now  a  sense  of  obligation:  she’s  giving  the 
           response  that  Scott  would  want  to  hear...

                                 SCOTT
                                  (to  the  Reporter)
                        How  about  I  ask  her  a  few  questions?

           The  Reporter  turns  the  session  over  to  Scott.  

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (to  Zelda)
                        What  would  your  ideal  day  constitute? 

           Again,  he  seems  to  be  anticipating  a  “correct”  answer: 

                                 ZELDA
                        Peaches  for  breakfast...  Then  golf. 
                        Then  a  swim.  Then  just  being  lazy.  Not 
                        eating  or  reading,  but  being  quiet  and 
                        hearing  pleasant  sounds.   The  evening  -- 
                        ?  A  large,  brilliant  gathering,  I 
                        believe. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are  you  ambitious? 

           Zelda  balks.   Chews  reflexively  at  her  lip,  then  stops  at  a 
           gesture  from  Scott. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Not  especially,  but  I’ve  plenty  of 
                        hope.

           With  this  statement,  all  pretense  falls  away:   this  is  the 
           one  authentic  comment  in  the  whole  interview:  she  is 
           desperate  for  an  identity  of  her  own...  And  if  Scott  were  a 
           dog,  the  hair  on  his  neck  would  rise... 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT
                        And  what  about  Scottie?   What  do  you 
                        want  her  to  be  when  she  grows  up? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Not  great  and  serious  and  melancholy 
                        and  inhospitable.   But  rich  and  happy 
                        and  artistic.  

                                 SCOTT
                        And  what  would  you  do  if  you  had  to 
                        earn  a  living?

           The  question  has  the  hint  of  a  threat  about  it. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I’ve  studied  ballet.   I’d  try  to  get  a 
                        place  in  the  Follies.   Or  the  movies.   If 
                        I  wasn’t  successful,  I’d  try  to  write.

           Scott  turns  to  the  Reporter,  his  expression  suggesting  that 
           the  session  ends  here.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I  think  that  should  give  you  quite  a 
                        bit  of  material  -- 

                                 SUN  REPORTER
                        I  have  just  one  last  question,  if  I 
                        may? 

           Scott  nods... 

                                 SUN  REPORTER  (CONT'D)
                        How  would  you  describe  your  wife? 

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s  the  most  charming  person  in  the 
                        world... 

           Zelda’s  expression  says  that  there  was  a  time  when  those 
           words  wouldn’t  have  sounded  so  hollow.

           ON  the  CLICK  of  a  SHUTTER  and  a  FLASH  OF  LIGHT: 

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           ON  ZELDA  &  SCOTT 

           In  what  would  become  their  most  iconic  image  -  the  essence  of 
           Jazz  Age  sophistication:  his  arm  around  her,  their  faces 
           cheerless.  The  CLICK  of  a  SHUTTER  and  a  FLASH  GOES  OFF.  

           The  SHOT  FREEZES,  and  the  MASTHEAD  FADES  IN  above  them: 

                                   HEARST  INTERNATIONAL
           INT.  PALM  COURT  -  PLAZA  HOTEL  -  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  &  Scott  are  there  with  Max  Perkins  and  Harold  Ober.  

           On  the  table  is  a  collection  of  newspapers  from  around  the 
           country,  each  carrying  that  SAME  ICONIC  IMAGE.  Ober  beams,  as 
           Scott  knocks  back  another  drink.   Scott,  with  a  wry  smile. 

                                 SCOTT
                        So  I  guess  it’s  all  downhill  from  here  -- 

                                 OBER
                        Are  you  kidding?   This  is  unique  in  the 
                        history  of  publishing:  you’re  a 
                        literary  star  and  you’re  not  even  24 
                        years  old!   If  we  get  that  next  book  of 
                        yours,  we  can  capitalize  on  this  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (dodging)
                        We’re  thinking  about  going  over  to 
                        Europe  --  A  change  of  scenery...  It 
                        might  help  the  novel  along... 

           Zelda  takes  her  moment.

                                 ZELDA
                                  (venturing)
                        Max  --  I  was  wondering  -- 

                                 PERKINS
                        Your  short  story!  Yes  --

           Zelda  nods,  timid... 

                                 PERKINS  (CONT'D)
                        I  had  a  grand  time  reading  it!

           Her  face  is  vibrant  with  a  sudden  smile.  

                                 PERKINS  (CONT'D)
                        A  lyrical  sense  of  description, 
                        metaphors  that  take  on  lives  of  their 
                        own  --

                                 HAROLD
                        He  gave  it  to  me  last  week  and  I  think 
                        I’ve  found  a  place  for  it:  the  Chicago 
                        Tribune  is  interested. 

           Zelda  is  beside  herself...

                                 HAROLD  (CONT'D)
                        They’re  offering  a  thousand  dollars  for 
                        it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s  wonderful!
           CONTINUED:

                                 HAROLD
                        But  they  want  to  publish  it  under 
                        Scott’s  name... 

           And  like  that,  her  eyes  lose  their  spark. 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (to  Zelda)
                        Not  my  name  alone  --  alongside  yours  -- 

                                 HAROLD
                        No...  I’m  afraid  they  want  Scott’s  name 
                        exclusively.  

           As  if  she’s  flipped  a  switch,  Zelda  seems  to  shrug  it  off, 
           just  as  a  roaming  PHOTOGRAPHER  appears,  flashing  a  press 
           badge. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        How  about  one  for  the  society  pages?

           Max  and  Harold  gracefully  cedes  the  lime  light  to  Scott  and 
           Zelda,  who  oblige,  perking  up  for  the  camera.  

           As  the  Photographer  leaves,  they  picks  up  the  conversation.  

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  --  A  thousand  dollars  --  We 
                        certainly  won’t  have  any  trouble 
                        finding  a  way  to  spend  it!  

                                 SCOTT
                        If  it  hasn’t  already  been  spent... 

                                 PERKINS
                        Do  you  need  another  advance? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not  just  yet.  That’s  part  of  Europe’s 
                        appeal:   with  the  exchange  rate  what  it 
                        is,  we  can  live  on  a  third  of  the 
                        money... 

                                 ZELDA
                        With  a  little  luck,  we  might  even 
                        manage  to  put  some  away... 

           ON  the  BEEP  of  a  CAR’S  HORN:

                                                                   CUT  TO:

           EXT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  FRENCH  RIVIERA  -  1924  -  LATE  AFTERNOON

           High  above  the  sea,  surrounded  by  terraced  gardens,  palm, 
           pine,  and  silver  olive  trees.  It  has  a  series  of  Moorish 
           balconies  in  brilliant  white  and  blue  that  face  the 
           Mediterranean  and  give  it  an  air  of  an  exotic  fortress.   So 
           much  for  economizing... 
           CONTINUED:

           A  winding  gravel  drive  leads  to  the  entrance,  at  the  base  of 
           which  Sara  and  Gerald  Murphy  idle  in  their  Mercedes  10/40/65 
           with  the  top  down.  

                                 SARA
                        Zelda,  Dear!

           Zelda  appears  at  one  of  the  many  windows,  and  gestures  with  a 
           wave:  she’ll  be  right  down.  A  flash  of  the  puckish,  spirited 
           Zelda  we  met  in  Montgomery.

           INT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  SAME

           We  FOLLOW  Zelda  as  she  makes  her  way  through  the  house  --  the 
           interior  every  bit  as  elegant  and  old  world  as  the  exterior.  

           She  AD-LIBS  INSTRUCTIONS  to  the  NANNIE,  gives  SCOTTIE  a  kiss 
           goodbye... 

           INT.  SCOTT’S  OFFICE  -  VILLA  MARIE  -  SAME

           Scott  is  at  his  desk:  a  typewriter,  a  glass,  and  a  carafe  of 
           water.  He  is  writing  long  hand,  sunk  in  the  rabbit-hole  of 
           concentration.  

           ANOTHER  ANGLE  -  ON  ZELDA

           She’s  at  the  door,  peering  in,  beach  tote  in  hand,  dressed 
           for  a  day  at  the  shore... 

           She  watches  him  work,  as  awestruck  by  his  gift  for  focus  and 
           discipline  as  he  is  by  her  spontaneity.  

           She  approaches  silently,  kisses  him  lightly  on  the  back  of 
           his  neck.   He  nearly  starts. 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (smiling)
                        Sara  and  Gerald  are  waiting 
                        downstairs...

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t  have  too  much  fun  without  me... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Impossible,  Goofo... 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (eager)
                        I’ve  figured  out  the  whole  first  third 
                        of  the  novel... 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  just  knew  this  place  would  be  good  to 
                        us... 

           Scott  nods.  Zelda’s  eyes  shine  with  deep  satisfaction  on  his 
           behalf. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        So  I’ll  leave  you  to  it  -- 

           She  heads  off...  A  half  beat,  and  Scott  is  out  of  his  chair 
           with  his  pad  in  hand. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Wait!

           EXT.  STAIRCASE  -  SAME

           Zelda  all  but  dances  down  the  steps  to  the  front  door.   Scott 
           comes  down  after  her...

                                 SCOTT
                        “Among  Ashes  and  Millionaires!”

                                 ZELDA
                        Too  judgemental. 

           Her  replies  are  instantaneous  and  unfiltered... 

                                 SCOTT
                        “The  High-Bouncing  Lover?”

                                 ZELDA
                        That  is you  my  Dear!

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay...  One  more:   “The  Great  Gatsby!”

           She’s  at  the  door  and  pauses,  turns  to  look  up  at  him.   Her 
           face  brightens... 

                                 ZELDA
                        That’s  the  one... 

           Scott  nods:  he  craves  her  approval  and  basks  in  receiving  it 
           as  he  watches  her  exit  with  the  Nanny  and  Scottie  in  tow. 

           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  DAY 

           Zelda  and  Sara  walk  along  the  wet  sand.   In  the  b.g.,  Gerald, 
           the  Children,  and  OTHERS  are  ensconced  with  chairs  and  towels 
           beneath  an  umbrella  in  the  sand.  

           Zelda  gathers  shells  and  pretty  stones  as  they  walk.  

                                 ZELDA
                                  (suddenly)
                        Sara?

           Sara,  ever  serene,  looks  up  from  her  magazine.  

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        When  did  you  know  you  were  an  artist? 

           Sara  isn’t  sure  she  understands  the  question...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        I  mean  was  there  a  moment  when  suddenly 
                        you  knew:  “I’m  here  on  this  earth  to 
                        paint?”

                                 SARA
                                  (smiling)
                        Well  it  helped  that  my  father 
                        manufactured  ink  --  if  that’s  what  you 
                        mean...  I’ve  been  drawing  ever  since  I 
                        can  remember.  So  painting  sets  --  well 
                        it’s  just  drawing  writ  large,  isn’t  it?

           Zelda  takes  this  in...

                                 SARA  (CONT'D)
                        Why  do  you  ask,  Dear? 

           Her  tone  and  manner  is  almost  maternal... 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  don’t  know...  I  suppose  I  wish  I  had 
                        some  particular  talent... 

                                 SARA
                        My  God  Zelda!  You’re  the  most  creative 
                        person  I  know  --  there’s  nothing  you  do 
                        that  isn’t  -- 

           Zelda  tosses  her  a  skeptical  look.

                                 SARA  (CONT'D)
                        In  fact  just  this  morning,  watching  you 
                        come  down  the  drive  in  that  white 
                        sundress  of  yours...  I  was  thinking  I’d 
                        like  one  just  like  it,  and  that  I 
                        hadn’t  seen  it  in  the  shops  --  then 
                        realized  that  it’s  one  you  had  made 
                        yourself... 

           Zelda  considers  this:  could  Sara  be  right?

                                 ZELDA
                        My mother  taught  me  to  sew.  It’s  what 
                        she  thought  a  well  bred  woman  had  to 
                        know... 
                                  (beat)
                        I  used  to  dance  -- 

           Her  thoughts  are  interrupted  by  the  BUZZ  of  Jozan’s  bi-plane 
           as  it  sweeps  through  the  sky  just  above  them.  

           Zelda  tips  her  head  skyward  with  a  beaming  smile  and  waves  -- 
           relieved  to  have  the  distraction  from  her  own  concerns... 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Edouard!
           EXT.  LA  GAROUPE  BEACH  -  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  and  Jozan  are  the  water’s  edge,  bronzed  and  half-wet, 
           building  a  sand-castle  --  not  the  “drip”  sort  we  saw  Zelda 
           create  earlier  with  the  children. 

           This  is  something  more  constructed,  architectural:  a  fantasy 
           home...  And  the  two  of  them  work  in  perfect,  silent 
           collaboration,  forming  walls,  carving  out  windows  and  stairs. 

           Jozan  stops  to  watch  her  work,  her  front  teeth  digging  into 
           her  lower  lip. 

           Zelda  suddenly  pauses,  sensing  his  eyes  on  her:  she  looks  up. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Qu-est-ce  qu’il  y  a?  

           Her  French  is  nearly  fluent...  He  responds  in  kind,  so  their 
           whole  exchange  is  in  French,  w/  Subtitles.  

                                 JOZAN
                        I  was  thinking  we  could  build  this 
                        house... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Isn’t  that  what  we’re  doing...? 

                                 JOZAN
                        I  mean  on  a  cliff. 

           He  doesn’t  give  her  time  to  negate  him,  but  instead  looks 
           around,  then  points  into  the  distance. 

                                 JOZAN  (CONT’D)
                        Say  that  one  there...  A  bedroom,  with  a 
                        grand  picture  window  that  looks  out 
                        over  the  sea... 

           Zelda  stares  at  him,  blushing...  She  swallows  hard,  then 
           shakes  her  head  ever  so  slightly... 

           They  are  both  so  distracted  by  their  exchange  that  they  don’t 
           see  the  large  wave  sneak  up  behind  them:  it  crashes  down  just 
           shy  of  them.

           Zelda  SQUEALS  with  LAUGHTER  in  the  spray  of  the  water,  and 
           Jozan  throws  himself  in  front  of  the  sand  castle.  But  the 
           tongue  of  the  water  creeps  up  and  over  him.  

           As  it  retreats,  it  takes  the  sand  castle  with  it... 

           INT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  DUSK

           Zelda  enters  the  house.

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo!

           SILENCE.

                        Mama!

           The  baby  toddles  out  of  the  kitchen  area,  the  Nanny  just 
           behind  her.  Zelda  scoops  the  baby  up  in  her  arms... 

                                 ZELDA
                        My  very  own  little  princess!

           Scottie  glows  in  the  high  beam  of  her  mother’s  attention. 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Come  --  let’s  go  find  Daddy. 

           AT  THE  DOOR  TO  SCOTT’S  STUDY:  Zelda  knocks  on  the  door  with 
           her  free  hand.  SILENCE...  She  turns  the  knob  and  peers  in.  
           Scott  is  so  immersed  in  writing,  that  he  doesn’t  register 
           their  presence... 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                                  (quiet)

                                  (a  bit  louder)
                        Scott...

           He  looks  up  as  if  stepping  out  of  a  dream. 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        We’re  going  to  the  Murphys  in  about  an 
                        hour  -- 

           Scott’s  face  wrinkles  with  annoyance. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not  tonight  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        What  do  you  mean  “not  tonight”  --  we’ve 
                        made  plans.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Then  cancel  them  --  Or  go  on  your  own.

           The  exchange  becomes  more  contentious;  Scottie  begins  to 
           squirm  in  Zelda’s  arms...

                                 ZELDA
                        And  tell  them  what?

                                 SCOTT
                        The  truth:  that  I’m  in  the  thick  of  a 
                        chapter  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Just  leave  it  for  an  hour  or  two  -- 
                        it’ll  be  there  when  we  get  back  --

                        No!  It won’t!  It’s  here  now!  You  know 
                        how  hard  this  is  for  me...  For  once 
                        it’s  flowing  through  me.

                        I  have  to  write  it  now...  Or  I’ll  lose 
                        it... 

                                 ZELDA
                        There’s  a  world  of  things  you  might 
                        lose!

                        For  the  love  of  God,  Zelda!  

           With  that,  Scottie  joins  in  the  fray  with  a  piercing  WAIL... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Can’t  you  leave  me  alone!  Just once! 
                        Can’t  you  let  me  work...?  

                                 ZELDA
                        That’s  what  you  want? 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s  ALL  I  want!

           Scottie  continues  to  BAWL;  the  Nanny  appears  in  the  hallway, 
           and  rushes  to  take  Scottie  off  of  Zelda’s  hands. 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (yelling)
                        And  Mr.  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald  always  gets 
                        what  he  wants!

           And  she’s  gone. 

           EXT.  HOTEL  DU  CAP  -  THE  MURPHY’S  VILLA

           Zelda  is  at  the  door  alone.   She  KNOCKS. 

                                 SARA  (O.S.)
                        Will  someone  please  get  that?

           The  door  opens:  Zelda  is  pleasantly  surprised  to  see  Jozan.  

           INT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  LATE  NIGHT

           Home  from  the  party,  Zelda  wanders  through  the  house, 
           aimless.  Her  footsteps  echo  in  the  emptiness  of  the  rooms.  

           Then  she  sees  the  car  keys  hanging  from  a  hook  on  the  wall 
           near  the  front  door.  
           INT.  SCOTT’S  OFFICE  -  VILLA  MARIE  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Zelda  appears  at  the  door  to  his  office,  car  keys  in  hand. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  feel  like  taking  a  drive  --  care  to 
                        join  me...?

           Scott  pops  from  his  chair,  and  as  if  he  never  heard  the 
           question,  begins  to  pace  and  read  excitedly  from  the  pad  in 
           his  hand... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just  listen  to  this:   “... Daisy 
                           tumbled short of his dreams -- not 
                           through her own fault, but because of 
                           the colossal vitality of his illusion.  
                           It had gone beyond her, beyond 
                           everything. “

           Zelda  watches  from  the  threshold,  her  eyes  tearing  up...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        “He had thrown himself into it with a 
                           creative passion, adding to it all the 
                           time, decking it out with every bright 
                           feather that drifted his way. No amount 
                           of fire or freshness can challenge what 
                           a man will store up in his ghostly 
                           heart...”   What  do  you  think? 

           But  when  he  looks  up,  Zelda  is  gone... 

           EXT.  BEACH  -  BELOW  THE  VILLA  MARIE  -  NIGHT

           A  long  stretch  of  deserted  shore.   Zelda  is  there  alone, 
           letting  the  ocean  lap  at  her  feet. 

                                 JOZAN  (O.S.)
                        Close  your  eyes... 

           Zelda  smiles  at  the  sound  of  the  familiar  VOICE. 

                                 JOZAN  (CONT'D)
                        Do  you  trust  me? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh...  I  like  this  game... 

                                 JOZAN
                        Different  rules...  

                                 ZELDA
                        How  can  I  trust  you  if  you’re  changing 
                        the  rules...?

                                 JOZAN
                        I  will  show  you  that  you  can  -- 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        Now  what’s  the  fun  in  that? 

                                 JOZAN
                        Keep  your  eyes  closed,  you  will  see  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Maybe  we’d  all  see  a  whole  lot  better 
                        with  our  eyes  closed.   ‘Cause  keeping 
                        them  open  doesn’t  seem  to  prevent  us 
                        from  missing  what’s  all  but  sitting 
                        right  there  at  the  end  of  our  nose... 

           As  Zelda  speaks,  Jozan  has  begun  to  unbutton  the  back  of  her 
           cotton  dress.   And  for  every  button  undone,  he  bestows  a 
           kiss,  going  down  her  spine.  

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        What’s  the  word  for  this? 

                                 JOZAN
                                  (bestowing  a  kiss)
                        Un  baiser... 

                                 ZELDA
                        No.   Not  that... That...  The  way  I’m 
                        all  over  hot  and  cold  and  if  you  touch 
                        me  again  I  just  might  never  catch  my 
                        breath  -- 

           His  tenderness  and  attentiveness  are  a  long  way  from  Scott’s 
           more  urgent,  hungry  physicality... 

                                 JOZAN
                        I  think  there  is  no  sufficient  word  for 
                        this  in  any  language.  

           INT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  BEDROOM  -  LATE  MORNING

           Zelda  is  packing  up  her  things.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda?

           She  continues  to  pack. 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Zelda  --  what’s  gotten  into  you? 

           She  glances  up  at  him,  her  expression  enigmatic.  Then  goes 
           back  to  packing. 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (bursting)
                        What  in  God’s  name  are  you  doing!

           She  winces  at  his  outburst,  but  continues,  methodically  to 
           fill  her  bag. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        I’m  in  the  middle  of  reading  something 
                        to  you  --  looking  for  help  --  and  the 
                        next  thing  I  know  you’re  gone...  And 
                        I’m  up  all  fucking  night  in  a  flop 
                        sweat  because  I’m  certain  you’ve  driven 
                        the  car  over  a  cliff!

           She  looks  at  him  now,  as  if  to  point  out:  “Well  I  didn’t.”

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        For  Christ’s  sake,  say  something!

           They  start  talking  over  one  another. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This  is  a  joke...

                        time  talking  to  me  in  the  last  three 
                        weeks  combined... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just  as  I’m  doing  my  best  work  --

                                 ZELDA
                        You  should  be  relieved!   I’ll  be  gone  -- 
                        you  can  work  in  peace  --

                                 ZELDA 
                        Far  from  it:  I  want  to  leave  you  alone.  
                        That’s  what  you  said  you  wanted.   To  be 
                        left  alone.   A  divorce  just  makes  it 
                        legal  --

           CONTINUED: (2)

           The  condescension  is  almost  as  thick  as  the  anger.  Zelda 
           looks  at  him,  defiant...

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        You  don’t  know  the  first  thing  about 
                        taking  care  of  yourself  --  or  anyone 
                        else  for  that  matter  --  You  have  no 
                        skills  --  no  way  to  make  a  living  -- 
                        not  to  mention  what  you’d  do  with 
                        Scottie!   You  wouldn’t  last  six  minutes 
                        on  your  own  --

                        I’m  not on  my  own,  Scott... 

           It’s  a  blow:  Scott  goes  silent.  Then:

           There  is  so  much  truth  in  that,  Scott  has  no  reply.   After  a 
           beat,  Scott  steps  away,  then  out  of  the  room.   We  HEAR  the 
           CLICK  of  a  LOCK  from  the  other  side.

           INT.  MASTER  BEDROOM  -  DAY

           A  SERIES  OF  SHOTS: 
           CONTINUED:

           The  sequence  of  images  shows  us  a  woman  turning  inward  --  the 
           only  way  “out”  of  her  emotional  and  financial  prison:

           *  Zelda  is  perched  in  front  of  the  window,  facing  the  water, 
           where  along  a  small  stretch  of  sand,  Jozan  lingers  about.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)
                                  (composing  the 
                                   letter)
                           “You and I haven’t been happy just 
                           once. We’ve been happy a thousand 
                           times.” 

           *  Zelda  sleeps.  

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                           “The chances that the spring may belong 
                           to us are pretty bright because as 
                           usual...“

           *  The  bi-plane  rolling  and  turning  against  a  blue  sky,  and 
           then  reflected  in  the  water... 

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “I can carry most of contemporary 
                           literary opinion, liquidated, in the 
                           hollow of my hand.“

           *  Zelda  wakes  with  a  start... 

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                           “And when I do, I see the swan floating 
                           on it and-- I find it to be you and you 
                           only... “

           *  Zelda  on  the  bed,  smoking  a  cigarette  and  blowing  smoke 
           rings.  Staring  at  the  smoke  rings,  she  seems  to  lose  herself 
           in  them.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “But, Swan, float lightly, because by 
                           the exquisite curve of your neck the 
                           gods gave you some special favor...”

           *  The  smoke  rings,  shifting,  and  undulant,  like  the  water.

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “And even though you fractured it 
                           running against some man-made bridge, 
                           it can heal and you can sail onward.”

             *  Zelda’s  at  the  window  looking  out:  the  small  stretch  of 
           sand  is  empty  today. 

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “Forget the past... Turn about and swim 
                           back home to me, to your haven...”

           *  UNDERWATER,  sun  beams  rippling  in  the  clear  blue  sea,  as 
           Zelda  and  Scott  plunge  beneath  the  surface,  hand  in  hand, 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “ -- Even though it may seem a dark cave 
                           at times and lit with torches of fury; it 
                           is the best refuge for you -- “

           *  Zelda,  asleep,  wakes  with  a  YELP,  as  the  cigarette  has 
           burned  down  to  her  flesh.  

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “Turn gently... and sail back...

           *  A  letter  appears  beneath  the  door:  it  is  from  Scott.   Zelda 
           picks  it  up  like  something  precious,  which  might  shatter...

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “The good things... stay with me 
                           forever, and you should feel like I do -
                           - that they can be renewed...”

           She  opens  it  carefully,  and  walking  back  toward  the  window, 
           she  reads...

                                 SCOTT  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “I love you my darling, darling... “

           Zelda  glances  up,  lingers  there  a  moment, then  flips  the  face 
           of  her  platinum  watch,  so  she  can  see  the  inscription: 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (just  barely  audible)
                        From  Scott  to  Zelda... 

           Then  she  steps  from  the  window,  and  returns  to  the  bedroom 
           door.   She  hesitates  before  reaching  for  the  knob.  

           When  she  does,  it  gives  no  resistance  when  she  turns  it... 
           The  door  has  been  open  all  along:  to  some  degree  her 
           isolation  was  self-imposed... 

           EXT.  MEDITERRANEAN  SEA  -  DAY

           Zelda  is  back  in  the  ocean,  swimming  offshore... 

           INT.  HOTEL  DU  CAP  -  THE  MURPHY’S  VILLA  -  NIGHT

           All  the  usual  suspects  from  the  New  York  set  including  John 
           Bishop  and  his  WIFE,  ARCHIBALD  &  ADA  MACLEISH,  and  a  host  of 
           NEWER  FACES  from  Europe... 

           Food  and  liquor  alike  are  plentiful.   Zelda,  more  withdrawn 
           than  usual,  moves  through  the  crowd,  like  an  observant 
           phantom. 

           She  pauses  a  moment,  catching  sight  of  Scott  across  the  room, 
           in  an  animated  discussion  with  a  tall,  powerful  YOUNG  MAN 
           dressed  in  a  torn  fisherman’s  shirt,  and  ragged  workingman’s 
           pants:  ERNEST  HEMINGWAY.  
           CONTINUED:

           ON  SCOTT  &  ERNEST:  Scott,  animated  by  liquor,  is  on  a  tear: 

                                 SCOTT
                        The  brief  episodes,  the  hard  hammered 
                        words,  the  staccato  sentences  --  al-
                        together  a  remarkable  expression  of  the 
                        world  as  you  see  it  -- 

           ON  ZELDA:  as  she  slips  her  dress  off  her  shoulders,  letting 
           it  fall  in  a  puddle  around  her  feet...  She  steps  out  of  her 
           shoes,  and  in  nothing  but  a  silken  shift,  walks  barefoot 
           through  the  crowd  toward  Scott...

           The  two  men  remain  oblivious,  as  all  around  them  the  room 
           goes  quiet...  All  eyes  but  Scott’s  are  on  Zelda.

           She  keeps  a  steady  eye  on  him,  as  if  willing  him  to  notice 
           her...  But  he  doesn’t:  he’s  too  taken  with  Hemingway.  

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        I  took  the  liberty  of  sending  the 
                        manuscript  to  Max  -- 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                                  (with  disbelief)
                        --  Perkins? 

           And  now,  Zelda  appears  at  Scott’s  side,  dressed  ONLY  IN  HER 
           SLIP,  and  drapes  herself  around  Scott. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Care  for  a  swim?

           Scott  turns  now,  seeing  her  as  if  she’d  just  materialized 
           before  him... 

           Hemingway  is  clearly  alarmed;  Zelda’s  “Mona  Lisa”  smile 
           suggests  she  takes  a  certain  pleasure  in  his  discomfort.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Come  on  Goofo  --  I  dare  you... 

           EXT.  HOTEL  DU  CAP  -  NIGHT

           In  his  boxers,  Scott  follows  Zelda  out  to  the  promontory, 
           over  which  the  hotel  is  built.  A  half-moon  hangs  in  the  sky.

           INTERCUT  BETWEEN  THE  TERRACE  &  CLIFFSIDE

           The  Murphys  and  OTHERS,  gather  to  watch... 

           Zelda,  absorbed  in  thought,  walks  to  the  cliff’s  edge,  and 
           scrambles  easily  down  the  hill  to  the  lowest  of  the  notches.  

           Scott,  less  nimble,  and  clearly  more  inebriated,  follows.  

           A  few  of  the  Men  on  the  terrace  yell  out:   “That’a  boy!”  
           “Don’t  let  a   woman  show  you  up!”
           CONTINUED:

           The  Crowd  watches:  MOST  are  dumbstruck,  SOME  are  impressed,  a 
           FEW  are  concerned  --  Sara  and  Gerald  among  them. 

                                 SARA
                                  (to  Gerald,  quiet)
                        What  goes  on  in  that  girl’s  head...

           Zelda  steps  up  to  the  notch,  and  she’s  about  to  dive:

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                                  (distant)
                        Take  the  high  dive!

           Zelda  turns  to  look  at  the  Murphy’s  terrace. 

           Sara  is  visibly  disturbed  by  the  suggestion... 

                                 SARA
                        You  don’t  think  she  has  enough  bright 
                        ideas  of  her  own  -- 

           But  other  VOICES  join  in,  until  half  the  party  is  CHANTING: 

                                 GROUP
                        High  dive,  high  dive,  high  dive!

           Scott  as  just  scrambled  up  to  join  her.   But  Zelda,  accepting 
           the  implied  dare  without  a  second  thought,  begins  to  climb  to 
           the  highest  notch.   Below,  the  CRASH  of  the  WATER  against  the 
           rocks  is  the  only  sound.  

           Hemingway  appears  behind  Sara... 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        She’s  a  lunatic...

                                 SARA
                        Any  more  lunatic  than  men  at  war? 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        If  she  doesn’t  kill  him  on  that  cliff, 
                        she’ll  do  it  some  other  way  --  spending 
                        his  money  the  way  she  does  -- 

           Sara  turns  on  him,  in  a  stage  whisper...

                                 SARA
                        Am  I  the  only  one  who  sees  that  money 
                        means  more  to  Scott  than  almost 
                        anything  else!?   He  resents  it  --  and 
                        people  who  have  it,  including  his  wife.  
                        But  he  also  craves  it...  And  if  he 
                        doesn’t  manage  to  make  enough  of  it, 
                        he’ll  die  of  drink  and  anger  long 
                        before  she  has  a  hand  in  it... 

           Hemingway  allows  himself  to  be  chastened  momentarily  as  they 
           both  turn  their  attention  to  the  cliffs.  
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Zelda  reaches  the  highest  notch,  and  steps  to  the  edge.  
           Scott  scrambles  up  behind  her  --  winded  from  the  climb.  

           The  whole  party  is  gathered  on  the  terrace.  We  HEAR  MUTTERING 
           and  COMMENTARY: 

                                 MAN’S  VOICE
                        Her  sense  of  timing  better  be  good  -- 
                        or  she’ll  dive  right  into  nothing  but 
                        rocks.

                                 WOMAN’S  VOICE
                        Does  anyone  know?  Is  the  tide  in,  or 
                        out? 

           Zelda  and  Scott,  small  against  the  sheer  face  of  the  cliff, 
           their  skin  slick  under  a  pale  moon.  They  stand  side  by  side 
           at  the  edge,  knees  bent,  arms  back,  leaning  into  the  void... 

               The image is a virtual negative of their joyful leap into the 
               sun... 

           And  then  their  arms  are  in  motion,  rushing  upwards  and:  Zelda 
           takes  off  like  an  animal  born  to  the  act,  soaring  out  over 
           the  abyss,  then  vanishing  into  it.  

           Scott  remains  alone  on  the  cliff...  He  turns  to  look  at  the 
           Crowd  on  the  terrace;  even  at  this  distance,  his  fear  for  her 
           is  palpable.  He  looks  back  down  at  the  water... 

           Zelda  surfaces,  her  face  caught  for  a  flash  in  the  moonlight. 

           INT.  HOTEL  DU  CAP  -  THE  MURPHY’S  VILLA  -  MASTER  BATH  -  LATER

           Zelda  is  in  the  bath.  Sara  enters  with  a  towel,  and  leaves  it 
           on  the  rim  of  the  tub.   Sara  is  about  to  take  her  leave,  then 
           pauses. 

                                 SARA
                        You  know  --  that  was  an  awfully 
                        dangerous  thing  to  do  -- 

           Zelda  smiles,  and  in  her  most  languid,  husky  voice: 

                                 ZELDA
                        But  Say-ra  --  Don’t  you  know  --  we 
                        don’t  believe  in  conservation... 

           Then  with  a  playful  wink,  Zelda  slips  down  beneath  the 
           surface  to  rinse  her  hair.  After  a  beat,  Sara  steps  out. 

           EXT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  DAY

           Zelda  is  in  the  garden,  setting  up  an  easel.  Scott  wanders 
           out,  speaking  as  he  approaches. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        Should  it  be  “Trimalchio  in  West  Egg?  
                        That’s  the  working  title.   Or  simply 
                        “Trimalchio?”   Or  “Gatsby:  The  High 
                        Bouncing  Lover.”  

           Zelda  starts  mixing  paints  on  a  palette. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Whatever  happened  to  “The  Great 
                        Gatsby?” 

                                 SCOTT
                        You  still  like  it?

           He’s  immediately  responsive  to  her  input  --  almost  needy.  And 
           only  now,  as  he’s  about  to  head  back  inside,  does  he  notice 
           what  she’s  been  doing. 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        You’re  painting ? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Why  not? 

           Scott  shrugs... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well  I  don’t  know...  Certainly  you  can 
                        sketch.  You’re  right:   painting  will  be 
                        a  nice  change  of  pace... 

           And  with  that,  she  watches  he  heads  back  toward  the  house  her 
           heart  breaking  on  the  spot  at  his  indifference...  

           CLOSE  ON  WORDS  AS  THEY  STREAM  FROM  THE  TIP  OF  A  PEN

           “Gatsby: ‘... She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for 
               hours.’ “

           “He broke off.” 

           INT.  VILLA  MARRIE  -  STUDY  -  SAME

           Scott  is  at  his  desk  which  faces  a  window.   He  pauses,  looks 
           out  to  see  Zelda  at  her  easel.   The  image  is  almost  pastoral. 

           He  starts  writing  again:  the  pen  moves  along,  SCOTT  SPEAKS 
           the  lines  under  his  breath  as  he  composes...  

           “Nick: ‘I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured. You 
               can’t repeat the past.” 

           “Gatsby: ‘Can’t repeat the past? Why of course you can! I’m 
               going to fix everything just the way it was before.  She’ll 
               see...’ “

           CLOSE  ON  ZELDA’S  HAND

           As  she  draws  a  picture  of  Jay  Gatsby.

                                 SCOTT  (O.S.)
                        Gatsby  has  one  of  those  smiles...  It’s 
                        understanding.   No  --  more  than 
                        understanding... 

           EXT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  VERANDA  -  LATE  AFTERNOON

           Zelda  is  there  with  Scott;  the  table  is  littered  with 
           drawings  of  Gatsby  --  each  slightly  different.  

                                 ZELDA
                        So  --  More  like  you  --

           The  sun  dips  on  the  ocean  horizon.  Zelda,  in  her  bathing 
           suit,  is  slim  and  berry  brown.   They  are  sipping  Cinzano,  and 
           collaborating.   The  scene  is  almost  idyllic.   She  is  happy.

                                 SCOTT
                        No.  Not  like  me.  I’m...  I’m  too 
                        delicate.  He’s  stronger.   More 
                        athletic. 

           She  finishes  one  more  sketch,  and  leaves  it  on  the  table 
           while  she  rises  to  get  a  cigarette.  Scott’s  face  lights  up.  

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        Yes!  That’s  him!   That’s  Jay  Gatsby!

           Ebullient,  he  picks  her  up  and  whirls  her  about,  then  gazes 
           at  her  --  grateful. 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        You  know  my  dear  --  If  I  weren’t  me  -- 
                        I’d  want  to  be  you... 

           Zelda  looks  up  at  him,  basking  in  his  praise... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        You  draw  the  same  way  you  dance,  or 
                        swim,  or  eat.   Even  the  way  you  speak.  
                        The  way  you  do  everything.   Effortless. 
                        I’ve  never  been  able  to  write  that  way.  

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott  --  You  write  the  way  a  genius 
                        writes  --  however  that  is  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        No...  I  have  to  wring  myself  for  every 
                        word.  And  each  one  more  hobbled  by 
                        liquor  and  ambition  than  the  next.   No  -
                        -  You  are  the  artist.  Not  me.  
                                 (MORE)
           CONTINUED:
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You  embody  it.   With  every  gesture.  
                        With  your  fearlessness.  Your  lack  of 
                        artifice.  I  have  to  manufacture  it.  
                        And  when  I  do,  I  make  sure  to  tell  the 
                        world  about  it,  because  God  forbid  I 
                        should  fall  short  of  my  own  delusions 
                        of  grandeur... 

           Zelda  smiles...  When  Scott  is  sober,  his  self-awareness  is  so 
           acute  --  and  part  of  why  she  loves  him. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well  --  if  everything’s  so  effortless  -- 
                        you’d  think  I’d  have  something  to  show 
                        for  it... 

           Scott  points  to  the  drawing. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s  something. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo  --  No  one’ll  ever  see  it  but  you  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        That  used  to  be  enough. 

           He  says  this  with  a  sense  of  loss  and  sadness,  not  anger.  

                                 ZELDA
                        I  know. 

           She  says  nothing  more. 

                                 SCOTT
                        And  what  about  the  columns  --  and  the 
                        short  stories? 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (smiling)
                        You  mean  the  ones  published  under  your 
                        name? 

           Scott  takes  this  in.  Then  after  a  beat: 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  have  to  go  back  to  work. 

           Before  he’s  stepped  inside,  she  ventures  another  thought. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott...  I’m  twenty-six  years  old.   And 
                        I  am,  in  every  respect,  a  useless 
                        thing... 

           Words  all  the  darker  for  the  calm  with  which  she  says  them.

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda  -- 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        No,  no...  Let  me  --  just  listen:  I’m  an 
                        amateur  dancer,  an  uncredited  writer, 
                        an  untried  actress,  a  novice  painter... 
                        In  fact  I  don’t  really  know  anything 
                        that’s  appropriate  for  someone  my  age.  
                        As  a  wife  --  well  I  went  ahead  and 
                        bungled  that  but  good... 

           She  smiles  even  through  tears. 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Let’s  see?   What  else...  As  a  mother?  
                        I  think  we  both  knew  it  wasn’t  going  to 
                        be  my  strong  suit...  Though  neither  one 
                        of  us  dared  to  speculate  on  just  what  a 
                        colossal  disappointment  I’d  prove  to 
                        be.  Honestly,  Goofo  --  She’d  be  better 
                        off  in  the  care  of  a  goat... 
                                  (beat)
                        I  want  to  be  really  good  at  something. 
                        Just  one  thing.   Good  enough  to  call  it 
                        mine. 

           Scott  doesn’t  know  what  to  say  in  the  face  of  these  truths 
           laid  bare.   Faced  with  his  own  fear  and  confusion,  he  lashes 
           out: 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why  are  you  saying  this  now? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Because  it’s  true.   I  just  didn’t  know 
                        it  til  now  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        You  couldn’t  wait  until  I’d  finished 
                        with  work  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Work!?  We’ve  been  working  all  day!  Look 
                        at  these  -- 

           She  snatches  at  a  handful  of  drawings  on  the  table. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This  is  just  like  you  -- 

           And  now  they  are  yelling  over  each  other. 

                                 ZELDA
                        How  many  --  Let’s  count  --  all  your 
                        precious  Mr.  Gatsby’s  -- 

           And  she  begins  to  count,  sending  each  one  over  the  balcony  on 
           a  current  of  air  as  she  does. 
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCOTT
                        For  every  day  I  work  on  the  novel, 
                        there  are  twenty  I  spend  on  that  drivel 
                        for  the  magazines  just  to  service  this 
                        burlesque  you  call  a  lifestyle!

                                 ZELDA
                        Is  it  burlesque  or  tragedy!?

                                 SCOTT 
                        You’re  doing  this  to  ruin  me  --  Christ! 
                        I’ll  be  doing  short  stories  til  I  choke 
                        on  them!

           And  he’s  gone. 

           EXT.  HOTEL  DU  CAP  -  THE  MURPHY’S  VILLA  -  NIGHT

           Scott  BANGS  on  the  door,  candle  in  hand,  his  whole  body 
           quaking  in  panic.  Sara  YELLS  from  inside  the  house: 

                                 SARA
                        Scott!  Go  away!  It’s  4  a.m.  for  the 
                        love  of  God!

           But  Scott  continues  to  BANG  on  the  door  until  Sara  opens  the 
           door  --  Gerald  appears  just  behind  her. 

                                 SARA  (CONT'D)
                        Dammit  Scott!  You  are  so  juvenile!

           Then  she  registers  the  agony  in  his  face.  Without  another 
           word,  Sara  and  Gerald  follow  Scott  out  into  the  rain: 

           INT.  VILLA  MARIE  -  BEDROOM  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Zelda’s  body  is  draped  over  Gerald,  as  the  latter  walks  her 
           back  and  forth.   Scott  is  slumped  on  the  floor,  drinking  from 
           his  flask  and  going  to  pieces.  Sara  is  looking  at  a  bottle  of 
           pills,  now  empty. 

                                 SARA
                        How  many  of  these  did  she  take? 

           Scott,  MURMURING  to  himself,  doesn’t  hear  the  question. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  don’t  know.  Maybe  it  was  half  full.

           Sara  picks  up  an  open  bottle  of  olive  oil,  and  fills  a  spoon 
           with  it.  She  approaches  Zelda  with  the  spoon... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh...  No  more,  Sara...  Please  don’t 
                        make  me  take  that...  Too  much  oil 
                        and...  And  I  will  spoil!  Spoiled.  I  am 
                        already!
                                  (a  giddy  laugh)

                        sorry  Goofo... 

           Scott  is  on  his  knees  in  front  of  her,  so  stricken  by  the 
           possibility  of  losing  her... 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  beg  you.  Turn  about.  Swim  back... 
                        We’ll  be  happy  again.   I  promise  you. 
                        We’ll  be  happy. 

           INT.  MURPHY’S  VILLA  -  LIVING  ROOM  -  DUSK

           A  wan  looking  Zelda,  is  there  with  Scott,  Sara,  Gerald, 
           Ernest,  his  wife,  HADLEY,  and  the  MacLeishes  are  there  along 
           with  a  few  OTHERS.   MUSIC  plays  on  a  record  player  in  the  b.g.

           Scott  is  hammered,  plying  Ernest  and  Hadley  with  questions: 

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright  --  Tell  the  truth:   did  you 
                        sleep  together  before  you  were  married?

           And  now  Sara  has  had  enough:

                                 SARA
                        Scott!  You  think  you  if  you  can  just 
                        ask  enough  questions  you’ll  get  to  know 
                        what  people  are  like?

           As  Sara  tears  into  him,  Zelda  observes  the  exchange, 
           impassive,  then  rises  from  her  seat.  

                                 SARA  (CONT'D)
                        But  you  won’t.   You  don’t  really  know 
                        anything  at  all  about  people!

           Scott’s  face  bloats  with  anger,  he  rises  and  heads  for  the 
           bar,  pours  himself  another  drink...  But  before  he  can  knock 
           it  back,  he’s  distracted: 

           Zelda,  her  skirts  above  her  waist,  is  dancing  to  the  MUSIC... 

           Sara,  Gerald,  and  the  others  sit  motionless,  watching  her.  

           But  Zelda  is  oblivious  to  her  audience.   She  is  not  dancing 
           for  them.   But  for  herself...  She  looks  neither  right,  nor 
           left;  she  catches  no  one’s  eye.  

           Instead,  she  seems  to  sink  deep  inside  herself,  as  she 
           surrenders  herself  to  the  rhythm,  yet  not  once  does  she 
           appear  clownish. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I  don’t  care  what  you  say  Sara,  he’s 
                        got  terrible  odds  against  him...

                        them.   You’ll  see  a  look  come  over  them 
                        as  though  they’re  being  drawn  together, 
                        waiting  for  something  to  happen. 
                        They’re  looking  forward  to  something 
                        fantastic.   Something  extravagant.

                        Well  he’s  going  to  follow  her  right  into

           INT.  FITZGERALD’S  CAR  -  NIGHT

           Scott  is  at  the  wheel,  with  a  bottle  of  champagne  braced 
           between  his  knees.  Zelda  is  next  to  him;  Hemingway  and 
           Archibald  MacLeish  are  squeezed  into  the  rumble  seat.  

           INT.  MURPHY’S  CAR  -  SAME

           Gerald,  Sara,  Ada,  and  Hadley  are  just  behind  Scott.

                                 SARA
                        Half  the  time  he  takes  this  curve,  I 
                        swear  he’s  going  off  the  cliff... 

           INT.  FITZGERALD’S  CAR  -  SAME

           Scott  takes  a  swig  from  the  bottle  of  champagne.

                                 SCOTT
                        Here’s  to  the  king  of  the  Second  Rates!

           He  takes  one  more  swig  from  the  bottle.  
           CONTINUED:

           And  now,  as  Scott  pulls  off  the  roadside  onto  a  gravel  area. 
           Rather  than  slow  down,  he  begins  to  put  on  speed. 

           INT.  MURPHY’S  CAR  -  SAME

           Gerald,  Sara,  Ada,  and  Hadley  blanch  white.  

           INT.  FITZGERALD’S  CAR  -  SAME

           He  swerves  so  that  the  car  nearly  turns  over,  as  it  rounds 
           the  gravel  patch...  And  then,  Scott  revs  the  motor,  and 
           drives  straight  for  the  cliff... 

           INT.  MURPHY’S  CAR  -  SAME

           Sara  is  at  once  terrified  and  outraged. 

                                 SARA
                        I  swear  I  will  kill  him  if  he  survives.

           INT.  FITZGERALD’S  CAR  -  SAME

           They  are  coming  fast  upon  the  edge  of  the  cliff... 

           And  just  as  it  appears  they  are  about  to  go  over,  Scott  JAMS 
           on  the  brakes,  bringing  the  car  to  a  precarious  stop.  Scott 
           hops  out  of  the  car,  red  faced  and  HOWLING  with  LAUGHTER.  But 
           he’s  cut  short,  when  Hemingway,  MacLeish,  and  Gerald  come 
           barrelling  at  him: 

                          HEMINGWAY
                 You  piss-for-brains  son-of-
                 whore!

                                               You  might  have  a  death-wish, 
                                               but  I’ll  be  goddamned  if  you 
                                               take  me  with  you!

                                               Scott!  Are  you  deranged! 

           Zelda  looks  on  with  blank  indifference,  as  the  Men  set  upon 
           Scott,  and  wrestle  him  to  the  ground.   Hemingway  throws  a 
           punch,  but  Gerald  deflects  it  before  it  lands...   Zelda  turns 
           to  head  inside.  Scott,  pinned  to  the  ground,  looks  up  at  the 
           three  men  with  an  incongruous  grin. 

                                 GERALD 
                        How  can  genius  be  so  perfectly 
                        senseless.

           Scott’s  LAUGHTER  is  all  bitterness.

           EXT.  ELLERSLIE  -  DUSK

           SUPER:  WILMINGTON,  DELAWARE   ELLERSLIE  ESTATES   MARCH  1927

           A  sprawling,  Greek  Revival  mansion,  with  two  stories,  and 
           massive  Doric  Columns  along  the  front.  

           INT.  ELLERSLIE  -  FOYER  -  SAME

           All  the  FAMILIAR  FACES  (Mencken,  Sara  Haardt,  Carl  Van 
           Vechten,  Ludlow  Fowler,  etc...)  as  Zelda  slips  into  the  role 
           of  hostess  --  only  where  there  used  to  be  warmth,  there  is  a 
           self-ironic  edge.   She’s  in  disguise,  and  she  knows  it.  

           Max  Perkins  and  his  WIFE  enter:  Zelda  moves  to  greet  them. 

           The  VALET  helps  remove  their  coats.  Max  takes  a  quick  look 
           around  and  exchanges  a  knowing  look  with  Zelda,  as  they  move 
           into  the  main  part  of  the  house: 

                                 PERKINS
                                  (ironic)
                        Hooray  for  Hollywood? 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  thought  we’d  never  get  out  of  there  -- 

                                 PERKINS
                        I  heard...Eight  weeks  of  work  --  for 
                        nothing.   And  I  still  haven’t  gotten 
                        his  chapters... 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s  going  so  slow,  it  could  be 
                        serialized  in  the  Encyclopedia 
                        Britannica.

           They  walk  past  the  open  door  to  the  KITCHEN:  Scott,  a 
           cigarette  dangling  from  his  mouth,  is  stacking  cases  of 
           bootlegged  liquor  as  another  YOUNG  MAN  unloads  them  from  a 
           truck  just  outside  the  service  door.  

           Lois  is  perched  on  a  stool,  CHATTERING  away...  Zelda,  Max, 
           and  his  Wife,  move  on. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I  suggested  this  place  because  I 
                        thought  it  would  be  far  enough  away 
                        from  the  distractions. 

                                 ZELDA
                        It  was  alright  when  he  drank  while  he 
                        wasn’t  working.  But  now  --  he  claims  he 
                        can’t  work  unless  he’s  tight... 

           This  is  news  to  Max...

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        I’ve  been  toying  with  some  ideas 
                        myself.  Maybe  even  a  novel... 

           She’s  tentative,  testing  his  receptiveness. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I’ll  read  anything  you  send.  Always. 

           Zelda  nods,  smiles,  then  releases  them  to  the  CROWD.   She 
           stands  there  a  moment,  watching  after  them,  chewing  on  her 
           lower  lip. 

           A  WAITER  passes  out  of  the  KITCHEN  carrying  a  fresh  tray  of 
           Champagne.   Zelda  helps  herself  to  one  as  he  goes  by,  and 
           then  downs  it  like  a  glass  of  lemonade. 

           EXT.  ELLERSLIE  -  NIGHT

           A  BAND  plays  off  to  the  side  of  a  dance  floor,  where  Zelda, 
           uncharacteristically  drunk,  is  dancing  with  Lawton  Campbell. 

           But  she  has  her  eye  on  Scott,  who  is  dancing  with  Lois  Moran, 
           a  17-year-old  actress  he  met  in  Hollywood... 

           It  recalls  the  day  Scott  and  Zelda  met,  watching  each  other 
           on  the  dance  floor,  only  now,  where  there  was  once  desire, 
           there  is  only  suspicion. 

           The  couples  move  around  the  floor  such  that  Zelda  and  Scott 
           find  themselves  back-to-back.  

           Lawton  takes  the  opportunity  to  get  a  good  look  at  Lois. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Lois  Moran,  his  Hollywood  souvenir.  A 
                        face  so  fresh  you  want  to  slap  it. 
                                  (then)
                        She’ll  turn  up  in  his  next  book  with 
                        all  sorts  of  quixotic  endowments  -- 

                                 LAWTON
                        Zelda  --  She’s  a  child...  You’re  all 
                        worked  up  for  nothing. 

                                 ZELDA 
                                  (on  a  tear)
                        Now that  would  be  a  first:  he’ll  have 
                        exercised  his  imagination  enough  to 
                        create  something  worthy  of  the  term 
                        “fiction.”

                        You’d  be  irresistible  in  a  pair  of 
                        boxer  shorts... 

           The  word  hits  Zelda  like  a  cattle  prod,  and  she  whips  away 
           from  Lawton,  to  face  Scott. 
           CONTINUED:

                                                 (giggling)
                                               Men’s  boxers?   I  don’t  think 
                                               I’ve  ever  seen  a  pair  -- 

           Scott  turns  around,  startled. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Repeat  what  you  just  said... 

                                 LOIS

                                   oblivious)
                        About  the  boxers... 

           And  before  Scott  can  react,  Zelda’s  hand  connects  with  the 
           side  of  his  face.  

                                 ZELDA
                        How  much  more  of  me  are  you  going  to 
                        take!   Is  nothing  sacred!?  
                                  (to  the  Party)
                        I’m  the  one  who  wears  boxers!   It  was 
                        my  idea!   Not  his!  

           As  she  speaks,  she  removes  the  platinum  watch  he  gave  her 
           from  her  wrist.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT’D)
                        I’m  also  the  one  who  dives  into 
                        fountains!  And  from  Eden  Roc  --  so  when 
                        you  read  about  that  --  remember  -- 
                        that’s  me!

           Now  she  throws  the  watch--hard--right  at  Scott.  It  zips  by 
           his  head  and  crashes  into  the  wall  behind  him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You  want  to  explain  that?

           Zelda  shrugs. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  was  done  with  it. 

           Scott  lets  out  a  harsh  cough-of-a-laugh...

                        A  bold  gesture  though.  The  critics  will 
                        moon  over  it  when  it  appears  in  your 
                        next  piece  of  work.  And  call  you  ever

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t  be  uncharitable  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  didn’t  say  anything  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s  that  look  in  your  voice.   And  the 
                        tone  on  your  face...  At  least  the  girl 
                        does  something  with  herself.  Something 
                        that  requires  not  only  talent  --  but 
                        effort!

           Zelda  goes  SILENT.  The  cruelty  in  Scott’s  remark  is  new  to 
           his  repertoire.  But  she  reels  herself  in  so  when  she  speaks, 
           there’s  nothing  hysterical  about  it: 

                                 ZELDA
                        But  Goofo...  There  is one thing I do.  
                        For  which  I  was  fated  to  have  a  gift 
                        all  too  singular.  And  if  you  can’t  see 
                        it,  it’s  only  because  I’ve  put  so  much 
                        into  it,  that  there’s  nothing  left  of 
                        me.   You  have  it  all:  my  words  are 
                        yours;  my  stories  are  yours;  my  essays 
                        too;  my  mischief  is  yours.   I’ve  even 
                        tried  to  give  you  my  death.  But  you’re 
                        the  author  here,  and  I  guess  you’ve 
                        decided  it’s  too  early  in  the  story  for 
                        that...  So  I’m  still  here:  Mrs.  F. 
                        Scott  Fitzgerald.   Ask  around.   People 
                        will  tell  you  I  do  that  better  than 
                        anybody. 

           As  she  says  this,  her  voice  BREAKS  with  despair;  tears  make 
           tracks  down  her  cheeks. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  don’t  have  to  ask  anyone.   I  knew 
                        that  the  day  we  met.

           Where  a  moment  ago  there  was  cruelty,  now  there  is  tenderness 
           and  resignation,  not  to  mention  truth:   he  did  know  better 
           than  she  just  how  much  of  herself  she’d  sacrifice  for  him. 
           And  just  how  much  he  needed  her  to  do  so.

           And  then  her  focus  is  off  of  Scott:  the  whole  room  has  long 
           since  stopped  to  watch,  but  it’s  only  now  that  Zelda  fully 
           realizes  it,  and  the  humiliation  is  unbearable.

           A  rage  bubbles  up  from  within  her: 

                                 ZELDA
                        No...  No  more... 

           Her  eyes  are  glassy  with  fury  and  something  darker  still.  

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Not  one  more  breath.  Not  one  more 
                        thought.  Take  from  her  --

           Now  even  the  band  has  stopped  playing;  the  Guests  stand 
           silent,  and  watch  as  Zelda,  in  a  froth  of  fury  and  tears, 
           beats  on  Scott,  and  unravels  before  their  eyes.

           As  it  is  sucked  up  into  a  syringe. 

           INT.  ELLERSLIE  -  MASTER  BEDROOM  -  SAME

           Scott,  Lawton,  and  one  of  the  SERVANTS  hold  down  a  thrashing 
           Zelda  as  a  DOCTOR,  50,  administers  the  morphine.  Her  body 
           goes  slack  as  she  surrenders  to  the  drug. 

           INT.  ELLERSLIE  -  FOYER  -  DAY

           The  house  is  quiet.  It’s  been  several  days  since  the  party 
           and  Zelda  has  put  the  episode  of  her  outburst  behind  her.  

           She’s  animated  this  morning,  putting  on  her  coat  to  leave, 
           just  as  Scott  enters  the  house,  still  drunk  from  a  night  of 
           carousing... 

                                 SCOTT

                        I  can’t  live  this  way  anymore.  Like

                        a  shark  and,  I  believe,  lives 
                        indelicately  on  its  offal.  I’m  done 
                        with  it.  

           INT.  ELLERSLIE  -  EMPTY  ROOM  -  EARLY  MORNING

           Zelda,  reflected  in  the  gilt  frame  mirror  as  she  struggles  to 
           carry  it,  with  the  help  of  the  HOUSE  KEEPER,  into  one  of  the 
           mansion’s  many  unused  rooms. 

           She  is  dressed  in  her  dance  gear:  tights,  skirt,  leotard,  and 
           ballet  shoes,  and  a  simple,  but  delicate  watch  she  picked  up 
           at  the  shop.  

           Scott  appears  in  the  doorway,  watching  the  two  women  wrestle 
           with  the  mirror  without  moving  to  help.  

                                 SCOTT
                        That  thing  looks  like  it  belongs  in  a 
                        whore  house. 

           Zelda  ignores  him.   The  two  women  set  the  mirror  down, 
           against  the  wall.   Zelda  checks  the  position,  and  satisfied, 
           dismisses  the  Housekeeper  with  a  nod.  Then  she  drags  a  chair 
           and  places  it  so  that  she  can  use  the  back  of  it  as  a  “bar.” 

           She  stands  back  now,  reaches  for  the  “bar”  and  assumes  First 
           Position,  checking  herself  in  the  mirror.  

           Scott,  drinking  from  his  flask,  continues  to  watch.  Satisfied 
           with  the  entire  set  up,  she  turns  to  a  Victrola  in  the 
           corner,  and  drops  the  needle  onto  a  record. 

           And  with  the  first  note  she  begins  her  bar  work  to  the  tune 
           of  “The  Parade  of  Wooden  Soldiers,”  a  nearly  carnival  like 
           melody  --  almost  cartoonishly  so:  a  clipped  pace  with  drums 
           and  trumpets.   Scott  takes  his  leave. 

           THE  NEXT  SERIES  OF  IMAGES  ARE  CUT  IN  TIME  TO  “THE  PARADE  OF 
           WOODEN  SOLDIERS,”  A  NEARLY  CARNIVAL-LIKE  MELODY,  ALMOST 
           CARTOONISHLY  SO:  A  CLIPPED  PACE  WITH  DRUMS  AND  TRUMPETS. IT 
           BECOMES  FASTER  AND  FASTER  UNTIL  BOTH  THE  MUSIC  AND  ZELDA’S 
           MOVEMENTS  TAKE  ON  A  FRENZIED  AND  DISTORTED  QUALITY.

           A  SERIES  OF  SHOTS,  FROM  WIDE  TO  CLOSE,  WITH  INCREASING  SPEED

           *  Zelda  in  the  studio,  working  at  the  bar  in  class,  her 
           movements  more  fluid  now,  her  clothing  dark  with  sweat. 

           *  Scott  sitting  at  his  desk,  the  paper  blank  in  front  of  him, 
           a  bottle  of  gin  and  a  glass  at  hand. 

           *  Zelda  working  at  home,  in  front  of  the  mirror,  her  skin 
           slippery  with  perspiration. 
           CONTINUED:

           *  Scott  writes  a  few  lines. 

           *  Zelda  does  her  first  pirouette  in  class.  Fumbles. 

           *  Scott  crosses  out  his  lines. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  FACE,  as  she  whips  her  head  around  to 
           complete  two  turns... 

           *  Scott  pours  himself  a  drink,  and  knocks  it  back.

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  CALF  MUSCLES,  rippling  as  she  rises  on 
           point. 

           *  Scott,  just  awake,  in  BATHROOM  mirror,  his  hand  shakes  as 
           he  attempts  to  brush  his  teeth. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  FACE  as  she  chugs  back  a  glass  of  water. 

           *  Scott  looks  in  the  fridge  for  tomato  juice,  and  finds  only 
           an  empty  bottle.   He  slams  the  door  shut.   Gets  a  glimpse  of 
           Zelda  in  a  far  room,  jumping  up  and  down  in  fifth  position. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  FACE  as  she  jumps  up  and  down,  appearing 
           and  disappearing  in  the  mirror,  again  with  increasing  speed. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  FEET  as  she  jumps  in  fifth  position, 
           switching  fifths  every  time  she  lands. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  FACE  as  she  whips  around  in  pirouette 
           once,  twice,  three,  four,  five  times  --  and  with  each  turn, 
           her  face  becomes  more  gaunt,  her  bones  more  pronounced,  as  if 
           she  were  literally  whittling  away  at  herself... 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  EYES,  the  mirror  and  herself  reflected  in 
           her  pupil. 

           *  ON  THE  MIRROR  where  Zelda’s  REFLECTION  is  her  17  YEAR  OLD 
           SELF.

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  EYES,  blinking  away  the  sweat  from  her 
           brow  spills  past  her  eyelid. 

           *  ON  THE  MIRROR  as  the  glass  LIQUEFIES,  becoming  a  pool  of 
           water  --  clear  at  first,  it  grows  darker,  until  it’s  nearly 
           ink,  and  Zelda’s  reflection  is  blurred  until  it’s  gone  in  the 
           blackness. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  ONE  EYE:  reflected  in  the  pupil  is  the  mirror, 
           undulating,  like  something  alive... 

           *  ON  THE  MIRROR  as  it  appears  to  ripple,  and  then  with  an 
           unholy  PEAL,  it  SHATTERS  as  if  from  a  blow  behind  the 
           glass...

           Zelda  drops  the  floor,  SCREAMING,  covering  her  head  with  her 
           arms,  the  mirror  intact  behind  her. 

           Scott,  reacting  to  the  SCREAM,  appears  at  the  door.

                        Zelda! 

           He  moves  to  enter  the  room:

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott,  no! 

           She  rises  slightly  from  her  crouch,  gets  to  all  fours,  and 
           looks  around  her...  Her  eyes  go  wide: 

           HER  POV:  the  floor  of  the  room  is  covered  in  shards  of 
           mirror,  like  small  floating  sheets  of  ice... 

           Zelda  keeps  her  head  low,  as  if  uncertain  that  more  won’t 
           come  flying  at  her. 

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                                  (almost  whispering)
                        Don’t  move.  There’s  glass  every-where. 
                        All  around.   You  mustn’t  step  on  the 
                        pieces.  They’ll  break,  and  I  need  to 
                        collect  them.  Put  the  mirror  back 
                        together.  And  keep  dancing.  

           Scott  stands  at  the  door,  his  face  fractured  with  despair: 
           there’s  nothing  at  all  on  the  floor.  The  only  thing  that’s 
           shattered  is  her  mind.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Goofo  --  Will  you  help  me...?   Put  it 
                        all  back  together?

           Scott  nods,  tears  spilling  down  his  cheeks.  

           Zelda  looks  down,  staring  at  her  hands.   She  turns  one  over, 
           and  sees  a  red,  oozing  lesion:  this  is  real  --  not  imagined. 
           But  she’s  not  sure. 

           INT.  HOSPITAL  ROOM  -  DAY

           SUPER:  PHIPPS  PSYCHIATRIC  INSTITUTE   JANUARY,  1932

           Nurses  attend  to  Zelda,  whose  body  is  now  covered  in  red, 
           oozing,  psoriatic  lesions.   They  baste  her  body  with  cream, 
           and  wrap  her  bandages.  

           She  is  wild  eyed,  MUTTERING  to  herself: 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s  appalling.  Horrific.   What’s  going 
                        to  become  of  me...  I  have  to  work.  And 
                        I  can’t  work.   I  have  to  die,  and  yet  I 
                        must  work.  Let  me  go.  I  must  go... 

           Scott  appears  at  the  small  window  on  the  door  to  her  room, 
           and  looks  in. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                        Mr.  Fitzgerald?

           Scott  turns  to  see  DR.  THOMAS  RENNIE,  40,  young  and  affable.  

                                 DR.  RENNIE
                        I’m  Dr.  Rennie...  I’ll  be  working  with 
                        your  wife  along  with  Dr.  Meyer... 

           Dr.  Rennie  softens  to  the  visible  despair  on  Scott’s  face. 

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes  the  body  just  can’t  contain 
                        the  anguish  of  the  mind...  Especially 
                        one  as  expansive  as  your  wife’s...  So 
                        the  sores  erupt  like  that,  but  they’ll 
                        heal...

           Scott  nods,  as  if  hearing  him  from  a  long  way  off.  Then:

                                 SCOTT
                                  (almost  a  non

                        You  know  --  it  just  about  10  days  ago, 
                        she  suddenly  announced  what  sounded  to 
                        me  like  an  ultimatum  --  a  threat  to  go 
                        crazy.  

           The  statement  is  laced  with  a  yearning  to  understand,  to  make 
           sense  not  only  of  her  unraveling,  but  his  own.  

           Dr.  Rennie  offers  a  sympathetic  nod,  then  gestures  for  Scott 
           to  follow  him.  

           EXT.  PHIPPS  INSTITUTE  -  SAME

           Undulant  green  lawns  unfurl  in  every  direction.   The  setting 
           is  bucolic,  peaceful.   Scott  walks  with  DR.  MEYER,  65,  a 
           slight  man  with  deep  brown  eyes,  and  Dr.  Rennie.  

                                 DR.  MEYER
                                  (slight  Germanic  accent)
                        She  is  not  what  I  would  call  strictly 
                        schizophrenic...  Hers  is  more  of  a 
                        joint  problem  --  what  I  would  call  “une 
                           folie à deux...:” 

           Scott  is  intrigued: 

                                 DR.  MEYER  (CONT'D)
                        Two  people,  intimately  connected,  with 
                        similar  obsessions...  The  weaker  of  the 
                        two  will  eventually  yield  to  the 
                        stronger,  with  the  consequence  that  the 
                        identity  of  the  first  can  become 
                        confused...  Delusional.  I  believe  her 
                        current  condition  --  the  eczema  --  is  a 
                        largely  psychosomatic  expression  of 
                        that  confusion  and  anxiety. 
           CONTINUED:

           Scott  reaches  for  his  flask,  and  takes  a  swig... 

                                 DR.  MEYER  (CONT'D)
                        In  many  of  these  cases  it  often 
                        happens  that  the  disturbed  individual 
                        will  shed  the  delusions  when  separated 
                        from  the  other  person. 

           Scott  is  repelled  by  the  notion...  

                                 SCOTT
                        I  get  sick  at  the  thought...  I  would 
                        be  a  ruined  man  for  years  --  Though 
                        its  true:   if  you  asked  our  friends, 
                        fifty  percent  would  say  that  my 
                        drinking  drove  Zelda  insane  --  the 
                        other  half  would  assure  you  that  her 
                        insanity  drove  me  to  drink.   And  they 
                        would  be  unanimous  in  saying  that  each 
                        of  us  would  be  well  rid  of  the  other  -- 
                        in  full  face  of  the  irony  that  liquor 
                        on  my  mouth  is  sweet  to  her  and  I 
                        cherish  her  most  extravagant 
                        hallucinations.

                                 DR.  MEYER
                        If  you  cannot  see  your  way  to  a 
                        separation  --  then  her  prognosis  will 
                        depend  entirely  on  your  willingness  to 
                        be  treated  as  well  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Treated?  

           Dr.  Meyer  glances  at  the  flask  in  his  hand... 

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (bridling)
                        Dr.  Meyer,  my  drinking  does  not  get  in 
                        the  way  of  my  ability  to  function  in 
                        the  real  world  -- 

                                 DR.  MEYER
                        I’m  well  aware  --

                                 SCOTT
                        And  I  will  continue  to  drink  --  if  only 
                        because  giving  it  up  would  give 
                        credence  to  her  family’s  conviction  --
                        --  that  I  am  the  cause  of  this 
                        catastrophe.

           Dr.  Meyer  nods,  painfully  aware  of  the  futility  in  arguing 
           with  a  drunk... 

                                 DR.  MEYER
                        I  will  do  what  I  can.   I  want  to  put 
                        her  on  a  fairly  rigid  schedule  of 
                        activity  to  help  her  get  her  bearings. 
                        Routine  can  be  effective  that  way  --

                                 SCOTT
                        Well  dancing  is  out  of  the  question  -- 
                        and  she  may  want  to  write,  but  the 
                        strain  of  it  can  be  too  much  for  her  -- 
                        so  I  suggest  --

                                 DR.  MEYER
                                  (cutting  him  off)
                        Mr.  Fitzgerald  --  I  think  it  best  if 
                        you  are  not  involved  as  her 
                        caretaker...  Dr.  Rennie  will  be 
                        overseeing  her  daily  activity... 

           Scott  chafes  at  the  suggestion... 

                                 DR.  MEYER  (CONT'D)
                        And  I’m  concerned  that  your  visits 
                        might  prove  to  be  disruptive.  So  if  I 
                        may  ask  that  you  give  her  some  time.

           The  men  stop  walking:  they’ve  reached  the  entrance  to  the 
           institute.  Dr.  Meyer  and  Scott  regard  one  another... 

           After  a  beat,  Scott  nods:  “I’ll  give  her  some  time...”   And 
           he  heads  out  the  door,  leaving  Dr.  Meyer  and  Dr.  Rennie  to 
           exchange  a  knowing  look  of  doubt...  

           A  SERIES  OF  SHOTS  AS  ZELDA  EMBARKS  ON  HER  ROUTINE 

           *  Dr.  Rennie  pushes  Zelda  in  a  wheelchair  through  the  lush 
           gardens  of  the  hospital  grounds;  she  is  still  covered  in 
           sores.  

           *  Zelda,  at  the  desk  in  her  room,  her  hands  still  covered  in 
           red,  open  psioratic  blisters,  struggles  nonetheless  to  find  a 
           comfortable  fit  for  a  pen  in  her  hand... 

                                 DR.  RENNIE
                           “So much she loved the man -- “

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  hand  as  she  writes:  “Save me the Waltz.” 

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “ -- so close and closer she felt 
                           herself -- “

           *  Zelda,  her  body  still  covered  in  sores,  but  no  longer  open 
           wounds,  swims  in  the  hospital  pool,  supervised  by  a  NURSE. 

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  HAND  as  she  writes  haltingly  with  a  pen.  
           The  sores  on  her  hand  are  beginning  to  heal.

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “ -- that he became distorted in her 
                           vision -- ”

           *  Zelda  sits  at  a  desk  in  her  room,  filling  pad  upon  pad  with 
           writing...  Her  eczema  is  receding,  her  sores  fading.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “ -- like pressing her nose upon a 
                           mirror and gazing into her own eyes.”

           *  Zelda  and  Dr.  Rennie  walk  the  hospital  grounds  in  animated 
           conversation.   The  sores  are  barely  visible,  though  her  skin 
           is  still  flaking... 

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                         “ She felt the essence of herself 
                           pulled finer and smaller like those 
                           streams of spun glass -- “

           *  CLOSE  ON  Zelda’s  HAND,  the  words  flowing  from  her  pen  in  an 
           effortless  stream.  

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “ -- that pull and stretch till there 
                           remains but a glimmering illusion.” 

           *  Dr.  Rennie  peering  over  Zelda’s  shoulder  as  she  writes, 
           impressed.   Her  sores  are  now  entirely  gone. 

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                        “Neither falling nor breaking, the 
                           stream spins finer.”

           INT.  ZELDA’S  HOSPITAL  ROOM  -  DAY

           Zelda  continues  to  write,  as  Dr.  Rennie  reads  out  loud  from  a 
           page  he  has  in  his  hand. 

                                 DR.  RENNIE
                                  (reading)
                        “She felt herself very small and 
                           ecstatic.  Alabama was in love.”

           The  words  of  course  describe  herself,  as  Dr.  Rennie  looks  at 
           her  now,  the  fact  is  not  lost  him...  She  works  in  a  nearly 
           trance-like  state,  her  skin  not  only  free  of  the  eczema,  but 
           glowing  with  health...  

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (CONT'D)
                        Zelda... 

           She  doesn’t  seem  to  hear  him...  And  for  a  moment,  we  see  in 
           Dr.  Rennie  a  flash  of  that  spell  she  has  always  cast:  he  too 
           is  enchanted.  

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (CONT'D)
                        Zelda!

           She  looks  up  now  from  her  pad,  her  eyes  bright  and  alive. 

                                 DR.  RENNIE  (CONT'D)
                        This  is  remarkable.   Truly.   If  you 
                        keep  this  up,  it’ll  be  a  success.

           Her  face  blooms  with  gladness  at  the  compliments.

                                 ZELDA
                        I  should  be  done  by  the  end  of  the 
                        week.

           Dr.  Rennie  considers  this,  quizzical... 

                                 DR.  RENNIE
                        A  whole  novel  in  6  weeks... 

           Zelda  shrugs... 

                                 ZELDA
                        If  I  could  write  as  fast  as  I  can  think, 
                        it  would  have  been  done  a  week  ago.

           Dr.  Rennie  smiles. 

           INT.  PHIPPS  INSTITUTE  -  DR.  MEYER’S  OFFICE  -  DAY

           Scott,  red  faced  with  indignation,  rages  at  Dr.  Meyer  and  Dr. 
           Rennie  both.  Zelda’s  manuscript  sits  on  the  desk.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You  let  her  send  it  to  my  editor 
                        without  consulting  me!  

           From  their  expression,  neither  Doctor  expected  such  a  violent 
           reaction  to  the  situation... 

                                 DR.  RENNIE
                        She  felt  it  would  be  wrong  to  impose  on 
                        you  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (over  him)
                        Literally  one  whole  section  of  this 
                        thing  is  an  imitation  of  my  own  novel!

                        I’m  going  to  have  to  make  some  changes 
                        before  I  allow  her  to  seriously 
                        compromise  her  future  as  well  as  my 
                        own.  Now  I’m  going  to  go  talk  to  her  -- 

           And  turns  to  leave.

                        Not  in that  state,  you’re  not... 

           Scott  turns  on  him,  his  face  distorted  by  something  close  to 
           malice...

                        husband,  are  not... 

           Braced  as  if  hit  in  the  face  by  ice  water,  Scott  picks  up  the 
           manuscript  and  takes  his  leave  without  another  word. 

           INT.  A  SMALL  ROOM  -  PSYCHIATRIC  CLINIC  -  DAY

           Pale green walls, and a table. Zelda, is there with Scott, 
           Dr.  Rennie  and  the  Stenographer.

           SUPER:  PHIPPS  PSYCHIATRIC  CLINIC,  FEBRUARY  1932

                        So  --  What  do  you  want  from  me? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  want  you  to  do  what  I  say.   That  is 
                        exactly  what  I  want  you  to  do,  and  you 
                        know  it... 
                                  (beat)
                        I  want  you  to  stop  writing  fiction.  You 
                        are  a  third  rate  writer  and  a  third 
                        rate  ballet  dancer  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (flat)
                        You  have  told  me  that  before  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        I  am  the  professional  writer,  with  a 
                        huge  following.  I’m  the  highest  paid 
                        short  story  writer  in  the  world  --

                                 ZELDA
                        It  seems  to  me  you  are  making  a  rather 
                        violent  attack  on  a  third  rate  talent 
                        then  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (over  her)
                        Now  the  difference  between  the 
                        professional  and  the  amateur  is 
                        something  that  is  awfully  intangible.
                                  (to  Dr.  Rennie)
                        She  has  written  some  nice,  little 
                        sketches.  She  has  a  satiric  point  of 
                        view.  And  some  experiences  to  report.  
                        But  she  has  nothing  essentially  to  say.

                                 ZELDA
                        Why  in  hell  you  are  so  jealous,  I  don’t 
                        know.  If  I  thought  that  about  anybody, 
                        I  wouldn’t  care  what  they  wrote  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Because  you  are  broaching  at  all  times 
                        on  my  material  --  !
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA 
                        For  someone  with  so  much  material  -- 
                        you've  taken  an  awfully  long  time  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (cutting  her  off)
                        If  I  haven't  published  --  in  what  -- 
                        six  or  seven  years  --  !

                                 ZELDA
                        Eight  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (to  Dr.  Rennie)
                        Three  of  those  years  were  directly 
                        because  of  a  sickness  of  hers,  and  two 
                        years  before  that  indirectly,  in  that 
                        she  wanted  to  be  a  ballet  dancer!

           As  agitated  as  Scott  gets,  Zelda  remains  calm,  almost 
           “centered.”  It  is  Scott  who  appears  unbalanced.

                                 ZELDA 
                        You  mean  you  were  drinking  constantly.

           Scott  bridles  at  the  remark.

                                 ZELDA  (CONT'D)
                        Lucky  for  you  we  didn't  divorce.   Who 
                        would  you  have  to  blame  then?

           Dr.  Rennie's  expression  suggests  he  doesn't  disagree  with 
           that  observation.

                                 SCOTT
                                  (as  if  in  pain)
                        I  am  being  destroyed  here.  It  is  all 
                        unfair.  The  whole  equipment  of  my  life 
                        is  to  be  a  novelist  --

                                 ZELDA
                                  (quipping)
                        I  am  part  of  the  "equipment"  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (bursting)
                        But  that  is  all  you  ever  wanted!  Look 
                        me  at  me...  Look.   At.   Me!

           Zelda  turns  to  him.

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (quiet)
                        I  dare  you  now  --  to  deny  it.  Say  it 
                        out  loud.

           Zelda's  eyes  brim  wet,  she  bites  down  hard  on  her  bottom  lip, 
           already  raw...  Her  fingers  toy  absently  with  her  NEW  watch.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                        You've  never  loved  me  as  much  as  you 
                        loved  what  I  would  make  out  of  you.

           She  breaks  skin.   Her  lip  bleeds...  Then  she  looks  away. 
           Scott  glances  at  Dr.  Rennie,  as  if  to  say:  "You  see."

                                 SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                                  (calm  now)
                           I  am  supporting  you.   It  is  all  my 
                        material.   None  of  it  is  yours.

                                 ZELDA
                                  (to  Dr.  Rennie, 
                                   steady)
                        I  tell  you:   my  life  has  been  so 
                        miserable  that  I  would  rather  be  in  an 
                        asylum.
                                  (to  Scott)
                        Does  that  mean  anything  to  you?

                                 SCOTT 
                        It  does  not  mean  a  blessed  thing.

                                 ZELDA 
                        Then  I’ll  explain:  it’s  impossible  to 
                        live  with  you  --  I  want  to  live 
                        someplace  that  I  can  be  my  own  self.  I 
                        want  to  write,  and  I’m  going  to  write  --

                                 SCOTT
                                  (raising  his  voice)
                        It  has  got  to  be  an  unconditional 
                        surrender  on  her  part.  That  is  the  only 
                        promise  I  can  have.  I  want  my  own  way  -- 
                        I’ve  earned  the  right  to  my  own  way  --

                                 ZELDA
                        And  I  want  the  right  of  my  own  way  -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                  (bellowing)
                        And  you  cannot  have  it  without  breaking 
                        me,  so  you  have  to  give  it  up  --  !

           Zelda  lets  that  last  outburst  hang  in  the  air.   She  glances 
           at  Dr.  Rennie,  who  is  looking  at  Scott  as  if  wondering 
           whether  or  not  they’re  treating  the  right  patient. 

           A  LONG  SILENCE.   Then  very  quietly,  she  ends  the  argument: 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (almost  confessional)
                        It  is  the  great  humiliation  of  my  life 
                        that  I  cannot  support  myself.  It’s  just 
                        something,  one  thing  --  I  can  no  longer 
                        abide.   I  simply  cannot  live  in  a  world 
                        that  is  completely  dependent  on  him. 
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCOTT
                        Well.  Now  we  have  found  rock  bottom... 

           Dr.  Rennie  looks  from  one  to  other,  nodding.  After  a  beat: 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (to  Scott, 
                                   sympathetic)
                        You  know  what  the  matter  is?   You 
                        haven’t  written  that  book  and  if  you 
                        ever  do  get  it  written,  why,  you  won’t 
                        feel  so  miserable  and  suspicious  and 
                        mean  towards  everybody  else.  

                                 SCOTT
                        It  would  have  been  written  -- 

                                 ZELDA
                                  (finishing  for  him)
                        If  it  weren’t  for  me...  I  know. 

           She  glances  down  now,  and reflexively,  in  search  of  comfort, 
           she  flips  the  watch  face  over,  as  if  to  read  an  engraved 
           message  which  is  not  there...

           Scott  sees  the  gesture,  his  face  softens  with  a  rush  of  emotion:

                                 SCOTT
                        But  if  it  weren’t  for  you,  I  might  not 
                        have  ever  written  at  all.  

           And  therein  lies  the  impossible,  unbearable  truth  of  their 
           connection,  for  which  they  now  offer  each  other  the  most 
           profound  empathy.  

                                 ZELDA
                        What  is  our  marriage,  Goofo?  

                                 SCOTT
                        I  don’t  know...  In  1921,  we  were  about 
                        the  most  envied  couple  in  America.

           Zelda  considers  this: 

                                 ZELDA
                        I  guess  so.   We  were  awfully  good  showmen. 

                                 SCOTT
                        We  were  awfully  happy... 

                                                            FLASH  BACK  TO:

           EXT.  FRENCH  RIVIERA  -  1924  -  DAY

           ZELDA  &  SCOTT  -  WHERE  WE  FIRST  MET  THEM

           Standing  side  by  side  on  the  cliffs  of  Eden  Roc,  drenched  by 
           the  golden,  late  afternoon  sun.   Zelda  gives  him  an  ebullient 
           glance  then  faces  the  ocean. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        One...  Two...  Three!

           And  they  take  a  synchronous  leap  off  the  cliff,  chasing  the 
           sun  and  the  sea... 

           And  the  IMAGE  FREEZES... 

                                                            FADE  TO  BLACK.

           WHITE  TYPE  (WITH  ACTUAL  PICTURES  OF  ZELDA  AND  SCOTT):

                Between the ages of 20 and 33, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote four 
                                 great American novels.  

                   After Zelda entered the sanitarium, he never completed 
                                        another.  

                 He died at the age of 40 from complications of cirrhosis of 
                                       the liver.  

                 Zelda died eight years later in a fire at the sanitarium.  

                  Per the provision in her last will and testament, she was 
                  buried next to Scott at the Rockeville Union Cemetery in 
                                        Maryland.
