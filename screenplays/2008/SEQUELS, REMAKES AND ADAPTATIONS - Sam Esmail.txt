                                 JR (V.O.)
                        It is with no false humility that I 
                        wish the following script to never be 
                        produced into a motion picture of any 
                        kind in any universe in our known 
                        existence.  If you are indeed hearing 
                        these words being read back by an 
                        overpaid celebrity in a theater, or 
                        at home, then please know that the 
                        following production has been made 
                        without my blessing.  I will now 
                        display a picture of a black, virile 
                        owl for no known reason.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This story is meant to serve as an 
                        obsessive, honest re-enactment of the 
                        many years of my life.  While it is 
                        true that certain details will be 
                        embellished, please note that most, 
                        if not all, of the false moments that 
                        you will surely encounter will be 
                        primarily the fault of the filmmakers 
                        and the cast, and their inevitable 
                        poor execution.  I will now display a 
                        picture of the early 90's band "The 
                        Owls."

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It is my intention to avoid the rules 
                        and regulations often associated with 
                        Hollywood and their products.  In 
                        fact, I consider this more of a 
                        Powerpoint presentation than a movie. 
                        As a result, you may notice irregular 
                        storylines that defy standard 
                        narrative structure.  You may also 
                        notice overly used voice over, random 
                        cutaways to scenes or shots, as well 
                        as other no-noes dictated by the 
                        studio system and the like.

           INT. ROBYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD IN BIG FONT: 1991

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        It was 1991.

           The title card vanishes.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was eighteen years old and smoking 
                        reefer for the first time with a girl 
                        named Robyn while watching “Blake 
                        Edwards’ Skin Deep" on basic cable.  
                        Old school, where the TV does the 
                        channel changing and the digital 
                        guide was the shitty local paper.

           ROBYN, a beautiful high school junior, finishes her last hit 
           from the bong.  She snickers at the badly dubbed movie.

           ON A SHITTY TV:

                                 JOHN RITTER
                        I've never felt this way before.  I'm 
                        seriously unhappy.  This is just not 
                        the bush-league blues.  We're talking 
                        major-league depression here.  I 
                        can't sleep.  I take pills.  But they 
                        only last a couple of hours and then 
                        I'm up at 4:00 in the morning pacing 
                        the (flipping) house or walking on 
                        the cold (forgetful) beach.  I'm so 
                        miserable, I wanna (perhaps) shoot 
                        myself.  But, I can't because I'm 
                        afraid to die.  How's that for 
                        (downtrodden)?

                                 ROBYN
                        God, they ass-banged this movie.

           She looks over at JR, a nerdy senior with dark glasses.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        JR, you are blazed.

                                 JR
                        Is that what this is?

           Robyn giggles.
                                 ROBYN
                        You're so fucking high.

           JR leans back and takes in the gravity of the situation.

                                 JR
                        I'm so fucking...

                                 ROBYN
                        What?  What are you so fucking...?

                                 JR
                             (unsure)
                        In love...

           Expecting a joke, she doesn’t get it.

                                 ROBYN
                        With what?

           With a little muster:

                                 JR
                        I don't know.  With you.

           Robyn shoves JR’s knee in a ‘cut it out’ fashion.

           JR takes the plunge and kisses her.  FREEZE FRAME.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been in love with Robyn since 
                        the sixth grade.

           INT. JUNIOR HIGH (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           A MIDDLE-SCHOOL ROBYN leaves her locker.  A MIDDLE-SCHOOL JR 
           timidly slips a note into the locker after she’s left.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Instead of acting on it, I used the 
                        only superpower I felt I had: my 
                        writing.

           MONTAGE OF ROBYN WITH NITWITS, JOCKS, ASSHOLES, FUCKHEADS, 
           BURNOUTS, AND OVERALL DICKHEADS AS SHE GOES TO HER LOCKER AND 
           PICKS UP MORE LOVE LETTERS FROM JR.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I continued sending my astute love 
                        letters over the years as she 
                        continued to date a menagerie of 
                        nitwits, jocks, assholes, fuckheads, 
                        burnouts, and overall dickheads.
           Robyn smiles at one of the love letters as the NITWIT next to 
           her wears a dumb grin.

                                 NITWIT
                        What’s that?  Detention slip?

                                 ROBYN
                        No, it’s a love letter from my best 
                        friend JR.

                                 NITWIT
                        Do I need to kick his ass?

                                 ROBYN
                        Why would you need to kick his ass?

                                 NITWIT
                        I don’t know, you’re giving me a 
                        headache, let’s make out before third 
                        period.

           INT. ROBYN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Out of flashback.  Freeze frame on the kiss resumes.  Robyn 
           pushes away.  She’s flattered, but not interested.

                                 ROBYN 
                        That’s nice, but I can't.

                                 JR
                        Why?

                                 ROBYN
                        I don’t know.  Because you're not my 
                        type.  I'm just not attracted to you.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        This was true.  I am not very 
                        attractive, something I'm sure won't 
                        be reflected in the casting of this 
                        part due to Hollywood's shallow pool 
                        of ugly celebrities.  Bear that in 
                        mind.

           With a nod.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Yeah...I guess I’m not good looking.

                                 ROBYN
                        It’s not that.  You are good looking.  
                        Just not to me.
                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I was now the ass-banged.

           INT. JR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           JR is sitting near the TV wearing headphones.  He’s watching 
           British porn and handling his business.

                                 MALE BRITISH PORN STAR (O.S.)
                             (in a British accent)
                        That’s it.  Rub those tits.  Right on 
                        that cock.  That’s a nice girl.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As I sat pleasuring myself to British 
                        porn, I couldn’t help but feel a 
                        slight tug of depression.

                                 MALE BRITISH PORN STAR (O.S.)
                        Take the cock, just like that...take 
                        it whole...God, your mouth is like a 
                        fucking blender, you fucking cunt!

           JR finally finishes.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        You know that moment after you’ve 
                        rubbed one out to a porno, that 
                        moment of self-disgust, of self 
                        loathing.  That moment of what-the-
                        fuck-did-I-just-do?

                                 MALE BRITISH PORN STAR (O.S.)
                        You want that cum?  Don’t you, you
                        fucking cunt?  You wanna drink that 
                        for daddy?  Huh?

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I felt dirty, small, ugly.  But I 
                        couldn’t pinpoint why.

           JR turns the TV off.

           INT. JR’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Wide awake, JR lies in bed.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Was it Robyn?  Was it the shallow 
                        insignificance of my, then, eighteen 
                        years of life on this planet?  Or was 
                        it that I was still high?
           His eyes dart around the room.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I went to sleep hoping to wake up 
                        sober.
                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But I never did.  In fact, that day 
                        was the last sober day of my adult 
                        life.

           INT. RANDOLPH KITCHEN - MORNING

           Stern old parents, MR. and MRS. RANDOLPH, sit and eat their 
           Honeycombs.  JR’s slightly older, mentally retarded sister, 
           NANCY, eats her corn flakes.  JR, sweating from the perpetual 
           high, tries to eat his bowl of Lucky Charms.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The next morning I was still as high 
                        as the Hubble.

           Mr. Randolph shoves his small spectacles up and looks at JR.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        JR?

                                 JR
                        Dad?

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Son?

                                 JR
                        Mom?

           Concerned, Mrs. Randolph stops watching her soaps from the 
           small TV on the counter.

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        JR?

           JR tries to hold onto reality as he finds solace with his 
           leprechaun marshmallows floating in his pink milk.

                                 JR
                        I don’t know how to tell you this, 
                        but I’m high.

           Mrs. Randolph quickly gasps and slaps her son.
           INT. DOCTOR SCHECKEL’S OFFICE - DAY

           The old, bewildered, gray-haired DOCTOR SCHECKEL props up his 
           glasses as he reads over a chart.

           He looks at the worried trio before him: JR and Parents.

                                 DR. SCHECKEL
                        I have to admit, I’ve never 
                        encountered anything quite like this.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Is he brain damaged, Doctor?

                                 DR. SCHECKEL
                        I’m not entirely sure.

           He eyes JR.

                                 DR. SCHECKEL (CONT'D)
                        Son, was the cannabis peppered with 
                        anything that you know of?

           JR looks over at his Mom and Dad, then back to the Doctor.

                                 JR
                        Peppered?

                                 DR. SCHECKEL
                        Oh you know, peyote, opium, smack, 
                        crack, Raid?

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        The roach spray?

           She slaps JR again.

           INT. ROBYN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Robyn is getting ready for a big night out.  She cakes on make-
           up as a meek JR sits on her bed, infatuated.

                                 ROBYN
                        Wait, you’re like plowed right now?

                                 JR
                        Like a Nebraskan corn field.

                                 ROBYN
                        That doesn’t make sense.  We smoked 
                        out like two days ago.
                                 JR
                        I know.

           Robyn laughs.

                                 ROBYN
                        That must have been some good shit.

                                 JR
                        Actually, the doctor was wondering if 
                        it was laced with anything.

                                 ROBYN
                        I mean, I’m not high.  Yet anyway.

           She puts away her make-up and tries on a pair of shoes.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Thoughts?

           JR closes his mouth and looks her up and down.

                                 JR
                        Extraordinarily comely.

           Robyn rolls her eyes.

                                 ROBYN
                        Welcome to nerdville.

                                 JR
                        Was there maybe Raid or 
                        something...on the weed?

                                 ROBYN
                        Are you seriously asking me that?  
                        Isn’t that like an urban myth?

                                 JR
                        Well, the doctor said--

                                 ROBYN
                        Well, the doctor is a cock.  Look, 
                        JR, I’m sorry I did this to you.  I 
                        shouldn’t have smoked you out.  I 
                        probably should have known you 
                        couldn’t handle it.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        And if you’re wondering if that hurt, 
                        it did.  A lot.  Fucking cunt.
                                 ROBYN
                        You’re as sweet as a Jolly Rancher, I 
                        really like you.  I just don’t know.

           She hugs him.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        She was still the most amazing girl 
                        in the world.

           She pulls back.

                                 ROBYN
                        But I have a big date with Guillermo 
                        Ricardo.  I’ve gotta get going.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Fucking cunt.

           She goes into the bathroom and throws up.  She comes back 
           swishing Listerine.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Did you just throw up?

                                 ROBYN
                        I had a big lunch.

           She sees that JR is a little distressed.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Look, if you don’t want to go home 
                        just yet, you’re more than welcome to 
                        hang out here.  Just don’t smell my 
                        underwear.  And I’ll know.  So don’t.

           She walks out of the room.  JR sits silently on the bed.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As I sat there plagued with the 
                        thought of her going on a date with 
                        some douchebag named Guillermo 
                        Ricardo, I decided to confirm her 
                        feelings for me.  I needed to know if 
                        she felt anything.  I knew we were 
                        special.  There had to be something.

           JR rummages through her room, looking for that something.  
           Below her Nintendo, he discovers a George Michael notebook, 
           scribbled on top: “Top Secret: Do Not Read”
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Please, reserve your judgments.  I 
                        was in love.

           He tears through the notebook.  Little letters, drawings, etc.  
           He happens upon a recent entry.  His face quickly saddens.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I found it.  I found the 
                        incriminating evidence that was going 
                        to prove the status of our 
                        relationship.  I found it right there 
                        in her George Michael pseudo diary 
                        half-hidden below her Nintendo.  Like 
                        the battle of Gettysburg, this would 
                        become the significant turning point 
                        of my life.

           INT. JR’S BEDROOM - DAY

           JR solemnly enters his room.  He sits in a chair and miserably 
           stares into space.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As the years dragged on, as my life 
                        devolved...I would let those words, 
                        those brutal words, paralyze my 
                        existence.  My life quickly turned 
                        into a Dostoevsky novel.

           JR ages into his late twenties, the room changes into a dreary 
           apartment resembling a Siberian prison.

           INT. JR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           JR turns on his small TV.  JASON HEWLETT, a pompous soldier in 
           uniform is smiling from ear to ear as he’s being interviewed 
           on popular entertainment news show “Hard Copy.”

           ON TV:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        We’re sitting here today with soldier 
                        Jason Hewlett whose heroics in the 
                        recent Gulf War led to a New York 
                        Times Bestseller: T-D-O-W, 
                        exclamation mark?

           GRAPHIC: Book cover which reads “TDOW!”

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        It’s actually pronounced Ta-Dow!
                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Oh, pardon me, my notes say it’s an 
                        acronym, which stands for “The Day Of 
                        War”?

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Yes, that’s correct.  However, we say 
                        it out, sort of a marketing hook.

           They exchange obligatory laughs.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Well, it certainly has worked for you 
                        Soldier Hewlett, the story of your 
                        survival during an Iraqi ambush has 
                        not only landed you a multi-million 
                        dollar book deal, but there are 
                        rumors that a movie is in the works 
                        starring Corey Haim in what some are 
                        saying could be his huge comeback.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As I aged into my twenties, I grew 
                        even more bitter at the world.  There 
                        on a late night episode of “Hard 
                        Copy,” in between infomercials of the 
                        famous Ronco 5-tray electric food 
                        dehydrator, I discovered my life 
                        nemesis Jason Hewlett.  Sure, it’s 
                        not healthy to despise someone you 
                        don’t even know, but it happens when 
                        that rare combination of talentless
                        dreck and consequent inexplicable 
                        success disrupts the very bowels of 
                        your being.

                        For some it’s Steven Seagal’s
                        shocking rise to fame.

                        For others it might be the incredibly 
                        awful band “Good Charlotte.”

                        And yet for others, it might be the 
                        famous writer and star of “My Big Fat 
                        Greek Wedding,” Nia Vardalos which 
                        scored 241 million at the box office.  
                        W-T-F is right.

           ON TV:

           Hewlett flashing a huge smile.

           JR sadly drinks a beer as he watches on.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        For me it was Soldier Jason Hewlett, 
                        a Gulf war hero who won the Purple 
                        Heart for his meager heroics and 
                        consequently sold his story to 
                        Hollywood.

           JR crushes his can and throws it at the screen.

           JR, now in the corner of his room, works on his loud whizzing 
           desktop which is sitting on the floor.

           Search result finds Robyn’s email.

           JR clicks and begins writing a draft.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        When the Internet came around in the 
                        mid-90s, some saw potential for 
                        innovative forms of commerce or 
                        communication.  I, like most early 
                        adopters, used it to stalk a past 
                        love.

           JR changes his mind and deletes the email.

           INT. BROKERAGE FIRM - DAY

           A now older JR is talking to a young, eager BROKER.
                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I scraped and saved from the jobs I 
                        was able to keep as I aged into my 
                        late twenties, mostly writing 
                        technical manuals for the crap they 
                        sold on the home shopping network.  
                        Finally, I decided to invest all my 
                        savings into the search engine I 
                        thought would take over the Internet 
                        and set me for life.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Put it all on Lycos.

                                 BROKER
                        A wise investment.

                        The rest of the world didn’t see what 
                        I saw in that cute little dog that 
                        sniffed out my late night 
                        curiosities.  My savings evaporated.

           INT. JR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           JR, now older, and even more miserable.  The apartment, more 
           sparse and empty.

                                 JR (V.O.) 
                        I grew into my thirties without hope 
                        for change.  Nothing could shake the 
                        misery that hugged my soul like an 
                        inappropriate uncle.  Finally, one 
                        day I said... 

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Fuck it.

           EXT. BUSY HIGHWAY STREET - DAY

           JR walks down the side of a very busy street.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Ok, ok, I’m sure you want to know 
                        what Robyn wrote in that diary.  But 
                        it’s pretty ruthless.  I don’t even 
                        know if I can say it.  I don’t even 
                        know if I want the actor playing me 
                        to say it.  That’s how painful it 
                        was.  So, let the actress playing 
                        Robyn say it.

                        And this was word for word, straight 
                        out of the diary.  Nothing edited.  
                        If you believe anything in this 
                        movie, believe these words.  This is 
                        what she wrote:

           JR stops and looks at the oncoming traffic.

                        JR tried to kiss me.  It was awful.  
                        He’s so ugly that it makes me want to 
                        cry.  I’ve never known what it felt 
                        like to be so turned off--

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        ‘Turned off’ was in all caps.  I 
                        remember that vividly...

                                 ROBYN (V.O.)
                        ...so turned off by someone’s 
                        appearance.  It makes me want to cry.  
                        His dead-awful love letters were like  
                        Milli Vanilli songs, except without 
                        any of the talent-- 

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Ok, enough.  There was more.  But I 
                        can’t share it.  Besides, I’m almost 
                        dead.

           JR sees a semi barreling down the street.  He steps in front 
           of it.  Splat.  He’s dead.

                        Before I continue with the story, I’d 
                        like to say that the following may 
                        seem fantastical to most of you.  The 
                        majority of you will not believe 
                        these events to be true.  Granted, my 
                        memory is a little murky when it 
                        comes to the specifics of said 
                        events, but I do claim them to be 
                        true nonetheless.  That 
                        notwithstanding, I hope that you will 
                        keep an open mind and not simply toss 
                        this aside as movie magic.  This was 
                        not my imagination.  This actually 
                        happened.  Honest.

           EXT. DMV PARKING LOT - DAY

           JR awakens in a parking lot of a DMV.  He looks around and 
           notices OTHERS waking up just as confused as he is.

           They stand in a long line leading into the DMV building.

           JR walks past a sign, which is designed in the same vein as a 
           DMV logo, except it reads: “Department of Motionless Vim”

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        For those who don’t know, vim is 
                        actually a word that means ebullient 
                        vitality and energy as in vim, vigor, 
                        vitality.  I find it really comes 
                        handy in a good game of Scrabble.  
                        Sometimes you can get dumbfucks to 
                        challenge you.  That’s the best.  Of 
                        course...dumbfucks don’t really play 
                        Scrabble.

           JR nervously smiles at his recent dead peers as he waits in 
           the long line.

           INT. DMV WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Inside, it’s a run-down municipal DMV office.  Hundreds of 
           seats line the cheap floor with tickers hanging on the walls.

           The usual DMV looking TELLERS are behind desks in the middle 
           square, servicing their patrons with apathetic disinterest.

           JR notices a ticker tape machine and pulls a number: J7.  He 
           sits and watches the clock: 11:43 PM.

           INT. DMV WAITING ROOM - DAY

           3:57 PM.  JR is falling asleep on a FAT BLACK WOMAN sitting 
           next to him.  She shrugs him off.

           A booming, distraught intercom sounds off:

                                 INTERCOM (O.S.)
                        J7!  J7!

           JR looks at his ticket-- it matches.

           INT. MILLARD FILLMORE’S OFFICE - DAY

           MILLARD FILLMORE, the white-haired 13th President of the U.S., 
           sits in his sturdy leather chair reading Highlights magazine.
           His buzzer comes to life:

                                 INTERCOM (V.O.)
                        Mr. Fillmore, Person J7, JR--

           Nervous, Millard coughs loudly and puts his magazine away.

                                 MILLARD
                        Send him in, send him in.

           JR walks into a smaller version of the Oval Office.

           Millard walks around his desk and meets him in the center of 
           the Presidential seal with his hand extended.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        How you doin’, JR, Millard Fillmore, 
                        13th President of the United States.

           He shakes his hand quickly and pulls around a couple of seats.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        Sit, sit.

           They both sit awkwardly, looking at each other.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I’m a little...

           He gestures to emote he’s spacey.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        I just shot myself up with some Harry 
                        Jones...heroin to the lay.

           They sit in silence.  Millard picks up a Pepsi fountain drink 
           and sips on the straw until it’s drained.

                                 JR
                        You’re the 13th President of the 
                        United States?

                                 MILLARD
                        Millard Fillmore.  I’m your ALA.

                                 JR
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 MILLARD
                        I’m your After Life Agent.  Let’s 
                        take a look, shall we?
           Millard stands and walks over to a huge bookcase.  He quickly 
           spots the spine with JR RANDOLPH printed boldly on it.

           He pulls the book, opens it up to a page, and scans.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        This is no good.  Definitely no good.

           He sits back down and snaps the book shut.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        Says here you killed yourself.

                                 JR
                        ...Is that bad?

                                 MILLARD
                        No, no, don’t be ridiculous.  You 
                        still have some more chances...

           His voice trails as he flips through the book again.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        Zounds!  Only two more to be exact.  
                        You’re up to 499,998.

                                 JR
                        ...Is that bad?

                                 MILLARD
                        You see, in the after-life, you are 
                        given a certain amount of chances to 
                        live your life and attain vim, the 
                        act of achieving personal 
                        fulfillment.  Each time you fail, you 
                        start from the beginning and try all 
                        over again.

                                 JR
                        You’re telling me every single time 
                        I’ve tried to live life and achieve 
                        personal fulfillment, I fail?

                                 MILLARD
                        Ahh...it would be appear that way, 
                        yes.

                                 JR
                        And how exactly do I go about 
                        achieving this vim?
                                 MILLARD
                        Glad you asked.  I actually produced 
                        a little instructional video with the 
                        help of a burly woman named Wilma to 
                        answer that very question.

           Millard walks to the back and sets up a VHS and TV cart.  He 
           sticks a tape in and dims the lights.

           ON TV:

           CHEESY 80s STYLE GRAPHIC: YOUR ROAD TO VIM!

           Millard comes on the screen, standing in his office, and 
           addresses the camera as he speaks in an affected tone.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Hi, I’m Millard Fillmore, I became 
                        the 13th President of the United 
                        States after old President Zach 
                        Taylor croaked of gastroenteritis 
                        while I was Vice-President.
                             (whispers)
                        That’s gas.

           JR looks over at Millard who chuckles at his own joke.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        This video is to help you navigate 
                        the treacherous waters of life with 
                        hopes that you’ll achieve vim and 
                        personal fulfillment.  Are you ready?  
                        Good.  Let’s get started!

           The green screen background dissolves into a blackhole found 
           in space.  Millard motions towards it.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        All humans are born with a deep void 
                        in their hearts.  It’s your job in 
                        life to fill this void.  You might 
                        ask yourself, that’s a pretty big 
                        void Mr. President, I’m just an 
                        insignificant nothing with no 
                        prospects or potential, how could I 
                        possibly fill this void?  Glad you 
                        asked.  The great news is, there are 
                        many things out there that will help 
                        you.  Some use love.

           A GRAPHICAL BEATING HEART overlays part of the blackhole.

           A GRAPHICAL MILLARD AT A PRESIDENTIAL PODIUM overlays another 
           part.  Millard chuckles at this.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Isn’t that cute?  The answers are up 
                        to you.  As you journey through life,

                        make up who you are, and help you 
                        quickly fill this void altogether.

                        And you’ll be on your way to 
                        achieving vim and personal 
                        fulfillment.

           A HUGE SMILEY FACE covers the blackhole.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        The After-Life Committee knows how 
                        difficult this is, which is why you

                        But if you don’t!

           The HUGE SMILEY FACE is set on fire.  The sight is gruesome.  
           The Smiley Face begins screaming in agony.

                        Wilma can have a morbid sensibility.

                        Négro failed his first four chances.

                        He was a sandal salesman who cheated 
                        on his wives and contracted syphilis 
                        on his second try.  On his third try 
                        he was a mediocre badminton player.  
                        It wasn’t until his fifth try he got 
                        it right.  On another note, did you 
                        know that the object they hit in 
                        badminton is referred to as a 
                        shuttlecock?  I always found that 
                        amusing.

           Millard laughs at his own joke.  A picture of a smiling, late 
           30s FRANK JEFFRIES now appears.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        But then, there’s Frank Jeffries.  
                        Your average middle-aged suburbanite 
                        with three kids, loving wife, and a 
                        dog named Slave.  Point is, you don’t 
                        have to achieve world glory to reach 
                        vim.  It’s a personal journey.  You 
                        just have to find those special 
                        virtues that fills your void.

           Cheesy music signals the end of the tape.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Don’t mind the music.  Wilma isn’t 
                        very nimble with the synthesizer.  
                        Now let’s stand up.

           JR stands.  Millard motions him to the birth door.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Once you go through that door, you 
                        will be reborn as you, but you will 
                        have no memory of your previous 
                        lives.  Not in any logical sense.  
                        But you will have emotional memory, 
                        certain feelings that will help 
                        remind you of your past misfortunes.

                                 JR
                        Like déjà vu?

                                 MILLARD
                        I never cared much for the French.

                                 JR
                        How will I know not to kill myself 
                        this time around?
                                 MILLARD
                        You have to listen to your inner 
                        voice JR.  This is your life story 
                        you’re rewriting.  Create the ending 
                        you want.

                                 JR
                        That’s all very sweet and low, but 
                        let’s cut the shit.  If I’ve done 
                        this four hundred odd thousand times, 
                        chances are, I’ll do it again.  My 
                        inner voice ain’t working.  Isn’t 
                        there anything else that can help?

           Millard ponders this, and nods.  He lifts a vial of red liquid 
           from his coat pocket.

                                 MILLARD
                        Take this.

           JR takes the vial and holds it up.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Take it and never speak of it again.

                                 JR
                        What is it?

                                 MILLARD
                        My dealer handed it to me.  It goes 
                        for high prices in the after-life 
                        black market.  Now, it won’t 
                        assuredly help you remember every 
                        detail of your past life, but it 
                        will, at some point, flash certain 
                        images that may jog your noggin.

           JR nods and downs the vial.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?!  You were meant 
                        to take a tablespoon!

           JR blanches.

                                 JR
                        Thanks for the delayed prescription, 
                        Mary Poppins! What’s going to happen 
                        to me now?
                                 MILLARD
                        I don’t know!  But more importantly, 
                        how am I going to be repaid the 500 
                        after-life rupees it was worth!

           JR starts rubbing his eyes.

                                 JR 
                        I’m tripping balls right now.

           Millard shakes his head and points to the door.

                                 MILLARD
                        Go through that door, JR.  You have 
                        no excuses now.  This is your last-- 
                        well, second to last chance.

           Millard squeezes JR’s shoulders.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Look for those things that will fill 
                        that void in your heart and I promise 
                        you, you’ll reach vim.

           JR takes a deep breath, unlocks the door, and walks into a 
           dark corridor.
                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I will now display a picture of two 
                        mountain lions attacking each other 
                        for no known reason.

           GRAPHIC: a still of two mountain lions going at it.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        At this point, I was reborn as 
                        myself.  I will briefly go into my 
                        childhood, but don’t worry, I won’t 
                        make it some gay Steven Spielberg 
                        shit about how I loved to pick at my 
                        mashed potatoes or found an alien 
                        that taught me the meaning of life 
                        while plugging Reese’s Pieces.  I 
                        will attempt to be as concise as 
                        possible for the sake of brevity.

           TITLE CARD IN BIG FONT: 1982-1987
           EXT. PHILLIP’S HOUSE - DAY

           Two nine year olds, PHILLIP and YOUNG JR (donning over-sized 
           dark glasses) stand in wide-eyed amazement as they watch two 
           dogs humping on their neighbor’s lawn.

           Phillip continues their conversation as their eyes stay glued 
           to the spectacle across the way.

                                 PHILLIP
                        Well, see, girls have a hole.  And 
                        that’s what you use your penis for.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        It’s just a hole?

           Beat, as Phillip and Young JR turn their head sideways to 
           observe the new position.

                                 PHILLIP
                        Ah-huh.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        So, girls walk around with holes in 
                        between their legs?

                                 PHILLIP
                        Yup.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Does it lead anywhere?

                                 PHILLIP
                        I don’t know.  I’ve never put my 
                        penis in one before.

                                 YOUNG JR
                             (incredulous)
                        And all you do is stick it in?  And 
                        that’s it?

                                 PHILLIP
                        Ah...yup.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        How many times?

                                 PHILLIP
                        Until she gets her period.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        That seems like a lot.  I don’t think 
                        I could do that.
                                 PHILLIP
                        Well, you have to.  Otherwise, you 
                        won’t have kids.

           Young JR turns his head to Phillip and addresses him directly.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        No, there’s artificial insemination.  
                        That way, I don’t have to have sex 
                        and still have kids.

           Phillip rolls his eyes and looks over at his nerdy accomplice.

                                 PHILLIP
                        Artificial what?

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Artifi--

                                 PHILLIP
                        --Shut the fuck up!  That’s what you 
                        have to do.  Don’t be a pussy.

           A dog bark makes the kids’ heads snap back to the yard.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Why is she barking?  And why is the 
                        other dog sleeping?

           EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

           Phillip and his FRIENDS are picking on YOUNG NANCY.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The day before, Phillip and I 
                        officially met for the first time at 
                        our bus stop.  He and two of his 
                        friends kicked my ass right there on 
                        someone’s lawn.  I was defending the 
                        honor of my mentally retarded sister.

           Young JR takes a karate stance.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        I know karate.

           Phillip punches him.  JR falls to the ground hard.

           Mrs. Randolph storms out of her house screaming obscenities at 
           Phillip and his friends.  They split.  

           Young Nancy leads her mom towards Young JR, laying motionless.
                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        JR, what are you doing?

                                 YOUNG JR
                        I’m not here.

           EXT. PHILLIP’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mrs. Randolph, holding up Young JR, shows PHILLIP’S MOM the 
           black eye.  Phillip is pulled to the door by his ear.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Phillip wound up apologizing, under 
                        duress from his mother, of course.

           EXT. PHILLIP’S HOUSE - DAY

           Back to the dog-humping scene.  Phillip and Young JR stop 
           staring at the dogs and go back to playing Transformers.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The next day, Phillip invited me over 
                        to play Transformers.  And there in 
                        his front yard, our battle scene took 
                        a pause so that he could elucidate, 
                        the best way he knew how to fuck
                        bitches and chicks.

           EXT. STREETS - DUSK

           Young JR walks home alone, clutching his Transformers.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I remember walking home from his 
                        house feeling very confused about the 
                        world.  I kept picturing all these 
                        women walking around with gaping 
                        holes in between their legs.  

           WOMEN walk by with huge, black gaping holes in between their 
           legs.  Young JR shakes his head.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Young JR sits in the back of a classroom completely entranced 
           by the TEACHER’S visuals on atoms and molecules.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Physical science always eluded me as 
                        a child.  In first grade, we learned 
                        about atoms and molecules.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was blown away-- completely 
                        astounded at the thought that there 
                        were these little particles floating 
                        around.  I was such a moronic fucking 
                        idiot.

           INT. YOUNG JR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Young JR sits indian-style on his bed and stares into the air.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I went home and decided to sit in my 
                        living room and concentrate.  Sure 
                        enough, I began seeing atoms and 
                        molecules floating around.  

           Animated atoms and molecules pop up around an amazed Young JR.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I decided not to tell people because 
                        it was too dangerous.  Being the by-
                        product of bad 80s flicks, I knew 
                        full well that the bad people would 
                        have me locked up and experimented 
                        on.  So, I saved this secret, and 
                        kept it to myself.  I had thought 
                        about telling one girl I knew, 
                        Michelle, but I didn’t want any harm 
                        to come to her either.  So, it was 
                        just mine, and it made me feel 
                        special that I had this gift.  Of 
                        course, you’re probably thinking 
                        short-bus special.  I guess I would 
                        too, if I were in your shoes hearing 
                        all this crap.

           EXT. STREETS - AFTERNOON

           Young JR is playing soccer with his FELLOW CLASSMATES.

           MICHELLE, a cute 9 year old girl, rides by in a purple bike.

           Young JR stares at her and gets hit in the head by the ball.  
           He lays on the ground still staring at her.

                                 JR (V.O.) 
                        Before Robyn there was Michelle 
                        Powers.  She was my Kelly Kapowski, 
                        my Winnie Cooper, my Jordan 
                        Catalano...
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAYS - DAY

           Michelle walks down the hallway with her POSSE, other third 
           graders smile and wave.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        She was perhaps the most popular kid 
                        at our school.  She was also quite 
                        beautiful.  This led me to my first 
                        test in life, could I get a girl like 
                        Michelle Powers as a girlfriend?

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           CONNIE, an awkward third grader with freckles and glasses, 
           stares at Young JR with a look of disgust and says...

                                 CONNIE
                        No.

           Young JR looks down.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        After passing the message down the 
                        long line of Michelle disciples,  
                        Connie, an unattractive minion, gave 
                        me the answer one day after recess.  
                        I was disappointed, but somehow not 
                        surprised.  It had to be because I 
                        wasn’t good looking enough.  I asked 
                        Connie if that was the reason.

           Connie shrugs.

                                 CONNIE
                        I don’t know.

           She then holds Young JR’s head up by the chin, takes a closer 
           look at him from both sides and says...

                                 CONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, that’s probably it.

           INT. RANDOLPH APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Young JR’s parents are hosting a party with MIDDLE-AGED BORES.  
           We see photos of Mrs. Randolph’s large family on the mantle.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        My mom had always been disappointed 
                        in my looks.  She was very 
                        attractive, and came from an 
                        attractive family.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She wanted everything to be as fine-
                        looking as possible, the house, the 
                        kids, the car; if it wasn’t, she’d 
                        cover it up with lipstick and blush.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Mrs. Randolph is crying as the DOCTOR delivers bad news with 
           Young Nancy by her side.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        She was quite disappointed when my 
                        older sister was born with down 
                        syndrome.  She could never have the 
                        exploitative Junior Miss she always 
                        wanted in a daughter.  

           INT. NANCY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mrs. Randolph is forcing an awkward Young Nancy in a bad dress 
           and tons of make up.  Young JR watches from the door.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        It didn’t stop her from caking my 
                        sister in make-up, hairspray, and 
                        gaudy clothes.  It always wound up 
                        making Nancy look like an awkward 
                        little girl with a noticeably 
                        overbearing mother.

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           Mrs. Randolph, in cafeteria lady get up (hairnet and all), is 
           scooping out food and putting it on Young JR’s plate.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        At the time, we didn’t have a lot of 
                        money-- my dad worked for the army 
                        and...well, you know, the ethics of 
                        those guys are a notch below Kathy 
                        Lee Gifford, so he got paid shit.  
                        Consequently, my mom worked as a 
                        lunch lady in our school cafeteria.

           Michelle comes up in line with JR, Mrs. Randolph teases her.

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        But you two would be the cutest 
                        couple!

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Mom!  What the F?
                                 MICHELLE
                        Well, Mrs. Randolph, he’s not really 
                        my type.  Can I have a 1% milk?

           Mrs. Randolph sighs and hands her a small milk.

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        I try.  I cut his hair.  He doesn’t 
                        exercise.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sorry Mrs. Randolph.

           INT. YOUNG JR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Young JR lays under his sheets as Mrs. Randolph tucks him in.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        My mom would use my looks as the 
                        reason why I could never get a girl 
                        like Michelle.  She’d always wonder, 
                        out loud mind you, how she conceived 
                        such an unattractive boy.  She felt I 
                        was a bad seed sprouting downwards to 
                        Hell.

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        JR, I want you to grow up and make 
                        your family proud, but you have so 
                        many flaws at such a young age.  If 
                        you keep this up, you’re going 
                        straight to Hell.  I’m being serious 
                        now, Ok?  Can you tell mommy is being 
                        serious?

           INT. YOUNG JR’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Young JR awkwardly picks up the phone and dials.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Michelle was the first person I ever 
                        called on the telephone.  I remember 
                        thinking the phone was some magical 
                        invention, my lifeboat to the outside 
                        world.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        So, I really like your lunchbox.

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        JR, how did you get my number?
                                 YOUNG JR
                        In the phonebook.  Is that OK?

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        Not really.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        But it’s so cool that I can hear your 
                        voice on this thing, isn’t it cool 
                        that you can hear mine...hello?

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Despite Michelle’s reluctance, my 
                        heart would never break for her.  
                        Until one day...

           INT. YOUNG JR’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Young JR runs in, locks the bathroom door and starts crying.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        We moved away in the middle of fourth 
                        grade.

           Mr. Randolph, in military attire, bangs on the door loudly.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Open this door now JR!

                                 YOUNG JR
                        I don’t want to move!  I love 
                        Michelle!  You can’t make me move!  
                        Please!  I want to marry her!

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        She’s not even attracted to you!

           Young JR continues to cry.  He sees the atoms.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I sat in the bathroom and stared at 
                        the atoms and molecules for comfort.

           A faint knock at the door.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Leave me alone!

                                 YOUNG NANCY
                        It’s Nancy.

           JR lets her in and locks the door immediately.  She sits on 
           the floor next to him and puts her head on his shoulder.
                                 YOUNG JR
                        I loved her Nancy.  What am I going 
                        to do without her?

                                 YOUNG NANCY
                        In Sweet Valley High, Elizabeth 
                        Wakefield wrote Todd Wilkins a love 
                        letter.

           JR smiles.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Good tip Nance.

           They sit on the bathroom floor in silence, atoms and molecules 
           swirling around them.

           INT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - DAY

           Present day Randolph house, empty, with some new furniture and 
           boxes.  Young JR plays with his toys as he’s enveloped by a 
           high volume of atoms.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        A month later, we were unpacking all 
                        our boxes in our new house.  I 
                        remember noticing an unusual amount 
                        of atoms hovering around.

           Young JR then notices his mom dusting in the living room.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I peeked around the corner of the 
                        living room to see my mother dusting.  
                        It was then that I realized what I 
                        thought were molecules from science 
                        class were actually dust particles 
                        that lingered after my mom cleaned.

           The atoms and molecules dissolve away to reveal dust 
           particles.  Young JR looks around, heartbroken.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Suddenly, the world made a lot less 
                        sense. 
                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You start out writing shit about your 
                        childhood, and you think it’s not 
                        going to be gay, and then it is, and 
                        next thing you know you’re crying to 
                        some old shrink who updates his ‘GQ’
                        and ‘The Nation’ subscriptions during 
                        your sessions.  Let’s speed this up, 
                        shall we?

           INT. JR’S BATHROOM - DAY

           The present day JR is now gawking at himself in the mirror.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Grew up, went through puberty.

           INT. JR’S BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Started jerking off.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           JR staring at Robyn as he attempts to open his locker.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Fell in love with Robyn.

           INT. ROBYN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           JR taking a hit off the bong while sitting next to Robyn.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Got perpetually high.

                                 ROBYN
                        I'm just not attracted to you.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Got rejected.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Lost my money.
           INT. JR’S SIBERIA-LIKE APARTMENT - DAY

           JR, mid-thirties, miserable like before.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Wanted to die.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Fuck it.

           EXT. BUSY HIGHWAY STREET - DAY

           JR stares at the traffic.  He steps in front of a semi 
           barreling down the street.

                                 JR (V.O.) 
                        Then it hit me, that moment.

           FLASHES OF THE DMV, RED VIAL, MILLARD SAYING:

                                 MILLARD
                        This is your life story you’re 
                        rewriting.  Create the ending you 
                        want.

           JR steps away just in the nick of time as the semi keeps 
           trucking down the street.  JR laughs at his luck.

                                 JR
                        I remember!  Millard!  Millard, I 
                        remember!  I have another chance!

           Due to his enthusiasm, he neglects to see the other semi 
           coming the opposite way.  Splat again.  He’s dead again.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. MILLARD FILLMORE’S OFFICE - DAY

           An unshaven, unkempt Millard is passed out in his chair with 
           his head arched back.  Some drool has dried on his chin.

           JR runs in frantically.

                                 JR
                        Millard!  Millard!

           He goes over and slaps him awake.

           Millard coming to, tries to get his bearings.
                                 MILLARD
                        You bastards!  She told me she wanted 
                        to!

                                 JR
                        It’s me, JR Randolph!  Remember?  I’m 
                        one of your...patients or after-life-
                        ees!  Or whatever!  You were helping 
                        me find vim, fulfillment.  Remember?

           Millard clears his throat and shapes up.

                                 MILLARD
                        Oh yes, of course, JR.  You have to 
                        excuse me, I see a lot of people.  
                        Sorry, I’m a bit...

                                 JR
                        I know, I know, you just shot 
                        yourself up with some heroin.  Listen 
                        Millard, right before I was about to 
                        commit suicide, I got a rush of 
                        flashes, like you said, except it was 
                        very vivid.  And everything came 
                        back!  Our whole conversation!  This 
                        place!  You!  Everything!

                                 MILLARD
                        That’s impossible!

           Millard finally remembers with bitterness.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Oh, yes!  Now I remember.  You’re the 
                        reason why Caroline left me.

                                 JR
                        What?  You’re dating?  A Caroline?

                                 MILLARD
                        Not anymore.  Now she’s going with 
                        that hot shot After-Life Agent up on 
                        the 37th floor.  He just passed Redd 
                        Foxx into Heaven.

                                 JR
                        From “Sanford and Son”?

                                 MILLARD
                        I don’t want to talk about it.
                                 JR
                        Are you comprehending what I’m 
                        saying?  I remembered everything!  
                        You said it was just going to be a 
                        thing to nog my joggin.  But it 
                        wasn’t.  I remembered everything with 
                        vivid clarity.

           Millard, a little tired of JR’s enthusiasm, stands up.

                                 MILLARD
                        Then why in Lucifer’s anal fissure 
                        are you still back here?  I would 
                        have been alerted already if you 
                        would have gone on to do something 
                        outstanding.

           He walks over to the bookcase.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Let’s take a look at what 
                        revolutionary JR Randolph has done 
                        with his life!

                                 JR
                        Wait, you don’t understand--

           Millard finds the book and begins thumbing through it.

                                 MILLARD
                        No, no!  You come in storming after 
                        you’ve chugged the proverbial red 
                        vial of my ever dwindling life, I at 
                        least hoped it’s paid off so that I 
                        may impress Caroline with my...

           His voice begins to trail off as he reads.

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        ...latest success as an After-Life 
                        Agent, instead, you’ve reminded me--

                                 JR
                        Millard, wait!

                                 MILLARD
                        -- Of how much of a failure I have 
                        become!

                                 JR
                        You don’t get it--
                                 MILLARD
                        What don’t I understand, JR?  That 
                        even after cheating...

           He looks around, and remembers to speak softly for discretion:

                                 MILLARD (CONT’D)
                        Even after cheating, I couldn’t 
                        motivate you to not kill yourself at 
                        the same exact moment you did once 
                        before.  If that isn’t failure, then 
                        what, I ask you, is?

                                 JR
                        Millard, it was an accident!  Another 
                        fucking semi came the opposite way!

           Fed up, Millard goes over to the rebirth door and opens it.

                                 JR (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 MILLARD
                        I want you to go.  Go on.

                                 JR
                        You don’t believe me?

                                 MILLARD
                        By my records, you have killed 
                        yourself 499,999 times, all by 
                        suicide.  I’m sorry, JR, but you’re a 
                        lost cause.  Chances are, you’ll go 
                        through that door, and be back here 
                        burning in Hell like that poor little 
                        smiley face.

           Disappointed, then angry, JR walks to the door.  Before he 
           exits, he takes a look back and sternly says:

                                 JR
                        Just so you know, the local 
                        prostitute fucks people behind a 
                        middle school named after you.

           He slams the door shut.
                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           GRAPHIC: A still of the New York Mets insignia.
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I thought you should know I love the 
                        Mets and the Yankees suck my fucking 
                        taint.  That’s all.  Ok, so I was 
                        reborn yet again, but let’s skip the 
                        shenanigans, the childhood, the girls 
                        with gaping holes, the atoms and 
                        molecules malarkey, the jerking off, 
                        the bong hit, the mother slap and 
                        let’s get right to it--

           INT. ROBYN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           JR reading the George Michael diary.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        This time the flashes came earlier...

           JR rubs his eyes.  He remembers.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It hit me precisely the moment my 
                        heart was destroyed by Robyn’s 
                        discouraging words.  I remembered 
                        everything, how my past life crumbled 
                        because of the very memory I was 
                        experiencing right then and there.  
                        How I was defeated.  But this time, I 
                        would learn.  This time, I would 
                        retaliate.

           JR throws the George Michael diary on the ground and runs out 
           of the room.

           EXT. ROBYN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robyn is making out with sexy GUILLERMO RICARDO in front of 
           his beat-up truck.  

           JR’s runs out to witness this.  His stomach sinks.

                                 JR
                        Robyn!

           Robyn pulls away quick and looks at JR.

                                 ROBYN
                        JR?

                                 JR
                        Robyn, I have to tell you something.
                                 ROBYN
                        Oh God, is this going to be 
                        embarrassing or some shit?

                                 JR
                        I’m in love with you and--

                                 ROBYN
                        Shit.  JR, I’m with my boyfriend.

           Guillermo Ricardo extends his hand.

                                 GUILLERMO RICARDO
                        Guillermo Ricardo, singer/songwriter.

           JR doesn’t take his hand and looks at Robyn.

                                 JR
                        And I read your George Michael diary 
                        and I know what you said about me, 
                        and it really stung like a bee.

                                 ROBYN
                        You what?

                                 JR
                        I read your George Michael--

           Robyn slaps him.

                                 ROBYN
                        Fuck you, JR!  Those were my personal 
                        thoughts!  Ok?  God!  You know what 
                        JR, at least I have something to say.  
                        And you wonder why I don’t like you!

                                 JR
                        You don’t like me?

                                 ROBYN
                        Look at Guillermo Ricardo!  He’s a 
                        singer/songwriter!  He’s recorded 
                        seven albums already and he hasn’t 
                        even graduated high school.  People 
                        care about what he has to say.  I 
                        care about what he has to say.  Which 
                        is more than I can say for you!  You 
                        have nothing to say about anything, 
                        and if you did, no one would care, 
                        including me!  I hate you!  Don’t 
                        ever talk to me again!

           She goes into her house and slams the door.  
           JR stands awkwardly next to Guillermo Ricardo.

           INT. JR’S BEDROOM - DAY

           JR reads his yearbook, looking at Robyn’s picture.  Next to 
           it, her message: “This summer will rock!  I’m gonna get you to 
           smoke weed, just you wait!  Luv ya like a brother, Robyn.”

           ON TV: A press conference with President George H.W. Bush 
           speaking on the imminent victory of the Gulf War.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I felt even worse than I did in my 
                        past life.  All that bullshit 
                        rhetoric that the movies try to tell 
                        you about going after the woman of 
                        your dreams can suck my sack.  It 
                        wasn’t true.  Sometimes it’s better 
                        to not go for it, especially if 
                        you’re gonna feel like a complete and 
                        utter loser-douche afterwards.

           JR watches TV.  An ARMY AD begins to run.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Then it hit me.  Out of all the wars 
                        America’s been in; World War I and 
                        II, Vietnam, Korean, Civil, 
                        Revolutionary, out of all them, which 
                        one was breezy easy?  Which one could 
                        I join and come back from without so 
                        much as a hickey?  Which one could 
                        make me a war hero?  Which one could 
                        make me the hapless hero of a 
                        Hollywood movie? 

           INT. RANDOLPH KITCHEN - DAY

           Mr. and Mrs. Randolph perform the same morning rituals.

           JR stares at his father’s old army photographs sitting on the 
           mantle; he’s proudly dressed in uniform, being honored.  

           JR looks to his parents and confidently announces:

                                 JR
                        Mom, Dad, I’m joining the army.

                                 MRS. RANDOLPH
                        Remember, JR, you’re still high.  You 
                        really think you should be making any 
                        big decisions?
                                 JR
                        I’m gonna make you guys proud.

           They sit in silence, no response.

           INT. MILITARY BUS - DAY

           JR in military fatigues sits and looks out the window.

           INT. MILITARY CAMP - DAY

           JR attempts basic training, but performs badly.

           INT. MILITARY HEAD OFFICE - DAY

           SERGEANT BILKINS stands behind his desk scratching his head.  
           A beat up JR stares back at him.

                                 BILKINS
                        Randolph, the army thinks you’re 
                        better suited for writing, like an 
                        army reporter, you know?  Reporting 
                        on the day’s...tactics and whatnot.

                                 JR
                        A writer?  The army has those?

                                 BILKINS
                        Not really, but, let’s face it son, 
                        you’re not really cutting it as a 
                        soldier, and you spelled your name 
                        and address right on the application, 
                        which is more than I can say for over 
                        50% of the soldiers we got here.

                                 JR
                        That’s...this is a joke, right?

                                 BILKINS
                        No, believe me, we did the stats.  
                        It’s clearly over 50%.
                             (leaning in and 
                              whispering)
                        It’s actually closer to seventy.

                                 JR
                        No, I meant...I’ve never written 
                        anything before, professionally.

                                 BILKINS
                        It’s Ok, JR.  No one’s gonna really 
                        read it anyway.  The good news is you 
                        leave for Iraq in the morning!
           EXT. IRAQ US ARMY BASE - DAY

           A helicopter lands.  JR and his COMPANY jump out.

           INT. IRAQ US ARMY BASE - DAY

           JR sets up an old Windows 3.11 PC in the corner as the rest of 
           the TROOPS set up camp in the Mosque-turned-Army base hall.

           JR begins typing:

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Day one.  We are stationed in and
                        desecrating a holy Mosque in Iraq 
                        simultaneously.

           Soldier JASON HEWLETT strolls in with confidence. JR eyes him 
           with anxiety.  Jason Hewlett catches his stare.  He quickly 
           elbows his buddies and yells over at JR:

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Hey writer-nerd, spell 
                        supercalifuckyourmomma for me!

           His BUDDIES join in his laughter.  JR keeps typing:

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The troops are genuine assholes.  
                        Like a fine wine of assholery.  Never 
                        have I encountered this form before.  
                        Their ignorance and arrogance max out 
                        any combination I have ever seen 
                        heretofore.  

           Their laughter seems endless.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I can say for sure that I will not 
                        feel sorry for these guys should they 
                        die in combat.  That there will be no 
                        “Platoon” moment where I would even 
                        rescue them given the opportunity.  I 
                        would rather turn and walk away.

           COMPANY COMMANDER TURNER walks in.  Everyone scurries to stand 
           at attention.

                                 COMMANDER TURNER
                        Sorry fellas.  Looks like we just won 
                        the war ten minutes ago.  We leave 
                        0600 tomorrow.

           Everyone’s disappointed.  They begin packing their belongings.
           INT. IRAQ US ARMY BASE - NIGHT

           The SOLDIERS sleep soundly on their cots.  SUDDEN GUNSHOTS and 
           EXPLOSIONS stir everyone awake.  Commander Turner runs in:

                                 COMMANDER TURNER
                        Everyone, this is for real!  We’re 
                        being attacked by a renegade Iraqi 
                        force!  Up and at ‘em!  Again, this 
                        is for real!

           JR and the Soldiers get dressed as Commander Turner repeats 
           his command.  He sees JR.

                                 COMMANDER TURNER (CONT'D)
                        Randolph!  Stay behind and...write 
                        this shit up!

           JR finishes putting his fatigues on as the rest of the troops 
           rush downstairs to defend the base.

           More SCREAMS AND GUN BLASTS as JR nervously tries to load and 
           arm himself with a gun.

           A HUGE GRENADE BLAST is followed by more SCREAMS.  JR tries to 
           decipher what’s happening through the windows, but can’t see.

           Soldier Jason Hewlett busts back in screaming and limping, his 
           leg bleeding.  He falls on his cot.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Everyone’s dead!  Everyone’s dead!

                                 JR
                        What?!  That was like thirty seconds!

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        They’re all fucking dead, nerd!  
                        They’re fucking dead!

           ARABIC YELPS AND FOOTSTEPS are heard coming up the stairs.

                                 JASON HEWLETT (CONT'D)
                        Oh God!  They’re coming for us!  
                        Those Sand Niggers are coming!  
                        Ahhh!!  We’re all gonna die, you 
                        fucking nerd!  We’re gonna die!!

           He starts crying.
                                 JR
                        What?!  Aren’t you going to do 
                        something?  You’re supposed to save 
                        us!

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Play dead, and maybe they’ll leave 
                        you alone!!  Play fucking dead!!

           Jason Hewlett plays dead.  YELPS AND FOOTSTEPS get louder.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        This was it.  My last shot at life 
                        and I was going to die in the easiest 
                        war known to mankind.  I couldn’t let 
                        that happen.  I couldn’t die this 
                        pussy.  I knew I had to do something.

           JR runs towards the grenade case, pulls one out, and throws it 
           down the stairs just as he sees the shadows.

           BOOM!  The voices and footsteps go away.

           Panting heavily, JR grips his gun tightly and walks towards 
           the top of the stairway to get a closer look.

           A stray shot is fired, hitting JR in the knee.

           Now limping and screaming, JR drops his gun and backs up.

           Lone IRAQI SOLDIER SHARIF walks up holding his gun.  He points 
           it at JR and fires, but nothing.  He throws the gun away and 
           gets into a karate stance.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I know some of you won’t believe 
                        this, but if you compared William 
                        Zabka, the villain from “The Karate 
                        Kid,” to this Iraqi soldier, it’s an 
                        eerie resemblance.

           GRAPHIC: A still of William Zabka from “The Karate Kid” is 
           displayed side-by-side with striking similarity.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Even the same hair flop, I fuck with 
                        you not.

           Not knowing what to do, JR gets into a karate stance as well.

           Some basic karate moves are attempted from both parties, with 
           Sharif clearly superior to the limping JR.
           The crying Jason Hewlett watches in despair.

           JR attempts to kick Sharif in the chest with his weak leg, but 
           Sharif catches it and strikes him down with his elbow.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The whole thing seemed so familiar.  
                        Even the great Bill Conti score was 
                        playing in my head.

           As the score begins playing, JR looks around for help.  The 
           cocky Sharif walks around yelling at him in Arabic to get up.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I even saw Pat Morita and Elisabeth 
                        Shue as I laid there holding my knee.

           Cutaways to the actual Karate Kid film from the final fight.

           Sharif kneels down next to him and continues to goad him.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It was then that I knew what I had to 
                        do.

           Determined but weak, JR stands up.  Sharif smiles and takes 
           his stance, ready to fight.

           JR makes the famous flamingo stance.

           Confused at first, but then cocky, Sharif runs towards him.  
           JR flamingo kicks him in the face and knocks him out cold.

           The Bill Conti score swells.  JR, limping and delirious, 
           barely stands and begins screaming:

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        We did it!  Mr. Miyagi, we did it!  
                        We did it!

           Curled up on his cot, the crying Jason Hewlett, bedazzled by 
           the spectacle, mutters to himself:

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Mr. Miyagi?

           EXT. IRAQ US ARMY BASE - DAY

           JR is being put on a helicopter in a stretcher next to Jason 
           Hewlett.  The bodies of the rest are being zipped up.
                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        I can’t believe they’re all dead.  I 
                        can’t fucking believe it.

                                     JR (V.O.)
                        Now I know you might think I’m cold 
                        to say that soldier Jason Hewlett was 
                        still a dick, and will always be one, 
                        even at this point when we’re being 
                        taken away on stretchers as we watch 
                        our whole company being zipped up in 
                        body bags, but it’s true.  My opinion 
                        never changed.  This wasn’t one of 
                        those dumb fucking “Forrest Gump” 
                        moments, and Jason Hewlett wasn’t 
                        some poor gimp like Bubba who you 
                        should feel sorry for.  So don’t.

           INT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mom and Dad celebrate the return of JR with their SNOOTY 
           FRIENDS.  Mom is so proud.  JR stands, with a cane, in the 
           corner.  He is not proud.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        My parents threw me the obligatory 
                        welcome home thing, more of an excuse 
                        for my mom to throw a party for her 
                        Eddie Bauer friends, than for me.

           The Purple Heart is in a cheesy gold case, on display atop the 
           fireplace next to his father’s war pictures.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, I got the Purple Heart.  But 
                        there was no press or video, and I’m 
                        not going to pull some Zemeckis CGI 
                        bullshit where they take some stock 
                        footage of Bush and put me in it to 
                        reenact it.  And if they proceed to 
                        do this, know that it is without my 
                        blessing.

           JR turns and looks at the party of strangers, a party 
           supposedly for him.  Nancy, his sister, stands next to him.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Hi Nancy.

                                 NANCY
                        Hi.

           She smiles.
                                 JR
                        You have a pretty smile.  Anyone ever 
                        tell you that?

           Her smile gets bigger, turns into a giggle.

                                 NANCY
                        No.

           She stops her giggling.

                                 JR
                        You can laugh.  It’s Ok.

                                 NANCY
                        Mom says no.  She says I don’t make a 
                        very pretty face when I do it.

           JR shakes his head in contempt.  He sees his parents’ huge 
           fish tank standing in the corner.

           He walks over to it and without hesitation sticks his head in.  
           He stares back at the shocked and confused strangers looking 
           back at him through the fish tank.  

           Nancy is laughing uncontrollably.

           EXT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - DAY

           JR stuffs his suitcase in a cab.  Mr. Randolph stands at the 
           doorway with Nancy-- Mrs. Randolph noticeably absent.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The next day, my mom was so 
                        overwrought with embarrassment that 
                        she could no longer have me as a son, 
                        even with the recent accolades I 
                        garnered.  She finally disowned me.

           JR smiles and waves.  Mr. Randolph nods, walks into the house, 
           Nancy lingers for a bit and waves back.  JR gets into the cab.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be back for you, Nancy.  I 
                        promise!  Ok?

           Nancy smiles as his cab drives off.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                        As predicted, my flimsy one day 
                        account of my albeit shady war 
                        bravery turned into a best selling 
                        book, “A Day of War” or ADOW!

           GRAPHIC: a still of coffee mugs and t-shirts with “ADOW!” 
           written on it.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Shirts and coffee mugs followed, 
                        except I think it had more to do with 
                        the fact that people liked saying it 
                        more than anything else.  It kind of 
                        rolled off the tongue.  You try it.

           GRAPHIC: ADOW! in big, bold letters.

                        See?  It’s fun.  This dumb 
                        abbreviation of my most pivotal 
                        moment in life took the catchphrase 
                        all the way to Hollywood.
                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Before I move on to Hollywood, let’s 
                        discuss some things for a second, 
                        shall we?  In Hollywood there are 
                        only a handful of movie studios.

           Disney, Paramount, etc.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Now, it’s important to note that 
                        these studios are owned by other 
                        companies usually referred to as...

           GRAPHIC: all the logos dissipate into new logos; Viacom, Time 
           Warner, GE, Walt Disney Corp.

                        ...Media conglomerates.  Now, you’ve 
                        heard that word before, and to some 
                        of you it may or may not mean 
                        anything.  But here’s what they 
                        actually are.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Mind fuckers.  You see, media 
                        conglomerates, or mind fuckers, want 
                        to fuck the shit out of your mind in 
                        an effort to tell you how to feel, 
                        think, and act.  Why?  

           GRAPHIC: the stick figure now climbs to the top of the brain 
           and starts taking a dump.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So they can feed and sell the shit 
                        they produce back to you.  You see, 
                        once a certain movie, song, book, or 
                        as they like to call it, property, 
                        gets popular, the bigger the pile of 
                        shit they can sell, the more they can 
                        own you.

           GRAPHIC: the shit pile fills up the brain.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The more they own you, the more 
                        desensitized you’ll become, the more 
                        they can sell even more to you, the 
                        more money they’ll make off of you.

           GRAPHIC: movie studio logos crash in and fill the screen.  
           They move in formation to outline a vagina.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In essence, the movie studios are the 
                        bitches of these big mind fuckers 
                        armed with one objective, and one 
                        objective only, make shit popular so 
                        you’ll buy anything associated with 
                        it.  Sure, they’ll do their dumb 
                        fucking Russell Crowe movies and 
                        boring British dramas to get some 
                        street cred at the Oscars, but at the 
                        end of the day, they’re just banks 
                        hellbent on renting space in your 
                        brain.  And don’t let any one of 
                        those assholes tell you otherwise.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - DAY

           Smog covers the Hollywood sign on an early LA morning.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I took a meeting with one of these 
                        assholes.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        For personal satisfaction, I’ve 
                        decided to call them MindFuck 
                        Pictures.  That isn’t their real 
                        name, obviously, but it’s what they 
                        should be called.

           INT. MINDFUCK PICTURES OFFICES - DAY

           A huge, expansive office with movie posters all around.  The 
           MindFuck Pictures logo (stick figure humping brain) is 
           displayed from the ceiling.

           A fat executive with curly hair named MR. STRADLATTER sits 
           behind his desk.  His sidekick, who only goes by CONNECTICUT, 
           sits next to him wearing casual khakis and a flannel.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        The three movies I laughed hardest at 
                        were “Airplane!”, “Caddyshack”, and 
                        “The Godfather Part 3”.  You?

           Perplexed, JR sits across from him, searching for an answer.

                                 JR
                        Umm...I really liked “Roxanne.”

           Connecticut speaks up:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        The one with Steve Martin?  The big 
                        nose?

                                 JR
                        Yeah.  I laughed at that.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        We’re not here to talk about 
                        comedies, are we, JR?

                                 JR
                        No, I don’t think we are.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        What are we here to talk about then?

                                 JR
                        Umm...I think we’re here to talk 
                        about my book.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        And what book might that be, JR?
                                 JR
                        Ummm...the one I wrote.  About the 
                        war.  I’m sorry, did your assistant--

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        ADOW!

           Awkward silence in the room.

                                 JR
                        Yes.  That would be the title of the 
                        book.  Stands for “A day--

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        ADOW!

           Another awkward silence.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        Let me ask you something, JR.

           Mr. Stradlatter locks his fingers together.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        Would you like your book, “ADOW!”, to 
                        be adapted into the film that 
                        everyone talks about in 1995.  The 
                        film that brings home the bacon--

           He points to a nearby chest full of cash.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        And the eggs.

           He points to a shelf full of popular entertainment awards.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        That’s what we make here at MindFuck 
                        Pictures.

           He points to the above logo.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        We make bacon and eggs.

           JR nods.

                                 JR
                        I’m good.  I think I got it.

           Mr. Stradlatter solemnly stands and looks at an old painting
           of his father, Charles Stradlatter II, cooking bacon and eggs.
                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        You see, JR, Papa Stradlatter was a 
                        revolutionary in his day.  He started 
                        MindFuck Pictures by selling nudie
                        flip books at freak shows for a 
                        nickel.  He turned this company into 
                        the empire you see today.  

           Mr. Stradlatter gets weepy.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        One thing he always wanted was to win 
                        an Oscar, but alas, that damn Academy 
                        always felt his films never cut the 
                        mustard.  Old Papa entrusted me with 
                        his empire, and on his death bed 
                        asked me to win MindFuck that 
                        slender, naked gold man-- his words.

           Mr. Stradlatter caresses the painting.  JR and Connecticut 
           awkwardly look at each other.

           Wiping his misty eyes, Mr. Stradlatter blurts out:

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        This is Connecticut!

           Connecticut stands and offers his hand.  JR takes it. 

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Like the state.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        You know when you meet someone and 
                        you almost immediately realize that 
                        at some point they will go to jail.  
                        That’s how it felt when I met 
                        Connecticut.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Right north of New York, you know 
                        where Connecticut is?

                                 JR
                        Yeah, actually, yeah, it’s just north 
                        of...New York.

           Mr. Stradlatter smiles and nods.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        You’re a smart guy, JR.  So is 
                        Connecticut.  He’s our creative 
                        executive.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        He’ll help you with the adaptation, 
                        provide all the tools necessary for 
                        turning that beautiful book of yours 
                        into a movie for all audiences.  How 
                        does that sound?

           JR sheepishly nods.

                                 JR
                        Sounds good, Mr. Stradlatter.

           JR stands and offers to shake Stradlatter’s hand, but he 
           doesn’t oblige.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        I don’t do that.

           Connecticut jumps up.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        JR, let’s grab a drink!

           INT. MUSSO AND FRANK BAR - AFTERNOON

           The place is mildly busy.  Connecticut and JR sit at the bar 
           and have a couple of beers.  JR looks uneasy.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        It’s beautiful out here, isn’t it?  
                        How do you like Los Angeles so far?

                                 JR
                        I’ve only been here for a few days, 
                        but what I know of, I hate.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Yeah, me too actually.  It’s so 
                        shitty.  The smog, the weather.  
                        Disgusting.  You’re from back east?

                                 JR
                        Yeah, New Jersey.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Mets fan?

                                 JR
                        Yeah.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        So am I.  That’s cool, cool.  Did you 
                        know that I went to jail?
                                 JR
                        No, but I’m not surprised.  No 
                        offense though.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        None taken.

                                 JR
                        What did you go to jail for?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I tried to steal the Rodin exhibit 
                        from the Met.

           He finishes his beer.

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        Wanna go smoke some weed?

           INT. CONNECTICUT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           JR and Connecticut are in a heavy duty smoke out session with 
           a big, blue Superman bong.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        What’s fucked up is when they 
                        handcuff you, you feel so powerless.  
                        You have this moment where you’re 
                        realizing that this is society’s way 
                        of saying we no longer trust you to 
                        have your hands in front of you.  You 
                        know how fucked up that is?

                                 JR
                        Yeah, that’s pretty fucked.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Whatever.  By the way, you gotta have 
                        a love interest in your movie.

                                 JR
                             (caught off guard)
                        What?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Stradlatter is never gonna greenlight
                        a script for production without a hot 
                        chick.  Otherwise, dudes aren’t gonna 
                        see it, you know?

                                 JR
                        But there weren’t any girls there.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Just make it some girl back home, 
                        right, you probably had one, right?

                                 JR
                        Actually, yes...

           Connecticut distracted by a sitcom playing on TV:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        You know what I don’t get?  When 
                        fucking sitcom characters pretend to 
                        not see or hear obvious behavior for 
                        the sake of the joke.  You know what 
                        I mean?  Like, a guy will be hiding a 
                        puppy in his pants, and the person 
                        he’s hiding it from pretends that he 
                        doesn’t hear or notice this.  Is that 
                        fucked or what?

                                 JR
                        It’s pretty fucked.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        This is pretty good weed, huh?  
                        Medicinal.  They grow it at Skywalker
                        Ranch, believe it or not.  Actually, 
                        that’s probably not true.

                                 JR
                        Well, I should have mentioned this 
                        before, but I got perpetually high at 
                        the age of eighteen.  So, I was 
                        already kind of high.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        That’s kind of cool...wanna do blow?

           INT. HILLS HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           JR and Connecticut sit on a sofa in a crowded party doing coke 
           off of a glass coffee table.  After a line, Connecticut yells:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Whose dick you gotta suck to hear 
                        some Blues Traveler?

           They continue talking with sniffs of blow interspersed:

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        The thing is, no matter what, this 
                        chick has gotta be hot.
                                 JR
                        What chick?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        The love interest.  She can’t be 
                        interesting looking or anything, 
                        she’s just gotta be hot.  Like Nicole 
                        Eggert hot, circa 1987 to 1990.  I 
                        know it’s wrong and whatever, but 
                        that’s the way it works, end of 
                        story.

                                 JR
                        Should I just write ‘hot’ in the 
                        description line?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        No, because, Stradlatter can’t think 
                        he’s just out casting a hot chick.  
                        He’s gotta think the script has more 
                        integrity and it’s justified and 
                        shit.  So, use more subtle 
                        descriptors, put her in short-shorts, 
                        her hair still wet from the shower, 
                        not wearing a bra, shit like that.

                                 JR
                        Subtle descriptors.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Subtle descriptors.  And keep a 
                        consistent tone.  For example, I 
                        wrote this comedy called “The 
                        Presidential Pardon” about this 
                        deadbeat guy whose polar opposite 
                        close friend winds up winning the 
                        presidency.  So, this guy, in comedic 
                        fashion, would break the law, because 
                        he knows his friend will always 
                        pardon him.  Wild antics ensue, 
                        learns a lesson at the end, stops 
                        breaking the law, etc.

                                 JR
                        That sounds interesting.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I know.  Thing is though, you always 
                        gotta elevate the conflict.  And when 
                        you’re talking about breaking the 
                        law, after robbing seven elevens, you 
                        kinda have to go to rape and murder.

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        Not good fodder for a comedy, thus, 
                        mixed tones.  Doesn’t work.

                                 JR
                        I see your point.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I’m ready for some X, how about you?

           INT. TECHNO CLUB - NIGHT

           JR and Connecticut are sweating bullets, rolling on ecstasy, 
           as techno music blares.  Connecticut yells at the DJ:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Whose dick you gotta suck to hear 
                        some Nikki French?

           DJ doesn’t respond.

                                 JR
                        Be honest, was Stradlatter just 
                        tossing my salad or could this be the 
                        movie of 1995?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        No, probably not.  No offense, but 
                        that’s like a crapshoot. It’s like 
                        fucking a hot Brazilian chick without 
                        a rubber, you’re probably going to 
                        die or get a weird disease and wish 
                        you had.  Just remember, don’t ever 
                        write from the heart.  Always write 
                        from the checkbook.  You can always 
                        add heart later.

                                 JR
                        Any other maxims to follow?

           Connecticut thinks long and hard before responding:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Here’s one thing that niggles me: 
                        never use ‘fragrant’ as a verb.

                                 JR
                        You can do that?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I fucking won’t stand for it.

                                 JR
                        I don’t think I could ever do 
                        something like that.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I like your cane by the way.  Is that 
                        real wood?

                                 JR
                        Thanks, and I don’t know.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Let’s do some shrooms.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - DAY

           It’s early morning, and a tired JR and Connecticut walk 
           zombified down the boardwalk.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        What’s so fucked about doing shrooms 
                        in Venice is that there are so many 
                        crazy people and things happening 
                        already that it’s almost a wash.

                                 JR
                        You’re right, it almost feels 
                        sobering.  In a bad way.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        The whole point of the hot chick 
                        thing--

                                 JR
                        I think I’ve got that covered.  I’ll 
                        definitely have a subtly described 
                        hot chick wearing short-shorts with 
                        wet hair just from the shower.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Let me just add some perspective.  
                        The point is for the ending.  When 
                        your protag at the end--

                                 JR
                        Protag?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Protagonist, main character, 
                        whatever.  When faced with his maker, 
                        at the eleventh hour, moment of 
                        truth, turmoil abound, you have to do 
                        the quick flashbacks to this hot 
                        chick.  Fucking beautiful eyes, ass, 
                        boobs, the whole nine, but artfully 
                        of course.

                        That’ll be the thing that motivates 
                        the protag to overcome his greatest 
                        obstacle and win in the end.

                                 JR
                        That seems a little clichéd, don’t 
                        you think?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        That’s the whole purpose of this 
                        town, JR.  It’s not to be original, 
                        but one or two bus stops from cliché 
                        avenue.  Cuz you’re right, you can’t 
                        make the same shit.  The name of the 
                        game is to make the same shit a 
                        little more current.  Throw in a 
                        Clinton joke, break some taboos, but 
                        still keep it dumb and simple.

                                 JR
                        Connecticut, you’ve really helped me 
                        out a lot to...days.  I’m glad you 
                        didn’t sugarcoat any of this.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        No problem, JR.  Now let’s go in this 
                        bodega on the left and shoplift.

           INT. MINDFUCK PICTURES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A room full of executives.  At the end of the table stands a 
           smiling Mr. Stradlatter.  At the other end sits a timid JR 
           with Connecticut at his side.

           Mr. Stradlatter lifts up a regular ballpoint pen.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        See this pen, JR?

                                 JR
                        Yes.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        This pen has been working non-stop 
                        for seventeen years.  

           The rest of the group nods with pride.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        Some say it’s impossible.  How could 
                        a simple, innocuous ballpoint pen, 
                        constantly being used for seventeen 
                        years, keep going?

                        It would dry up, shrivel, and die 
                        like all the other shitty ballpoint 
                        pens out there.  But not this one.  
                        This pen, JR, is a miracle pen.

           The group nods again.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        Now some have asked why not donate 
                        this miracle pen to science, have it 
                        experimented on.  Maybe the ink 
                        formed an undiscovered compound, that 
                        can be learned from, thus innovating 
                        the whole pen industry with 
                        everlasting ink.  Maybe this 
                        mysterious compound could lead to 
                        solving other problems, like the 
                        world’s energy crisis!

           Mr. Stradlatter takes a step towards JR and lowers the pen.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT’D)
                        You know what I say to those fucks, 
                        JR?  I say no.  Wanna know why?  
                        Because when you’re lucky enough to 
                        be handed a miracle, you shouldn’t be 
                        stupid enough to take it apart, 
                        change it, exploit it, fuck it in the 
                        ass.  Accept the gift, as is.

           Mr. Stradlatter lifts up JR’s script.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        This script is one of the most 
                        profound scripts I have ever read.

           Everyone mumbles “yes”, “absolutely”, “for sure”.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        And I can tell you, from the bottom 
                        of my heart, that we will not take it 
                        apart, change it, exploit it.  We 
                        will make it as is, as it should be.  
                        This is the miracle script that my 
                        old Papa has been waiting for.

           Everyone waits for JR to respond.

                                 JR
                        That sounds cool.
                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Cool?  That’s it?  What’s the matter, 
                        why do you always have such a dopey 
                        look on your face?

                                 JR
                        Oh, that’s probably because I’ve been 
                        stoned since I was eighteen.

           Mr. Stradlatter nods awkwardly and smiles.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Ok, let’s get to brass tacks, and 
                        introduce the crew.  Everyone, please 
                        state your name and one thing 
                        interesting about yourself.

           He points to the squirrely, British guy with glasses at the 
           end named WENDELL THORNDROP.  He stands.

                                 WENDELL THORNDROP
                        I’m Wendell Thorndrop, the director.  
                        I’m British and I love the theater.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Doesn’t seem interesting, but Ok.

           The next guy is an angry German man named VIG VOLKEMP.

                                 VIG VOLKEMP
                             (in German, with 
                              subtitles)
                        A new Hitler will rise, and we shall 
                        overcome.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        He’s the cinematographer, for those 
                        of you that don’t understand German.

           The next person, an attractive lady, GENNIFER MILLER.

                                 GENNIFER MILLER
                        Hi, I’m the producer, Gennifer, and I 
                        spell my name with a ‘G’.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        And Connecticut you know.  Like the 
                        state, just north of New York.

           Connecticut awkwardly nods.
                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        This is the fine group of people that 
                        are going to make this the miracle of 
                        1995.  We begin rolling film this 
                        spring.  Is that exciting?

                                 JR
                        I’m enthused.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        What’s that?

                                 JR
                        I said I’m enthused.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER 
                        For a second there, I thought you 
                        called me a latent homosexual.

                                 JR
                        Interesting...I don’t see how you get 
                        the two confused--

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Regardless, we also have some 
                        surprising news for you.  We’ve cast 
                        the lead part!

                                 JR
                        You have?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Yes!  The person that will be playing 
                        you!  A fine young actor by the name 
                        of Paul Walker whom I discovered 
                        while watching “The Young and the 
                        Restless."

                                 JR
                        You watch “The Young and the 
                        Restless”?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Research, of course.  Soaps are a 
                        good playground for some of the 
                        silver screen’s finest actors.  Look 
                        at Grace Kelly and Cary Grant.

                                 JR
                        Wow, I didn’t know...

           Behind Stradlatter’s back, Connecticut shakes his head ‘no.’
                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        ...they came from soap operas.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        You’ll meet him tomorrow at the 
                        Newsroom Cafe.  He’s a method actor, 
                        so he wants to observe your whims and 
                        mannerisms for authenticity.

           Mr. Stradlatter pats him on the back.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        He’s the spitting image of you, JR.

           EXT. NEWSROOM CAFE - DAY

           PAUL WALKER, young and handsome, sits in front of a bashful, 
           nerdy JR who emphasizes this by pushing up his glasses.

                                 JR
                        It’s hard to believe you’re gonna 
                        play me.

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll do you justice.

           He laughs at his supposed unintentional wording.

                                 PAUL WALKER (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t mean that in a gay way.

                                 JR
                        It’s just that we look nothing alike.

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        It’s fine, I’ll get a cane just like 
                        yours.  Sweet piece, where’d you get 
                        it?

                                 JR
                        Actually, I got this after the war.  
                        You know, because of the war.

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        I’ll wear your glasses too.  I’ll 
                        even have them make it with your 
                        prescription.  What is it, like -400 
                        or something?

                                 JR
                        No, that’s not even a real 
                        prescription, but why would you do 
                        that?  You wouldn’t be able to see.
                                 PAUL WALKER
                        It’s more authentic.  If you can’t 
                        see, then therefore that means I 
                        shouldn’t see.

                                 JR
                        But I can see.

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        Ah, but then why are you wearing 
                        glasses?

                                 JR
                        No, I mean, I need the glasses to 
                        see.  Without them, I can’t.  See?

           JR lifts up his spoon to sip on his soup.  Paul Walker does 
           the same with his french fry, copying his motion.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        Method.  It’s an imitation exercise.  
                        Just act natural.

           JR continues to sip on his soup, Paul Walker makes a sipping 
           sound on his french fry, then eats it.

                                 JR
                        So, tell me what drew you to the 
                        script?

           Paul Walker, in a very over the top nerdy voice:

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        So, tell me what drew you to the 
                        script?

           Taken aback, JR takes a moment.

                                 JR
                        Wow.  Is that what I sound like to 
                        you?

           In an even nerdier voice:

                                 PAUL WALKER
                        Wow.  Is that what I sound like to 
                        you?

           Paul winks at him and resumes his normal voice:
                                 PAUL WALKER (CONT'D)
                        Pretty good, huh?  It’s method.  Went 
                        to school for it.

           He shouts at a nearby waiter:

                                 PAUL WALKER (CONT'D)
                        Whose balls do I have to lick to get 
                        a refill over here?

           He laughs and smiles at JR.

                                 PAUL WALKER (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t mean that in a gay way.

           Unimpressed, JR cracks a forced smile and returns to his soup.  
           Paul Walker continues imitating him with a french fry.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I will now display a picture of a 
                        monkey climbing a tree for no known 
                        reason.

           GRAPHIC: a still of a monkey climbing a tree.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Production on my script quickly 
                        began.  Despite Stradlatter’s 
                        intentions, the script did change 
                        quite a bit.  Four short months 
                        later, production wrapped, and by 
                        early fall we were premiering at 
                        Lincoln Center in New York City.  
                        Early reviews were great, but from 
                        the cuts I saw, it was a disaster.  I 
                        couldn’t stomach sitting in the 
                        theater.  Instead, I walked down to 
                        Washington Square Park.

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT

           JR sits on a park bench, with his head resting on his cane, as 
           he listens to screaming black Israelites.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        My mission seemed on track.  I was 
                        making something for myself.  I went 
                        to war and beat my life nemesis.  I 
                        turned my experience into what 
                        Hollywood called a slutty Oscar 
                        virgin waiting to be deflowered.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was getting accolades and respect.  
                        However, happiness didn’t seem at 
                        reach.  In the midst of this newfound 
                        glory, that same tug of depression 
                        returned.

           JR walks to a pay phone and dials.  Robyn’s answering machine:

                                 MR. RANDOLPH (O.S.)
                             (monotone)
                        Hello.  This is the Randolph 
                        resident.  No one...is...at the 
                        house...or can reach the 
                        tele...phone.  Please leav--

           BEEP.

                                 JR
                        Hey Dad...Mom, it’s JR.  I know we 
                        didn’t leave things on the best of 
                        terms, but I wanted to let you know 
                        that I miss you.  The film based on 
                        my book  based on my life is coming 
                        out soon.  Don’t see it though, it 
                        sucks.  But...umm...I just wanted to 
                        check in...Nancy, if you’re 
                        listening...I hope you’re doing Ok.  
                        I should get going.  I miss you.  
                        Remember what I said, Nancy.  I still 
                        meant it.

           A banner hangs: “1995 ACADEMY AWARDS”

           Joan Rivers and co. greet stars as they walk the red carpet.

           INT. LA COUNTY MUSIC CENTER - NIGHT

           Whoopi Goldberg introduces the show.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        ADOW! made it to the academy awards, 
                        garnering five Oscar nominations, 
                        including one for me for Best 
                        Adaptation, and the king of all 
                        Oscars, Best Picture.  Of course, it 
                        didn’t look like we had a shot, 
                        “Braveheart” was the heavy-on 
                        favorite.
           INT. LA COUNTY MUSIC CENTER - LATER

           Cutaways to the nominees in the audience.

                                 KEANU REEVES (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                        “ADOW!”...Mike Figgis for “Leaving

                        Thompson for “Sense and Sensibility”!

           Everyone cheers loudly for Emma.  Keanu fumbles as he opens 
           the envelope.

                                 KEANU REEVES (CONT'D)
                        God, I think my buddy Dennis would 
                        have blown up that bus by now if I 
                        were really this clumsy.

           Cutaway to Dennis Hopper as the audience chuckles.  Keanu 
           looks at the winner with shock.

                                 KEANU REEVES (CONT'D)
                        JR Randolph for ADOW!

           Gasps, followed by polite cheers.  Emma is not happy.  JR 
           waddles up to the stage with his cane and accepts the Oscar.

                                 JR
                        This is for Millard Fillmore.  I know 
                        some of you don’t know who he is, but 
                        he was the 13th President of the 
                        United States, and the inspiration 
                        for all of this.  So, that’s it, I 
                        guess.  Thanks.

           The stunned audience politely claps again.
           INT. LA COUNTY MUSIC CENTER - LATER

           The famous “Pulp Fiction” Dick Dale song plays as SAMUEL L. 
           JACKSON walks to the podium.

                        All right, here it is.  The last and 
                        final award of the evening.  Here are 
                        your nominees for best picture!

           Cutaways to the nominees in the audience.

                        and Sensibility"...Charles 
                        Stradlatter, III for “ADOW!"...and 
                        Alan Ladd Jr.; Bruce Davey; Mel 
                        Gibson for “Braveheart”!

           Everyone cheers for “Braveheart.”  Samuel Jackson opens the 
           envelope.

                                 SAMUEL L. JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        Before I announce the winner, I’d 
                        just like to say please check out my 
                        great performance in “The Great White 
                        Hype” coming to theaters this summer.

           Everyone chuckles at the shameless plug.

                                 SAMUEL JACKSON 
                        Ok, but seriously folks, the best 
                        picture of 1995 goes to...Charles 
                        Stradlatter, III for “ADOW!”

           The audience gasps loudly.  

           Mel Gibson is pissed.

           I/E. THE STANDARD HOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT

           JR, still in a tux from the awards show, sits on the floor 
           while hugging his cane and watches the big Oscar party through 
           the big glass doors.

           Connecticut hangs over the ledge and curiously peers down at 
           the gigantic pool below.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Dude, I really think I can fly right 
                        now.  I mean, I really believe that.
                                 JR
                        I promise you Connecticut, it’s the 
                        acid we just dropped an hour ago.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        It is?  But it seems so easy.  You 
                        honestly believe that if I jumped off 
                        this balcony with my hands out wide 
                        and flapped them like wings, I 
                        wouldn’t be able to fly?

                                 JR
                        Yes, I believe that.  Again, I’m 
                        pretty sure it’s the acid we took 
                        that’s making you think that.

           Connecticut holds up an Oscar.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Check it, I swiped this off one of 
                        those Spanish fucks that wrote “Il
                        Postino.”

                                 JR
                        It wasn’t that good.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        What’s the matter with you JR?  We 
                        had a big night!  We took home the 
                        big quesadilla. Why you so down?

                                 JR
                        I don’t know.  You know, when I came 
                        out here, I really thought all of 
                        this would fill this void I’ve had my 
                        whole life.  I thought I’d matter.  I 
                        thought all of this would really make 
                        me happy.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Dude, are you insane?  How the fuck 
                        aren’t you happy?  You’re the toast 
                        of the town.  You own this place 
                        right now.  Everyone’s talking about 
                        you.  You matter.

                                 JR
                        It doesn’t feel like it.  I’m missing 
                        something.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Oh, I see where this is going.  
                        You’re talking about love, aren’t 
                        you?

           Connecticut sits next to him.

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        All right, let’s have a fag moment 
                        for a second.  But after this, I’m 
                        gonna prove you wrong and fly off 
                        into the horizon.

                                 JR
                        Ok.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Here’s my theory on dating.  You have 
                        all these women out there.  Ok, so, 
                        95% of them will never give you a 
                        chance in hell.  Actually, no 
                        offense, but you’re not that 
                        attractive, so it’s more like 98%.

                                 JR
                        Seems reasonable.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        So, now we’re down to 2%.  Now, 95% 
                        of that...actually, more like 98%, 
                        again, due to the aforementioned 
                        reasons, will most likely be ugly.  
                        Then you gotta throw out all the 
                        crazies, the deformed, and other 
                        unknown ailments.  Then you gotta 
                        throw out all the conniving cunts 
                        that only want you for your money, 
                        power, success, etc.  And when all is 
                        said and done, you’re down to like 
                        five or six chicks.

                                 JR
                        Again, reasonable.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Well...the odds are stacked against 
                        you, my friend.  Basically, there are 
                        only five or six chicks out there 
                        that will be right for you.  Out of 
                        however many billion, you gotta meet 
                        one of these chicks.  It’s almost 
                        next to impossible.  I’m a little 
                        cuter, so my number is closer to 13.
                                 JR
                        Have you ever been in love with one 
                        of the 13?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Unfortunately JR, I’m like the movies 
                        they make in this town.  I’m an 
                        entertaining sideshow, an escapist.  
                        I’m so detached from society and 
                        people that it’s hard for me to 
                        connect to anyone, what with the 
                        drugs and whatnot.

                                 JR
                        Why not quit the drugs?  Why not join 
                        society and become a happier person?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        That’s death in this industry.  As 
                        soon as you try to become a real 
                        person, you lose your edge, you 
                        become boring and forgettable.  I 
                        can’t be some fucking no-name in 
                        suburbia with meatloaf on Sunday.  
                        Even though I do like meatloaf.  
                        Sizzler makes a mean one.

                                 JR 
                        I need to be happy Connecticut.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        No one’s happy.  That’s why they call 
                        it happy.  But when you one day meet 
                        one of the six, you gotta pursue her.  
                        I mean really pursue her.  Don’t let 
                        anything get in your way.  Even if 
                        she rejects you at first, you gotta 
                        be persistent, and not stalker 
                        persistent, but confident.  You gotta 
                        want her like a junkie wants the 
                        junk.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        It was then that I realized what I 
                        had to do.  I had to get Robyn back.  
                        I had to win her love.

                                 CONNECTICUT 
                        All right, now, are you positively 
                        sure I can’t fly off this balcony?

           JR stands and looks over the edge.  He smiles.
                                 JR
                        I see what you mean, it really does 
                        feel like you can fly off this 
                        balcony.
                             (with a nod)
                        Fuck it.

           JR climbs over the railing.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        As I contemplated experiencing human 
                        flight, it occurred to me that 
                        perhaps this wasn’t the best risk to 
                        take.  After all, if I died, that’d
                        be it.  It’d be all over.  And as 
                        romantic as it seemed at the time 
                        that I could fly into the night like 
                        Superman and Lois in that oddly 
                        narrated scene from the first movie, 
                        I chose the more prudent option and 
                        stepped down.

           JR climbs back over the ledge and sits back down.

           Connecticut shakes his head in disappointment.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Watch this.

           He climbs over the ledge.

                                 JR 
                        You sure, man?  I really think the 
                        acid is lying to you.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Like a bird, I’m gonna fly.

           Connecticut jumps off.

           JR watches as Connecticut’s body plummets.  His body hits the 
           edge of the pool and bounces him into the water.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Connecticut, in a full body cast, sips a Capri Sun through a 
           straw.  He’s surrounded by executives.  JR stands in the back.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I thought long and hard about what to 
                        say to Robyn.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I felt bad for Connecticut, but I did 
                        my part to warn him of the acid’s 
                        tricks on the mind.

           He pulls out pen and paper.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I started writing what I thought 
                        would be the most important love 
                        letter to date.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           JR continues to write while crammed in the middle seat.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I had to word what I was going to say 
                        perfectly.  I knew now that 
                        professional success was only a small 
                        part of reaching vim.  Love would 
                        take me the rest of the way.

           EXT. ROBYN’S HOUSE - DAY

           JR nervously stands in front of the house carrying roses and 
           reading his speech.  He folds it and puts it in his pocket.

           He RINGS the doorbell.  ROBYN’S MOM, old and bitter, answers 
           while smoking a cigarette.  She notices JR’s glassy eyes.

                                 ROBYN’S MOM
                        Great, another stoned loser.  You 
                        must be here for Robyn.  Sorry kiddo, 
                        she shipped out yesterday.

           DOOR SLAM!

           Dejected, JR walks down the driveway.  By the road, he sees 
           Robyn’s old Dodge Dart packed with her belongings.  

           He walks up to it and peers through the window.  He sees Robyn 
           laid across the front seats asleep.  He taps on the window.

           Robyn yawns and sits up.  Shocked, she lets JR in.

           INT. ROBYN’S DODGE DART - CONTINUOUS

           Robyn lights a cigarette and turns on the car radio.  The 
           Flaming Lips’ “When You Smile” is on.

                                 ROBYN 
                        I suppose you’re here to rub your 
                        success in?
                                 JR
                        No.  Robyn.  I’m here to tell you 
                        that I love you and that--

                                 ROBYN
                        Wait-- rewind that, what?

                                 JR
                        I’m here to say that I love you and 
                        that--

                                 ROBYN
                        You love me?  Still?

                                 JR
                        Yes and I want to--

                                 ROBYN
                        JR, I’ve been nothing but a fuckface
                        to you.  I mean, this is flattering, 
                        but seriously, you can do so much 
                        better.  I’m living in my car.

                                 JR
                        So did Jewel...I think...your mom 
                        told me you moved out.

                                 ROBYN
                        Mother’s a fucking cunt.  It’s like 
                        what Biggie Smalls said: “I wish my 
                        mom had a fucking abortion.”

                                 JR
                        I’m glad your mom didn’t have an 
                        abortion, not that I’m pro-life.

           She smiles and gives him a huge hug.

                                 ROBYN 
                        I do love you, JR.  You were my best 
                        friend.

                                 JR
                        A moniker I could live without.

                                 ROBYN
                        When I saw you at the Oscars, I 
                        realized I was a huge asshole for 
                        giving you up.
                                 JR
                        You’re not an asshole.  Besides, I 
                        don’t think girls can be.  You can be 
                        a slut or a cunt, if you want.

                                 ROBYN
                        I am...you know, I never told anyone 
                        this, but when I used to babysit my 
                        little sister, sometimes I would let 
                        her cry in her playpen, you know?  
                        Knowing that all I had to do was pick 
                        her up to make her stop.

                                 JR
                        Why didn’t you?

                                 ROBYN
                        I would eventually.  But I made her 
                        cry first because I wanted to be the 
                        reason, the reason, for her to stop.  
                        It’s so fucked, you know?

           She shakes her head at the memory.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        I’m such a slutcunt. And all those 
                        mean things I said in my diary, it 
                        wasn’t true.  I just didn’t know what 
                        I wanted.

                                 JR
                        What do you want now?

                                 ROBYN
                        Jeez manganese, who knows?  You 
                        picture your life going one 
                        direction, and then you’re living in 
                        a Dodge Dart.  I just want to be 
                        happy.

                                 JR
                        So do I.

                                 ROBYN
                        You believe in God, JR?  You know, 
                        Heaven, Hell, that shit?

                                 JR
                        Yeah, I actually went to the after-
                        life after I killed myself for you in 
                        my past lives.

           Robyn smiles in amusement.
                                 ROBYN
                        That’s so sweet, you killed yourself 
                        for me?

           They share a moment and a look.

                                 JR 
                        499,999 times to be exact.  Because 
                        you’re the only one that can make me 
                        happy, Robyn.  You’re my last hope.

           She kisses him.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Three weeks later, we were married.

           EXT. CLIFFS - DAY

           JR and Robyn kiss at their wedding.  Everyone cheers.  

           JR notices three empty seats with placards: “MR. RANDOLPH, 
           MRS. RANDOLPH, NANCY.”

           INT. RECEPTION - LATER

           JR uncomfortably stands by the punch looking at his beautiful 
           bride, Robyn, drunk dancing.

           Mr. Randolph walks up.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Hi son.

           JR turns around, surprised.

                                 JR
                        Dad!  You made it!

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Yeah.  Sorry for the tardiness.  I 
                        had to stop for gas.  Goddamn price 
                        gougers.  It’s up to a buck a gallon.

           They coldly shake hands.

                                 JR
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        Sure, son.  Beautiful bride.

           They both look at her as she continues to drunk dance.
                                 JR
                        She is beautiful.  I can’t believe 
                        she’s my wife.  You proud of me?

                                 MR. RANDOLPH 
                        Sure.  To a certain extent.  Are you 
                        still high?

                                 JR
                        Yeah.  Where’s Mom and Nancy?

                                 MR. RANDOLPH 
                        Well, son, your mother publicly 
                        disowned you, as you know.  So, she 
                        can’t really accept you back.  Her 
                        word wouldn’t be good to the 
                        community if she did so.  You know 
                        how your mother values those things.

                                 JR
                        Tell her I still love her, despite 
                        everything.  And tell Nancy...well, I 
                        guess tell her that I love her too.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH 
                        I will.

                                 JR
                        I love you too, Dad.

           Mr. Randolph sheepishly smiles and nods.

                                 MR. RANDOLPH
                        We all care very deeply for you, JR.  
                        I know we have a hard time showing it 
                        sometime.  But it’s there in the 
                        distance.  

           With a nod, he walks away.  JR fondly looks after him.

           INT. JR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A new spacious apartment.  Robyn, in interior design mode, is 
           hanging color swatches on the walls.

           JR sits in a corner tinkering with an old Netscape 1.0 
           browser.  He’s on Amazon’s arcane website, ordering a book.  
           Excited, he walks over to Robyn.

                                 JR
                        Look, I just ordered “The Bridges of 
                        Madison County” online!
                                 ROBYN
                        Why is that so exciting?

           Robyn peruses through the swatches.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Buying books on a computer isn’t 
                        going to help us raise a family, JR.  
                        We need a house, income, a Subaru
                        hatchback.  You need to start growing 
                        up and stop playing computer games.

           She sticks a bluish swatch on his shirt.

           INT. ACCOUNTANT’S OFFICE - DAY

           JR sits across from MR. FERRIS, his nebbish accountant.

                                 MR. FERRIS
                        JR, now that you’re married, you’ll 
                        have to think about investing your 
                        money wisely.  Maybe even consider 
                        buying an estate.

                                 JR
                        Yeah, actually Robyn and I are 
                        looking into that.  I’m thinking 
                        about buying into the Internet boom.

                                 MR. FERRIS
                        Internet?

           He leans closer for discretion:

                                 MR. FERRIS (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know the lingo, but I will 
                        not cover up drug money.  Not again.

                                 JR
                        No, Mr. Ferris, this isn’t about 
                        drugs.  It’s about stocks.  I’ve been 
                        reading up on this whole Internet 
                        explosion, and I’m thinking of buying 
                        in.

                                 MR. FERRIS
                        You mean the thing with the fancy 
                        mail?

           Mr. Ferris scoffs.
                                 MR. FERRIS (CONT'D)
                        JR, JR, it’s a fad.  Here, let me 
                        prove it to you.

           He pulls out a pad and pen.  He writes a note, then shows it 
           to JR.  It reads: “Hi J.R., How are you?, Mr. Ferris."

           He pulls out an envelope and begins writing JR’s address.

                                 JR
                        Mr. Ferris, what are you doing?

                                 MR. FERRIS
                        Just a minute.

           He finishes and stuffs his note in the envelope.  He licks and 
           seals it.  He searches for a stamp.

                                 MR. FERRIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh, fuck me up the anus, I’m out of 
                        fucking stamps.  Flo!  Flo!

                                 JR
                        Mr. Ferris--

                                 MR. FERRIS
                        Ok, ok, but you see my point?  If I 
                        had a stamp, it’d be done.  You see?  
                        It’s a fad, son, just a fad.
                                                                CUT TO:

                        Suffice to say, I ignored my 
                        accountant’s dimwitted insight and 
                        put all my money into Netscape.  By 
                        1998 they had gone up almost tenfold 
                        when they were bought out by AOL.

                        By 2000, the stock went up even more 
                        when AOL merged with, yes, one of 
                        those pesky mind fuckers, Time 
                        Warner.

                        This pesky mind fucker made me one of 
                        the richest people in Hollywood.
           INT. JR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Robyn sits on one end of the couch reading a Vanity Fair, JR 
           sits on the other end with his laptop.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As the money flowed in, our lifestyle 
                        upgraded.

           INT. JR’S HOUSE - DAY

           Robyn sits on one end of a large couch, doing her make up.  JR 
           sits on the other end with a nicer, bigger laptop.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        My marriage to Robyn was good, and 
                        slowly my void closed in.
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - DAY

           Robyn sits on an even larger couch watching TV, JR sits at the 
           other end of the room at the house bar, drinking alone.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t the happiest at times, but 
                        still satisfying.  I had the wife, 
                        the money, and the success.  I was on 
                        my way. 

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - NIGHT

           A luxurious mansion in the Hollywood Hills.  JR has done well 
           for himself, even owning a nicer cane.  He opens the door and 
           a longer-haired, older Connecticut stands with a smile.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Whoa brother!  You have really let 
                        yourself go.  Perpetual munchies?

           He pats JR’s protruding belly.

                                 JR
                        Nice to see you, Connecticut.  What’s 
                        with the Johnny Rzeznik hair?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Is it bad?  Fuck.  I’ll get it cut 
                        tomorrow.

           Connecticut walks in and takes in the enormous house.
                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        I should have listened to you when 
                        you told me this whole Internet thing 
                        was taking off.  Fucking geeks and 
                        their www’s.  What does that stand 
                        for anyway?

                                 JR
                        World wide web.

           Connecticut shakes his head.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Fucking geeks.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - LARGE HALL - LATER

           JR and Connecticut stand in a large hall filled with 80s movie 
           memorabilia.  Everything from a “Batman” costume to a 
           “Robocop” prototype to the “Back to the Future” De Lorean.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Speaking of geeks.  The fuck, JR?  
                        This is a little out there.

                                 JR
                        I know, I went a little nuts when I 
                        got all that money.  Hit up every 
                        movie auction I could find. 

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        You know what though, I bet this 
                        would be cool on some special K.  
                        Wanna do some?

                                 JR
                        Actually, I’m going to pass.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Oh.

           Awkward pause.  Connecticut puts his head down.

                                 JR
                        You seem...hurt?

           Connecticut insincerely scoffs.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Well, that’s fucking stupid, I’m not.  
                        Did I tell you I stole a Commodore-64
                        from a public school in the projects.  
                                 (MORE)

                        It came with “Pitfall.”  I fucking 
                        love that game.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - BAR - NIGHT

           Connecticut sips on a Jack and Coke as he stares at a huge 
           sexy poster of Robyn in her underwear.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Your wife is one foxy piece of ass.

                                 JR
                        I’m flattered you think so.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        What did she model for?

                                 JR
                        She’s not a model.  She just likes 
                        poster-sized pictures of herself.  
                        That was taken on our honeymoon.

           Connecticut shrugs.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Nonetheless.

           He sees another poster of her, again, in her underwear.

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        What about that one?

                                 JR
                        Trip to San Fran.

           Connecticut scans the room and points to one with her lying on 
           her stomach, this time exposing her bare ass.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        The ass one?

                                 JR
                        Her grandfather’s birthday, why all 
                        the hurlyburly over Robyn?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Well, JR, I don’t know how to tell 
                        you this.  I figured I should show 
                        you before it hit geekspace.

           Connecticut retrieves a DVD from his inside pocket.
           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - THEATER - LATER

           JR and Connecticut watch Robyn having sex with a BEEFCAKE.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        This home theater is fresh.  We 
                        should watch “A Few Good Men” after 
                        this--

           Robyn moans loudly and exclaims:

                                 ROBYN (O.S.)
                        Oh!  It’s like I’m shitting a cock!

           Awkward silence.

                                 JR
                             (re: sex tape)
                        Where did you get this?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        It’s been getting passed around at 
                        the parties I’ve been copulating at.

                                 JR
                        What kind of parties?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        It’s interesting.  What we do is 
                        dress up as Romans, complete with 
                        sandals and headdress, and partake in 
                        open orgies while listening to sped 
                        up techno versions of Mozart.

                                 JR
                        That is interesting.

           The sex tape continues to play.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        This is horrible.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Well, I don’t think they were going 
                        for great cinematography JR.  The 
                        sound design is atrocious too.  Point 
                        is, you should be upset that she’s 
                        fucking some other dude, not at the 
                        production value!

                                 JR
                        That’s what I was referring to.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        ...Nevertheless.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - BAR - NIGHT

           Drunk, JR sips on his drink and notices the time: 7:27 AM.

           Robyn, tired and bleary eyed, walks in through the front door.  
           She’s caught off guard by JR.

                                 JR
                        It’s 7:30 in the morning.

                                 ROBYN
                        I was out.

                                 JR
                        Where?

                                 ROBYN
                        Fix me a drink.

                                 JR
                        Where were you?

                                 ROBYN
                        Ok, I’ll fix one myself.

           Robyn goes behind the bar and starts making a vodka tonic.

                                 JR
                        This isn’t Jeopardy, you can’t just 
                        not buzz in.  Where were you?

                                 ROBYN
                        Fine...what is an abortion clinic?

                                 JR
                        You’re pregnant?

                                 ROBYN
                        I was.

                                 JR
                        You’re fucking somebody else?

           Robyn sighs.  She takes a sip of her drink.

                                 ROBYN
                        Don’t have a period.  Who told you?

                                 JR
                        A video.
                                 ROBYN
                        On the Internet?  Fuck that Goddamn 
                        Internet.

                                 JR
                        No, this was old fashioned DVD.

                                 ROBYN
                        Yeah.  I was going to tell you, but 
                        I’ve just been really stressed out 
                        about it, what with the abortion, and 
                        the...pregnancy before that...you 
                        know?

           She lights a cigarette and hides her eyes.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Are you mad?

                                 JR
                        Yeah.  And hurt.  Not to mention that 
                        I’m slightly annoyed you just aborted 
                        what might have been my unborn child 
                        without telling me.

                                 ROBYN
                        I know, I’m a shitty person.  I 
                        didn’t know what to do.  I couldn’t 
                        have a baby, yours...or anyone’s...I 
                        just...I still love you.

                                 JR
                        Why’d you fuck this guy?

                                 ROBYN
                        I told you this would happen.

                                 JR
                        You never told me you’d cheat on me.  
                        In fact, when you married me, I think 
                        you explicitly told me you wouldn’t 
                        fucking shit cocks on the side!

                                 ROBYN
                        God, JR, I know you’re high and 
                        everything, but think for a nano.  
                        I’ve been miserable all these years.  
                        You’re off being a total Hollywood 
                        prick, buying up dumb fucking shit 
                        for a hallway no one shits about, and 
                        you never once cared about me or what 
                        I was going through.
                                 JR
                        What are you going through?

                                 ROBYN
                        A lot, ok?  A fuck lot.  Let’s face 
                        it, JR, you don’t love me.  You 
                        hardly even know me.  My therapist 
                        said you fell in love with this 
                        idyllic movie version of me.

                                 JR
                        You’re seeing a therapist?

                                 ROBYN
                        This is what I’m talking about, JR.  
                        I’ve been seeing a therapist for two 
                        years, and you never bothered to 
                        notice.

                                 JR
                        But you never told me you were seeing 
                        a therapist.

                                 ROBYN
                        Well, we started sleeping with each 
                        other, so it was hard to be 
                        forthright about that, but you get 
                        the gist.

                                 JR
                        Was that the guy in the video?

                                 ROBYN
                        I’d have to see it first, but 
                        probably.  He had dark hair, if that 
                        helps.

                                 JR
                        He was pretty fit for a therapist.

                                 ROBYN
                        JR, you and I, we were both lonely.  
                        We needed each other.  But this was 
                        never working...I’m leaving you.

                                 JR 
                        He was pretty beefy.

           Robyn shakes her head.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        You said you loved me.  You married 
                        me.
                                 ROBYN
                        You killed the part of me that loved 
                        you.

           Like a punch in the stomach, JR takes a moment.

                                 JR
                        That’s it, then?  This is over?

                                 ROBYN
                        You know what, JR?  I’m gonna turn on 
                        the TV.  We’re gonna relax, watch 
                        some daytime programming and couch 
                        potato this for a sec.  But yeah, I 
                        don’t think I can do this anymore.  
                        I’m probably going to leave you.

           Robyn turns on the TV.  She turns away from it to talk to JR.  
           On the screen, the news reports of the 9/11 attacks appear. 

           Shocked, JR stares at it.  Aloof, Robyn continues:

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        I love you JR, Ok?  It’s just that, I 
                        don’t know, I’ve been trying to tell 
                        you how depressed I’ve been, and 
                        would it kill you to bench press 
                        every once and awhile?

           JR is too entranced by the news.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Fine, I withdraw the bench press 
                        comment, but at least cardio for fuc--

           Robyn turns and sees the horrifying images.  

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God.  Aliens.  I fucking knew 
                        it.  I knew it!

           She quickly hides underneath the bar with her drink.

                                 ROBYN (CONT'D)
                        This is it, JR.  “Independence Day” 
                        was right on the money, just like 
                        I’ve been saying!

           JR turns up the volume to listen.  

           His cell phone rings.  He answers.
                                 CONNECTICUT (O.S.)
                        We’ve got balls of problems here.

           Stradlatter can be heard screaming in the background.

                                 JR
                        Yeah, I know, I just turned on the 
                        news.

                                 CONNECTICUT (O.S.)
                        No, not about the World Trade Center.  
                        This is a bigger can of 
                        nightcrawlers. Stradlatter is 
                        hitting a full-throttled conniption.

           From under the bar:

                                 ROBYN (O.S.)
                        JR!  Who are you talking to?  Are you 
                        ordering the jet?

                                 JR
                        What’s the sitch with Stradlatter?

                                 CONNECTICUT (O.S.)
                        They’re remaking an unauthorized 
                        version of “ADOW!”

                                 JR
                        You do know that the World Trade 
                        Center was just attacked and the 
                        whole country is in a state of 
                        emergency slash bedlam, right?

                                 CONNECTICUT (O.S.)
                        Doesn’t matter.  Stradlatter needs 
                        you here, rápido...do you know a 
                        Private Jason Hewlett?

           JR lets out a huge sigh.

           INT. MINDFUCK PICTURES OFFICES - DAY

           Stradlatter, heated and upset, sits behind the desk.  
           Connecticut sits in his usual seat next to him.  The TVs are 
           on continuous news coverage of the 9/11 attacks.

           JR, still disheveled, sits across from them.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Why do you look like shit?  Are you 
                        still stoned?
                                 JR
                        Well, yes, but that’s not why I look 
                        like shit.  I’ve been up all night.  
                        I think my marriage is falling apart.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        That’s not important right now, JR.  
                        Connecticut!  Show him!

           Connecticut hands him a script titled: “ADAW!” written by 
           Private Jason Hewlett

                                 JR
                        Adaw?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        A day at war.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        That script is being passed around to 
                        every major studio.  It’s getting a 
                        lot of heat, JR, we’re talking ultra 
                        cancer rays.  They’re saying it’s the 
                        honest account of what really 
                        happened that day.

                                 JR
                        Hewlett was there, but, Mr. 
                        Stradlatter, I was honest in my 
                        script.  I didn’t lie.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Well, this assclownfucker is saying 
                        you did!  There’s a fucking bidding 
                        war over the script that will 
                        supposedly end the credibility of 
                        MindFuck Pictures!  They’re saying 
                        once this gets made, we’re gonna have 
                        to hand over our Oscar.  Hand it 
                        fucking over!  Do you know how many 
                        studios, JR, have been asked to hand 
                        their Oscars back to the Academy?  Do 
                        you?

                                 JR
                        I would guess...zero?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Right as a Christian.  If this 
                        happens, our studio will lose its 
                        bacon...

           He points to the chest full of cash.
                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        And the eggs...

           He points to the Oscar sitting on a nearby shelf.

                                 JR
                        What do you want me to do?

           Mr. Stradlatter walks over to his father’s painting.  He weeps 
           while caressing it.  Connecticut continues:

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Mr. Stradlatter would like you to pay 
                        a visit to this Jason Hewlett.  Maybe 
                        threaten him, physically and 
                        financially.

                                 JR
                        Look, Mr. Stradlatter, with all due 
                        respect, I’m not sure if I’m 
                        comfortable--

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Let me explain something to you, JR.  
                        I know you’ve reached a certain 
                        modicum of success, what with your 
                        lucky investment into this Internet 
                        fad.  But once this fad wears away, 
                        where will you be?

                                 JR
                        Sir, I don’t think it’s a fad.  I 
                        think it’s the future.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Be that as it may, son, movies are 
                        forever.  And sure, maybe I can buy a 
                        few books online, but let me ask you 
                        this, can I buy a movie?

                                 JR
                        Yeah.

           Stunned, Mr. Stradlatter looks to Connecticut.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I think he’s right, sir.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Verify it.  Now, JR, I need you to 
                        put your perpetual stoned aloofness 
                        aside and tell me you’re going to 
                        help us.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        We were there for you when we turned 
                        your simple life story into a 
                        universal movie for the ages.  Now 
                        it’s your turn to be there for us.  
                        Papa Stradlatter needs you more than 
                        ever.  Please.  If this Oscar gets 
                        taken away, I will have disgraced his 
                        good name.  I will have failed my 
                        only purpose in life.

           JR looks at the painting and reluctantly nods.

           INT. HEWLETT PRODUCTIONS - DAY

           A small, rinky-dink outfit.  Jason Hewlett, now in business 
           attire, sits behind a desk with a huge grin.  JR uncomfortably 
           sits on a stool in front of him, leaning on his cane.

                                 JR
                        Do you have a chair I could sit on?

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        What’s the matter, JR, don’t like the 
                        stool?

                                 JR
                        It’s a little uncomfortable, to be 
                        honest.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        You were always a pussy.  Tough shit, 
                        those were on sale for $9.99.  Not 
                        everyone could have predicted that 
                        this nerd box was going to hit as big 
                        as you did, you fucking geek.

           Jason Hewlett’s straight-laced wife, DEBORAH, sternly enters.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Hewlett, we’ve snagged another 
                        studio, we’ll call them company D.

           She posts a sticker of a D on a big white board resembling

                        What’s their twenty?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Burbank, CA.  Who’s the glassy eyed 
                        grunt?

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Charlie.
           Deborah pulls out a gun and aims it at his head.

                                 JR
                        Is that absolutely necessary?

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        It’s Ok, Deborah.

           She puts the gun down.

                                 JR 
                        Actually, my name is JR.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        You’re Charlie Foxtrot to us, nerd.  
                        This is my wife.

           JR offers his hand, Deborah doesn’t take it.

                                 DEBORAH
                        What’s the ETA on Charlie’s 
                        departure?

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        I was just about to deep six him as 
                        we speak.

                                 DEBORAH
                        10-4.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Roger that.

           They coldly kiss.

                                 DEBORAH
                        India, Lima, Oscar, Victor, Echo, 
                        Uniform.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Love you too, babe.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Hoo-Rah!

           She leaves.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Time’s up, JR.  I have a script to 
                        sell.
                                 JR
                        You know, Hewlett, if it weren’t for 
                        me, your ass would be grass.

                                 JASON HEWLETT
                        Listen nerd, not a day goes by that I 
                        hadn’t wished I died that day.  I’d 
                        give anything to die in combat than 
                        to have the whole world know I was 
                        saved by a fucking geek like you.  
                        Now, it’s payback.

           INT. MINDFUCK PICTURES CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A room full of executives.  Mr. Stradlatter is at the helm.  
           JR meekly sits at the opposite end, holding his cane.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        As we all know, our reputation is at 
                        stake.  Folks, we have an enemy out 
                        there hellbent on ruining all our 
                        careers.  But we’re not going down 
                        without a fight.  I present to you...

           A overhead projector behind him displays “ALOW!”

                                 JR
                        ALOW?

           Mr. Stradlatter hits another button: “A LIFE OF WAR”

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        ALOW!  A life of war!

           The executives smile.

                                 JR
                        What is that?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        ALOW!  The exciting sequel to the 
                        hit, Oscar winning, ADOW!

           Connecticut stands promptly.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        In the sequel, we follow JR Randolph 
                        as he tries to adapt to life after 
                        surviving a day of war.

                        His success, his trials and 
                        tribulations, but at its core, a love 
                        story, where he finally marries his 
                        high school sweetheart, and live 
                        happily ever after.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        You see, JR, the only way to 
                        retaliate, is to push your story even 
                        further.  This sequel will capitalize 
                        on everything the first movie didn’t.  
                        What numbskull out there doesn’t like 
                        a good war hero’s rise to fame and 
                        fortune?

                                 JR
                        So...this is about me?  You want me 
                        to write a script based on my life 
                        since the war?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        What do you think?

           JR sighs.

                                 JR
                        Ok, fine, I’ll do it, but then that’s 
                        it.  After this, my obligation to you 
                        is over.  When is this happening? 

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        The way we figure it, Hewlett and 
                        company are gonna push for a release 
                        next spring, in line with Bush’s 
                        announcement of the Iraq invasion.

                                 JR
                        Bush is invading Iraq?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        That doesn’t leave this room.

                                 JR
                        But Iraq had nothing to do with the 
                        9/11 attacks.  How do you know this?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        JR, I sometimes forget your naivete.  
                        Just look at Washington as another 
                        movie studio in the Hollywood system.  
                        They have their slate of blockbuster 
                        releases, just like everyone else.  
                        And they’ve slated Gulf War 2 for 
                        spring of ‘03.

                                 MR. STRADLATTER (CONT'D)
                        Which means we don’t have a lot of 
                        time.  It’s the perfect storm, JR.  
                        Two hit sequels coming out 
                        simultaneously!  One hand washes the 
                        other.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        This will legitimize our franchise, 
                        and totally overshadow ADAW!’s
                        release.

                                 JR
                        How much time do I have to write 
                        this?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        Son, you know I respect your work.  
                        And I want this to be the best sequel 
                        since “Superman II.”  You can have 
                        all the time in the world, I want 
                        this to be perfect.  But 
                        realistically speaking, three weeks.

                                 JR
                        Three weeks?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        With CGI effects nowadays, we need a 
                        year of post to polish this thing.

                                 JR
                        CGI?

                                 MR. STRADLATTER
                        It’s the new thing, JR.  Every great 
                        movie has it, and so will this.  Now, 
                        do what you have to do.  But in three 
                        weeks, I need that magical screenplay 
                        on my fucking desk.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Depressed, JR and Connecticut sit in the living room.

                                 JR
                        Robyn left me this morning.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Fuck her.  She was no good, JR.  You 
                        deserve better.

                                 JR
                        I think I’m going to go up to my 
                        cabin for a few weeks to write this.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Good call.  Maybe do some peyote and 
                        be one with nature and shit.

                                 JR
                        No, I’m just going to write.  
                        Probably longhand since the 
                        electricity is spotty up there.

           Connecticut gets an idea.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Holy Giuliani! I have an idea.

           INT. MINDFUCK PICTURES OFFICES - NIGHT

           After hours.  JR and Connecticut (in a cat burglar outfit) 
           stand outside the doors of the office, looking in.  They see 
           the infamous Stradlatter pen in a glass case on the shelf.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        I’ve been waiting my whole life to do 
                        this.

                                 JR
                        That actually frightens me more.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Stealing is an art, JR.  You can’t 
                        just steal for the sake of stealing, 
                        you have to have reason, passion 
                        behind it.  This, you needing to 
                        write longhand in some creepy “Evil 
                        Dead” cabin and MindFuck being on the 
                        line, it’s perfect!

                                 JR
                        I don’t know if you’re making much 
                        sense, Connecticut.  I’m being honest 
                        right now.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        If I know Stradlatter, he’s probably 
                        got this whole thing booby trapped 
                        with lasers and whatnot.  So, we 
                        can’t just walk in there and take it.

                                 JR
                        Yeah, but you knew the security code 
                        to the alarm.  We disabled it.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        All right, I see your point.  This is 
                        fucking exciting.

                                 JR
                        Really?  But you shoplift all the 
                        time.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Yeah, but this is the motherload, JR.  
                        It’s Stradlatter’s pen.  The pen.  
                        This is going to be my greatest 
                        accomplishment bar none.  I have to 
                        do this.  For me.

           Connecticut opens the door.  He hugs the walls and shimmies 
           near the shelf.  He opens the glass case, slips the pen out, 
           and slides it into his pocket.  He walks back out.

                        The quiche has been baked.  Let’s go.

           EXT. MINDFUCK PICTURES OFFICES - NIGHT

           Connecticut is on cloud nine, screaming with enthusiasm.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        We fucking did it, JR!  We fucking 
                        did it!  What a rush!

                                 JR
                        Hopefully Stradlatter doesn’t mind.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Are you kidding, that’s the point?!  
                        He’s going to fucking mind, of course 
                        he’ll mind!  It’s going to be great!

           He hugs JR.

                                 CONNECTICUT (CONT'D)
                        I love you man!  I do!  That was 
                        greater than any drug experience, 
                        than any party, than anything.  I 
                        feel alive, I feel fucking alive!  I 
                        did this for you man, I did it all 
                        for you!

                                 JR
                        You said you were doing it for 
                        yourself back there, which is 
                        probably more accurate since I didn’t 
                        even really want the pen.
                                 CONNECTICUT
                        You know what, JR, my life’s complete 
                        now.  That was it, that was my life’s 
                        mission.  I’m done.

                                 JR
                        Done?  Done with what?

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        This, JR, I’m done.  I’m gonna be a 
                        real person now, go out on dates, 
                        maybe stop using drugs...for 
                        recreational use, go to rehab.  I’m 
                        gonna finally join society.  Meatloaf 
                        and all.

           Connecticut screams with enthusiasm down the street.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - DAY

           JR, with a suitcase, begins a hobbled walk towards the door 
           with his cane.  Robyn appears in the doorway.

                                 ROBYN
                        What are you doing?

                                 JR
                        I’m taking a break.  Heading up to 
                        the mountains for a little bit.

                                 ROBYN
                        Are you leaving me?

                                 JR
                        Am I leaving you?  I thought you were 
                        leaving me.

                                 ROBYN
                        No.  I said probably, but I didn’t 
                        mean it.  I still love you.

                                 JR
                        Oh, then to answer your question, 
                        yes, I am leaving you.

                                 ROBYN
                        What?!  Why?  I told you I wouldn’t 
                        cheat on you again!

                                 JR
                        No, you actually never said that.  
                        But this is over.  Good bye.
           INT. LIMO - DAY

           JR sits in the backseat, with his suitcase in his lap.  Robyn, 
           now upset, sits next to him, pleading.

                                 ROBYN
                        Please don’t leave me!  Please!

                                 JR
                        Robyn, you were right, I married you 
                        for the wrong reasons.  This was a 
                        mistake.  I did to my whole life what 
                        your therapist did to you in that 
                        video.

                                 ROBYN
                        Please!  Don’t do this!  I need you!  
                        I promise, I’ll find a new therapist!

                                 JR
                        You’re still seeing him?

                                 ROBYN
                        You mean for therapy or for sex?

           EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD LANDING STRIP - DAY

           JR walks up the steps to his private jet.  Robyn clutches onto 
           his cane, still pleading her case.

                                 ROBYN
                        Please, JR!  I love you!  I don’t 
                        want to lose you!  Please need me!

                                 JR
                        Why Robyn?

                                 ROBYN
                        Because I’m fucked and I need you.  
                        I’m fucked!  Ok?  Everyone in my 
                        whole life used me, even my Goddamn 
                        therapist.

                                 JR
                        Sadly, in a way, I did too.

                                 ROBYN
                        Why?  Why can’t you just want me for 
                        who I am?  Why is that so fucking 
                        hard for people to accept?
                                 JR
                        It’s my fault.  I went about this the 
                        wrong way.  I thought you’d give me 
                        happiness.  I thought all of this 
                        would.  But it didn’t.  It just did 
                        the polar opposite.

                                 ROBYN
                        You were never happy with me?

                                 JR
                        A friend once told me that no one’s 
                        ever happy.  That’s why they call it 
                        happy.

           Robyn struggles to keep from crying, but lets go.  They hug as 
           the jet’s propellers spin up.  They exchange words, but the 
           loud fans keep their dialogue inaudible.  They finally kiss.

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           JR walks in, suitcase and cane in hand.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I arrived at a small desolate cabin 
                        near the mountains.  I needed to get 
                        away, start anew, start fresh.  
                        Depression was winning, I had hit a 
                        low point.  Robyn was right.  I was 
                        just another Hollywood prick, I was 
                        just as bad as that asshole Jason 
                        Hewlett.  Substitute monosyllabic 
                        grunts with articulation, and I was 
                        the same douche I had always hated.  

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           JR sits in a comfortable leather chair and stares into space.  
           He pulls the pen out and starts to write.  The pen slowly 
           fades, the ink is gone.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The tug of depression became 
                        overwhelming.  Three weeks turned 
                        into three months.
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           JR in the same chair with a beard and a bigger belly.
                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Three months turned into three years.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           JR, same chair, long beard and hair, bigger belly.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Three years turned into six years.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           JR, same chair, longer beard and hair, huge belly.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I stopped receiving phone calls.  I 
                        stopped reading the news.  I cut 
                        myself completely off from the real 
                        world.  The tug of depression had 
                        won.  I lost...until finally, I 
                        decided to get up.

           Weakly, JR stands up on his cane and brushes himself off.  

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And go home.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION

           JR enters his dusty, empty mansion.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        Within minutes of my return, I 
                        discovered that Robyn had moved in 
                        with a Tony award winning dancer from 
                        the musical “Wicked,” Stradlatter 
                        moved forward with ALOW!, then was 
                        outed later for producing an 
                        unauthorized autobiography, thus 
                        dismantling MindFuck Pictures.  He 
                        even had to return his coveted Oscar.  
                        He committed suicide by stepping in 
                        front of a semi.  A movie is in the 
                        works.  But the most startling news 
                        of all came with a phone call...

           A PHONE RING.
           JR drops his suitcase and scurries towards the living room.  
           He blows the dust off the phone and answers with a cough.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Umm...hello?

                                 JR
                        Yes?

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Excuse my astonishment, no one’s 
                        answered the phone in the past year 
                        and a half.  I’m looking for a JR 
                        Randolph?

                                 JR
                        This is he.

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Wow!  Again, excuse my astonishment, 
                        didn’t expect you to be the one 
                        answering--

                                 JR
                        May I help you?

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Well, Mr. Randolph, we’ve been trying 
                        to get a hold of you, like I was 
                        saying.  Frankly, the estate you 
                        inherited is going to default back to 
                        the state if you don’t do something 
                        about it.  It’s kind of urgent that 
                        you sign the appropriate forms--

                                 JR
                        My inheritance?

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Well...yes...your inheritance, from 
                        your parents...oh gosh, did no one 
                        tell you?

                                 JR
                        I haven’t spoken to anyone in six 
                        years.  You’re the first.
                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Oh, I see, that’s peculiar.  Well, I 
                        hate to be the one that breaks the 
                        news, but your parents are dead, Mr. 
                        Randolph.  They died in a car 
                        accident last spring.

           Stunned and hurt, JR drops his cane sits on a couch, kicking 
           up enormous dust.  He begins coughing hysterically.  He looks 
           around and sees his familiar childhood atoms and molecules.

                                 LAWYER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Randolph?  Hello?  Hello?

           JR drops the phone as the floating atoms swirl around him.

           INT. GROUP HOME FOR THE DISABLED - DAY

           JR sits in a large room talking to his now older sister, 
           Nancy.  She quietly sits and reads out loud Judy Blume’s “You 
           There God? It's Me, Margaret."

                                 JR
                        Nancy?  It’s your brother, JR.

           She continues to read, completely ignoring him.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Nancy?  I will get the fuckhead who 
                        did this to Mom and Dad.

           No response, she continues to read.

           INT. GROUP HOME FOR THE DISABLED - COUNSELER OFFICE - LATER

           JR sits across from a pretty counselor named AMY FILLMORE.  He 
           notices the nameplate and asks:

                                 JR
                        Amy Fillmore?  Any relation to 
                        Millard?

                                 AMY
                        Millard?

                                 JR
                        The thirteenth President?

                                 AMY
                        The President of what?

                                 JR
                        I guess not.
                                 AMY
                        Listen, JR, I can see you’re in a lot 
                        of pain.

                                 JR
                        Good.  Since I’m perpetually high, 
                        I’ve often wondered if people can 
                        read my emotions.

                                 AMY
                        High?  You mean, you’re stoned?

                                 JR
                        Yes.

                                 AMY
                        Right now?

                                 JR
                        Yes.

                                 AMY
                        I see.  The past year must have been 
                        painful for you, but there are ways 
                        around it.  I know of a great 
                        Narcotics Anonymous group, if you’re 
                        interested.

                                 JR
                        It’s a little more complicated than 
                        that, but thanks for the advice.

                                 AMY
                        Well, I want to reassure you that 
                        Nancy’s in good hands here.  We all 
                        love her.

                                 JR
                        I can see that in you.  That you love 
                        her.  You’re very beautiful, by the 
                        way.

           Amy blushes and awkwardly smiles.

                                 AMY
                        Thanks.

                                 JR
                        You look happy.

                                 AMY
                        I would say that I am.
                                 JR
                        That’s nice.  I’m sure you’ll pass 
                        this time around.

                                 AMY
                        I’m sorry?  Pass what?

                                 JR
                        What happened to my parents?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, you don’t...you didn’t know?

                                 JR
                        No, I’ve been gone for six years.  
                        It’s been a lot of catching up.  I 
                        just found out about YouTube 
                        yesterday.  Interesting idea.

                                 AMY
                        Yes it is.  Pretty popular.  Well, 
                        your parents died in a car accident.

                                 JR
                        Someone hit them?

                                 AMY
                        Drunk driver.

                                 JR
                        Who?

                                 AMY
                        They never caught the person.  It was 
                        a hit and run.  I guess it was 
                        customary that your mom asked Nancy 
                        to read a book when she and your dad 
                        would leave the house for an errand.  
                        She told Nancy they would be home 
                        before she finished it, kind of a way 
                        to preoccupy her while she was alone.  
                        She hasn’t stopped reading the book 
                        since.

                                 JR
                        The guy who did this is a fucking 
                        asshole.  My sister needed my 
                        parents, for better or worse.  No one 
                        does what this cockface did and gets 
                        away with it.  No one.  He deserves 
                        to die.
                                 AMY 
                        You sure you don’t want that NA
                        number?  I think you should take some 
                        time off, clear your head.

                                 JR
                        I took six years off, and it didn’t 
                        help.  I’m more miserable than ever.  
                        But now I know what needs to be done 
                        for any shot at redemption.  Again, 
                        thanks for the advice.

           JR leans on his cane and gets up to leave.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        You are very beautiful.

           He stammers out.

           EXT. GROUP HOME FOR THE DISABLED - DAY

           JR stands outside and looks at Nancy through her window.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I needed to get back on course.  I 
                        was desperately sliding down misery 
                        mountain, and I had to climb back up.  
                        I’d be damned if I would let my 
                        sister rot in a group home without 
                        some sort of redemption.  Vengeance 
                        gave me the purpose in life I needed.  
                        I was going to kill my parents’ 
                        murderer for ruining my sister’s 
                        life.  Revenge, not love or success, 
                        would now fill my void.  Justice 
                        would be my new path to vim.

           INT. JAMES FRY PRIVATE EYE OFFICES - DAY

           A shabby Hollywood office.  JAMES FERNER, a snarky private 
           investigator, sits behind his desk.

                                 JAMES
                        James Ferner, how may I help you?

                                 JR
                        It says James Fry, Private Eye 
                        outside.

                                 JAMES
                        Just has a better ring to it, don’t 
                        you think?
                                 JR
                        It rhymes, if that’s what you mean.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s what I mean.  What can I do 
                        for you Mr. Randolph?

                                 JR
                        I need to find a person.

                                 JAMES
                        I can help you.  Who are you trying 
                        to find?

                                 JR
                        He was a drunk driver that killed my 
                        parents on March 29th, 2006.

           JR lifts an envelope up and hands it to him.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        These are all the newspaper clippings 
                        and police reports surrounding the 
                        case.  It was a hit and run.

           James sifts through this as he curiously peers at JR.

                                 JAMES
                        Wait a minute, you’re JR Randolph, 
                        aren’t you?!  The crazy billionaire 
                        guy that disappeared all those years.  
                        I like that beard.  Put on a few 
                        pounds I see.

                                 JR
                        Yeah.

                                 JAMES
                        You know, I was hired to find you!

                                 JR
                        Didn’t do a very good job.  Maybe I 
                        should find someone else.

                                 JAMES
                        No, no, no. That was a weird period 
                        in my life.  I was going through a 
                        crazy divorce, cunt tried to take my 
                        Miata.  That’s over with now.

                                 JR
                        Did you get the Miata?
                                 JAMES
                        No.  But I left a decayed human thumb 
                        in the glove compartment.

           JR lifts himself up on his cane.

                                 JR
                        Let me know when you find him.  I’m 
                        kind of going through a weird period 
                        myself.  I need this right now.

                                 JAMES
                        Don’t you worry, Mr. Randolph.  I 
                        will catch this prick or my name 
                        isn’t James Fry.

                                 JR
                        It isn’t.

                                 JAMES
                        You get what I’m saying.

           He leaves.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - BAR - NIGHT

           JR sits at his bar and gets drunk.  He stares at the dusty 
           Robyn posters on the walls.  He throws his drink at one of 
           them, smashing the glass.

           He then goes on a tirade and rips down all the posters, 
           smashing them up with his cane.  He does the same with the 
           bar, destroying glasses, bottles, everything.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           JR attacks the living room next.  Trashing everything.

           INT. RANDOLPH MANSION - LARGE HALL - NIGHT

           With slightly more hesitation, JR continues his rampage on his 
           beloved movie memorabilia.

           A PHONE RING.  He answers.

                                 JR
                        Yeah?

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Mr. Randolph?  It’s James Ferner.

                                 JR
                        Who?
                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        James Fry, Private Eye.  We met 
                        yesterday.  About the drunk driver.

                                 JR
                        Yeah?

           JR slumps against a wall and notices the fallen Batman suit.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        This guy was pretty easy to find.  
                        Name’s a Bob Country.  He’s a petty 
                        thief, few sentences here and there.  
                        Wound up homeless.  He’s currently 
                        staying at the St. John Church 
                        Shelter on Willard Ave.

                                 JR
                        What does he look like?

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Old, white.  He always wears a jacket 
                        with his name stitched on it.  It’s 
                        in every one of his mugshots.

                                 JR
                        You sure it’s him?

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Positive.  I can come by with some 
                        proof if you’d like, some testimonies 
                        where he actually confess--

                                 JR
                        No thanks.

           He hangs up on him and continues to stare at the Batman suit.

           I/E. ST JOHN’S CHURCH - NIGHT

           Old homeless man BOB COUNTRY, wearing his shirt that reads: 
           BOB COUNTRY.  He sits alone in the bell tower and eats.

           In the darkness, he hears a sound followed by a silhouette of 
           a heavier set Batman using a cane.

           Bob stands and walks closer to the figure.

                                 BOB COUNTRY
                        Who’s there?
                                 JR/BATMAN
                        Have you ever danced with the devil 
                        by the pale moonlight?

                                 BOB COUNTRY
                        What the heck?

           JR/Batman swings his cane and hits him hard in the face.  Bob 
           Country staggers backwards and wipes his nose.

                                 BOB COUNTRY (CONT'D)
                        Are you out of your heckin’ mind?

           JR steps out to reveal he’s wearing the Batman suit.  His gut 
           stretches it out.  His long beard creeps out of the mask.

                                 JR/BATMAN
                        You killed my parents.

           He hits Bob again with the cane, knocking him to the ground.

                                 BOB COUNTRY
                        Please!  Stop!  You’re hurting me!

           JR grabs him by the collar and brings him close.

                                 JR/BATMAN
                        You made me!

                                 BOB COUNTRY
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about!  Please, crazy person, stop--

           He coughs.  He can’t breath, gasps.  A stroke.

                                 JR/BATMAN
                        Bob?!  Bob Country?!

           A SCREAM.  By the door, a NUN snaps a picture with her cell.  

                                 JR/BATMAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh fuck.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I will now display a picture of a 
                        swan diving for no known reason.

           GRAPHIC: a still of a swan diving.
                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was immediately arrested and 
                        charged for the murder of Bob 
                        Country.  Although his heart attack 
                        was ultimately what got the best of 
                        him, they believed they had a case 
                        since I declared I would kill him to 
                        witnesses days prior.  My lawyers 
                        said it didn’t look good.  The death 
                        sentence was suggested.  They urged 
                        me to plead not guilty by reason of 
                        insanity on the count of me wearing 
                        the Batman suit.  When they locked me 
                        up, I also claimed I saw atoms and 
                        molecules, which furthered my 
                        insanity plea.  I was sentenced to a 
                        federal penitentiary, the mental 
                        illness ward, for the rest of my 
                        years.

           INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY, MENTAL ILLNESS WARD - DAY

           JR sits alone in a white room filled with atoms and molecules.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I later would keep the atoms and 
                        molecules to myself, since again, I 
                        was convinced they were trying to use 
                        my special powers for evil.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY, MENTAL ILLNESS WARD - DAY

           JR’s beard is now gone.  His hair turns gray.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        As the years passed, the isolation 
                        destroyed my spirit.  Every 
                        Christmas, they would allow me to 
                        watch two hours of television as a 
                        treat.  Things I learned from this 
                        limited contact with the outside 
                        world: In 2025, designs on ass 
                        pockets became a fad.

           ON TV: Levis commercial displaying different jeans’ ass 
           pockets featuring cartoon characters, Chinese lettering, and 
           ironic Internet chat lingo.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In 2048, baseball replaced umpires 
                        with computers.
           ON TV: A baseball game.  The BATTER lays off a pitch.  Behind 
           the board, the digital screen displays: STRIKE 3, YOU’RE OUT!  
           The BATTER charges the screen with his bat and beats it to 
           pieces.  His teammates attempt to stop him.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In 2051, green screen mime movies 
                        became a hit in Tinseltown.

           ON TV: a MIME, clearly in front of a green screen composited 
           apartment, improvises around the furniture in a corny manner.

           INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY, MENTAL ILLNESS WARD - DAY

           JR, old and frail, lays in his bed.  The atoms and molecules 
           slowly dissolve away.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        In 2057, I died.
                             (beat)
                        For the five hundred thousandth time.

           The last atom fades away.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. DMV PARKING LOT - DAY

           JR, old and white-haired, stands in the familiar parking lot.  
           TWO POLICEMAN stand in front of him.

                                 POLICEMAN #1
                        JR Randolph?

                                 JR
                        Yeah?

                                 POLICEMAN #1
                        Please come with us.

           JR looks at the other baffled recent dead.

                                 JR
                        What’s this about?

                                 POLICEMAN #1
                        You have to come with us.

           The two Policeman approach him on either side.  JR lifts his 
           cane and sweeps one of the Policeman’s legs, sending him to 
           the ground hard.  He whacks the other policeman across the 
           face and takes off into the DMV.
           INT. DMV WAITING ROOM - DAY

           JR maniacally runs through the busy DMV room towards Millard’s 
           office.  Policemen run after him.

           INT. MILLARD FILMORE’S OFFICE - DAY

           JR rushes into the empty office.  No Millard Fillmore.  He 
           sees the birth door and has no choice.  He runs in.

           INT. JR RANDOLPH MUSEUM - DAY

           JR walks into a luxurious museum, confused.  A MUSEUM 
           ATTENDANT is there to greet him.

                                 MUSEUM ATTENDANT
                        Hello, welcome to the Museum of JR 
                        Randolph’s Life.  Step this way 
                        please.

           She hands him a program.

                                 JR
                        This is a museum of my life?

                                 MUSEUM ATTENDANT
                        Please step this way.

           She motions him inside.

                                 JR
                        So, it’s over?  I’m already an 
                        artifact.  I can’t be reborn?

           No response.

           JR nods and walks into the museum.

           He walks past paintings of photo galleries all taken from 
           different periods of his life.  He sees one painting of two 
           dogs humping and smiles at the memory.

           He continues past films being projected on walls, moments 
           captured from his youth.  One film projected is of his younger 
           self and Nancy eating cereal together.

           ON FILM:

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Hey Nancy, wanna hear a joke?  It’s a 
                        cereal joke!

           Nancy laughs.
                                 YOUNG JR (CONT'D)
                        Why are you laughing, I haven’t even 
                        told you the joke yet!

           She continues to laugh.  Young JR joins in the laughter.

           JR smiles again and continues on his walk.

           EXT. MILLARD FILMORE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Millard is standing with the two Policemen.  He sees the 
           opened birth door and shakes his head.

                                 MILLARD
                        I’ll bring him back.  Just stay put.

           Millard enters.

           INT. JR RANDOLPH MUSEUM - DAY

           Millard is greeted by the chipper Attendant.

                                 MUSEUM ATTENDANT
                        Please step this way.

                                 MILLARD
                        Hi young lass, I’m looking for a 
                        mediocre looking fellow.

                                 MUSEUM ATTENDANT
                        He’s in the Twilight Hall, sir.

           INT. JR RANDOLPH MUSEUM - TWILIGHT HALL - DAY

           A sign reads: TWILIGHT HALL

           Millard walks in and sees JR sitting alone, looking at a 
           display of a tattered copy of Nancy’s book “Dear God, it’s Me 
           Margaret.”  Millard sits next to him.

                                 JR
                        This is what happens when it’s over?  
                        I become a relic, a museum.

           Millard nods slowly.

                                 MILLARD
                        It’s time to go JR.

                                 JR
                        Hell and Damnation?
                                 MILLARD
                        It appears that way.

                                 JR
                        I tried Millard.  I really did.

                                 MILLARD
                        Do you know why the After-Life 
                        committee removes logical memory of 
                        past lives in the first place?

                                 JR
                        No.

                                 MILLARD
                        Because over the years they’ve 
                        noticed that people with memories of 
                        their past failures succeeded less in 
                        their subsequent tries.  The 
                        committee did this to help shepherd 
                        people through the After-Life, 
                        instilling them with emotional memory 
                        and a supposed inspirational After-
                        Life Agent for guidance.  Instead, we 
                        skirted the system.  We cheated.

                                 JR
                        I just don’t get it.  I really 
                        thought I was on the right path this 
                        time.

                                 MILLARD
                        I know, I read the report.  Tell me, 
                        JR, when you were this...movie maker, 
                        what kind of stories did you write?

                                 JR
                        I don’t know, I guess I wrote about 
                        my life.

                                 MILLARD
                        Did you write from your gut, your 
                        heart?

                                 JR
                        No.  I was told to write from the 
                        pocketbook, and to add heart later.

                                 MILLARD
                        Why do you suppose they asked you to 
                        do this?
                                 JR
                        They wanted to sell the movie, and 
                        win awards.  They had a demographic 
                        they were targeting.  And they wanted 
                        me to tailor the script to those 
                        people.

                                 MILLARD
                        I see.  And when you wrote the 
                        script, the real script that 
                        ultimately became your miserable 
                        life, what demographic did you write 
                        that for?

                                 JR
                        I’m sorry?

                                 MILLARD
                        Going to war, selling your story, 
                        marrying the wrong girl, what 
                        audience were you targeting?

           JR doesn’t respond.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        You sold out your life journey, JR.  
                        You wrote your life for an audience.   
                        For your parents.  For your friends.  
                        For the public.  You wanted to look 
                        good on paper.  All the story 
                        elements you used to fill your void 
                        was never for you.  You never cared 
                        about yourself, you never once 
                        realized that the audience you should 
                        have been living for was you and you 
                        alone.

           JR looks down.  He slowly nods.

                                 JR 
                        I understand.

                                 MILLARD
                        JR, do you know what happens if I 
                        reject your vim eligibility?

                                 JR
                        A really horrible, eternal burning 
                        sensation.
                                 MILLARD
                        You’ll be shipped to Hell, and those 
                        bastards love to pile on the 
                        paperwork.  Lord knows I hate 
                        paperwork.
                             (shakes his head)
                        I’m going to approve your vim 
                        eligibility.  This was as much my 
                        fault as it was yours.  I should have 
                        never given you that drug.

           Millard stands.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Come on, let’s get you through.

           JR doesn’t move.

                                 JR
                        I’d like to go back.

           JR solemnly stands and looks at Millard.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        I need to go back.  Please.  I know 
                        I’ve been given enough chances, but I 
                        just need one more.  One more try.  I 
                        still have that void, even now.  I 
                        never got a chance to experience vim.  
                        I think I know what to do now.

           Millard thinks it over.

                                 MILLARD
                        Ok, this is a pretty big favor you’re 
                        asking of me, but I think Wilma 
                        doubles as an accountant.  I’ll have 
                        her fudge the numbers.  
                        Unfortunately, there’s no reversal of 
                        this narcotic that I so unwisely 
                        prescribed to you, so you’ll still 
                        have the unbearable memory of your 
                        past life.  You sure you can do this?

           JR nods.

           INT. MILLARD FILLMORE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Millard and JR stand in front of the rebirth door.

                                 MILLARD
                        Well, this is it.
                                 JR
                        Was Wilma ok with it?

                                 MILLARD
                        I think she has a little bit of a 
                        schoolgirl crush on me.  But, hey, 
                        sometimes you have to take one for 
                        the team as the vernacular goes.

           JR smiles.

                                 MILLARD (CONT'D)
                        Hey, can you do me favor and stop 
                        that prostitute?  It’s a middle 
                        school for crying out loud.

                                 JR
                        I will.

           JR nods.  He walks through the door.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I will now display a picture of a 
                        snake eating its tail for no known 
                        reason.

           GRAPHIC: a still of a snake eating its tail.

                                 JR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So, I was reborn.  Grew up, smoked 
                        out with Robyn, but didn’t get 
                        perpetually high this time.  Life 
                        didn’t seem as hazy.  I opted out of 
                        going to war.  Never believed in it 
                        anyway.  Went to University of 
                        Buffalo, which was founded by none 
                        other than Millard Fillmore, the 
                        thirteenth President of the United 
                        States.  Shortly thereafter, I moved 
                        to New York and became a sportswriter 
                        for the Mets.

           INT. LA COUNTY MUSIC CENTER - NIGHT

           Emma Thompson wins for “Sense and Sensibility."  Mel Gibson 
           wins for “Braveheart.”

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        “Braveheart” took top honors in 1995.  
                        As did Emma for her writing in “Sense 
                        and Sensibility.”
           INT. MUSSO AND FRANK - NIGHT

           JR sits across the way from Connecticut and his beautiful, 
           young girlfriend, GEORGIA.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I befriended Connecticut through my 
                        ties with the Mets.  He seemed to be 
                        doing better on this try.  Fell in 
                        love with a girl named Georgia, like 
                        the state, just south of North 
                        Carolina.

           Connecticut tries to steal the exotic ashtray into his coat 
           pocket.  Georgia yells:

                                 GEORGIA
                        Pillow!

           Connecticut puts the ashtray down and looks straight ahead.

                                 CONNECTICUT
                        Pillow’s our safe word.

           INT. GROUP HOME FOR THE DISABLED - COUNSELER OFFICE - DAY

           JR eagerly asks Amy out.  Amy grimaces.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        I asked Amy out.  But she didn’t 
                        take.  I’ll try to be more 
                        persistent, as Connecticut always 
                        suggests.

           EXT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - DAY

           JR stands in front of his old house.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        The morning of my parents’ car 
                        accident, I waited outside my old 
                        house to see my sister.

           JR walks in.

           INT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - DAY

           He hears the sound of Nancy talking upstairs.  He walks up.

           INT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - NANCY’S ROOM - DAY

           Nancy sits on her bed and reads “You There God? It's Me, 
           Margaret" out loud, to her self.  JR sits next to her.
           He sees a finished bowl of cereal on her dresser.

                                 JR
                        I can’t remember the last time I had 
                        cereal.  I used to love it.  Remember 
                        that cereal joke I used to tell you 
                        when we were kids.

           Nancy continues to read, not responding.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Ok, I’ll tell it to you again.  So 
                        there’s a box of cornflakes.  And at 
                        the bottom of the box was a flake 
                        called Blake the Flake.  Well, Blake, 
                        dissatisfied for being at the bottom, 
                        climbs all the way to the top and 
                        exclaims: “I’m Blake the Flake, and 
                        I’m the greatest Flake of them all!”  
                        Then someone comes by and flips the 
                        box over.  So, again, he finds a way 
                        to climb to the top and exclaims 
                        loudly: “I’m Blake the Flake, and I’m 
                        the greatest Flake of them all!”  
                        Then someone comes by and flips the 
                        box over.  Again, he climbs to the 
                        top and exclaims even louder still: 
                        “I’m Blake the Flake, I’m the 
                        greatest Flake of them all!”  Then 
                        someone comes by and flips the box 
                        over.  So, with a sigh, he climbs 
                        back up and at the top of his lungs 
                        screams: “I’m Blake the Flake, I’m 
                        the greatest Flake of them all!”  
                        Then someone comes by and flips the 
                        box over.

           JR’s eyes well.  His sister still reads.  No response.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Get it, Nancy?  It’s a serial joke.  
                        Get it?

           He starts to cry.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        Mom and Dad are dead, Nancy.  They 
                        died in a car accident this morning.  
                        I’m sorry.

           Undeterred, Nancy continues to read.
                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Nancy.  I’m really sorry, 
                        OK?  I’m sorry.

           JR puts his head down as he sobs.

                                 JR (CONT'D)
                        I’m fucking sorry.  I’m so fucking 
                        sorry.

           He hugs Nancy tight.  She hugs him back.

           JR stands up, quietly crying, and walks out.

           INT. RANDOLPH HOUSE - JR’S BEDROOM - DAY

           He walks into his old room and turns on his old Windows 3.11 
           PC.  He starts typing.

                                 JR (V.O.)
                        That’s when I started writing this 
                        account.  I don’t know why, but I do 
                        know that this is for me, and only 
                        me, and no one else.  And who knows 
                        what will happen.  Who knows if I’ll 
                        actually succeed this time around.  I 
                        just know that I can’t worry about 
                        that anymore.  You get told how to 
                        write the story of your life as you 
                        grow up.  And it gets hard to stay 
                        true to what you want.  Especially 
                        with those mind fuckers out there.  
                        Don’t let them take a shit in your 
                        brain.  It fucking reeks.

           JR turns the monitor off.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
