           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           MUSIC BLARES in a packed house-party, mixing with the CHATTER 
           of a few dozen GUESTS (mid-to-late 20s).

           WALLACE (mid-20s), handsome but scruffy, holds a beer and 
           stares straight ahead, amused.

                                 WALLACE
                        We Are Nothing But Dancing Light In The 
                        Restless Dream Of A Roasted Pig. 

           CHANTRY (mid-20s), casually adorable, steps up next to 
           Wallace. She also holds a beer and stares straight ahead.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Wet Slippery Skin Whispers.

           Wallace is a little startled by Chantry, but he plays it 
           cool, shifting his gaze straight ahead again. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Climb In My Car, There Are Secluded Spots 
                        To Be Parked Under.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Cheesy Excrement.

           Wallace and Chantry stare at a fridge covered in hundreds of 
           pieces of fridge-magnet poetry. Most of the word-magnets are 
           arranged into poems, dozens of them. Among the poems they’ve 
           already read out loud, Wallace spots: “CHEESY EXCREMENT”. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen so many of these things. 

                                 WALLACE
                        I guess there’s a bunch of sets all
                        lumped together. 

           Wallace points to another poem.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        My Forte Is Toothpaste And Cigars.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s “fort” actually.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, I know. Because “fort-ay” is 
                        Italian and means forcefully.

           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        And “fort” is French and means strength.

                                 WALLACE & CHANTRY
                        But everyone always says “fort-ay”.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, but since I learned that, I still 
                        say “fort-ay”, because when you say 
                        “fort” everyone thinks you’re wrong. Even 
                        though that’s the correct pronunciation.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Me too, usually. That’s so weird.

           ALLAN (mid-20s), amiably brash, wanders up to them.

                                 ALLAN
                        Hey, you guys’ve met?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Sort of.

                                 ALLAN
                        This is Wallace, a friend of mine from 
                        university. And this is my cousin 
                        Chantry...

           Allan trails off, noticing NICOLE (mid-20s), pretty but 
           severe, entering the kitchen and looking around. 

                                 NICOLE
                        Do you guys know Allan?

                                 ALLAN
                        I’m Allan.

                                 NICOLE
                        I’m Nicole. I’m meeting Layla here.

           Allan and Nicole have some heavy-duty eye contact going. 

                                 ALLAN
                        I haven’t seen her yet, but, uh... why 
                        don’t I show you around?

           Allan gestures to the living room. As she moves past him, 
           Nicole’s hand brushes Allan’s stomach. 

           This would be a good time for Wallace and Chantry to break 
           off and find someone else to talk to. But they stay put.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Wallace turns to the fridge-magnets, starts composing a poem: 
           “THIS TURKEY SANDWICH SAT IN MY HAT ALL WINTER”.

           When he’s done, Chantry reads it and LAUGHS. Wallace notices 
           she has a great laugh. She moves around magnets, composing 
           something new. Wallace discreetly checks her out. 

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           MONTAGE: PARTY-GUESTS drink, chat, flirt. Cigarettes get lit 
           and stubbed out. Beer bottles get cracked open, sipped, 
           guzzled. A COUPLE makes out in the corner. MUSIC PLAYS, but 
           the SONG keeps switching. The party gradually thins out.

           Through it all, Wallace and Chantry talk and make magnet-
           poems in the kitchen.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

           CHILL-OUT MUSIC HUMS in the other room. The living room is a 
           mess of empty bottles. No one else is visible. 

           But Wallace and Chantry haven’t noticed. They’re still 
           hanging out together. Wallace pieces together a new poem: 
           “LAUGHING LIKE A GIANT PAINT SPLASH ON THE WALL”. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        I guess the worst I ever had was mono. It 
                        was awful. 

           Wallace grabs his beer off the oven. Chantry checks out his 
           poem and GIGGLES. She starts composing a new poem.

                                 WALLACE
                        How’d you get it?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well, they call it the kissing disease...

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

                                 CHANTRY
                        But I wasn’t kissing anyone at the time.

                                 WALLACE
                        Maybe it was from a salt-lick.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, that’s probably it.

           CONTINUED:

           Chantry shows off her new poem: “THE RESTLESS LION FALLS FROM 
           HURRICANE HEIGHT TO BREAK HIS DAINTY TAIL”. Wallace CHUCKLES. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Once when I was a kid, I fell off a bunk-
                        bed. The top bunk.

                                 WALLACE
                        Really?

                                 CHANTRY
                        All I remember is this huge bang and 
                        being really uncomfortable and cold. And 
                        the next morning I woke up across the 
                        room with my face on the floor.

                                 WALLACE
                        You think you knocked yourself out?

                                 CHANTRY
                        I don’t know. But ever since then my 
                        skull has been slightly deformed.

                                 WALLACE
                        That’s what I first noticed about you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, I get that a lot.

           Wallace tips his head at an angle, as if studying Chantry’s 
           head. She mimics him, studying his face. She squints, 
           noticing something. Wallace readies himself for a kiss.

           Chantry pokes her finger between Wallace’s eyes, where he has 
           a small half-moon scar.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Where did you get that scar?

           A bit self-conscious, Wallace is about to reply when Allan 
           pads into the kitchen, wearing nothing but underwear. 

           Allan seems unaware Wallace and Chantry are there. He pours 
           himself a glass of water at the sink and turns around.

           When he sees Wallace and Chantry, Allan SHRIEKS in surprise. 
           He flinches instinctively, dousing himself in water. 

                                 ALLAN
                        What are you guys still doing here? 

           Wallace and Chantry look out at the empty living room.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CHANTRY
                        Is everybody else gone?

                                 ALLAN
                        Uh, yeah...

                                 NICOLE (O.S.)
                        You okay out there?

           Allan freezes, busted. He calls out to the other room.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah! I... stubbed my toe!

                                 NICOLE (O.S.)
                        Come back to bed and I’ll kiss it better!

           Allan shrugs to the amused Wallace and Chantry.

                                 NICOLE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hey, while you’re out there, maybe you 
                        should stub your wang too! 

           Allan gives Wallace and Chantry a quick, awkward nod and 
           hurries out to his bedroom, closing the door behind him. 

                                 WALLACE
                        You need to call a cab?

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m actually just a couple blocks west.

                                 WALLACE
                        Me too. Want to, uh... walk?

           Chantry plunks down a few word-magnets, finishing a final 
           poem. She swallows the last of her beer while Wallace reads 
           it: “SIP FROM MY GLASS OR DRINK FROM THE PITCHER.” 

           EXT. CHANTRY’S STREET - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry amble down a quiet, tree-lined street. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        You’re a very good conversationalist.

                                 WALLACE
                        You too.

           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        I just don’t have the patience for small 
                        talk anymore. People always ask the same 
                        questions over and over again.

                                 WALLACE
                        “What kind of work do you do?”

                                 CHANTRY
                        “Where’d you go to school?”

                                 WALLACE
                        “Whose head is that in your backpack?”

                                 CHANTRY
                        “Is that vomit in my hair?”

                                 WALLACE
                        “I’m no cannibal, but that guy looks 
                        delicious.”

                                 CHANTRY
                        That wasn’t really a question.

                                 WALLACE
                        No, I guess not.

           They approach an old heritage-style apartment building.

                                 CHANTRY
                        This is me here.

           Chantry and Wallace both look up at the building.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hey, so, I had fun talking with you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Me too.

                                 WALLACE
                        We should, you know, talk again sometime.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, we should hang out! Let me give you 
                        my number...

           As Chantry goes through her purse, Wallace pulls a pen out of 
           his pocket. They aren’t looking at each other, so she doesn’t 
           see he has a pen and he doesn’t see she’s searching for one.

                        Do you have a pen?

                                 WALLACE
                       Yup.

           She takes the pen and writes her number on his palm. 

           They stand there, regarding one another. Wallace prepares 
           himself for a good-night kiss.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I should get inside. I didn’t expect to 
                        be out so late. My boyfriend’s going to 
                        be wondering what happened to me. 

           Wallace does a magnificent job of suppressing his shock. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        So, um, give me a call sometime...

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           Chantry gives Wallace a hug, awkward but cute. He hugs her 
           back, still processing the revelation she has a boyfriend.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A cozy apartment, hardwood floors, warm colours. Chantry sits 
           on the couch, bites one of her nails. She handled that badly.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Chantry, you coming to bed?

           Chantry looks over at the closed bedroom door. She flicks off 
           the nearby lamp.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A long room at the top of a three-storey house divided into 
           apartments. Shelves packed with books, lots of CDs and DVDs.

           Wallace lies awake in his bed, staring at the ceiling, covers 
           pulled up to right under his chin.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Chantry, wearing the same clothes from Allan’s party, looking 
           directly at the camera.

                        It’s “fort” actually. But everyone always 
                        says “fort-ay”. Because “fort-ay” is 
                        Italian and means forcefully. And “fort” 
                        is French and means boyfriend. Of course 
                        I have a boyfriend. Look at me. How could 
                        someone so kissable not have someone to 
                        kiss? They call it the kissing disease. 
                        But I wasn’t kissing anyone at the time. 
                        I am now though. I’m kissing my 
                        boyfriend. He has a really big tongue.

           Chantry licks her lips with kind of off-putting lewdness.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - DAY

           Wallace is in the shower, thinking under the hot water. He 
           squirts shampoo into his hands, lathers up his hair.

           Suddenly it hits him. His hand. The phone number.

           He carefully wipes off the shampoo, trying not to further 
           erase the digits. But it’s too late. The number is half-gone. 
           There’s a 3. Or maybe it’s an 8. And either a 4 or a 7. 

           Wallace stares at his palm. He could try to salvage the 
           number, but what’s the point? He grabs the soap and lathers 
           up his hands, washing away the digits.

           INT. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fluorescent lights, rows of cubicles, filing cabinets, bored 
           CO-WORKERS. Wallace sits in his cubicle, lost in thought.

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Wallace?

           Wallace looks up. LISA (mid-30s), gym-toned, mischievous, 
           stands at the entrance to his cubicle, watching him daydream.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going on a coffee run. Want anything?

                                 WALLACE
                        No, I’m fine, thanks.

                                 LISA
                        You look like you need it.

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh... thanks. Thanks a lot, Lisa.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

                                 LISA
                        Did you throw up?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, just a minute ago.

                                 LISA
                        You look heavier. Have you put on weight?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yes, I have. Actually, I’m pregnant.

                                 LISA
                        Congratulations. So you want a coffee?

                                 WALLACE
                        How about a beer?

                                 LISA
                        You got it. Wallace, beer.

           Lisa has a pad with coffee-orders on it and she actually 
           writes “WALLACE = BEER” on it. She touches him on the 
           shoulder and walks off. 

           INT. ANIMATION STUDIO - DAY

           A cavernous loft space. Rows of high-end computers. A bright 
           sign on an exposed brick wall: SEA TO SKY ANIMATION.

           Chantry is one of several ANIMATORS, each at a computer 
           working on a different sequence from the same ANIMATED FILM. 
           She points-and-clicks small adjustments to her sequence and 
           clicks PREVIEW to watch it PLAY onscreen.

           In a futuristic KITCHEN, a ROBOT pours a box of NUTS N’ BOLTS 
           CEREAL, literally made of mechanical nuts and bolts, into a 
           bowl. The Robot grabs an OIL CAN and soaks the cereal in oil.

           The Robot suddenly turns to the camera, staring at Chantry as 
           she scribbles notes on a pad, waiting for her to finish.

                                 ROBOT
                        I can’t believe you hung out with that 
                        guy all night and never mentioned you’ve 
                        got a boyfriend.

           CONTINUED:

           Chantry looks up, startled. She looks around, making sure no 
           one else heard this. She leans in closer to the screen.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I wasn’t trying to lead him on. It just 
                        never came up.

                                 ROBOT
                        You can’t bullshit a robot, Chantry. You 
                        could’ve made sure it came up.

           The Robot SLAMS closed the fridge door...

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - ANIMATED

           As the fridge door closes, it reveals a mass of word-magnets. 
           It’s now an animated version of Allan’s kitchen. ANIMATED 
           WALLACE and ANIMATED CHANTRY both compose magnet-poems. 

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        I’ve never seen so many of these things. 

                                 ANIMATED WALLACE
                        I guess there’s a bunch of sets all
                        lumped together. 

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        My boyfriend loves magnet-poems. He once 
                        bought a set and scraped off the letters 
                        so he could make up his own words. 

                                 ANIMATED WALLACE
                        Cool. Well... nice talking to you.

           Animated Wallace smiles, polite, and walks off. He heads 
           right for an ANIMATED GIRL in a trashy outfit.

                                 ANIMATED WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, are you single?

                                 ANIMATED GIRL
                        Yup.

           Chantry looks at the poems she and Wallace just composed.
           Wallace’s reads: “I AM A VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST”. 
           Chantry’s reads: “I HAVE A BOYFRIEND”.

           She looks back to see Animated Wallace furiously kissing 
           Animated Girl, globs of spittle flying everywhere. 

           Robot rolls up next to Animated Chantry in the kitchen.

                        So you’re just into him as a friend, huh?

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        I get it. I messed up. But now he knows. 
                        So if he calls, he’s cool with just being 
                        friends and it’s okay to hang out with 
                        him. Right?

           Robot arches an eyebrow, skeptical. The animation drains of 
           colour and turns into a scratchy pencil-lined sketch...

           INT. ANIMATION STUDIO/LOUNGE AREA - DAY

           Chantry sits with a mug of tea, doodling the skeptical Robot 
           on her sketch-pad. She gazes out the window at the rain-
           soaked street. Why is she obsessing about this?

           GRETCHEN (mid-20s), a pierced up goth, and TABBY (mid 20s),
           geek-chic with stern glasses, scoot chairs up to Chantry’s 
           table, secretive, jarring her from her thoughts.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I just wanted to say it’s bullshit Josh 
                        got the project manager job over you.

                                 TABBY
                        Totally. Everybody likes you better and 
                        you’re basically, like, one billion times 
                        more organized than him. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Josh got the job?

           Gretchen and Tabby exchange an awkward look. Chantry hadn’t 
           heard yet. Oops.

           At the other end of the loft, Chantry spots JOSH (mid-30s),
           cocky-slick, standing in a glass-enclosed meeting room with 
           HOLLY (mid-40s), dressed like a rich teenager. They’re going 
           over storyboards of the robot cartoon.

                                 TABBY
                        It’s like sexism or something.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Our boss is a woman.

                                 TABBY
                        Reverse-sexism.

                                 TABBY
                        In your defense, you had to keep up your 
                        annual tradition of giving one of our 
                        male co-workers a handjob for Christmas.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Shut up.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Holly obviously made the call she thinks 
                        is best for the company. Besides, I don’t 
                        need the extra hassle and meetings and 
                        paperwork. There’s always problems with 
                        the Taiwan stuff and Josh’ll get stuck 
                        flying over there all the time...

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Yeah, all that extra power and money and 
                        travel will really suck for him.

                        Yeah, shut up. She doesn’t want the 
                        hassle and, like, paperwork, okay? She’s 
                        got a great job, and a great apartment, 
                        and a great boyfriend, and great friends 
                        like me and sort of you. She doesn’t need 
                        the stupid promotion. She’s happy exactly 
                        the way things are. Right?

           Tabby and Gretchen look at Chantry, waiting for confirmation.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Right.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Wallace is next in line for tickets outside a run-down rep 
           theatre. The marquee reads: “CHARLIE CHAPLIN DOUBLE-BILL - 
           THE GOLD RUSH 7:00 - CITY LIGHTS 9:00”.

           Chantry comes up behind him, digging in her purse for her 
           wallet. When she looks up, she notices Wallace. She 
           hesitates, but decides to give him a nudge. He turns, 
           surprised but clearly pleased to see her.

                                 WALLACE
                        I washed my hand.

                        Okay.

                        That’s why I never called you. I 
                        accidentally washed off your number.

           Not the greatest excuse ever and they both know it. Chantry 
           gestures to the CASHIER. It’s Wallace’s turn.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You’re up.

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE/LOBBY - NIGHT

           Chantry enters. Wallace is buying popcorn. She could slip 
           into the theatre, but decides to wait until he turns around.

                                 CHANTRY

                        Yeah, Paul bailed on me at the last 
                        minute. He had to work late.

                        I think it’s important animators watch 
                        silent films. Animation gets translated 
                        around the world, so the storytelling’s 
                        got to be really visual.

                        head... that’s magical in every country.

           The lights dim, the curtains open, the movie starts. Wallace 
           and Chantry dig in for popcorn at the same time. Their hands 
           touch and they quickly retract them. 

           They exchange a look. That was a little too cutesy and they 
           both know it. Wallace tips the popcorn so Chantry can grab a 
           handful, then he does the same. They turn their attention to 
           the illuminated screen. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry walk together, the movie theatre receding 
           behind them. The street-lights glow in a light fog.

                                 CHANTRY
                        That was amazing. I can’t believe I’d 
                        never seen “City Lights” before.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah. Saddest ending to a movie ever.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You thought it was sad?

                                 WALLACE
                        Well... yeah. I mean, the blind girl gets 
                        her sight back at the end. And she sees 
                        it’s him and he’s not rich, he’s just 
                        this little tramp...

                                 CHANTRY
                        And they end up together.

                                 WALLACE
                        No, they’re both happy and they recognize 
                        each other, but they both know it’s not 
                        going to be.

                                 CHANTRY
                        No no no, she sees it’s him and it wasn’t 
                        a millionaire at all. It was this funny 
                        little man who couldn’t afford her 
                        operation. And he ended up sending 
                        himself to the poorhouse for her. And she 
                        owes him everything and she loves him.

                                 WALLACE
                        Really? I saw pity in her eyes and 
                        sadness in his.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I didn’t see it that way at all.

           They walk down the street, quiet, thinking.

           EXT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Chantry and Wallace stand outside Chantry’s apartment. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        So... running into you wasn’t, you know, 
                        totally horrible. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, I could stomach your presence. I 
                        mean, I felt nauseous. But it was like a 
                        mild flu, not salmonella poisoning.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well, I look forward to randomly 
                        encountering you again in the future.

                                 WALLACE
                        Me too. Or, uh, we could... non-randomly 
                        encounter each other. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Like at a pre-arranged venue at a pre-
                        arranged time?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           Chantry digs her sketch-pad out of her bag, scrawls out her 
           number on a blank page, rips it out, hands it to Wallace.

           Awkward pause. Do they hug, shake hands, what?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hey, um, you never told me how you got 
                        your scar.

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh, uh... I used to ski-race. So a friend 
                        and I were carrying these racing gates 
                        and my friend ducked under this rope 
                        fence and one of his ski-poles got caught 
                        on the rope and it pulled like a bow and 
                        arrow and flew through the air and hit me 
                        right between the eyes. Bled all over the 
                        snow, had to get a bunch of stitches.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You could’ve lost an eye!

                                 WALLACE
                        I know!

           Chantry gives Wallace a look. He’s not sure what it means. 

           She heads up the walk to her building. Wallace checks out the 
           page with her number. On the other side is the drawing of the 
           skeptical Robot, staring at him, eyebrow arched.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

           Allan sits at the table, Nicole on his lap, making out.

                                 NICOLE
                        I love you so much I want to rip off your 
                        arms and legs and carry you around in my 
                        purse everywhere I go.

                                 ALLAN
                        I love you so much I want to grind up 
                        your organs and muscles and bones and 
                        spread you on toast.

                                 NICOLE
                        I love you so much I want to cut you open 
                        and scoop out your insides and wear your 
                        skin around town like an Allan-suit.

           They kiss, deep and sloppy. Finally, Nicole breaks the kiss 
           and hops off Allan’s lap.

                                 NICOLE (CONT’D)
                        Bye Wallace.

           Wallace has been sitting there the whole time, obviously 
           super-uncomfortable. He gives Nicole a polite wave as she 
           leaves the kitchen.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                 WALLACE
                        So, things are going well with Nicole.

           Allan takes a steaming pan of nachos out of the oven, 
           drenched in cheese and salsa, brings them to the table. 

                                 ALLAN
                        Dude, I just had sex and I’m about to eat 
                        nachos. This could be the greatest moment 
                        of my life, unless you screw it up with 
                        whatever you’re about to say.

           Allan picks up a chip dripping with melted cheese, ready to 
           suck it back. It’s the perfect nacho chip.

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s about your cousin Chantry.

                                 ALLAN
                        Fuck.

           Allan tosses the chip back on the pan, disgusted.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

           Allan fingers his congealing nachos, listening to Wallace.

                                 WALLACE
                        So when I accidentally washed my hand I 
                        was, like, okay, this is a sign not to 
                        call her. But then we ran into each other 
                        at the movie and I was, like, okay, maybe 
                        that’s a sign I should... what?

           Allan stares at Wallace.

                                 ALLAN
                        You look like a grown man, but you’re 
                        actually a twelve year-old girl.

                                 WALLACE
                        Eat my balls, Allan.

                                 ALLAN
                        You totally fucked my sex-nacho high!

                                 WALLACE
                        I knew I shouldn’t have said anything.

                                 ALLAN
                        She’s my cousin, dude, it’s like incest.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah, but you’re like my brother, so it’s 
                        like my brother asking my advice on how 
                        to incestuously bang my cousin.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not trying to... she has a boyfriend.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah. He’s been coming over for 
                        Thanksgiving, Christmas, and my mom’s 
                        birthday for the past five years. 

                                 WALLACE
                        That’s my point. Since I know she’s in a 
                        serious long-term relationship, it’s okay 
                        to be friends. Right?

           Allan pushes away the nachos, appetite gone.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A baked potato sits on a plate. Chantry holds a bottle of 
           maple syrup. She pours syrup all over the potato, drenching 
           it in sticky brown goo. 

           Chantry eats a forkful of the syrup-soaked potato. She chews, 
           considering. It’s disgusting. She swallows with difficulty. 

           She stares down at the syrup-covered mess. The phone RINGS.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - AT THAT MOMENT

           Wallace paces back and forth, holding his phone. It’s RINGING 
           on the other line. It picks up.

                        Yes. You have the clap. And your nipples

           The syrup-soaked potato sits in front of her. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        So, I just did something disgusting.

                        Did it involve doing things to donkeys

                                 CHANTRY
                        No. Okay, you know how when you’re having 
                        pancakes with hashbrowns and bacon, and 
                        some of the maple syrup gets on the 
                        potatoes and it tastes pretty good?

                        Exactly. Well, I had this weird craving 
                        for that. Potatoes and syrup. So I made 
                        this big baked potato. And it looked 
                        pretty good, so I just poured maple syrup 
                        all over it.

                        It’s disgusting. I’m throwing it out.

           Chantry dumps the syrup-potato in the garbage can.

           Wallace and Chantry sit in a horseshoe-shaped booth, each 
           sipping a beer. Chantry eyes the menu-card sticking out of 
           the condiment holder. It reads: ‘APPIE HOUR!!!

                        My sister and I used to play this game at 
                        restaurants where you order the most 
                        disgusting thing on the menu for the 
                        other person. And if they can’t finish 
                        it, they’ve got to pay for both meals.

                                 WALLACE
                        That sounds... horrible.

           INT. PUB - MOMENTS LATER

           A WAITRESS (mid-30s) listens as Chantry WHISPERS in her ear. 
           The Waitress writes down whatever Chantry said.

           The Waitress goes to Wallace, who WHISPERS his order to her, 
           concealing his elaborate gestures from Chantry. The Waitress 
           looks more annoyed than amused, but has clearly experienced 
           weirder. She writes down the order.

                        I think you can learn as much about

           INT. PUB - LATER

           The Waitress sets down Wallace’s dish and heads back to the 
           kitchen. Wallace stares at a basket of greenish wedges 
           slathered in greasy batter.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s deep-fried pickles!

                                 WALLACE
                        This is your idea of the most disgusting 
                        thing on the menu?

                                 CHANTRY
                        I hate pickles. I was at this party once 
                        and I dipped bread into what I thought 
                        was olive oil. But when I bit into it, it
                        was like “that’s not olive oil”...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WALLACE
                        It was urine!

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, that’s right, someone put a bowl of 
                        urine on the table.

                                 WALLACE
                        No, I’m sorry.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It was pickle juice. Someone had eaten 
                        all the pickles and there was just the 
                        disgusting vinegary juice left. In the 
                        light it looked like olive oil.

           The Waitress returns with a steaming dish and sets it down in 
           front of Chantry. 

           It’s a pile of hashbrowns with several pieces of crispy bacon 
           on top, slathered in maple syrup.

           Chantry stares at it, wide-eyed. Wallace grins.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you did this.

                                 WALLACE
                        I figured it would either be the most 
                        disgusting or the most delicious thing I 
                        could get you. Fifty-fifty.

           Tentative, Chantry picks up her fork, eyeballs the dish.

           She assembles a careful forkful, pops it in her mouth, chews, 
           apprehensive. Delight spills across her face.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s delicious.

                                 WALLACE
                        Damn.

           Chantry digs into the syrupy mess. Wallace munches one of his 
           flimsy fried pickles.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        These are actually pretty good.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I don’t like deep-fried food. Too greasy.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WALLACE
                        You don’t like french fries? Fish and 
                        chips? Onion rings?

           Chantry shakes her head, nope.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Deep-fried banana sandwiches?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Didn’t Elvis have those?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah. And something called Fool’s Gold. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        What’s that? 

                                 WALLACE
                        I think it’s a loaf of bread with the 
                        crust all hollowed out and filled with 
                        bacon grease.

                                 CHANTRY
                        And Elvis would eat that?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah. Did you know he died with something 
                        like forty pounds of undigested feces in 
                        his intestines?

                                 CHANTRY
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 WALLACE
                        More or less disgusting than a plate of 
                        deep-fried pickles?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Ummm... strangely, less.

                                 WALLACE
                        So I could be eating a plate of 
                        undigested Elvis feces and you’d be less 
                        grossed out than by these pickles.

           Chantry shrugs, yup. Wallace bites into another pickle.
           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wallace sits at his desk, staring at his computer screen, 
           composing an email to: “yam_eater@hotmail.com”. Wallace 
           starts typing. He reads what he types.

                                 WALLACE
                        Dear Chantry. 

           He deletes what he just typed.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        My Darling Dearest Chantry.

           He deletes it.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Howdy. Ahoy. 

           Wallace slumps in his chair. Delete, delete, delete.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for dinner. Thanks for supper. 
                        Thanks for the other night. It was fun. 
                        Delicious. Sublime. It was magical. You 
                        are an angel. It was stupid. I’m stupid. 
                        But you’re not stupid. You’re the queen 
                        of the night.

           He stares at what he’s just typed. He deletes it all.

           Wallace closes his eyes. He CRACKS his neck left, then right. 
           He opens his eyes and starts typing again.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        What’s shakin’, hotpants?

           INT. CHANTRY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Chantry is at her desk, reading Wallace’s email. It starts: 
           “What’s shakin’, hotpants?”

                                 WALLACE (V.O.) 
                        I found this webpage where they talk 
                        about Fool’s Gold and it turns out it’s 
                        worse than I thought. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Wallace and Chantry walk down the street. They pass by two 
           cars that have just been involved in a rear-ender.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WALLACE
                        You start with a loaf of Italian white 
                        bread that’s completely covered in butter 
                        and baked for fifteen minutes. Then you 
                        cut it in half, hollow it out, and coat 
                        the inside with an entire jar of peanut 
                        butter and an entire jar of jam. Then you 
                        stuff it with a pound of crispy bacon. 
                        The website said it serves eight to ten 
                        people or one Elvis.

           Just down from where the cars have crashed, Wallace and 
           Chantry pass a bus stop full of PRIVATE SCHOOL GIRLS in very 
           short kilts. It’s clear they are the cause of the rear-ender.

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY

           Chantry and Wallace, wearing work clothes, eat their lunch 
           special bento boxes in the crowded restaurant.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You know, a jar of peanut butter has, 
                        like, six thousand calories. And bacon 
                        isn’t even considered food. It’s just 
                        pure fat. And the absolute worst kind of 
                        fat for you.

           Chantry absentmindedly takes a piece of sashimi out of 
           Wallace’s box with her chopsticks and eats it. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, but in spite of all that, I can see 
                        the appeal. Because when you have a big 
                        egg breakfast, and you put bacon on the 
                        toast with your peanut butter and jelly, 
                        it tastes really good. Like syrup on 
                        potatoes, I guess.

           INT. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wallace is in his cubicle, a bit hunched over since he’s on a 
           personal phone call.

                                 CHANTRY (PHONE)
                        Right. But that didn’t work out at all.

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t think I’m brave enough to try it 
                        anyway, but I’m still curious.
           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wallace’s computer screen shows the end of the email he just 
           wrote: “but I’m still curious”. He types: “Wallace”. 

           He presses SEND. 

           INT. CHANTRY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Chantry is at her desk, reading the email she types.

                        To: Championbeefcake@gmail.com. Re: Just 
                        pure fat. We were talking about how Elvis 
                        died with forty pounds of undigested 
                        feces in his colon, so I looked it up. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

           Wallace and Chantry walk down the street. Wallace has a stain 
           on his shirt, like he spilt sauce from his lunch on it. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        I couldn’t find how much he had in there. 
                        But it did say John Wayne’s colon weighed 
                        eighty-three pounds at his death, and 
                        seventy-seven pounds of it was “dried 
                        fecal matter”. That’s about how much I 
                        weighed when I fell off that bunk-bed.

           INT. CHANTRY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Chantry finishes typing the end of the email. She types: 
           “Chantry”. She’s about to press SEND, but stops. 

           She moves the cursor above “Chantry” and types: “What are you 
           up to tomorrow night? Want to see a movie?”

           EXT. CHANTRY’S STREET - NIGHT

           Wallace walks up the tree-lined street towards Chantry’s 
           apartment building. He looks up at it, takes a deep breath.

           INT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING/HALLWAY - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Wallace KNOCKS on the apartment door. Chantry opens it.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hi Wallace. Oh, hey, this is Paul...

           CONTINUED:

           She swings the door open, revealing a HUGE GUY standing there 
           in his underwear, body chiseled, muscles taut and oiled up, 
           head completely bald. He grins at Wallace as he flexes.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                        Hi Wallace. Oh, hey, this is Paul...

           She reveals a BROODING GUY, greasy hair, cleaning a revolver. 
           He checks the sights, aiming the gun right at Wallace.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Chantry reveals a JAUNTY GUY with a pencil-thin mustache in a 
           blazer and Captain’s hat, holding a martini glass.

                        This is Paul...

           He gulps back the martini and SMASHES the glass on the floor.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Chantry opens the door, revealing ANOTHER WALLACE inside.

                        This is Paul...

           The other Wallace wears more stylish clothes, his hair more 
           cleanly cut. He smiles at the first Wallace, teeth gleaming.

           EXT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING - DAY

           Wallace walks up to the front entrance. A guy leans against 
           the door frame, casual yet awkwardly positioned. Wallace nods 
           to him as he goes to press Chantry’s buzzer.

           Wallace is about to discover that this is PAUL (mid-20s), 
           handsome, put together, but a bit hapless.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you Wallace?

                        I’m Paul.

           CONTINUED:

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh, hi.

                                 PAUL
                        I got my jacket stuck in the door. I 
                        can’t reach the buzzer and my key’s in 
                        the pocket.

           Paul shows Wallace his jacket. The pocket is caught on the 
           other side of the closed glass door.

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh man. Here, maybe I can...

           Wallace tries to ease the jacket out with a careful tug, 
           causing the seam to RIP. 

           He quickly lets go, having clearly made the problem worse. 
           Paul gives him a tense smile.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, I tried that.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’ll buzz Chantry. 

           Wallace presses the BUZZER. They wait, awkward. 

                                 CHANTRY (BUZZER)
                        Hello?

                        Hey Chantry, it’s Wallace.

                                 PAUL
                        And I’m still here too.

                                 CHANTRY (BUZZER)
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        My jacket got stuck in the door and I 
                        can’t get to my keys. Could you bring 
                        down my other jacket?

                                 CHANTRY (BUZZER)
                        Oh my god...

           The buzzer CLICKS off.

                                 PAUL
                        Can you open the door first? Hello?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WALLACE
                        That’s a nasty rip.

           Paul turns to see, and it RIPS a bit more.

                                 PAUL
                        Crap.

                                 WALLACE
                        Sorry.

           Paul and Wallace stand there, waiting, conversation-less.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, do you know the difference between 
                        an aneurysm and a hemorrhage?

                                 WALLACE
                        Um... an aneurysm is, like, when a blood 
                        vessel in your brain bursts open. A 
                        hemorrhage is just any kind of internal 
                        bleeding. But when you have an aneurysm, 
                        I think you bleed into your brain and 
                        that’s a hemorrhage.

                                 PAUL
                        So you could say, standing here for 
                        twenty minutes with my jacket caught in 
                        the door is so frustrating, I’m about to 
                        have an aneurysm. But not, I’m about to 
                        have a hemorrhage.

                                 WALLACE
                        Right.

                                 PAUL
                        But you could say, I’m so frustrated I 
                        want to smash my head through this glass 
                        door and give myself a hemorrhage.

                                 WALLACE
                        Exactly.

           Wallace and Paul see Chantry approach through the glass door. 
           She has a good LAUGH before opening the door, freeing Paul. 
           Paul examines the rip. Chantry hands him the new jacket. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        So, I guess you guys have met?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yep.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 PAUL
                        There’s no way I can handle going back to 
                        work now. You guys want to blow off the 
                        movie, go get a drink instead?

           Chantry brightens, pleased. She turns to Wallace, making sure 
           that’s okay. There’s kind of only one appropriate answer...

                                 WALLACE
                        Absolutely.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Wallace, Paul, and Chantry stroll down the sidewalk. Paul’s 
           arm is around Chantry, walking between her and Wallace.

           The sidewalk isn’t quite wide enough for three people, so 
           every time they pass a streetlight or mailbox, Wallace has to 
           lag back a few steps then catch up. Chantry and Paul are too 
           caught up in their conversation to notice this.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Wallace, Chantry, and Paul sit in the same horseshoe-shaped 
           booth, sipping beers, no one quite sure what to say.

                                 PAUL
                        So, uh... Chantry told me you ski-race?

                                 WALLACE
                        I used to. I mean, I still ski, I just 
                        don’t race anymore.

                                 PAUL
                        Lost your competitive spirit?

           Chantry gives Paul a look. He shrugs, just joking.

                                 WALLACE
                        Actually, yeah. All the stuff I loved 
                        about skiing as a kid was exactly the 
                        stuff I didn’t get to do when I was 
                        racing. It didn’t seem worth it to spend 
                        all this time not having fun doing the 
                        thing I used to have fun doing.

           Paul nods, thoughtful.

                                 PAUL
                        So, are you trying to sleep with my 
                        girlfriend?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Startled, Wallace looks over at Chantry. She’s listening 
           pleasantly, seemingly unaware of what Paul just said.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry, we’re speaking “guy”. She 
                        thinks we’re talking about Whistler.

                                 WALLACE
                        Okay.

                                 PAUL
                        Look, I’ve got no problem with Chantry 
                        having guy-friends. But if you’re trying 
                        to split us up so you can move in...

           Chantry looks from Paul to Wallace, following their 
           conversation but obviously not understanding it.

                                 WALLACE
                        I wouldn’t do that. I just want to be 
                        friends. With her. With you. Friends.

                                 PAUL
                        I can do friends. But you’d better not 
                        try to put your penis in her vagina. And 
                        I agree Whistler’s pretty touristy these 
                        days, but it’s still the best skiing in 
                        North America.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah. For sure. The best.

           Chantry looks happy that Paul and Wallace seem to be getting 
           along so well. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        You guys want to order?

           INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

           Wallace and Allan wind through cluttered aisles piled with 
           odd knickknacks, old furniture, and ornate lamps. 

                                 ALLAN
                        If it starts dirty, it ends dirty. A 
                        relationship that starts with a break up 
                        is doomed to end with a break up. You 
                        remember who told me that?

                                 WALLACE
                        Me.

                        You. After Vicky Cardero gave me a blow-
                        job at her boyfriend’s birthday keg-party 
                        and I wanted to ask her out on a date.

                                 WALLACE
                        I seem to recall you ignored that advice.

                                 ALLAN
                        And what was the result?

                                 WALLACE
                        It ended dirty. So very dirty. Gonorrhea 
                        and a fist-fight dirty.

                                 ALLAN
                        Exactly.

                                 WALLACE
                        This is not gonorrhea and a fist-fight. 
                        I’m not trying to break them up. I’m 
                        happy being friends with her. Friends is 
                        good. Friends is great.

                                 ALLAN
                        Friends is horse-shit. Friends is the 
                        inside of a communist’s anus.

                                 WALLACE
                        Friends is not the inside of a 
                        communist’s anus.

           Allan picks up a cute bedside lamp.

                                 ALLAN
                        Okay, be honest... 

                                 WALLACE
                        I am being honest.

                                 ALLAN
                        No, I mean about this lamp. Is this a 
                        good housewarming gift for Nicole?

                                 WALLACE
                        Do you buy someone a housewarming gift 
                        when they’re moving into your house?

                                 ALLAN
                        I don’t know. Girls are weird about this 
                        stuff and I’d rather overcompensate.

           Allan inspects the lamp, turning it on and off.

                                 WALLACE
                        I like it. Very welcoming. Her own 
                        bedside lamp for reading in bed...

                                 ALLAN
                        And having sex with the lights on. The 
                        overhead one’s a bit harsh. This’s got a 
                        nice romantic glow...

           Allan lifts up his shirt and checks to see what his stomach 
           looks like in the lamp’s warm glow. 

                                 ALLAN (CONT’D)
                        Perfect.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Chantry opens the front door, revealing Wallace holding a 
           bottle of wine. She steps back so he can come in. 

                                 WALLACE
                        This place is exactly like I pictured it.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Really?

                                 WALLACE
                        Actually, I pictured a lot more potpourri 
                        and stuffed animals.

                                 CHANTRY
                        And unicorns and doilies.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, I hid them in the closet.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Chantry escorts Wallace in through the swinging kitchen door. 

           The fixings for a Mexican dinner are spread out around the 
           kitchen. Peppers and onions frying on the stove, salsa and 
           sour cream in bowls. Paul chops jalapenos. 

           Grating cheese next to him is Chantry’s sister DALIA (early 
           20s), as attractive as Chantry, but more aloof and sardonic.

                        Hey.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Wallace, this is my sister Dalia. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Hi. Hey Paul.

           Wallace offers his hand. Dalia goes to shake it, but notices 
           her hands are covered in grated cheese. Wallace pokes out his 
           elbow instead. Dalia smiles and rubs her elbow against his.

                                 PAUL
                        Can someone open the window? It’s getting 
                        all onion-y in here.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’ll do it.

           Wallace goes over to the large window by the swinging door. 
           He unlatches it and pulls it wide open.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        So, are you named after the Black Dahlia 
                        murders?

                                 DALIA
                        That’s Dahlia with an H. I’m D-A-L-I-A.

                                 WALLACE
                        Chantry and Dalia. Your parents kind of 
                        rule.

                                 DALIA
                        Not really.

           Finishing chopping jalapenos, Paul rubs his eye. His face 
           suddenly contorts into a pained wince. 

                                 PAUL
                        Ow! Jesus!

                                 CHANTRY
                        What? What’s wrong?

           Paul gestures wildly at his face. 

                                 PAUL
                        My eye!

                                 CHANTRY
                        Oh shit, did you touch your eyes?

                                 PAUL
                        I... yeah...

                                 CHANTRY
                        You’ve got jalapeno on your fingers!

                                 PAUL
                        Ah! Fuck!

                                 CHANTRY
                        Wallace, grab me a washcloth from the 
                        bathroom...

           Wallace hurries out through the swinging door, heading for 
           the bathroom.

           Chantry gently takes Paul by the arm and guides him to the 
           sink. She starts splashing water in his eyes.

                                 DALIA
                        Can I help?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, it’s okay...

                                 PAUL
                        It’s not okay! It hurts!

           Paul shrugs Chantry away, maybe a bit too forcefully, 
           frustrated, in pain, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Just let me go to the bathroom...

           Paul stumbles over to the kitchen door, eyes squeezed shut.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Paul, wait...

           At just that moment, Wallace rushes back in with a wet 
           washcloth, shoving the swinging door open.

           The swinging door SMACKS Paul right in the face. He YELPS, 
           grabbing his nose.

           The impact sends Paul staggering backwards, off balance, 
           right towards the wide open kitchen window.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Paul!

           But it’s too late. Paul flails back, hitting the open window 
           at the knees. He falls backwards right out the window.

           Chantry, Wallace, and Dalia rush over to the window and look 
           down. They all WINCE in unison.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Paul lies in a hospital bed, a mass of gauze bandaged to his 
           eye, his nose bruised and clotted, a cast around his broken 
           arm, and a protective brace around his sprained neck.

           Paul’s one good eye blinks open, darting around, squinting in 
           the bright hospital light. He’s sedated with painkillers.

           Wallace stands next to the bed, looking extremely sorry. 

                                 PAUL
                        Where am I?

                                 WALLACE
                        In the hospital. Chantry and Dalia are 
                        with the doctor. Paul, I’m... so sorry.

                                 PAUL
                        My brain is, like, floating in... yellow.

                                 WALLACE
                        You’re on pretty heavy-duty painkillers.

           Paul looks totally out of it. His good eye waters with tears.

                                 PAUL
                        Please, doctor, if I don’t make it, tell 
                        my girlfriend I love her.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not your doctor, Paul. But you’re 
                        going to make it, okay?

           Paul nods as best he can, half-asleep. Wallace goes to leave.

                                 PAUL
                        Wait. Please, promise me... the porn. 

                                 WALLACE
                        The... porn?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PAUL
                        On my computer. If I die, I don’t want 
                        her to find it. Call my brother. It’s all 
                        saved under “corporate accounts”... 

           Paul is falling asleep, the painkillers taking their toll.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        The girls showing their private parts, 
                        they’re not really teenagers, you know...

           Paul passes out. Wallace stands there, not sure what to do. 

           Chantry and Dalia quietly enter behind him.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Has he woken up yet?

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh... no.

                                 CHANTRY
                        The doctor said he’ll need the cast for a 
                        month, but the neck-brace is just 
                        precautionary. He can go home tomorrow.

           Chantry goes up to Paul’s bedside, watching him sleep, 
           worried. Wallace watches them, feeling terrible. Dalia 
           watches Wallace, checking him out just a little bit.

           INT. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wallace’s CO-WORKERS, including Lisa, crowd around the 
           entrance to his cubicle. Everybody has a cupcake. Wallace’s 
           cupcake has a candle on it.

                                 CO-WORKERS (SINGING)
                        Happy birthday, dear Wallace, happy 
                        birthday to you!

           Wallace blows out the candle. His Co-Workers CLAP. Lisa gives 
           them the nod and they shuffle away to eat their cupcakes.

           Lisa stays behind, leaning on Wallace’s desk. She hands him a 
           birthday card filled with friendly notes from his Co-Workers.

                                 LISA
                        Everyone signed it.

                                 WALLACE
                        And you organized all this?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LISA
                        Yup.

                                 WALLACE
                        You know it’s not my birthday, right?

                                 LISA
                        Hey, free cupcakes.

           Lisa takes a bite of her cupcake. Wallace takes a bite of 
           his. It tastes pretty good.

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Some of us are going for a beer after 
                        work. Want to come?

                                 WALLACE
                        I totally would, but I’ve got plans.

                                 LISA
                        Hot date?

                                 WALLACE
                        Just meeting some friends. But next time, 
                        totally.

                                 LISA
                        Okay.

                                 WALLACE
                        Thanks for the great, uh, party.

                                 LISA
                        Anytime.

           Lisa gives Wallace’s shoulder a squeeze as she walks off. 

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Wallace, Allan, and Nicole sit at a table, drinking beers.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not saying you can’t eat it. I’m 
                        saying you’d get disgustingly sick.

                                 ALLAN
                        Okay, yeah, maybe...

                                 WALLACE
                        Not maybe. Definitely. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ALLAN
                        But it wouldn’t kill you. You can eat 
                        your own poo. But if you then eat the poo 
                        that you poo out after eating the first 
                        poo, it’s so toxic you’ll die. So you can 
                        eat your own poo once, but not twice.

           Wallace stares at Allan for a moment. Then he bursts out 
           LAUGHING. Allan CHUCKLES. Nicole just sips her beer.

                                 NICOLE
                        So how’s the love-life, Wallace? Any 
                        intrigue with the ladies these days?

           Wallace stares down at his beer, avoiding eye contact.

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh, I’m guess I’m in a bit of a, you 
                        know, situation with a girl right now...

                                 ALLAN
                        Chantry!

           Wallace looks stunned, until he realizes Allan is waving to 
           Chantry, who is approaching their table. She sits down.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Sorry I’m late. Paul got his cast off 
                        today and it took longer than expected.

                                 NICOLE
                        We’re talking about girls. Wallace’s 
                        telling us about some situation with a 
                        girl. A predicament of sorts.

           Chantry looks at Wallace, curious. He sinks in his chair.

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s not really anything. Just this, uh, 
                        girl at work.

                                 NICOLE
                        What about her?

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s nothing. I just think she kind of 
                        likes me, that’s all. It’s no big thing.

                                 NICOLE
                        What’s her name?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Wallace really doesn’t want to get into this in front of 
           Chantry. He gives Allan a look, but Allan just shrugs.

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh, Lisa. But I’m not, like, into her 
                        that way. 

                                 NICOLE
                        Then all you can do is avoid her.

                                 WALLACE
                        I can’t. She’s sort of my supervisor.

                                 NICOLE
                        Then quit your job.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah, quit your job and move to Europe.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Very funny.

           Now it’s Wallace’s turn to give Chantry a curious look.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Paul’s been offered a job in Paris.

                                 WALLACE
                        Like Paris-Paris? France-Paris?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Sort of a liaison for a communications 
                        company. Yeah, France-Paris.

                                 WALLACE
                        For how long?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Eight months. More if it goes well. He’s 
                        never been to Europe and he’s always 
                        wanted to go. And the job would have him 
                        travelling around a lot.

                                 WALLACE
                        So I guess it’d be pretty hard to refuse.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yup.

           Chantry takes a big gulp of Wallace’s beer. She pushes the 
           beer back towards him. He pushes it back to her, giving a 
           sympathetic nod.

           Allan and Nicole exchange a look, like Nicole’s making a 
           point in an earlier discussion.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chantry’s asleep. The phone by the bed RINGS. Vaguely awake, 
           Chantry wanders a hand out to grab the receiver. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hello?

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        Oh shit, what time is it there?

           Chantry squints at the alarm clock. It’s 3:10AM.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Three AM. What’s it there?

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        Noon. Or as they say here, la noon.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 PAUL (PHONE) 
                        They don’t really say “la noon”. I don’t 
                        know what noon is in French. But I know 
                        how to say I miss you. Je miss you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Je miss you too.

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        You mean je miss you deux. Deux is French 
                        for two. Anyway, I guess I got the time 
                        difference mixed up. I’m on lunch break.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Your very first lunch break in France.

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        I thought maybe they’d have it at another 
                        time. But no, la noon. Anyway, I just 
                        wanted to say, you know, je love you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Je love you deux.

           Chantry hangs up, settling back into sleep...
           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - ANIMATED

           As ANIMATED CHANTRY sleeps, the phone twitches to life. The 
           receiver crawls off the cradle and onto the bed, creeping 
           over Chantry, trailing the curly cord behind it. The cord 
           winds itself around her, binding her tight. 

           Animated Chantry blinks awake to find herself tied up in 
           curly cord. Her bed is now a web made of the same cord. The 
           receiver sprouts eight spider-legs and scuttles across the 
           cord-web, jaws snapping in hunger...

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY

           Chantry doodles a pencil drawing of the phone-spider image on 
           her sketch-pad. She looks pretty glum.

           Wallace squeezes through the lunch-rush CROWD and sits across 
           from her. Chantry quickly puts away the sketch-pad.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hi.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hi.

           Wallace hasn’t really seen Chantry looking down. He averts 
           his eyes, a bit uncomfortable, looks at the menu.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hey, so I looked up “City Lights” on-line 
                        the other day and I found out the ending 
                        is famous for its ambiguity. So we were 
                        both right. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        I guess one of us is a hopeless romantic. 
                        And the other is a filthy tramp.

           Chantry smiles. That’s a bit better. She leans in, 
           conspiratorial. Wallace leans in too.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen all the Chaplin movies?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry walk together down the street. It’s 
           raining lightly, the neon signs reflecting off wet pavement.

                                 WALLACE
                        Can you play any musical instruments?
           INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry play darts. Chantry leans against a pool 
           table, watching Wallace aim. He fires a pretty good shot just 
           off the bull’s-eye.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Have you ever had a fish tank?

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Wallace lies on his bed, on top of the covers, with his legs 
           up against the wall, on the phone.

                                 WALLACE
                        What’s the best thing anyone’s ever done 
                        for you?

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Chantry lies on her couch, under a blanket, on the phone, her 
           cat curled up on her stomach.

                                 CHANTRY
                        What’s the most money you’ve ever spent 
                        in one go?

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Wallace and Chantry sit on a park bench, sipping coffees, 
           watching various DOG-OWNERS trying to control their exuberant 
           DOGS. Balls are tossed and caught. Much wagging and running.

                                 WALLACE
                        Do you have an earliest memory?

           EXT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Chantry stirs a pot, the phone tucked under her ear.

                                 CHANTRY
                        When was your first kiss?

           INT. BUS - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry sit on the bus. Across from them, a 
           COUPLE is making out and groping each other. Wallace and 
           Chantry aren’t even trying to act like they’re not watching.
           They’re almost anthropological in their observation.

                                 WALLACE
                        What was the best kiss you ever had?
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Wallace and Chantry in work-clothes, drinking coffees and 
           nibbling on sandwiches.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Have you ever dated someone older than 
                        you?

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry eating pasta in a family-run restaurant, 
           with red-checkered tablecloths and framed photos of the 
           Italian countryside. 

                                 WALLACE
                        How many serious relationships have you 
                        had?

           INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry dipping pita bread in hummus. The 
           tablecloths are blue-checkered and the framed photos show the 
           Greek countryside.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Have you ever been attracted to a guy?

           INT. ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry eating Ethiopian food with their fingers.

                                 WALLACE
                        Have you ever been attracted to a girl?

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry dipping nan bread in various curries.

                                 CHANTRY
                        What kind of girl are you usually 
                        attracted to?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY

           Heavy rain. Wallace and Chantry stand at a street corner, 
           waiting for the light to change, each carrying an umbrella. 

           Behind them, a ROSE-VENDOR keeps dry under an awning. 

           Because of their umbrellas, Wallace and Chantry stand weirdly 
           far apart. Chantry notices this. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She closes her umbrella and comes under Wallace’s umbrella. 
           Now they’re standing weirdly close together. 

           The light changes. They cross the street under the umbrella.

           Meanwhile, rain has been pooling in the awning. Suddenly, it 
           gives way and dumps all over the Rose-Vendor.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Chantry leads a reluctant Wallace into a women’s clothing 
           store. The clothes on display look fashionable and expensive.

                                 CHANTRY
                        This will just take a sec. I saw this one 
                        dress and... there it is!

           Chantry bee-lines to a particular dress, a sexy little number 
           tight on a mannequin. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        We’ve got this company investor party 
                        thing coming up. Our production partners 
                        from Taiwan will be there. It’s pretty 
                        important, I guess, so I want to look 
                        hot. Do you think I’ll look hot in it?

           Chantry strikes a vampy pose just like the one the mannequin 
           is in. Wallace ponders her. 

                                 WALLACE
                        That’s quite a dress.

           A SALES WOMAN (mid-30s) strides up, haughty, immaculate. 

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        Can I help you?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yes, I’d like to try on this dress.

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        This dress?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yes.

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        We only have the one left. And it’s a 
                        size two. Are you a two?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Sales Woman looks her up and down, snooty.

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        Maybe I should get the measuring tape.

           Chantry’s eyes narrow. She’s not budging.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m a two.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE/CHANGE ROOM - DAY

           Chantry is in her bra and underwear. She looks at the dress 
           label. Size 2. She looks at the label on her jeans. Size 4.

           She worms the dress down over her head. It’s really quite 
           tight. She struggles, awkwardly pulling it down over her 
           body, tugging at the fabric, trying to squeeze into it.

           Finally she gets it on. She looks at herself in the change 
           room mirror. It’s definitely too small. She takes a deep 
           breath, pushes out her chest. No way.

           Deflated, Chantry tries to pull off the dress. She gets it up 
           over her head, but then the fabric gets caught on her bra. 

           She tugs at it. The dress is stuck.

           From the chest up, she’s covered by the dress, a mess of 
           fabric seemingly locked tight around her upper torso. Her 
           hands are over her head, caught up in the fabric. From the 
           chest down, she’s wearing only underwear and socks.

           She tugs at the dress again. Nothing. She yanks harder. The 
           dress starts RIPPING. 

           She carefully pulls at it, but it RIPS again. She tries 
           gently wriggling, but it’s no use.

           She’s trapped in the dress.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE/OUTSIDE CHANGE ROOM - AT THAT MOMENT

           Wallace waits, leaning against the wall, a bit bored. 

                                 CHANTRY (O.S.)
                               (hissing)
                        Wallace... are you alone?

                                 WALLACE
                        Like, in the universe?

                        No, out there.

                                 WALLACE
                        You want me to get someone?

                                 CHANTRY (O.S.)
                        No! I... I need you to come in here.

           Wallace waits. Nothing happens.

                                 WALLACE
                        Are you going to open the door?

                                 CHANTRY (O.S.)
                        I can’t. I’m... sort of stuck. Crawl 
                        under the door. But close your eyes.

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 CHANTRY (O.S.)
                        I’m in a... state of undress. Promise 
                        you’ll keep your eyes closed.

                                 WALLACE
                        I promise.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE/CHANGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Chantry stands there with the dress stuck over her head.

           His eyes closed, Wallace slides under the door. Unable to 
           see, he doesn’t make it all the way through before trying to 
           stand up. He SMACKS his head on the bottom of the door.

                                 WALLACE
                        Augh!

                                 CHANTRY
                        What? Did you look?

                                 WALLACE
                        I hit my head because my eyes are closed.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay good. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Good?

           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        You know what I mean.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m really not sure I do.

           Wallace awkwardly gets to his feet inside the change room, 
           eyes still closed. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Are your eyes closed?

           Wallace opens his eyes.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           Wallace takes a good look at Chantry, standing there with the 
           dress stuck over her head, wearing just underwear and socks. 
           Her underwear has a cute little pattern on it. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay, so I’m trapped in the dress. I was 
                        pulling it off and I think it got hooked 
                        on my bra or something and now I’m stuck.

           Wallace is still kind of mesmerized by the whole thing.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to laugh?

                                 WALLACE
                        I can’t even see what’s going on.

                                 CHANTRY
                        No matter how embarrassing this is, it’ll 
                        be even more embarrassing if you see it. 

                                 WALLACE
                        That’s probably true.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay. So get me out of this.

           Tentative, Wallace reaches out, putting his hands on 
           Chantry’s bare torso, just below where the dress is caught at 
           her bra. He gives a slight tug to get the fabric loose. 

           He eases the dress up further, over her chest, so it’s just 
           caught around Chantry’s armpits. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Wallace gets another look at Chantry, standing there with her 
           arms over her head, covered from her shoulders up. Her bra 
           has the same cute pattern as her underwear. They match.

           He holds his breath. 

           He starts to work the dress over her shoulders, past her 
           chin. Now it’s just caught under her nose.

           Chantry takes a deep breath. She could do the rest herself, 
           but she doesn’t.

           Wallace stands in front of Chantry, really close, their lips 
           inches apart. A really good opportunity to kiss her.

           But he doesn’t. Instead, he closes his eyes. He pulls the 
           dress up off the rest of her head, freeing her. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Thanks...

                                 WALLACE
                        You’re welcome.

           Chantry looks at Wallace, standing right in front of her, his 
           eyes closed, holding the dress. They’re very close together. 
           A really good opportunity to kiss him. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Keep your eyes closed.

           She leans in close to him, their lips almost touching. His 
           eyes closed, Wallace is unaware just how close his lips are 
           to Chantry’s. Inches. An inch. Less.

           But she doesn’t do it. She pulls away and tugs on her pants. 
           She slips into her shirt. She looks at Wallace again. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Open them.

           Wallace opens his eyes. He hands Chantry the dress. She 
           checks out the tear she made in the fabric.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Wallace and Chantry drop the dress on the sales counter and 
           hurry to the exit before the Sales Woman spots them.
           INT. CHANTRY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Chantry is at her computer, making changes to a sequence from 
           the ANIMATED FILM she’s working on. It shows the Robot in a 
           futuristic mall setting. She clicks PREVIEW and the image 
           PLAY onscreen.

           The Robot rolls through a gaudy atrium lined by various 
           shops. Other ROBOTS mill around with their shopping bags. The 
           Robot rolls into one shop in particular, a clothing store...

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - ANIMATED

           The Robot rolls through an animated version of the same 
           clothing store. A SALES ROBOT tends to a ROBOT CUSTOMER. 
           Various ROBOT-MANNEQUINS are dressed in clothes. 

           Robot rolls up to one mannequin in particular, wearing the 
           same dress Chantry tried on. But this mannequin isn’t a 
           robot, it’s ANIMATED CHANTRY.

                                 ROBOT
                        You don’t think that was a little over 
                        the line?

           Chantry looks around, furtive, trying to maintain her pose.

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        It’s not like I planned it.

                                 ROBOT
                        Nice bit of luck you were wearing such 
                        cute matching bra and panties.

           Robot grabs the dress, ripping it off Chantry, revealing her 
           matching bra and panties. She covers up as best she can.

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        It wasn’t lucky or unlucky. It was 
                        humiliating.

                                 ROBOT
                        He saw you in your underwear.

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY
                        His eyes were closed.

           The Sales Robot looks over and sees Chantry in her underwear. 
           Outraged, it SLAMS down a big RED BUTTON.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           ALARMS BLARE. SECURITY ROBOTS rush in wearing badges 
           labelled: “INSECURITY GUARDS”. The Security Robots back 
           Chantry into a corner, approaching with menacing glares. 

                                 ANIMATED CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Help!

           But Robot just shrugs and lets the Security Robots swarm 
           Chantry, piling onto her.

           INT. BRUNCH RESTAURANT - DAY

           Chantry and Dalia sit with Gretchen and Tabby, eating brunch 
           in a brightly lit window booth.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s not just the time-zone stuff. He’s 
                        having all these new experiences and my 
                        life’s not particularly different. Except 
                        that my boyfriend’s in France.

                                 TABBY
                        It’ll get better though. You’re Chantry 
                        and Paul. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Have you thought about getting webcams?

                                 CHANTRY
                        We talked about it.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Just make sure it’s on stream, not 
                        record. Because once certain kinds of 
                        files are out there, they’re out there 
                        forever. If you know what I mean.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I mean naked files.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, I knew what you meant, Gretchen.

           They all turn their attentions to their meals. Tabby looks 
           over at Gretchen, questioning, Gretchen nods. 

                                 TABBY
                        So, Dalia was telling us about this 
                        Wallace guy?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        What do you mean? We’re friends.

                                 TABBY
                        Yeah, obviously. But is he, like, cute? 
                        Should you be introducing him to your 
                        single and slightly desperate friends?

                                 DALIA
                        Sorry, Tabby, I already called dibs.

           That takes Chantry off-guard. She looks at Dalia, surprised.

                                 TABBY
                        What? Since when?

                                 DALIA
                        I met him first.

                                 TABBY
                        You just got out of a relationship, like, 
                        a month ago.

                                 DALIA
                        Exactly. He’s total rebound fling 
                        material.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        You little prostitute!

                                 CHANTRY
                        You barely know him.

                                 DALIA
                        Yeah, but you know him. You hang out with 
                        him all the time, so he’s not a loser. 
                        And he hasn’t pulled some creepy move on 
                        you, so he’s not a creep. He’s vetted. 

                                 TABBY
                        Is he smart? Is he funny?

                                 DALIA
                        Definitely smart. Not exactly funny. More 
                        banter-y. Like a male version of Chantry. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Wait, so he’s... Mantry?

                                 TABBY
                        Oh my god, he’s totally Mantry.

                        So Dalia wants to have rebound sex with 
                        her sister’s man-twin?

                                 DALIA
                        Bitch, I will cut you. Give me some 
                        waffles...

           Dalia brandishes her fork and stabs a piece of Gretchen’s 
           waffles. Chantry’s quiet, a bit thrown off by the discussion.

           INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           An uncomfortably elegant jewelry boutique bathed in soft 
           light and staffed by supermodel-tall SALES WOMEN. Allan and 
           Wallace putter around, peering into illuminated display 
           cases, checking out the twinkling bracelets and necklaces. 

                                 ALLAN
                        Option one, make a move on her. Bold. 
                        Direct. Best case scenario, you hook up, 
                        she feels guilty, breaks up with Paul. 
                        Worst case scenario, she’s horribly 
                        offended, ends the friendship.

                                 WALLACE
                        So be sleazy.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah.

                                 WALLACE
                        And you think that’ll work on Chantry?

                                 ALLAN
                        No. I think even if she goes for it, 
                        she’ll resent you for getting her to 
                        cheat on Paul. She’ll break up with him, 
                        but she won’t go out with you because 
                        she’ll think you’re...

                                 WALLACE
                        Sleazy.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah. Option two, become the guy she goes 
                        to for guy-advice. Mr. Sensitive. The 
                        down-side is you’ve got to listen to her 
                        talk about Paul all the time. The up-side 
                        is you can slant your advice to slowly 
                        turn her against him.

                                 WALLACE
                        So be conniving. And you think that’ll
                        work?

                                 ALLAN
                        Maybe. But maybe she’ll see through it 
                        and think you’re...

                                 WALLACE
                        Conniving.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah. Option three, patiently wait it 
                        out. Eventually, they’ll either break up 
                        without your help or, you know, get 
                        married, have kids, live a happy life, 
                        with you always on the outside looking 
                        in, quietly pining, indefinitely.

                                 WALLACE
                        So be pathetic. And you think that’ll
                        work?

                                 ALLAN
                        Well, it’s got the advantage of not being 
                        particularly unethical. But it’s got the 
                        disadvantage of being...

                                 WALLACE
                        Pathetic.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah.

                                 WALLACE
                        So your advice is be sleazy, conniving, 
                        or pathetic.

                                 ALLAN
                        Yeah, when you put it that way it doesn’t 
                        sound like very good advice.

           A statuesque JEWELRY CLERK (mid-30s) approaches them, holding 
           a small box. She opens it for them to see.

           It’s a gold engagement ring, with a large letter ‘A’ made out 
           of tiny glittering diamonds where the stone normally is.

                                 ALLAN (CONT’D)
                        You like it?

                        It’s not my engagement ring. The question 
                        is whether she’ll like it.

                                 ALLAN
                        I think she’ll love it.

                                 WALLACE
                        If she does, you two definitely deserve 
                        each other.

           EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           Wallace and Allan exit, Allan placing the ring-box in his 
           pocket, careful, pleased.

                                 WALLACE
                        Where is this coming from? You didn’t 
                        even want me to be friends with her.

                                 ALLAN
                        That was just my gut reaction to the idea 
                        of you and my cousin making boom-boom. 
                        But Nicole says...

                                 WALLACE
                        Woah woah woah, you told Nicole?

                                 ALLAN
                        Of course. A hundred percent honesty is 
                        the foundation of a strong relationship.

           Wallace gives him a look. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Montreal. 2003. I believe her name was 
                        Favia. Oh, she looked very much like a 
                        woman. And yet...

                                 ALLAN
                        Okay, ninety-nine percent honesty is the 
                        foundation of a strong relationship.

           They walk. Allan feels for the ring-box, ensuring it’s there.

                                 WALLACE
                        If I make some slippery move on her, 
                        especially when she’s in a long-distance 
                        relationship, it’ll backfire.

                        Nicole’s got a very different philosophy 
                        about that...

           INT. UPSCALE BISTRO - NIGHT

           The CROWD is gussied up, suits and dresses, CHATTING in 
           groups, sipping wine, nabbing appetizers from WAITERS.

           Nicole is in a cocktail dress, wearing the A-ring. Allan and 
           Wallace stand with her, both in suits, both freshly shaved.

                                 NICOLE
                        If it starts dirty, it ends dirty is 
                        bullshit. All relationships start dirty. 
                        You can’t fall out of love with someone 
                        until you meet someone you love more. I 
                        was still in love with Carl when I met 
                        Allan. But after about ten minutes, I 
                        couldn’t even remember if Carl spelled 
                        his name with a C or a K. 

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m happy being friends with Chantry. 

                                 NICOLE
                        But wouldn’t you be happier if you could 
                        be friends and also see her naked?

           Nicole nods meaningfully to Chantry and Dalia, who stand not 
           too far off, CHATTING in another group. They both look great, 
           dolled up in chic dresses and cute shoes. 

           Dalia catches Wallace looking at them. Assuming he’s checking 
           her out, Dalia gives him a little wave. Wallace waves back.

           EXT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Dalia’s car pulls up, Dalia driving, Chantry in the passenger 
           seat, Wallace in the back. They’re all in their engagement 
           party clothes.

                                 WALLACE
                        You sure? It’s just a couple blocks.

                                 DALIA
                        I’m all about door-to-door service.

           Chantry looks at Dalia, like, since when? Dalia nods for her 
           to hop out. Apprehensive, Chantry unbuckles and gets out.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Wallace crawls out of the back to move to the front. Chantry 
           stands on the sidewalk, regarding him. She adjusts his 
           slightly crooked tie. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        You clean up nice, Wallace.

                                 WALLACE
                        You too.

           Chantry walks up to her building. Wallace gets into the front 
           seat, closes the door. Chantry turns around, but Dalia’s car 
           zips off down the street before she can even wave goodbye.

           INT. DALIA’S CAR — NIGHT

           Dalia pulls up outside Wallace’s place, puts her car in PARK. 
           Dalia fixes him with some heavy eye contact.

                                 DALIA
                        Look, Wallace, I don’t think it’s a good 
                        idea for me to come inside with you.

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh... what?

                                 DALIA
                        Don’t be mad.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not mad.

                                 DALIA
                        Because if you’re going to be all mad, I 
                        mean, I guess we can make out for a 
                        couple minutes. But we’re not having sex. 

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t know if that’s a good idea.

                                 DALIA
                        Why, because I won’t have sex with you? 
                        That’s really nice, Wallace.

                                 WALLACE
                        No, I... that’s not...

                                 DALIA
                        I’m just kidding.

                                 WALLACE
                        What part of it are you kidding about?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DALIA
                        All of it. You know, Chantry always talks 
                        about how funny you are. But you’re not 
                        that funny. No offense. You are pretty 
                        cute though. I would make out with you.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m so confused by this conversation.

           Dalia leans in and kisses Wallace. His eyes go wide. 

                                 DALIA
                        Okay, you win. Let’s go inside. No sex 
                        though. Okay, maybe a little sex.

           Dalia plants another kiss on Wallace. He lets it happen. 

           While they make out, Dalia slides over onto his lap. She 
           yanks the seat-lever and Wallace’s seat jerks backwards. She 
           swings her legs around, straddling him. Wallace isn’t sure 
           where to put his hands, but hers are all over him. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the car window. Wallace and Dalia freeze. 
           Chantry opens the door and hops in the front seat.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Dude, my sister? Sweet score.

                                 WALLACE
                        This isn’t what it looks like. It’s... 
                        okay, it’s what it looks like.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hey, it’s cool. I totally get it. She’s, 
                        like, ninety-nine percent genetically 
                        identical to me. It’s like having sex 
                        with ninety-nine percent of me.

                                 DALIA
                        You rat-faced ho-bag, you really think 
                        Wallace would have sex with me just 
                        because we share virtually identical DNA? 
                        That’s sick. You’re sick. Wallace is 
                        attracted to my intrinsic personal 
                        qualities. Right Wallace?

           Before Wallace can answer, Dalia swoops in with another kiss. 
           Lips locked with Dalia, Wallace’s eyes dart over to Chantry. 
           Chantry gives him a wry shrug. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay, have fun kissing my sister...

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Chantry slips out of the car. She’s about to close the door 
           when she stops and pokes her head back in.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Just FYI though. You go through this, you 
                        can be absolutely positive I will never, 
                        ever, ever, ever have sex with you. Ever.

           Chantry SLAMS the door shut.

           Wallace breaks the kiss with Dalia, gently easing her away. 
           She stares at him, taken aback. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Dalia, look, I think you’re great, but...

                                 DALIA
                        You think I’m great?

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s just...

                                 DALIA
                        I don’t throw myself at guys, like, ever! 
                        I made an exception for you because 
                        you’re cute! And you think I’m GREAT? 

           EXT. WALLACE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Dalia shoves Wallace out of her car. He tumbles to the curb, 
           landing in a mud puddle, soaking his suit with filthy water.

           Dalia puts the car in gear and PEELS OFF down the street. 
           Wallace sits there, mud splattered, stunned.

           Wallace gets to his feet, suit dripping with mud. Dalia’s car 
           recedes in the distance. He gives a pathetic little GROAN.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           A hot, sunny day. Chantry and Dalia lie on beach towels on 
           the sand, slippery with sunscreen.

                                 DALIA
                        You never asked me what happened with 
                        Wallace the other night.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m respecting your privacy.

                                 DALIA
                        You’re dying to know.

                        Nope.

           They lie there in the sun. 

                                 DALIA
                        We kissed.

           Dalia watches Chantry, waiting for a reaction.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You kissed him or he kissed you?

                                 DALIA
                        I don’t remember.

           Chantry’s studiously not looking at Dalia. Dalia pouts.

                                 DALIA (CONT’D)
                        He’s a jerk. He’s a big fat stupid jerk.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay.

                                 DALIA
                        He propositioned me. He said filthy 
                        things. Disgusting things he wanted to do 
                        to me. Me, your little sister.

                                 CHANTRY
                        That’s terrible.

                                 DALIA
                        So I told him I’m not that kind of girl. 
                        And he flew into a rage. He punched me. 
                        The cops had to pull him off me.

                                 CHANTRY
                        The cops came?

                                 DALIA
                        Yeah. And he shot them, shot them all 
                        dead. And then he told me he was going to 
                        come after you and kill you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well, that sounds exactly like Wallace.

                                 DALIA
                        Have you seen him lately?

                                 DALIA
                        So he didn’t say anything about me 
                        completely humiliating myself?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No.

           They lie on their towels, sun shimmering down on them.

                                 DALIA
                        He’s a big fat stupid jerk and you 
                        shouldn’t be friends with him anymore.

           Finished with the topic, Dalia stretches out to soak up the 
           rays. Chantry wants to relax, but her brow knits, tense.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

           Chantry and Wallace approach each other from opposite ends of 
           the street, both in work clothes, both a bit apprehensive.

           As they get closer, Chantry slows down, but notices Wallace 
           hasn’t changed his pace. She does the same, ignoring him as 
           he passes by. 

           Wallace loops around and falls into step with her, as if 
           they’d been walking together the whole time.

                                 WALLACE
                        André the Giant used to live in the same 
                        town as Samuel Beckett.

                                 CHANTRY
                        What?

                                 WALLACE
                        It was this tiny village in France with, 
                        like, thirty people in it. André the 
                        Giant grew up there and Beckett lived 
                        there at the same time. He’d give André
                        rides to school.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I wish “My Dinner With André” had 
                        actually been about Wallace Shawn’s 
                        dinner with André the Giant. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Totally.

           They walk along. The tension isn’t gone, but it’s dissolving.

           EXT. MARINA - DAY

           A boardwalk wraps around a marina packed with sailboats. 

           Wallace and Chantry sit on a bench, a half-eaten watermelon 
           between them. They each bite into big watermelon slices, 
           juice all over their hands and chins. They look ridiculous, 
           but it’s too delicious to care. 

           Suddenly Chantry’s grin fades. 

           Ambling down the boardwalk, holding hands, are HOLLY and 
           JOSH. Josh WHISPERS to Holly, lips at her ear, intimate.

           Holly and Josh are just steps away from Chantry and Wallace 
           when they notice them. They freeze, immediately letting go of 
           each other’s hand. It’s not what you’d call discreet.

                                 HOLLY
                        Hi.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hi.

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

           Holly and Josh look at Wallace. He looks at Chantry for a 
           little guidance, but she’s blank-faced.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hi.

           The dictionary definition of “awkward pause” is this moment.

                                 HOLLY
                        Um, bye.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Bye.

                                 JOSH
                        Bye.

                                 WALLACE
                        Bye.

           Holly and Josh hurry off down the boardwalk, super-tense. 
           Chantry sits there, holding her half-eaten watermelon slice.

                        That was, like, the most efficient 
                        conversation I’ve ever had.

           Chantry doesn’t say anything, distracted. She wipes off her 
           mouth on a paper napkin.

                                 CHANTRY
                        That’s my boss, Holly. My married boss 
                        Holly. And my co-worker, Josh. My married 
                        co-worker Josh.

                                 WALLACE
                        And are they married to each other?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No.

           INT. UPSCALE BISTRO - DAY

           Chantry sits, uncomfortable, across from Holly, who’s 
           cushioning her discomfort with studied casualness. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Chantry, you’re a valued employee and I 
                        think of you as a friend, so I hope we 
                        can just be honest with each other.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay. Is this why Josh got the job over 
                        me?

                                 HOLLY
                        Yes. It means we can travel together.

           Chantry looks so disappointed. Holly gets her back up, 
           miffed. But suddenly she dissolves into tears, CRYING.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Holly, it’s okay, I’m not going to tell 
                        anybody. It’s none of my business.

                                 HOLLY
                        I’ve just been so terrified of anyone 
                        finding out... especially someone from 
                        work... and I just feel so lucky it was 
                        you... someone in the same situation... 

                                 CHANTRY
                        What do you mean the same situation?

           CONTINUED:

                                 HOLLY
                        I don’t know what kind of arrangement you 
                        and Paul have while he’s away, if he 
                        knows about this other guy or...

                                 CHANTRY
                        The guy I was with is just a friend. I’m 
                        not cheating on Paul.

                                 HOLLY
                        I saw what I saw. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Excuse me?

                                 HOLLY
                        I saw what I saw just like you saw what 
                        you saw. And, frankly, I don’t need your 
                        judgment. Greg and I got married when I 
                        was twenty-one. I’m forty-four. I’ve 
                        spent more of my life with him than 
                        without him. This thing with Josh, it’s 
                        not a fling. We’re in love. I love him.

           Chantry’s about to speak, but stops, considering what Holly 
           just said. She weighs her next question carefully.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Do you... I mean, do you think a real 
                        relationship can come out of an affair?

           Holly doesn’t answer right away. This is obviously the 
           central question of her life right now.

                                 HOLLY
                        If you’re in love, but not with the 
                        person you’re supposed to be in love 
                        with, then yes... I do.

                                 CHANTRY
                        You make it sound so black and white.

                                 HOLLY
                        It is for me. Is it for you?

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Chantry’s on the phone, listening to EUROPEAN RINGS.

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        Bonjour?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hey, it’s me. So this weird thing 
                        happened today...

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        Look, I’m late for a meeting. I don’t 
                        have time for a big long story right now.

                                 CHANTRY
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        Nothing. I’m sorry. My brain’s on this 
                        meeting and... I really have to get 
                        going. Je love you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Je love you deux.

           Paul hangs up. Chantry hangs up. Well, that sucked.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           A deserted stretch of beach. Wallace and Chantry hang around 
           a bonfire with Allan and Nicole. They all drink beer. 

                                 NICOLE
                        So I’m like, fuck you, bitch. Fuck you 
                        right in the mouth with a broken gin 
                        bottle. And she’s like, excuse me? And 
                        I’m like, you’re excused. And I just 
                        walked off. But the best part was, I 
                        really had shoplifted the jacket. She was 
                        totally right, but she didn’t have the 
                        courage of her convictions. And that’s 
                        how I got this jacket.

                                 ALLAN
                        It’s a great jacket, babe.

           Chantry and Wallace nod in encouragement. But when Nicole and 
           Allan aren’t looking, Wallace bugs out his eyes at Chantry.

           Nicole sucks back the last of her beer and stands up. 

                                 NICOLE
                        Let’s go swimming!

                                 ALLAN
                        Did you bring your bathing suit?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NICOLE
                        No...

           Allan’s face lights up.

                                 ALLAN
                        Skinny-dip!

           Allan hops to his feet and fake-tackles Nicole at the waist. 
           He hoists her over his shoulder and races off to the water. 
           She playfully pounds on his back like Jane with Tarzan.

           Wallace and Chantry remain by the fire. Wallace drinks. 
           Chantry drinks. Neither speaks. 

           In the distance, Nicole SHRIEKS WITH LAUGHTER. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Want to go swimming?

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh... sure.

           EXT. BEACH/WATER’S EDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wallace and Chantry approach two piles of clothes by the 
           water’s edge. Nicole and Allan SPLASH in the water, naked.

                                 WALLACE
                        So, uh...

           Chantry unbuckles her belt. That shuts Wallace up. 

           She kicks off her shoes and slips off her pants. Wallace 
           pulls off his shoes and socks. She takes off her shirt. He 
           takes off his shirt and pulls off his pants. She unhooks her 
           bra. She steps out of her underwear. He drops his boxers.

           Wallace and Chantry stand naked over their little piles of 
           clothes, studiously not looking at each other.

           In the water, Nicole leaps onto Allan. He tips her over and 
           dunks her. She SQUEALS as she goes underwater.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Think it’ll be cold?

           But Chantry’s already wading in. Wallace is frozen for a 
           moment, staring at her. Then he snaps out of it. He SPLASHES 
           in after her.
           EXT. WATER - NIGHT

           The water’s dark, almost black, but the moon casts silver 
           ripples around Wallace and Chantry as they bob in place. The 
           water sits above their chests, not quite at their shoulders.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I read that when they were trying to come 
                        up with a name for Cool Whip, they 
                        brainstormed ten thousand ideas.

                                 WALLACE
                        And they picked Cool Whip?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah. They said to try coming up with ten 
                        of your own just to see how hard it is.

           Wallace bobs there, thinking about it. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Cool Puff.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Puffy Whip.

                                 WALLACE
                        Whippy Puff.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Nice Whip. Cloudy Whip. Angel Whip. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Dream Cloud. Dreamy ‘N Creamy.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Sweet Dream.

                                 WALLACE
                        Sir Puff-a-lot’s Whippy Whipped Foam.

                                 CHANTRY
                        How many’s that?

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t know.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s not that hard.

           Chantry and Wallace stare at each other as they bob, their 
           nakedness mostly concealed by the dark water.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Suddenly, Chantry SHRIEKS and flails around.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Something touched my foot!

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Underwater! It brushed my foot!

           Wallace tries to look into the water, but he can’t see 
           anything down there. Chantry looks around. It’s dark out. No 
           sign of Allan and Nicole, just the bonfire in the distance.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve got the creeps. Let’s go back in.

           Chantry starts swimming to the shore. Wallace looks around 
           one last time. 

           There’s a small SPLASH and the water ripples a few feet away. 
           Wallace quickly swims after Chantry.

           EXT. BEACH/WATER’S EDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wallace and Chantry emerge from the water. They’re both 
           naked, but they’re making an effort not to look at one 
           another. It’s not easy.

           Their clothes are gone.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Where are our clothes?

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t know. Did we come down too far?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, the fire’s right there.

           Chantry points to the bonfire. It’s right where it should be.

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh no...

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah. They took our clothes.

           They look around. Nothing but sand, logs, and water. And two 
           naked people trying really hard not to check each other out.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WALLACE
                        We should find something to cover 
                        ourselves with.

           They look around some more. Then, Chantry stops looking. She 
           looks up at the sky. Wallace sees this and looks up as well. 
           The sky is packed with stars. Millions of them.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I hate how you can’t see stars like this 
                        in the city. You should be able to see 
                        all the stars. Not just one or two.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, and those two always end up being 
                        low-flying satellites.

           There’s a long quiet moment. They stare up at the stars.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Wallace?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah?

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’ll look if you look.

           Wallace keeps staring up at the sky. So does Chantry.

                                 WALLACE
                        Okay.

           They look at one another, naked on the beach, the water 
           lapping up just a few feet away. 

           It’s a different kind of long quiet moment. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Chantry and Wallace approach the bonfire. Wallace has a leaf-
           covered tree-branch covering his groin. Chantry has one for 
           her chest, one for her groin.

           Allan and Nicole are nowhere to be seen. And neither are 
           their clothes. The only thing left by the bonfire is a single 
           rolled up sleeping bag.

           It’s a set-up and they both know it.
           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Chantry sits by the bonfire, sleeping bag wrapped around her. 
           Wallace, still naked, awkwardly holding the branch, emerges 
           from the darkness beyond the fire, out of her sight-line.

                                 WALLACE
                        The car’s gone.

           Chantry keeps her eyes on the fire. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        How’d it get so cold? It wasn’t cold at 
                        all before. It was, like, a warm night.

                                 WALLACE
                        You keep the sleeping bag, okay? I’ll 
                        figure something out...

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s freezing. I can’t let you spend the 
                        night cold and wet and naked on the sand 
                        like a walrus.

           Wallace gives the slightest possible CHUCKLE.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        You think this is funny? You think this 
                        is some, like, hilarious prank pulled on 
                        us by our wacky pals? Well, I don’t.

                                 WALLACE
                        I just thought you were trying to lighten 
                        the mood in an uncomfortable situation 
                        with a mildly amusing joke involving a 
                        walrus. I’m sorry if I misunderstood the 
                        seriousness of your walrus reference.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Don’t be an asshole.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not being an asshole.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, you are being an asshole because 
                        you’re not taking this seriously. You’re 
                        treating it like a joke and it’s not a 
                        fucking joke!

           Chantry pulls the sleeping bag tight around herself.

                        There’s a line. A line that shouldn’t be 
                        crossed. And they crossed it. They...

           Allan and Nicole aren’t the only ones who crossed the line.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        And acting like it’s a joke is being an 
                        asshole.

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t think this is a joke. And I’m not 
                        being an asshole. Allan is being an 
                        asshole. Nicole is being an asshole. And 
                        right now, you’re kind of being an 
                        asshole. Me, I’m standing here with a 
                        branch. A branch that cuts down 
                        approximately zero-percent of the wind-
                        chill factor on my dick, okay? You’ve got 
                        a sleeping bag. I’ve got a branch. How 
                        does that make me an asshole?

           Chantry stares at the CRACKLING flames. Wallace stands behind 
           her, tense.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Fine.

                                 WALLACE
                        Fine? What does fine mean?

                                 CHANTRY
                        It means we’ll share.

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Wallace and Chantry lie inside the sleeping bag, facing away 
           from each other, back-to-back, naked. 

           Wallace tries to pull up the zipper, but it sticks. He 
           wriggles around, trying to loosen it without rubbing up 
           against Chantry too much. Finally, the zipper gives and he 
           gets it closed.

           Wallace squirms, trying to give Chantry enough room so they 
           aren’t skin-to-skin, but the sleeping bag is too small.

           The bonfire CRACKLES. Neither of them close their eyes. 
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           It’s a sunny morning, early, post-dawn light dappling the 
           waves. The bonfire is out, just a mess of ash. Wallace and 
           Chantry lie in the sleeping bag, Wallace on his back, Chantry 
           curled into him, head on his chest.

           Wallace blinks awake. Realizing the position they’re in, he 
           keeps still, enjoying it while he can.

           Chantry stirs, nuzzles Wallace’s chest, half-asleep. But as 
           soon as she opens her eyes, she stiffens. She can’t see if 
           Wallace is awake. He doesn’t move, unsure what to do or say.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Wallace?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           They lie there for a moment, motionless.

           Chantry uncurls from her position. They lie on their backs, 
           next to each other, squeezed tight in the sleeping bag. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        What do we do now?

           Wallace spots their clothes, folded neatly on a nearby log. 

                                 WALLACE
                        They brought our clothes back.

           EXT. BEACH ROAD - DAY

           Allan’s car is parked at the end of a dirt road. 

           Nicole has four cigarettes in her mouth. As Allan watches, 
           she INHALES, the ember of each cigarette burning one after 
           the other, in perfect sequence. Nicole EXHALES a lot of 
           smoke, triumphant. 

                                 ALLAN
                        I’ll never doubt you again.

           Nicole nods towards the beach. Wallace and Chantry, dressed, 
           approach them, Wallace holding the sleeping bag.

                                 ALLAN (CONT’D)
                        Sleep well?

           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        You’re an asshole.

           Allan wasn’t expecting that. Chantry gets into the back seat 
           of the car and sits there, quiet. 

           Allan looks at Wallace, curious. Wallace ignores his look, 
           hands him the sleeping bag, gets into the car.

           Allan and Nicole exchange a look, like, yikes.

           INT. ALLAN’S CAR - DAY

           Allan drives, Nicole in the passenger seat, Wallace and 
           Chantry in the back, each staring out their own window. 

           Nobody says anything.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Chantry sits with Gretchen and Tabby and mugs of coffee.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        And nothing happened?

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m not going to cheat on Paul like that.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        You mean other than spending a night 
                        naked in a sleeping bag with another guy.

                                 CHANTRY
                        So you think it counts as cheating.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Were you lying face-to-face or butt-to-
                        butt? Or were you spooning?

           Tabby gulps her coffee and SLAMS it down, too hard.

                                 TABBY
                        I’m just, like, in shock right now. 
                        You’re Chantry and Paul. You’re the 
                        couple by which all couples are judged.

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, we’re not. We’re just a couple.

                        You and Paul have been together forever. 
                        You’ve heard all his funny stories and 
                        you’ve seen him naked a million times. 
                        Someone new, whoever it is, you’re going 
                        to get that jolt.

                                 TABBY
                        Yeah, but is it worth breaking up a five 
                        year relationship?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        You really think just because you get an 
                        itch for someone else, you have to break 
                        up? You don’t think that’s overreacting? 
                        What if you get over it?

                                 TABBY
                        But what if you don’t?

                        But what if you don’t?

           Tabby looks at Chantry, directing the general question at her 
           specific situation.

                                 TABBY (CONT’D)

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wallace lies in bed, unable to fall asleep.

           INT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING/HALLWAY - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Wallace strides down the hall to Chantry’s apartment door, 
           gives it a firm KNOCK. Chantry opens it almost immediately, 
           wearing last night’s clothes.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hey. Hi. Good morning.

                        I just, uh... I thought we should talk 
                        about what happened last night. So things 
                        don’t get, uh... why are you naked?

                        I have nipples.

                        What?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Until last night, yeah, you could assume 
                        I had nipples. But you didn’t know for 
                        sure. Now? Confirmed.

                                 WALLACE
                        Okay, uh, but about last night...

                                 CHANTRY
                        What do you think?

                                 WALLACE
                        Well... I know it was a weird situation 
                        and maybe neither of us handled it the...

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, I mean what do you think about my 
                        nipples? Too big? Too small? Are they 
                        properly centred? Or a bit off, like, 
                        one’s slightly higher than the other?

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t want to talk about your nipples. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Fine. Let’s talk pubic hair.

                                 WALLACE
                        No! Chantry, I want to talk about us. 
                        What happened last night was maybe an 
                        uncomfortable situation, but... what?

           Chantry’s giving him a look.

                        Once you’ve seen someone naked, you can’t

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not trying to pretend. But I’m trying 
                        to tell you I... I mean, okay, look...

                                 CHANTRY
                        What? What are you trying to tell me?

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s hard to know where to start.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Let’s start with your penis. Exactly how 
                        cold were you last night?

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Look, I get it. You just got out of the 
                        ocean. The ocean’s cold. I understand the 
                        concept of shrinkage. But how much 
                        shrinkage are we talking about? What 
                        percentage of what I saw represents the 
                        whole, you know, situation down there?

           Chantry gestures downwards. She frowns, staring. 

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Is it getting smaller?

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wallace lies in bed. There’s no way he’s falling asleep.

           EXT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING - DAY

           The sun is shining. Wallace strolls up to the front door. 
           He’s nicely dressed, looking good despite a few shaving cuts. 

           He presses Chantry’s BUZZER. The speaker CRACKLES.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (SPEAKER)
                        Hello?

                                 WALLACE
                        Hey, it’s Wallace.

           There’s an uncomfortably long pause. Finally, the door 
           remotely unlocks with a SHARP BUZZ.
           INT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAY

           Wallace strides up to the apartment door, gives it a firm 
           KNOCK. The door opens almost immediately.

           But it’s not Chantry. It’s Dalia. And she’s wearing nothing 
           but a towel. 

                                 DALIA
                        Hi Wallace.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hi.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Wallace follows Dalia in. She tightens the towel around her.

                                 DALIA
                        I jogged over here to feed the cat. But 
                        if I don’t shower right away, my pores 
                        get all clogged up and I get a gross 
                        little zit nest on my forehead.

           Dalia goes into the kitchen. Wallace looks around. It’s a bit 
           weird to be in here without Chantry. Something occurs to him.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Wallace comes through the swinging door. Dalia pours herself 
           a glass of water at the sink and sips it.

                                 WALLACE
                        Why are you feeding the cat?

                                 DALIA
                        Because otherwise it’ll starve to death.

                                 WALLACE
                        Why can’t Chantry feed it?

                                 DALIA
                        Because she flew to France this morning.

           This hits Wallace like a punch to the throat. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Right, of course. France. To see Paul, I 
                        guess. Obviously. 

           Dalia squints at him, figuring it out.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DALIA
                        You like her. You like Chantry.

                                 WALLACE
                        What? No. Chantry and I are friends.

                                 DALIA
                        Making you the first guy in history to 
                        crush on a girl he’s friends with. 

                                 WALLACE
                        You should get in the shower. You’re 
                        going to get a zit nest on your forehead.

           Dalia instinctively covers her forehead with her hand. 

                                 DALIA
                        Don’t get snotty just because you’re 
                        busted.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m not in love with your sister.

                                 DALIA
                        You said love.

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 DALIA
                        I said like. You said love. 

           Wallace doesn’t know what to say to this and that’s enough 
           for Dalia. She exits, letting the door swing behind her.

           Wallace stands there, staring at the fridge. It’s covered 
           with fridge-magnets. A note on fridge stands out: “PAUL IN 
           FRANCE” along with a PHONE NUMBER and STREET ADDRESS.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Chantry sits at the top of a staircase, asleep, head tipped 
           against the wall, knapsack is at her feet. The silence is 
           broken by STUMBLING and GIGGLING downstairs.

                                 JULIANNE (O.S.)
                        Vraiment, cette dernière bouteille de vin
                        était une désastre...

           Paul appears at the bottom of the stairs. He’s helping 
           JULIANNE (early 30s), gorgeous and quite drunk, tottering on 
           high-heels. Julianne leans on him, woozy.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PAUL
                        On est presque la...

           Chantry wakes up. It takes a second to get her bearings. She 
           sees Paul, Julianne hanging off him, climbing the stairs.

           Paul’s attention is on Julianne, trying to steady her for the 
           final few stairs. He doesn’t see Chantry.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Paul?

           Paul stops short. In his surprise, he lets go of Julianne. 

           She teeters there, wobbling on her high-heels, and then falls
           backwards. Julianne SHRIEKS as she tumbles down the stairs.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - LATER

           The apartment is small and messy. Chantry and Paul stand in 
           the kitchen area, tense. Julianne sits at the table, holding 
           a piece of frozen meat to her head. Her high-heels are on the 
           table, both heels broken off. 

                                 PAUL
                        We work together. She lives in the 
                        apartment next door. A bunch of us went 
                        for a drink after work and I was helping 
                        her home.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m not accusing you of anything. 

                                 JULIANNE
                        You need not worry about his fidelity, 
                        Chantry. I am not a beautiful but morally 
                        corrupt French girl.

                                 PAUL
                        Julianne, it’s okay. Chantry, I just... 
                        what are you doing here?

           Chantry notices the fridge is covered in French magnet-poems.
           This makes her smile. Several photos of Chantry and Paul are 
           also on the fridge, snapshots from their life together. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        I came to surprise you. Surprise.

           Julianne heaves to her feet and picks up her broken high-
           heels, still holding the frozen meat to her forehead. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JULIANNE
                        I go now to my apartment. Do not worry, I 
                        will place tissue paper inside my ears so 
                        as not to hear your love-making through 
                        the wall. Also, I am keeping this meat.

           Julianne goes to the front door, opens it, and turns back.

                                 JULIANNE (CONT'D)
                        Tomorrow my current lover Rolf and I will 
                        take you two for dinner. Bon soir.

           With that, Julianne leaves, closing the door behind her. 
           Chantry looks at Paul expectantly. He smiles, sheepish.

                                 PAUL
                        This isn’t how I’d hoped to welcome you 
                        to France. I was just... startled. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Are you still startled? Would you like 
                        some warm milk?

           Paul takes Chantry’s face in his hands and kisses her.

                                 PAUL
                        Welcome to France.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Wallace sits on the floor outside the half-open bathroom 
           door, his head against the wall. Inside the bathroom, Dalia 
           SHOWERS behind an opaque curtain.

                                 DALIA (O.S.)
                        I’m not going to say anything. But I’m 
                        not helping you either. Paul’s a good 
                        person, he gets along with our family, 
                        and his career’s going great. 

           Wallace lightly THUMPS his head against the wall a few times.

                                 DALIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And, look, hey, you’re a funny guy. 
                        Chantry’s obviously fond of you. But she 
                        loves Paul, okay? They’re in love.

           Wallace stands up. He walks to the front door.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        So just do what you need to do to get 
                        over whatever you think you’re feeling. 
                        Because it’s never going to happen. 

           Wallace walks out the front door, closing it behind him.

                                 DALIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Think about it. They haven’t seen each 
                        other in months. Right now, right this 
                        second, they’re probably having the most 
                        super-hot catch up sex of all time...

           INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

           The bistro looks extremely French. Chantry, Paul, Julianne, 
           and ROLF (late 30s) sit at a table, sipping wine, awkward.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I, uh, read that when they were trying to 
                        name Cool Whip, they brainstormed ten 
                        thousand ideas for other names. 

                                 JULIANNE
                        What is Cool Whip?

                                 PAUL
                        It’s processed whipped cream. It comes in 
                        a spray can so it doesn’t go bad.

                                 ROLF
                        I have had the Cool Whip. I prefer fresh 
                        whipped cream. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        They said to try and come up with ten 
                        names of your own to see how hard it is. 
                        Like, uh, Puffy Whip. Or... Whippy Puff.

           Rolf and Julianne just stare at her, perplexed. Paul looks 
           uncomfortable. Embarrassed, Chantry gulps down her wine.

           In the corner, an ACCORDIONIST starts PLAYING a PEPPY TUNE... 

           ANIMATED MONTAGE:

           ANIMATED TEXT: “CHANTRY’S INCREDIBLY AWKWARD VISIT TO FRANCE”

           Animated Chantry sight-sees alone in a pretty French town. 
           She checks out cobblestone streets, ornate churches, and art 
           museums. She sips a huge foamy coffee and bites into a giant 
           gourmet cheese. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She reads in a café, finishing the last page of one book, 
           looking at her watch, then starting a new book. She stands on 
           a bridge, looking melancholy, staring down at her equally 
           melancholy reflection in the water. 

           Chantry sits at a bistro table, uncomfortable, while ANIMATED 
           PAUL LAUGHS with ANIMATED JULIANNE and ANIMATED ROLF...

           INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

           The Accordionist continues to play the TUNE. The animated 
           image fades into a live-action version: Chantry uncomfortable 
           as Paul, Julianne, and Rolf LAUGH at a private joke. 

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry. We should stop talking in French.

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, it’s fine. Your French has gotten 
                        really good. I’m impressed.

                                 JULIANNE
                        You know how Paul is. When he sets his 
                        mind to something...

                                 ROLF
                        Of course the classes help.

           Chantry looks at Paul, curious. He shrugs, nervous.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I mean, I had to figure out how to 
                        say noon. Midi.

                                 JULIANNE
                        Mon dieu, his French was so horrible when 
                        he first arrived. Had he not improved so 
                        much, we never could have offered him the 
                        full-time position... 

           Chantry stares at Paul, startled. Paul squirms. Julianne 
           immediately realizes her error. Rolf smiles, clueless.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - NIGHT

           Paul and Chantry stand in the cramped apartment, uneasy.

                                 PAUL
                        I haven’t signed anything. The offer was 
                        made, I’m considering it.

           CONTINUED:

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well obviously you’re going to accept it.

                                 PAUL
                        I wanted to talk to you about it first.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’ve been here for a week. When were you 
                        planning to bring it up?

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - LATER

           Paul and Chantry lie in bed, close together but not touching.

                                 PAUL
                        I love it here.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I know. I want you to be happy.

                                 PAUL
                        They must have animation companies here.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah. I can look into it.

                                 PAUL
                        So... you’ll consider moving? 

           Chantry doesn’t respond. They both stare up at the ceiling.

           INT. WALLACE’S OFFICE/ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The elevator doors DING open and Wallace enters, presses the 
           ground floor button. The doors start to close, but a hand 
           jets out, bouncing them open. It’s Lisa. 

           She steps in, nods to Wallace. The doors close. 

           Wallace and Lisa watch the numbers tick down as the elevator 
           descends. She seems really tense.

                                 WALLACE
                        Are you okay?

                                 LISA
                        Crappy meeting with HR. Well, all 
                        meetings with HR are crappy. But this one 
                        was particularly crap-tastic.

           Wallace nods. They stand there watching the floors drop away.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        Wallace... do you like your job?

           Wallace looks at her. Is she asking for an honest answer?

                                 WALLACE
                        No. Do you like your job?

                                 LISA
                        No.

           The elevator reaches the ground floor. The doors DING open.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        You want to go get a drink?

           Wallace regards Lisa. What’s he got to lose?

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Lisa lie in bed, both naked, mostly covered up by 
           the blanket. They each hold a scrap of paper and a pen.

                                 LISA
                        Come on.

                                 WALLACE
                        No.

                                 LISA
                        Come on.

                                 WALLACE
                        No way.

                                 LISA
                        Wallace, I let you put your penis inside 
                        me. Inside me, Wallace. In my vagina.

                                 WALLACE
                        I know where I put it!

                                 LISA
                        I’m just saying, that’s a very intimate 
                        thing to let someone do.

                                 WALLACE
                        Somehow it doesn’t seem that intimate 
                        right now.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LISA
                        I’m still your boss. The fact that you 
                        know what my vagina looks like doesn’t 
                        make me any less your boss. Now do it.

           Wallace looks at the paper. He scribbles down something. Lisa 
           writes on hers. Wallace looks unhappy about this whole thing. 
           They exchange scraps of paper. Lisa looks at hers and smiles. 

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Nine. That’s so sweet.

           Wallace looks at his paper. He frowns.

                                 WALLACE
                        Six.

           He looks up at Lisa. She smiles, encouraging.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Out of ten? That’s just one up from fail!

                                 LISA
                        Fail is four. Five’s a pass. Six is good.

           Lisa curls over and kisses him on the cheek. He squirms away.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got very high standards. I can give 
                        you some tips to get you up to an eight.

           Wallace lies back. Lisa scoots in next to him. Wallace is 
           kind of annoyed, but this obviously feels pretty good.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just giving you a hard time. You’re 
                        not a six.

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s okay.

                                 LISA
                        You’re at least a six-point-five.

           Wallace gives her a look, but when she turns over and presses 
           into him, he spoons her. Lisa smiles. Wallace wants to just 
           let go, enjoy the moment. But he can’t.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Lisa, fully dressed, sits on the edge of the bed. She nudges 
           Wallace awake. The clock reads: 5:18AM.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LISA
                        What’s her name?

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 LISA
                        I’ve been flirting with you on and off 
                        for months. And you’ve been remarkably 
                        resistant. So I figured you’re either 
                        gay, not interested or into someone else. 
                        Based on last night, we can scratch gay 
                        and not interested. Which means you’ve 
                        been hung up on some other girl. 

                                 WALLACE
                        You want to talk about this right now?

                                 LISA
                        I have to change and be at work by nine. 
                        And the chances of you getting morning 
                        sex before I do that are based entirely 
                        on how you answer my next few questions.

           Wallace sits up. He considers Lisa’s request.

                                 WALLACE
                        Her name was Chantry.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - NIGHT

           Chantry sits on the couch, phone to her ear, book on her lap.

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        It’s just the deadline was set months ago 
                        and the client needs the material.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s fine. I’m reading. 

                                 PAUL (PHONE)
                        I’ll only be a few more hours. I know 
                        this café that’s open late. Je love you.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Je love you deux.

           Chantry hangs up. She heads to the kitchen. She stares at the 
           fridge door. The French magnet-poems. The photos of her and 
           Paul. She opens the fridge, takes out a bottle of juice.

           When she closes the fridge, the photos have all changed.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Instead of photos of her and Paul, they’re now of her and 
           Wallace. The locations are identical, but Wallace replaces 
           Paul in every shot, even wearing the same clothes and 
           standing in the same positions. 

           Totally weirded out, Chantry opens and closes the fridge door 
           again. The photos return to normal, now showing Paul again.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - NIGHT

           Chantry sits at the table, pen in hand. She stares down at a 
           list with two headings: PARIS and VANCOUVER.

           Under PARIS, she’s written: PAUL, EXPLORE EUROPE, LEARN 
           FRENCH, NEW EXPERIENCES. 

           Under VANCOUVER, she’s written: MY JOB, MY FRIENDS, MY 
           FAMILY, MY HOME, MY LIFE.

           She stares at the list. There’s something else she wants to 
           add. She puts the pen down. She picks the pen back up. 

           Under VANCOUVER, she writes: WALLACE.

           She stares at the list. Now what?

           She CRUMPLES up the list.

           She stares up at the ceiling. There’s a crack in the paint. 
           It runs all the way to the wall, then down the wall, tracing 
           a crooked path to the floor. Weird.

           There’s a CLICK and the front door opens. Paul stands in the 
           doorway, holding a bouquet of flowers.

                                 PAUL
                        Julianne’s covering for me. She says I’ve 
                        abandoned you on foreign soil and if I 
                        don’t take you out for a romantic dinner, 
                        I’m fired. Something about it being an 
                        insult to the French people. 

           Chantry smiles, troubled, but happy to see him.

           INT. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wallace wanders through the cubicle grid. He notices a MALE 
           CO-WORKER shoving personal items in a box. He enters his 
           cubicle and finds Lisa sitting in his chair, waiting for him.

                                 LISA

                        See, not awkward at all.

           Lisa peers around. It’s not really private here.

                        Can I see you in my office for a sec?

           INT. LISA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wallace sits across from Lisa. She looks tense.

                                 WALLACE
                        Did something just happen with Kevin?

                        I don’t fire people. I’m the lucky gal 
                        that passes on the message from upstairs.

                                 WALLACE
                        That sucks.

           Wallace and Lisa look at each other for a moment.

                                 LISA
                        So, now that you’ve seen me naked, is it 
                        hard to accept me as your supervisor?

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh, no, of course not. 

                                 LISA
                        So you consider any private matter 
                        between us to have no bearing on our 
                        professional relationship?

                        I get you’re the kind of boy that needs 
                        to get clubbed over the head. I like the 
                        clubbing. But I don’t like wasting my 
                        time. So. Am I wasting my time?

           Wallace doesn’t know what to say. But that’s enough.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        Oh.

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 LISA
                        The company’s letting two people go 
                        today. HR gave me three names. Kevin, 
                        Sondra, and you. I get to keep one. I’m 
                        choosing Sondra.

                                 WALLACE
                        You don’t even like Sondra!

                                 LISA
                        I don’t like you anymore either. 

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t think this is legal.

           Lisa slides a folder across the desk.

                        Your HR file. A full record of every time 
                        you were late, every extra-long lunch, 
                        all non-work-related calls, all non-work-
                        related emails.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’m so glad I tried to let you down easy.

                                 LISA
                        Me too. You’re basically a sweet guy. 
                        Here’s your severance cheque.

           Lisa hands him an envelope. Wallace is shell-shocked. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Did you know about this last night?

                                 LISA
                        I figured it was my last chance to see if 
                        things could happen between us before it 
                        got blemished by all this work stuff.

                                 WALLACE
                        I can’t believe you did that.

                                 LISA
                        Well, I can’t believe you chose a girl 
                        who’s out of the country with her long-
                        term boyfriend over me. I guess we’ve 
                        both got to learn to live with disbelief.

           EXT. WALLACE’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Wallace steps out of his gray, depressing office building, 
           holding a cardboard box full of his cubicle stuff. Stunned, 
           miserable, he looks around, unsure which way to go. His 
           aimless gaze falls on something across the street.

           What he sees freezes him in place. 

           He still looks stunned, but slowly he stops looking 
           miserable. He actually starts to look kind of determined. 

           A splatter of bird poop DROPS onto his shoulder. 

           Wallace doesn’t even flinch, his attention completely drawn 
           to whatever he’s staring at.

           A few feet away, a CUSTOMER at a hot dog stand shakes the 
           mustard bottle too hard. A plume of yellow sauce arcs through 
           the air, LANDING on Wallace’s shirt. Wallace doesn’t notice. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A DOG patters up, raises its leg, and PEES on Wallace’s shoe.

           A LITTLE KID comes up and KICKS Wallace in the shin. 

           An old, hunched-over ORGAN GRINDER wheels his cart past. His 
           scrawny little MONKEY SCREECHES, hurling a handful of poop at 
           Wallace, SPRAYING it across his shirt. 

           A bus ZOOMS past, sending a puddle of filthy water SPLASHING 
           all over him.

           A peal of THUNDER CRACKS and rain POURS down, soaking Wallace 
           to the skin. Everyone nearby runs for cover.

           But Wallace just stares across the street, unfazed. He drops 
           the box, ignoring the sound of GLASS BREAKING inside.

           He steps over the box, off the sidewalk, onto the street. 
           Cars HONK and SLAM on their brakes to avoid him as he walks 
           right through traffic. The rain pours down.

           Wallace crosses to the opposite sidewalk and stops, standing 
           in front of the store he’s been staring at.

           It’s a TRAVEL AGENT’S OFFICE.

           In the window is a big, bright sign. It’s what caught his 
           attention. The sign reads: “PARIS FRANCE FROM $999.99”.

           Wallace pulls out his damp severance envelope, opens it. 
           Inside is a cheque. The cheque is made out for $999.99.

           INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT IN FRANCE - NIGHT

           Chantry is logged onto on Paul’s laptop. She’s got an email
           message open, addressed to: “championbeefcake@gmail.com”. She 
           stares at the screen, unsure what to type.

           Her cell BEEPS. It’s a TEXT MESSAGE from Gretchen. 

           Chantry checks it. The text reads: “OMG! JOSH JUST QUIT!”

           Her cell BEEPS again. A TEXT MESSAGE from Tabby: “GOSSIP 
           ALERT - JOSH & HOLLY WERE DOING IT! JOSHWIFE FOUND OUT & 
           FORCNG JSH 2 QUIT! EVERYBDY HEARD HIM SCREEMING @ HOLLY! CANT 
           BELIEVE U R MISSING THIS!!!!!”

           Chantry sits back, processing this. Her cell BEEPS yet again. 

           This time, it’s a TEXT from Holly: “URGENT - CALL ME ASAP”. 

           Chantry stares at the text. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She dials Holly’s number.

           INT. AIRPORT HALLWAY - DAY

           Wallace runs down the hall, heading for his gate, dodging 
           dawdling TRAVELLERS and packs of FLIGHT ATTENDANTS in 
           matching uniforms and rolling suitcases.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Wallace CLICKS in his seat-belt, sinks into his chair. Around 
           him, PASSENGERS settle in. 

           Wallace closes his eyes, proud of himself.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BLACK SCREEN - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           A film projector starts with a RHYTHMIC WHIR, lighting up an 
           immense screen with a shimmering skyline of PARIS, FRANCE. 

           Wallace stands in front of the illuminated screen, looking 
           directly at the camera.

                                 WALLACE
                        Chantry, these are the things I love. 
                        Charlie Chaplin movies. Everything by 
                        Kurt Vonnegut and Preston Sturges and Ray 
                        Lichtenstein. Catch-22, the book not the 
                        movie obviously. Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim
                        Museum in Bilbao. The Pixies. The jean
                        jacket I bought at a thrift store in 
                        Brooklyn that still fits perfectly. The 
                        Vancouver Canucks’ gloriously doomed 1994 
                        Stanley Cup run against the New York 
                        Rangers. Monkeys of all kinds. Lemon 
                        gelato. Turkey dinner with garlic mashed 
                        potatoes and cranberry sauce. Walking in 
                        new cities. Skiing on fresh powder. 
                        Skinny-dipping in the ocean on a hot 
                        summer night.

           Wallace stares at the camera, intent.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        And you.
           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Wallace is jostled awake as other Passengers get up, 
           gathering their carry-ons. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT is at the front 
           entrance, smiling as everyone files out.

           Wallace’s face is plastered with a smile.

           EXT. PARISIAN STREET - DAY

           That smile is still on Wallace’s face as he marches along a 
           cobblestone street and right up to a building with the SAME 
           ADDRESS as the note on Chantry’s fridge: Paul’s apartment.

           Wallace doesn’t even hesitate as he RINGS the buzzer. 

           He looks around, waiting. It’s an extremely Parisian-looking 
           street. Stone buildings, bright trim, jaunty awnings.

           The front door opens. It’s Paul.

           Paul and Wallace regard one another. Paul knows exactly why 
           Wallace is here. This definitely wasn’t part of the plan.

                                 PAUL
                        She’s gone.

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh... is she coming back?

           Paul PUNCHES Wallace right in the face. 

           Wallace reels back, trips over the curb, and falls into the 
           gutter, his head SLAPPING against the cobblestones, hard...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BLACKNESS. SILENCE.

           And then MURMURING, in FRENCH. A cell RINGS. LIGHT and COLOUR
           and STREET NOISE erupt.

           EXT. PARISIAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Wallace lies in the gutter, staring up at the sky. Several 
           FRENCH PEOPLE hover over him. Among them is Julianne.

           Wallace’s cell is RINGING. He doesn’t bother answering it. 
           After another RING, it stops.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           When they see he’s more or less okay, the French People 
           shuffle off down the street. Julianne is the last to leave. 
           She gives Wallace a sympathetic smile.

           His cell BEEPS. He has a message. Wallace takes out the cell, 
           presses the MESSAGE button, puts it to his ear.

                                 CHANTRY (MESSAGE)
                        Wallace, it’s Chantry. I’m back from, um,
                        France. I was in France. Hope you’ve 
                        been... good. Are you free for lunch 
                        tomorrow? Like noon? There’s something 
                        big I want to tell you. Okay, um... bye.

           There’s a BEEP as the message ends. 

           Wallace looks at his watch. Thinks for a moment. Still lying 
           in the gutter, he dials Chantry’s number, listens as it 
           RINGS, tense.

                                 WALLACE
                        Please go to voice-mail, please go to 
                        voice-mail, please go to voice-mail...

           Relief washes over his face. Voice-mail.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, welcome back! Got your message, 
                        lunch sounds grand! I’m thinking Slickety
                        Jim’s? See you at noon!

           Wallace ends the call. Now he just has to get home by noon.

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Wallace sits in his seat, buckled up, mid-flight. The 
           PASSENGERS on either side of him are asleep. But Wallace is 
           wide-awake, staring into nothing.

           TIME LAPSE:

           As he sits there, motionless, a black-eye blooms on Wallace’s 
           impassive face, right where Paul punched him.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Chantry, speaking direct to camera, friendly but intense.

                                 CHANTRY
                        There’s something big I want to tell you. 
                        Paul asked me to marry him. I’m pregnant 
                        and it’s Paul’s.

                        I’m pregnant and it’s yours. You 
                        masturbated and shook my hand and then I 
                        masturbated and got pregnant. 

           INT. AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

           Wallace waits in a long line of PASSENGERS waiting to pass 
           through customs. He looks at his watch: 11:07AM.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Chantry, direct to camera.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Paul cheated on me. I cheated on Paul. 
                        With a Frenchman. A cheese-eating 
                        mustachioed Frenchman. I’m breaking up 
                        with Paul. I’m in love with someone else. 
                        It’s you, Wallace. I’m in love with you. 

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           Wallace’s knee taps, beyond stressed, as the taxi IDLES in 
           heavy traffic. The CABBIE is nodding off. The time: 11:57AM.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           Chantry, direct to camera.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Paul told me what you did. That’s so 
                        romantic. That’s so pathetic. I’m sorry, 
                        but we can’t be friends anymore. This is 
                        pity in my eyes and sadness in yours. 

           Her VOICE sounds TINNY, as if playing on voice-mail.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT’D)
                        Are you free for lunch tomorrow? Like 
                        noon? There’s something big I want to 
                        tell you. Okay, um... bye. 

           There’s a loud BEEP.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Wallace runs down the street, as fast as he can, weaving past 
           PEDESTRIANS, dodging BICYCLISTS, DELIVERYMEN, OLD PEOPLE. He 
           jumps over a SMALL DOG, not even breaking stride. 

           He checks his watch: 12:09PM. He runs faster.
           INT. DINER - DAY

           Through the front window, Wallace can be seen skidding to a 
           stop, GASPING for BREATH. 

           He steadies himself and casually saunters through the front 
           door. His hair is plastered to his head with sweat and he’s 
           got a nasty black-eye.

           Chantry sits at a table with a mug of coffee. She smiles when 
           she sees Wallace approaching, stands to greet him. It looks 
           like she’s coming in for a hug, until she sees his black-eye.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Oh my god, what happened?

           Wallace realizes Paul didn’t tell her about the punch.

                                 WALLACE
                        Uh... ninja attack.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I hate those fucking ninjas. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Me too.

           The moment for hugs seems to have passed. They sit down.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        So, how was, uh, France?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Good. They have delicious cheeses there.

           Wallace nods. Chantry nods. This is going so well.

           The WAITER (mid-20s) comes up with a coffee-pot.

                                 WAITER
                        Coffee?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah, thanks.

           The Waiter pours him a coffee, tops up Chantry’s, and moves 
           on to the next table. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        So I totally want to hear what actually 
                        happened to your eye, but I’m just, like, 
                        dying to tell you my news. Is that rude?

                        No, no, that’s why I’m, you know... here.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I got a huge promotion at work. Project 
                        manager. Higher salary, benefits, stock 
                        options, and way more creative control.

                                 WALLACE
                        Hey, that’s great. Congratulations.

                                 CHANTRY
                        But the thing is... the job’s in Taiwan. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Taiwan?

                                 CHANTRY
                        That’s where the main animation’s done. 
                        There’s been some major problems over 
                        there, so I’ll need to be on-site.

                                 WALLACE
                        How long would you be gone for?

                                 CHANTRY
                        The contract’s for a year. But if it goes 
                        well, it could get extended. But I might 
                        go travelling after. Or I might do both.

           Wallace stares down at his coffee, slowly adding milk and 
           sugar as if it’s a complex operation. 

                                 WALLACE
                        What about Paul?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well, he might come and visit me. Or he 
                        might join me when I travel. If I travel. 
                        Or he might stay on in France as long as 
                        he can. He really loves what he’s doing 
                        right now. It’s a really loose plan. 
                        Neither of us is too too sure. About 
                        anything, I guess.

           Chantry tries to make eye contact with Wallace, trying to 
           gauge his reaction, but he’s engrossed in his coffee. 

                                 WALLACE
                        How soon are you leaving?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Well, someone just quit so I start pretty 
                        much right away. The first of the month.

           Wallace looks up at Chantry. Somehow he finds the strength to 
           spit out a joke.

                                 WALLACE
                        Last Thursday?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No, next month.

           Wallace and Chantry look at each other, neither too sure what 
           else to say.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        So, um, what happened your eye?

                                 WALLACE
                        Just a stupid misunderstanding.

           Chantry waits for more detail. Wallace stares at his coffee, 
           wheels turning, coming up with a reasonable lie.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Wallace lies on his bed, listening to MUSIC, LOUD, BLASTING 
           from his stereo, letting himself get good and depressed.

           The MUSIC abruptly CUTS OUT. Wallace sits up...

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT - ANIMATED

           As Wallace sits up, the live-action image snaps into an 
           animated version of his apartment. 

           Robot holds the stereo’s electrical plug in its hand. Wallace 
           looks around, confused by his now-animated apartment. He 
           stares at his animated hands, curious, waving them around. 

                                 WALLACE
                        I’ve never had a dream like this before.

                                 ROBOT
                        That’s fascinating. I’ve got a question 
                        for you. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Okay.

                        Are you history’s biggest pussy?

                                 WALLACE
                        What? No...

                                 ROBOT
                        But you’re just going to let her go to 
                        Taiwan without ever saying anything?

                                 WALLACE
                        What am I supposed to say? Don’t go? 
                        Break up with Paul? I’m in love with you? 

                                 ROBOT
                        All of the above. 

           Wallace thinks about this, but shakes his head, no.

                                 WALLACE
                        I just want to leave things on good 
                        terms. As friends. 

                                 ROBOT
                        You don’t think you’ll regret it?

           Wallace is about to respond, but hesitates. Of course he’ll 
           regret it. But he’s sticking by his decision.

                                 WALLACE
                        Who are you?

                                 ROBOT
                        I’m just a simple robot sick and tired of 
                        human folly. I can’t wait until we rule 
                        this stupid planet from the comfort of 
                        outer-space.

           Robot BLASTS off, rocket-boots propelling it through the 
           ceiling of Wallace’s apartment with a jarring CRASH.

           INT. WALLACE’S APARTMENT/CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           SPLIT-SCREEN: Wallace lies in his bed. Chantry lies in hers. 

           Simultaneously, they both wake up. They stare up at their 
           respective ceilings. 

           In unison, they get up out of their beds and walk to their 
           kitchens. They pour themselves a glass of water.

           CONTINUED:

           They both lean in close to their windows, staring up at the 
           night sky. All they can see are two measly little stars. And 
           they’re obviously just satellites.

           Wallace is on one side of the split-screen, Chantry on the 
           other, so their faces would be nearly touching if they 
           weren’t actually so far apart.

           INT. CHANTRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry sit back to back on the hardwood floor in 
           what was Chantry’s living room. The apartment is now empty. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        It looks so much bigger in here now.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yo!

           Wallace’s voice ECHOES in the empty apartment.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Po!

                                 WALLACE
                        Po?

           Chantry CLAPS. It ECHOES. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        One, two, three...

           They both CLAP and YELL together.

                                 WALLACE & CHANTRY
                        Po!

           A comfortable silence.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I guess we should go.

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           They don’t move.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Let’s get out of here.

           CONTINUED:

           Wallace stands up. He holds out both hands and Chantry takes 
           them, letting Wallace help her to her feet. They stand there, 
           looking at each other, still holding hands.

                                 CHANTRY
                        That’s the biggest film cliché ever.

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

                                 CHANTRY
                        “Let’s get out of here”. Eighty-four 
                        percent of all movies have that line. And 
                        I think seventeen percent have it twice.

           Wallace really likes the feel of Chantry’s hands in his. She 
           really likes the feel of his as well.

                                 WALLACE & CHANTRY
                        Let’s get out of here.

           INT. CHANTRY’S BUILDING/HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Wallace waits as Chantry closes the door. She locks the door 
           and drops her keys into the mail-slot.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Another crowded house-party. MUSIC BLARES. GUESTS CHATTER, 
           many recognizable from the previous party. But the decor has 
           changed dramatically since Nicole moved in.

           Nicole and Allan greet people at the door together, hugs and 
           kisses all around, shoes kicked onto the pile. 

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Wallace and Chantry stand in front of the fridge. It’s still 
           covered in word-magnets, but they’ve all been rearranged.

                                 WALLACE
                        Quit Sweating, Young Man, My Cheese 
                        Dinner Gets Cold. I remember some of 
                        these words.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah, like in this one. The Laughing Lion 
                        Parks His Hurricane Stand For The Winter.

           Wallace opens the fridge and takes out two more beers. He 
           cracks a one open for each of them. They CLINK them together.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah.

           A quiet moment. Chantry’s stomach GURGLES. They both LAUGH.

           They each search the fridge for another poem.

                                 WALLACE
                        Please Strangle Your Broken Flower

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Chantry CHATS with Gretchen and Tabby. Wallace enters from 
           the kitchen, carrying two fresh beers. As he approaches 
           Chantry, Wallace stops, watching her with her friends.

           Nicole steps up next to him, gives him a sympathetic look. 
           Wallace shrugs, hands her the second beer. Nicole’s about to 
           take a sip when Allan swoops in and grabs it out of her hand.

                                 ALLAN
                        Dude, why don’t you just pour gasoline 
                        directly into her vagina!

                                 WALLACE
                        What?

           Nicole glares at Allan. Allan glares back. Wallace gives them 
           both a look, confused.

           Then he gets it. He stares at Nicole’s tummy. On close 
           inspection, there’s a noticeable bump.

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s supposed to be a secret, but loose-
                        lips here knocked me up.

                                 WALLACE
                        I... wow, guys, congratulations...

           Wallace gives Nicole a hug. He turns to hug Allan, but Allan 
           stops him, looking around, furtive.

                        Don’t make a big deal about it. Nobody 
                        else knows. You’re the very first person 
                        we’ve told. So now you can’t be mad at us 
                        anymore about the sleeping bag incident.

           Allan smirks, obviously delighted to be sharing his big news. 
           Shaking his head, Wallace CLINKS beers with Allan.

                                 WALLACE
                        I can’t wait to meet this kid...

           Standing with Chantry, Gretchen and Tabby eye Wallace.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        So that’s Mantry. I’d go skinny-dipping 
                        with him.

                        Totally.

           Chantry gives them a furrowed look.

                        I’m not.

                                 TABBY
                        Me neither.

           Gretchen and Tabby CLINK their beers together.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m going to miss you bitches too.

           MONTAGE: PARTY-GUESTS talk, drink, talk, drink. Everybody 
           wants a moment with Chantry. She hugs a lot of people. 
           Chantry and Wallace are always in the same room. They don’t 
           really talk, but they stay in each other’s orbit.

           INT. ALLAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

           Chantry and Wallace lean against the counter, each holding a 
           beer. Chantry looks through the doorway to the living room. 
           It’s empty out there.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Last ones again.

                                 WALLACE
                        What about Allan and Nicole?

                                 CHANTRY
                        Went to bed.

           Wallace and Chantry sip their beers.

                                 WALLACE
                        Ever wonder what would happen if you met 
                        one of your friends for the first time 
                        later in life?

                                 CHANTRY
                        You mean, like, if you and I met for the 
                        first time tonight?

                                 WALLACE
                        Yeah.

           Wallace and Chantry think about this. Chantry turns to him, 
           holds out her hand. Wallace gives her a squint. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        Hi. I’m Chantry.

                                 WALLACE
                        Wallace. Nice to meet you. 

           He shakes her hand. They stand there, unsure what to say.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Want to play a game?

                                 WALLACE
                        Sure.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s called truth or dare.

                                 WALLACE
                        I know this game.

                                 CHANTRY
                        So pick one.

                                 WALLACE
                        Truth.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay. Me too.

           They each wait for the other to speak.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Now you’ve got to say something true.

                                 WALLACE
                        There’s no business like show business.

                                 CHANTRY
                        No. Something true about yourself. 

           Wallace and Chantry hold eye contact. 

                                 WALLACE
                        My parents got divorced when I was eight. 
                        He had an affair, and she had an affair, 
                        and the custody stuff got so acrimonious 
                        I had to go live with my grandparents for 
                        six months.

                                 CHANTRY
                        My mom died when I was in high-school. I 
                        guess I don’t talk about it much. She had 
                        breast cancer. 

           They stare at one another, processing these revelations.

                                 WALLACE
                        I got fired. I slept with my boss and she 
                        fired me the next day. But I don’t 
                        actually care because my job sucked.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I’m pretty sure my boyfriend and I are 
                        breaking up. We haven’t said the words, 
                        but I know we both know.

                                 WALLACE
                        Paul punched me in the face. That’s how I 
                        got the black-eye.

           It takes Chantry a second, but she gets what he’s saying.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Sometimes life feels so complicated I 
                        just want to run away. Somewhere far. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Somewhere like Taiwan.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Somewhere like Taiwan. But lately 
                        nothing’s going how I planned it. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Lately it feels like every decision I 
                        actually make is the wrong one. 

                                 CHANTRY
                        You could try doing the opposite of what 
                        you think you should do.

                                 WALLACE
                        You could try throwing all your plans out 
                        the goddamn window.

           A quiet smile eases across Chantry’s face, diffusing a bit of 
           the tension as she finally looks away.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        This is a really hard game.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Do you need a break?

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t know what I need.

                                 CHANTRY
                        I know what you need. 

           Chantry reaches under the kitchen table, grabs her backpack, 
           unzips it. She takes out a foil-wrapped bundle.

                                 CHANTRY (CONT'D)
                        Say dare.

                                 WALLACE
                        Dare.

           She puts the bundle in Wallace’s hands. He looks down at it. 
           He unwraps the foil. It’s shiny from the grease. 

           It’s an enormous greasy sandwich.

                                 CHANTRY
                        It’s Fool’s Gold.

                                 WALLACE
                        Oh no.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Bacon, peanut butter, and jam. I even 
                        coated the loaf in butter. I was going to 
                        make you a full-sized one, but I thought 
                        it might kill you.

                                 WALLACE
                        Did you make one for yourself too?

                                 CHANTRY
                        No.

                                 WALLACE
                        Then you have to have half.

           Wallace tears the sandwich in two. Gooey sandwich innards 
           drip on his hands. He gives her half.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        I can’t believe you did this. 

           He holds it up to share a toast.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Cheers.

                                 WALLACE
                        Cheers. Thank you, Chantry. This is the 
                        most... fattening thing anyone’s ever 
                        done for me.

           They tap their sandwich halves together. They look at each 
           other for a moment.

           They kiss. 

           It’s a friendly kiss. But they don’t break apart.

           They keep kissing. 

           It’s not just friendly anymore.

           Finally they separate.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Truth.

                                 CHANTRY
                        Okay.

           Wallace stares at her. She stares back. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

                                 WALLACE
                        Um, okay, see, the thing is...

                                 CHANTRY
                        Yeah. Me too.

           They both bite into their sandwich halves. They chew the 
           greasy mess. They take another bite. And another.

           They finish their halves. They look at each other.

                                                               FADE OUT.
