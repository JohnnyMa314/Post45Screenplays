           A HARD RAIN FALLS UPON...

                                     TEXT: ROME, 1521

           EXT. VATICAN CITY - VIA DELLA POSTA - DUSK

           A BOY MESSENGER runs the torch-lit Vatican streets as quickly 
           as his legs can carry him.  

           He crosses the cobbled road, dashing through puddles.  His 
           labored panting does not slow him down.

           INT. VILLA

           We follow the messenger darting down a marbled hallway.  The 
           boy throws open a door, revealing CARDINAL UMBRETTO, a slim, 
           spectacled man, sitting behind his document-covered desk.  He 
           does not even look up to acknowledge the boy.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Yes?

           The boy hands him an envelope.  The cardinal reviews the 
           message.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        Take this to Inquisitor Bernadonis 
                        Vitalo at St. Angelo’s.  Have him 
                        meet me at the Basilica.  
                        Immediately.

           The boy runs off, his feet patter down the long hall.

           The cardinal takes a sullen breath, rising from his seat.  

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        It is finally time.

           He buttons his cassock, his scarlet red sash flows behind him 
           as he walks down the hallway.

           CARA GIACHETTA (30s) steps from one of the doors in her 
           nightgown.  She, as if carved from marble, is the epitome of 
           Italian beauty.  Umbretto passes her without so much as a 
           glance.

                                 CARA
                        What is happening?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Bad things.  Go back to bed.
           INT. PAPAL PALACE - DUSK

           Cardinal Umbretto hurries through the ornate marble passage.  
           Waiting for him is INQUISITOR VITALO.  His sinewy forearms 
           are the only flesh revealed from beneath his cowl.  

           Vitalo drops his hood, taking up Umbretto’s pace.  Vitalo’s 
           pale face is severe at first sight.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I can take care of this without 
                        concerning the Pope.  He would not 
                        need to know.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        There is order here, Vitalo.  And 
                        we will give the appearance of 
                        following it.  

           They draw towards the SOUND of a party. 

           The cardinal opens two large doors to reveal a vast--

           DINING ROOM

           The room is lined by a giant rectangular table where GUESTS 
           chatter, MUSICIANS play and at the end of the table, Pope LEO 
           X sits.  

           The Pope is an overweight man, engrossed in the entertainment 
           and the adulation of his guests.

           The cardinal discreetly takes the Pope’s side.

                                 POPE LEO
                        Umbretto.  Can’t you see I am 
                        entertaining my guests?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Your Grace, I have news that 
                        requires your attention.

           The Pope ignores him, as SERVANTS place a gargantuan cake on 
           the table.  The Pope claps, signaling the next wave of 
           entertainers.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                             (under his breath)
                        Four more churches have been burned 
                        to the ground.  The priests... all 
                        dead.
           The Pope’s disposition quickly changes.

           ANTECHAMBER

           Pope Leo reads the message by the light of a fireplace.  A 
           leaflet attached is titled “95 Theses”.  He crushes the 
           papers, throwing them into the fire.

                                 POPE LEO
                        I thought this was just a drunk 
                        German who would change his mind 
                        after he sobered up.  

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        It has escalated.  These so called 
                        Lutherans... they defy us.

                                 POPE LEO
                        Our money?  Have we been able to 
                        collect?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        The congregations dwindle every 
                        day, afraid to enter our churches.  
                        The sales of indulgences have all 
                        but stopped. 

           The Pope paces.  He looks at Vitalo.

                                 POPE LEO
                        You’ve brought your long arm with 
                        you, Umbretto.  How suggestive.
                        I suppose you’d like to have this 
                        monk dragged here from Germany to 
                        have him scourged in our dungeons?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Make it so, your Holiness, and I 
                        will personally attend to his 
                        inquiry.

                                 POPE LEO
                        That only gives the German people 
                        more reason to despise us.  It 
                        cannot be my face that manufactures 
                        a martyr.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Nor do we have any designs in 
                        making one.

           The Pope makes his way to the door.
                                 POPE LEO
                        Good.  I leave this mess to you, 
                        Umbretto.  I expect success in 
                        cleaning this matter.  Failure... 
                        will not please God.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I understand.

           The Pope returns to his party.

           Umbretto looks out a window.  Rain falls down on the Vatican, 
           cleaning the tiled spires under spotted moonlight.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        This requires delicacy.  The path 
                        must be cleared of this German 
                        Lunatic for a righteous papacy.

           Cardinal Umbretto raises his eyebrow, waiting for Vitalo to 
           continue.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I know an inquisitor from my time 
                        in Spain.  He was once my protege.

           Cardinal Umbretto draws a deep, contemplative breath.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        He must be discreet.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        There is no one who can match his 
                        skills for this sort of task.

           Umbretto opens the window.  A humid air wafts in along with 
           the thrum of rain.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Will he come?  This...

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        His name is Arturo Sarmiento.

           Vitalo reaches out, washing his calloused hands in the rain.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        I was his confessor.  He will come.   
                        I promise. 

           We follow the--
                                               HARD RAIN INTO THE SKY...

                                                       DISSOLVING TO...

           ...rain shrouding a brown, muddied land along the sea.

                                   TEXT: GRANADA, SPAIN

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           A muddied battlefield is littered with BODIES, the GROANING 
           and the MAIMED.  MOORISH SOLDIERS slide as they fight with 
           stumbling SPANIARD FOOTMEN; they are tired.  Some retreat, 
           others continue their wearied battle.

           A WEAK MOOR rests against a low wall catching his breath.  
           The shadow of a man crawls over him.  The Moor notices, but 
           takes no action.  Instead he cries.

                                 SARMIENTO (O.S.)
                        Pick up your sword.

           The Moor loosely grabs his sword.  The act is just formality.

           ARTURO Sarmiento (late 30s), clad in an open tattered 
           priest’s habit, boiled leather armor beneath, pistols hanging 
           inside like the ribs of a beast.  Dark hair highlights the 
           rings around his desperate eyes.

           With merciless resolve, Sarmiento drives the sword through 
           the soldier and into the ground.  Sarmiento searches the 
           landscape for the next victim.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (under his breath)
                        Forgive me, soldier.

           A whistle chortles, Sarmiento finds his protege, PINTADO, 
           alerting him.  Sarmiento pulls his sword from the corpse, TWO 
           ARMORED SOLDIERS bravely run at him.  

           Pintado and Sarmiento run side by side over the uneven earth, 
           splitting up as Pintado takes on another fight.

           Pintado is wily young warrior, shoulder slung with a long 
           rifle, sword in hand.

           Sarmiento launches overtop a nearby wall, disappearing.

           The two soldiers blindly hurtle the wall, and have just 
           enough time to see the smoke rising from Sarmiento’s trained 
           pistols--
           BAM! BAM! They hit the ground, skidding to a halt.

           An arrow darts into Sarmiento’s side.  Sarmiento plucks it 
           from his robe without so much as a wince.  He traces the 
           arrow to--

           TWO MOORISH ARCHERS peeking around a bluff recognize him and 
           run for it.

           Chasing them like a greyhound, Sarmiento preps one of his 
           matchlock pistols with a burning wick.  

           Sarmiento muzzles the matchlock from the wind... and tags an 
           archer in the leg.  As Sarmiento runs past the limp soldier.  

           Pintado runs atop a outlying ridge, finishing the limping 
           soldier with a long shot from his rifle.

           The other soldier continues to run, screaming a warning to 
           his comrades:

                                 MOORISH SOLDIER
                             (in Arabic)
                        The Mace!  The Mace!

           The soldier is quieted by a shot through the neck.

           Sarmiento lies the man down, taking a dagger from the 
           soldier’s sheath.  

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Go easy.  Please.  

           Sarmiento steadies the bloodied soldier like a mother would a 
           child, sliding the knife between his collar bones. 

           The soldier becomes still.  Sarmiento closes the man’s eyes.

           A Moorish king, NASIR, steps into view of Sarmiento, drawing 
           his sword.  The king’s ENTOURAGE stands back.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I will make my request again.  
                        Leave this place.  These monks want 
                        nothing other than peace.

                                 KING NASIR
                        You have claimed what is not yours.  
                        For seven hundred years this land 
                        prospered under our rule.  This 
                        land shall return to the Muslims, 
                        if it is Allah’s will.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        My God is not willing.

                                 KING NASIR
                        We have the same God, Christian.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Then your God is not willing 
                        either.

           The king strikes at him with precision.  Sarmiento barely 
           catches up to the blow to block it, cutting his hand.

           Sarmiento, respecting Nasir’s ability, steps back.  The king 
           levies a battery of strikes with incredible speed.  Sarmiento 
           counters ineffectively.  PRINCE NASIR (Mid 20s) steps from 
           the gathering crowd to intervene in the fight.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        We have lost too many today, 
                        father.  Must we lose you, too?  
                        End this battle.

                                 KING NASIR 
                        Let your orders be heeded when I am 
                        dead.

           The prince, shamed by his father’s words, steps back.  The 
           king turns back to Sarmiento.

                                 KING NASIR (cont’d)
                        I apologize.

           Sarmiento nods, never letting his guard down.  The king nods 
           back, then launches at Sarmiento.  

           He knocks Sarmiento off balance, removing Sarmiento’s sword.  
           Sarmiento unexpectedly slips down an muddy incline, giving 
           Nasir the higher ground.  

           The king lunges at him, but Sarmiento takes advantage of his 
           lowered position, driving his now unsheathed dagger into the 
           king’s ribs.  

           The king slides face down in the mud, pushed by the momentum 
           of his final attack.  Sarmiento crawls to him and turns him 
           over.  He cleans Nasir’s surprised face.  The prince runs to 
           his father.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Let your men save you.  Do not let 
                        this happen to your son.
           Nasir feels his wound.

                                 KING NASIR
                        This was my statement to my people. 
                        I am to die here, fighting my 
                        father’s war.

           The King aggressively wrangles the prince in close, peeling 
           his eyes from Sarmiento long enough to say...

                                 KING NASIR (cont’d)
                             (to prince)
                        Do not die in the mud, at the hands 
                        of thieves.

           He mouths a few more words, then fades.  The boy cries.  
           Sarmiento begins to pray over Nasir’s body.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        What are you doing?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Praying for your father.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Which way is East?

           Sarmiento points the direction.  The prince turns, grabbing 
           Sarmiento shoulder, indicating for him to turn East as well.

                                 PRINCE NASIR (cont’d)
                        Then pray in that direction, so it 
                        may aid his passage to heaven.

           The prince bows down and weeps.  From over a wall vaults 
           PINTADO, drawing his sword to attack the prince, when 
           Sarmiento stops him.  

           Pintado, confused and angered by the break in battle, 
           reluctantly heeds Sarmiento’s command.

           The prince rises, looking down on Sarmiento.

                                 PRINCE NASIR (cont’d)
                        I must take my father back so he 
                        may be buried properly.  But my 
                        people... they will want this 
                        avenged.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I will expect to see more of your 
                        people then.
           The prince signals the entourage.  They lift the king’s body 
           from the mud, and leave quietly.  Pintado comes over to 
           Sarmiento.

                                 PINTADO
                        What was that?  You let them leave?  
                        I could have finished him off.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Your questions take the tone of 
                        impudence.  We are done for today.

                                 PINTADO
                        And what of tomorrow?  If it does 
                        not stop?  As it didn’t stop the 
                        day before?

           The muddied Sarmiento rises from the ground and walks away.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Pray that it ends.

                                 PINTADO
                        Don’t be naive, Sarmiento.  You 
                        speak like a man who doesn’t have 
                        blood on his hands.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I speak like a man who has seen 
                        enough blood to fill an ocean.

           EXT. CARTHUSIAN MONASTERY - DAY

           The rain continues to pour down on Sarmiento as he walks 
           towards the walled monastery’s gates.  The high monastery 
           walls reveal the age.

           His head slightly hung, too proud to trudge, too tired to 
           walk tall.  Pintado walks behind him, staring with a low brow 
           at Sarmiento’s back.

           Sarmiento looks at his hands... caked with soil and blood.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (praying to himself)
                        Dear Lord.  Forgive me for what I 
                        have done.

           Pintado walks past Sarmiento.

                                 PINTADO
                        Open the gates.
           From atop the monastery wall, a SENTRY sees the men 
           approaching.  A moment later the gates open.

           EXT. MONASTERY COURTYARD

           Rain pours down into the walled village.  The monastery is 
           rustic and worn.  Muddied paths wind around patchwork hovels, 
           which all surround the Spanish church in the center.

           Sarmiento and Pintado walk into the village, parting ways.

           Sarmiento’s son, IGNACIUS (5) plays in the rain with BROTHER 
           BATIZ, a short, gentle barefoot monk.  They stomp through the 
           water playfully.

           Sarmiento spots Ignacius playing.  Watching for a moment, he 
           releases a long breath, focusing on his son’s joy.

           Ignacius spots the tired Sarmiento walking into town, 
           breaking out into a run towards him.

           Ignacius throws his arms around Sarmiento.  Sarmiento 
           envelops the boy in his arms.

                                 IGNACIUS
                        Papi.

           The boy doesn’t care that his father is covered in the grime 
           of the battlefield.  Sarmiento, however, does notice the 
           uncleanliness of his hands.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Go clean yourself before supper.

           Ignacius complies innocently, running away, splashing through 
           puddles as he runs indoors.

           Brother Batiz walks over to Sarmiento, taking his sword and 
           satchel from his shoulders.  

           Brother Batiz notices a wound on his back, stopping Sarmiento 
           in his walk to dab the wound with some of his Chartreuse. 

           Sarmiento snaps out of his trance, grabbing a missalette and 
           pencil.  He flips through to a clean page.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (trying to see the wound)
                        How long?

           Brother Batiz measures the wound from the arrow with his 
           finger, indicating it’s length to Sarmiento.
           Sarmiento writes an entry about the wound as Brother Batiz 
           dabs the cut.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Six men today, brother.  It was my 
                        hand that stilled them.

           Sarmiento closes the missalette, continues walking.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        And I can barely remember their 
                        faces.

           INT. REFECTORY - EVENING

           The monks congregate to eat their rustic supper under candle 
           light.  The silence is broken by the muted contact of wood 
           utensils.

           Ignacius sits across from Sarmiento at the end of a table, 
           eating quietly.

           Sarmiento watches his son eat, motionless, hands lying on the 
           table.

           Ignacius puts his spoon down, tracing his small finger along 
           a old scar on his father’s hand.

                                 IGNACIUS
                        Did this hurt?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Sometimes, my son, it is best not 
                        to remember.

           Sarmiento pulls his hand away, picking up his spoon, 
           Ignacius, copying his father, does the same, continuing his 
           meal.

           Sarmiento watches Ignacius contemplatively before he begins 
           to eat.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - MORNING

           Sarmiento and Pintado silently stalk through a thicket, 
           paralleling a battle between Moors and Spaniards in the 
           muddied fields below.  The humidity hangs in the air, 
           Sarmiento and Pintado drip with sweat.
                                 PINTADO
                        There he is.

           Pintado crouches down, pointing beyond the battle.

           In the distance, A MOORISH GENERAL watches on from the rear 
           of his CAVALRY.

           Sarmiento squints, trying to make out Pintado’s query.  
           Pintado sees Sarmiento struggling to see the target.

                                 PINTADO (cont’d)
                        Is it that you don’t want to fight 
                        anymore?  Or is it that you cannot 
                        see what you’re fighting?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am looking to end a fight.  

           Sarmiento grits his teeth, shaking his head slightly as he 
           continues to move through the thicket.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        To take the first available shot 
                        may not always be the best one.

           INT. MONASTERY - MORNING

           Brother Batiz looks out his window, to see a PLATOON of SWISS 
           GUARD entering the monastery grounds.

           BATTLEFIELD

           Sarmiento guides the impatient Pintado through the thicket.

                                 SARMIENTO 
                        His weakness may not be evident if 
                        you take him on from the obvious 
                        angle, where he may move or run...

           MONASTERY

           Brother Batiz sees one of the SOLDIERS pulling a child out 
           from a doorway.  The Swiss guard entering all the buildings, 
           kicking up a commotion.  They are taking all the children.  

           BATTLEFIELD

           Sarmiento and Pintado crawl on their bellies, under a row of 
           felled trees, through the mud.  Pintado is clearly unhappy 
           with getting filthy, where Sarmiento thinks nothing of it.
                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Or worse, attack, only to have your 
                        defense lowered for him to return 
                        the favor with dire consequence.

           MONASTERY

           Brother Batiz runs frantically down a corridor, throwing open 
           a door.  Ignacius rises from his bed.

           BATTLEFIELD

           Sarmiento and Pintado crawl a short distance further, rising 
           to a crouch, moving silently behind a pile of rocks. 

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Better to strike from where he does 
                        not suspect he is vulnerable.  

           Sarmiento peeks his head over the outcrop, pointing at a 
           superiour angle on the Moorish General.

           MONASTERY

           A SWISS GUARSMAN throws open the door, to find Brother Batiz 
           pulling Ignacius behind him.

           BATTLEFIELD

           Pintado unslings his rifle, readying the powder and balast 
           quickly so he can take aim.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        It’s where your opponent doesn’t 
                        expect to be hit that you end a 
                        fight before it ever starts.

           MONASTERY

           Brother Batiz is tossed to the ground with a punch, the guard 
           lurches towards Ignacius.  Right before he grabs the boy--

           BATTLEFIELD

           BOOM!  Pintado takes the shot.  Pintado grins from ear to 
           ear.

           Sarmiento’s face becomes long and still, watching young 
           Pintado revel in his handiwork.  Without taking a look at 
           Pintado’s results, Sarmiento wades back into the mud, under 
           the felled trees.
           EXT. MONASTERY COURTYARD - DAY 

           Sarmiento walks in to find PEASANT FAMILIES moaning in agony.  
           He quickens his step to find Brother Batiz slumped on a 
           bench, bruised, beaten, with blood running from his nose.

           Brother Batiz makes eye contact with Sarmiento.  Sarmiento 
           sees the tears welling up in the monks eyes.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Ignacius!

           The ABBOT of the Monastery comes out, only to have Sarmiento 
           shoves him aside as he runs into the--

           INT. CORRIDOR

           Sarmiento dashes down the hallway, throwing open the door to 
           his--

           DORMITORY

           The modest room has been tossed.  Ignacius is nowhere to be 
           found.  The abbot comes to the doorway.

                                 ABBOT
                        They took all the childre--

           Sarmiento grabs the abbot, forcing him against the door.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Who?

           Brother Batiz tries to pull Sarmiento from the Abbot.

                                 ABBOT
                        The Swiss Guard, I tried to stop 
                        them but it was ordered by the High 
                        Inquisitor of Rome.

           Sarmiento’s grip slackens, releasing the abbot.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Rome?

                                 ABBOT
                        Yes, to Rome is where they said 
                        their were going.
           Sarmiento grabs a sack, putting some items inside.  Pulling a 
           heavy case from below a bed, Sarmiento reveals gun powder, a 
           set of fine pistols, a sack of ballasts.  He takes a SIMPLE 
           WOOD CRUCIFIX from Ignacius’ bedpost, hanging it around his 
           neck.

           Brother Batiz pulls a sack out from below his bed, packing an 
           extra robe, and some corked Chartreuse.

                                 SARMIENTO 
                        This is not your fight.

           Brother Batiz swigs his open bottle, corking it and placing 
           it in the sack.  His face a near scowl, he nods to Sarmiento.  

           Sarmiento pats Brother Batiz on the back, more to reassure 
           himself than the monk.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        To Rome then, brother.  I know a 
                        man there who may help me.

           EXT. CARTHUSIAN MONASTERY - DAY

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz prepare their horses for travel, 
           when Pintado walks over to Sarmiento, pressed to speak to 
           him.

                                 PINTADO
                        What is this I hear from the abbot?  
                        You are off to Rome without me?
                        This monk sacrificed nothing, and 
                        yet he rides with you?  Was it not 
                        I who fought on those battlefields 
                        along your side?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Consider the risk if someone does 
                        not stay here to protect the 
                        monastery.  You must await the 
                        Spanish reinforcements.

                                 PINTADO
                        You are not the only important 
                        person here, Sarmiento.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I need you here, my friend.  What 
                        is important is that I am doing 
                        what is needed.  I served Spain 
                        when I was asked, I fought here, 
                        with you, because I was asked.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARMIENTO (cont'd)
                        You should do what is asked of you, 
                        and not concern yourself with what 
                        you deserve.

                                 PINTADO
                        I have toiled here just the same as 
                        you.  But you keep me from the 
                        honor of going to Rome.

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz mount their horses.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I do not want this “honor” that has 
                        been given to me, my friend.  Nor 
                        should you.

           Sarmiento rides off.  Brother Batiz follows.  Pintado is left 
           hanging on Sarmiento’s last words.  Sarmiento’s jaw is 
           clinched tightly.

           MONTAGE

           -through the EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE over the Spanish mountains.  
           They ride on cobbled roads, dirt paths; through brush and 
           Spanish sand.

           -they wait out a hard rain under trees.

           -Sarmiento fixates on a GROUP OF CHILDREN who play along the 
           road as they ride past.

           -the ride through fields where PEASANTS farm.

           -at night, Brother Batiz and Sarmiento sit away from a 
           PILGRIMAGE’S camp fire, keeping to themselves.

           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE - VILLAGE - DAY

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz enter a village under gloomy 
           skies.  The muddied streets are motionless, the buildings 
           dormant, the sounds of life missing.  

           They ride past a YOUNG PEASANT GIRL sitting slouched at her 
           doorway.

           Sarmiento dismounts and kneels next to her, lifting her head 
           to find black boils dotting her neck.  He signals to Brother 
           Batiz to stay on his horse.  They cover their mouths and 
           noses.
                                 SARMIENTO
                             (showing the boils to 
                              Brother Batiz)
                        Black death.  Continue.  I will 
                        meet you at the east gate.

           Brother Batiz rides on.  Sarmiento looks into the girl’s 
           eyes.  She is in a groggy, zombified state.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Where is everyone?

           Her lips move slowly, trying to speak, but no words come out.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Your family?

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Forty days--

           She gags on her saliva.  Sarmiento pushes the door behind her 
           open, taking a look inside.

           INT. SMALL HOME

           The opened door illuminates a BODY, ripe from decomposition, 
           open sores long since dried.  The only sign of life: flies 
           festering near her dead eyes.  

           Sarmiento takes out his benedictional and invokes a short 
           prayer.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Forty days quarantine.

           Sarmiento tries to pick the girl up to move her, but she 
           struggles to stay put.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        M--
                             (coughs)
                        Mother...

           Sarmiento says nothing.  She touches his robe and gathers 
           energy to say something.

                                 YOUNG GIRL (cont’d)
                        God does not answer my prayers.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        I have been in His service all my 
                        life, and He has not answered my 
                        prayers, either.

           Sarmiento tries to leave, but she holds his robe tight, 
           keeping him from rising.  She locks her gaze on the pistols 
           beneath his robe.

           Sarmiento pries at her fingers, but she channels all her 
           strength into her grip.  She stares into his eyes, then 
           suggestively looks back at his pistols.  

           He continues to try to remove her hand.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (almost begging the child)
                        No.  Please, no.

           EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE

           Brother Batiz waits outside the village, standing next to his 
           horse.  Ankle-deep in mud, he mucks over to a patch of grass 
           to wipe his feet.

           The SOUND of a pistol blast startles Brother Batiz and his 
           horse.  After a moment, a stone-faced Sarmiento rides out of 
           the village gate.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        No more stops.  The righteous be 
                        damned.

           Sarmiento rides past Brother Batiz, who mounts his steed to 
           follow.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ROME - DAY

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz ride into Rome.  They marvel at 
           the rising, bustling Renaissance city.  

           VATICAN CITY

           CONSTRUCTION WORKERS scale the scaffolding in the distance; 
           marble stones are pulleyed upwards, as if in orbit around the 
           monumental structure being built: the Basilica of St. 
           Peter’s.
           INT. APOSTOLIC LIBRARY

           Sarmiento sits on a bench alone.  He looks small amongst 
           large tapestries, columns, and sculptures that fill the 
           immense marbled space.

           Cara, carrying her workload, emerges from a doorway, and sees 
           Sarmiento.  She squints as she looks over his rough exterior.  
           Her dark hair blends seamlessly with the dark corners of the 
           library, as if she were painted into the room.

                                 CARA
                        You’re not from here.

           When she notices his scarred hands, he self consciously hides 
           them in his robe.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am unclean from my travel.  I 
                        apologize.

                                 CARA
                        Who are you here to see?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am looking for Inquisitor 
                        Bernadonis Vitalo.

                                 CARA
                             (nodding knowingly)
                        I see.  You were sent here so I 
                        could examine you.  Cardinal 
                        Umbretto believes I have good 
                        judgement of character.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The Cardinal?  I wasn’t aware a 
                        line of judges awaited me.

                                 CARA
                        The Vatican provides judgement 
                        liberally.  I am Cara Giachetta,  
                        the literary censor for the 
                        Cardinal.

           He rises from the bench, offering his hand.  She feels his 
           rough hands.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        You are not here for academic 
                        reasons, I suppose.
           Sarmiento pulls his hand away.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        A woman working in the church.  
                        Your position does not come without 
                        it’s favors... I suppose.

           Cara, insulted, steps away from Sarmiento.

                                 CARA
                        There is enough trouble looming 
                        here as it is.  If you’ve come to 
                        create more, I’d advise you to 
                        return to wherever you are from.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Where is Vitalo?  I don’t have time 
                        to play games.

           As she walks away...

                                 CARA
                        Well, make time.  You are in Rome, 
                        the holy city.

           FROM AN INTERIOR BALCONY...

           Inquisitor Vitalo, Cardinal Umbretto and his RETINUE covertly 
           watch Cara walk away from Sarmiento.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Cara doesn’t like him.  A bad omen.  
                        And he is smaller than I thought. 
                        Underwhelming.  I don’t need a 
                        defrocked priest chasing a monk.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Trust me.  Leave him amongst the 
                        literati long enough, and he’ll 
                        begin persecuting people out of 
                        sheer frustration.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        So this is the famed “Mace of God”.

           Umbretto signals Vitalo, who points to one of Swiss pikesman, 
           ARMANNO (20s).  His young eyes are eager to please.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                             (to Armanno)
                        How many years in service?
                                 ARMANNO
                        Three, sir.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        And in that time, did they not 
                        teach you to bar transients?

           Vitalo ticks his head towards Sarmiento, the “transient”.

                                 ARMANNO
                        I will see to it.

           Armanno leaves to inquire.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Watch what this underwhelming man 
                        can do.

           ON THE FLOOR BELOW...

           Sarmiento, seated impatiently, is approached by Armanno.

                                 ARMANNO
                        What business brings you here?

           Sarmiento doesn’t respond as he barely peeks up at the 
           pikesman.  

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I await an audience, nothing more.

           Armanno notices he’s carrying a sword, and defensively wields 
           his weapon.

                                 ARMANNO
                        You are the Pope’s presence, disarm 
                        yourself.

           Sarmiento rises, removes his sword and raises his hand.  When 
           Armanno sees the battery of pistols and knives in his robe, 
           he shoves Sarmiento against the wall.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am here to see Inquisitor 
                        Bernadonis Vitalo--

                                 ARMANNO
                        Silence!

           Another GUARD joins the commotion.  Armanno tries to pull the 
           pistols off Sarmiento.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        They are slung on, you can’t pull 
                        them off--

           Armanno belts Sarmiento on the back of the head with the 
           pole.  Sarmiento grits his teeth in anger, touching the new 
           cut on his scalp.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I don’t think you’ll want to try to 
                        do that again.

                                 ARMANNO
                        Shut your mouth, beggar.

           Armanno shoves him again, but this time, Sarmiento presses 
           himself off the wall, shoving back into him.

           In one motion, Sarmiento grabs the pike, turning the weapon 
           until Armanno can no longer hold it without breaking his 
           wrists.

           Before there’s time to react, Sarmiento sweeps Armanno from 
           his feet, poking the butt of the pike into his solar-plexus, 
           knocking the wind from him.

           The other guard charges Sarmiento, sword drawn.  Sarmiento 
           notices...

           TWO MORE GUARDS running across the foyer.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (praying under his breath)
                        God, please, stay my hand...

           Sarmiento backs up, batting away slices from the fervent 
           guard.

           The guard stabs wildly.  Sarmiento uses the opportunity to 
           grab his wrist, slamming him in the face.

           Sarmiento disarms the guard, arm locking him, holding the 
           sword to his neck.  As Armanno rises, Sarmiento hits him in 
           the chest again with the heel of his boot.

           WATCHING ABOVE...

           Cardinal Umbretto nods pensively.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I’ve seen enough.  He will do.  
                        Stop him from spilling blood in 
                        here.  The marble will stain.
                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Of course.  Shall I bring him to 
                        you?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I’ll meet him at St. Angelo’s.

           Inquisitor Vitalo leaves.

           ON THE LIBRARY FLOOR...

           ...the two other guards close on Sarmiento, who tosses the 
           restrained man at them.  They catch him, turning back to 
           Sarmiento...

           Only to find him pointing two pistols at their heads.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        God wasn’t listening to my prayer.  
                        Perhaps you will.  Where... 
                             (pulling the hammers back)
                        Is Inquisitor Vitalo?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        You can’t help your nature, can you 
                        Sarmiento.
                             (to the guards)
                        Stand down.

           The guards do not listen.  Vitalo smacks the hand of one of 
           the guards.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        Lower those before you get yourself 
                        killed.  This Spaniard is a guest 
                        of mine.

           Sarmiento kneels before Vitalo, kissing his hand.  Vitalo 
           taps him to rise, and gives Sarmiento a hug.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Brother Vitalo.  I am glad to see 
                        you.

           Armanno slowly rises, giving a dirty side glance to Vitalo as 
           the two men walk past him.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Divine providence delivers us 
                        another union.  I am surprised to 
                        find you in Rome.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont'd)
                        Last I heard, you were protecting 
                        monks from an invasion?  From 
                        soldier to priest to soldier again.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes... I apologize again, brother, 
                        for leaving your side.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        No, no matter.  You penance 
                        continues to play out, accordingly.  
                        But I am glad to see you 
                        nevertheless.  What brings you 
                        here?

           Sarmiento bites his lips, trying to find the words.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The monastery was raided by the 
                        Swiss Guard, in the name of the 
                        inquisition.  The children were 
                        taken.  I don’t know why.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Spain is still awash in moorish 
                        bastards, is it not?  

           Sarmiento nods soberly.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont'd)
                        Yes, they are here in Rome.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        There was a boy amongst them, 
                        Ignacius.  Can you help me get him 
                        back?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        You came all the way from your war 
                        in Spain for this?  What difference 
                        does the boy make to you?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        He was my servant boy.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Indeed.  Those children are fine, 
                        Sarmiento, I assure you, nothing 
                        has been done to them.  But I have 
                        no sway over this.  If I were to 
                        release the boy, it would only 
                        raise the suspicions of the other 
                        inquisitors.

                        And you know as well as I the 
                        dangers of a suspicious inquisitor.

           Vitalo rubs his chin, thinking.  Sarmiento watches him with 
           intently.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        There is recourse.  Cardinal 
                        Umbretto can rectify your dilemma 
                        with the stroke of a pen.  I 
                        believe I can arrange a meeting.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Thank you brother.  You are a 
                        blessing upon this boy.

           Vitalo stops Sarmiento.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Play the innocent with the 
                        Cardinal, I invite you to.  But do 
                        not play me for the fool.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Brother, you are many things, but 
                        you are no fool.

           Vitalo continues walking.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        And of those things, I am still 
                        your confessor.  Meeting the 
                        Cardinal will remind you what 
                        sacrifice looks like.

           INT. VILLA - DAY

           Cara freshens herself in a bowl of water held by a SERVANT, 
           when the Cardinal comes in to see her.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        How goes your work, my dear?

                                 CARA
                        Aren’t you going to ask me if I met 
                        the stranger in the library?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Brisk tonight.  No pleasantries?

                                 CARA
                        If your dog Vitalo summoned that 
                        man, he will come to no good.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Do not worry about Vitalo’s 
                        dealings.  A hard cleaning is 
                        needed for the worst stains.  That 
                        is what he is good for.

           Cara sifting through some papers, pulling out...

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                             (reading the title)
                        The ninety-five Theses.  Yes, I 
                        know of it.  Recommend it as 
                        heretical and move on.

                                 CARA
                        It is why that brute is here.

           The Cardinal crushes the paper, throwing it to the floor.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Nothing stays secret in the 
                        Vatican.  You are making a mistake 
                        if you intend to kill your way out 
                        of the problems in Germany--

           The Cardinal snaps a slap across Cara’s face.  The servant 
           tenses.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Read your books and live plushly.  
                        I keep the walls standing in the 
                        Vatican.  I govern Vitalo, and he 
                        will govern his.  Do not concern 
                        yourself with what happens outside 
                        of how you wash and what counsel 
                        you keep.

           The Cardinal whisks his hand through the servant’s bowl.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        You could easily be in a nunnery.  
                        I hear she who is not first in line 
                        for the bowl is never clean.

           Cara turns her head away from Umbretto, hiding her contempt.  
           He gently caresses her back.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        I am off to make the kind of 
                        decisions that keep you out of that 
                        line.  Don’t wait up for me.
           After he leaves, Cara dismisses her servant.  She pulls on 
           her boots.

           EXT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - DAY

           A carriage runs into the thick walled, intimidating fortress 
           that straddles the Tiber river.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS

           Vitalo casually steps down the deep, torch-lined stairwell, 
           Sarmiento following behind.  

           The sound of rope straining, shackles clanking, the moans of 
           those begging to die echo throughout the--

           DUNGEON

           The wrought iron bars reflect a hellish orange from the 
           torches.  Sarmiento follows behind, looking at the beaten and 
           emaciated PRISONERS behind the bars.

           The prisoners are from all walks of life: Romans, Jews, 
           Saxons and Moors... all have crossed the church, all have 
           been condemned.

           Vitalo and Sarmiento stop at the last cell.

           Inside, a few CHILDREN, passed out or cowering in the 
           corners, keep away from Cardinal Umbretto.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        May I present the Cardinal.

           The Cardinal puts his hands through the bars.  Sarmiento 
           kisses his ring, all the while searching the small faces for 
           Ignacius.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        These children, Vitalo... this is 
                        barbaric.  Give them food once a 
                        day, at the least.
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        They are too young to understand 
                        their guilt.  You know this better 
                        than I, as this was once your 
                        trade.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Where is Ignacius?
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I am not a cruel man, Sarmiento.  I 
                        derive no pleasure from hurting 
                        children.  But when the Lord’s work 
                        is stifled, I must put my 
                        leniencies aside to do what is 
                        right.  Which is why you are here.  
                        To make things right.  

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        The boy, he is about four?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Five.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Born when you were in the Order.  
                        And you left shortly thereafter.  
                        Tell me... the boy’s skin is more 
                        olive than a typical Spaniard.  The 
                        bastard son of a Moor.  Five years 
                        old.  Left in the care of the most 
                        reckless man I have ever known.  
                        How did this come to pass?

           Sarmiento averts the Cardinal’s stare, looking at Vitalo 
           instead.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Get on with it.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        You know your offense.  A blasphemy 
                        such as yours has a heavy penalty.  
                        You have defiled your service as a 
                        priest, as a Catholic, as a 
                        Spaniard--

           Umbretto raises his hand, cutting off Vitalo’s driving 
           accusations.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        “The Mace of God.”

                                 SARMIENTO
                        A taunt the Moors gave me.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        A badge of your boldness, no doubt. 
                        But you do not have the courage to 
                        admit the boy is your son.

           Sarmiento says nothing.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        No matter.  He is innocent of our 
                        messes.  But there must be a 
                        penance for this crime against God.  
                        Will you pay?  Or would you rather 
                        the boy pay?

           Sarmiento’ eyes well up with tears, but his face remains 
           stoic.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (quietly)
                        Where is he?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Would you believe me if I said I 
                        understand your plight?  I am human 
                        enough to imagine the weight of 
                        your pain.  It eats you.  You are 
                        tired?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Of the struggle.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Why did you not run?   So no one 
                        could find you or the boy?  Why 
                        fight?

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (searches for words)
                        My whole life I have sought 
                        salvation, a sign... I fear if I do 
                        not fight, He will not answer my 
                        prayers.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Let me answer then, and ease your 
                        worries.

           FROM THE SPIRAL STAIRWELL...

           Cara covertly listens to the meeting.  A PORTLY GUARD walks 
           up behind her, grabbing her arm.

                                 PORTLY GUARD
                        What are you doing without escort?
           He tries to pull her, but she yanks her arm away angrily.

                                 CARA
                        Unhand me.  You don’t know who 
                        keeps me.  

           The guard is unsure who has the upper-hand now.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Unless you want to hang for 
                        touching me, you would be wise not 
                        to mention your name.  

           She turns back to listen.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        You are my escort.  Now, quiet 
                        yourself.  And mention nothing of 
                        my presence to anyone.  Or else.

           The portly guard is speechless, taking her side, as ordered.

           IN THE DUNGEON...

           The Cardinal produces a writ.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        This bull absolves you and any of 
                        your offspring of any wrong doing.  
                        Ignacius will be baptized here, and 
                        you will both be free to go.

           Sarmiento suspiciously eyes both the men.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I thought the Pope was the only one 
                        who could dictate bulls...

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        The honor of papacy is... 
                        temporary, at best.  But you are 
                        assured this will be ratified by 
                        the standing Pope when the time is 
                        right.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        And the price...

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        There is a curse upon Germany, 
                        Sarmiento.  Have you ever heard of 
                        the monk Martin Luther?
                                 SARMIENTO
                        No.

           Cardinal Umbretto gently pats a CHILD as he exits the cell.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Good.  Vitalo will give you the 
                        details.  But know your prayer has 
                        been answered, Sarmiento.  On this 
                        fateful day, I have truly made you 
                        the Mace of God.

           The cardinal comes over to him, making the sign of the cross 
           over his head.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        May the Lord be with you on this 
                        mission.  Much depends on it.

           The cardinal offers his ring to Sarmiento...

           Sarmiento snatches his hand pulling the cardinal close.  
           Vitalo pulls a knife on Sarmiento, leveling it with 
           lightening speed under his throat.

           But Sarmiento doesn’t care.  Nor does the Cardinal as he 
           smiles off Sarmiento’s threat.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (restrained)
                        The boy.  Not one lash.  Not one 
                        torment by anyone--

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Release him, or I will sever you--

           Vitalo cuts into Sarmiento’s skin, pressing him tensely.  But 
           Sarmiento doesn’t budge.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        The boy will be treated as if he 
                        were my own son.  You have my word.

           Umbretto nods to Vitalo, who reluctantly withdraws his blade.

           Sarmiento releases the Cardinal, finally kissing his ring.

           As the Cardinal exits.  He thinks he sees Cara.  But when he 
           passes where Cara was spying, she is no longer there.

           Vitalo sheaths his knife, stepping away from Sarmiento, 
           shaking his head.
                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        You are not here for your boy any 
                        longer, Sarmiento.  You are here 
                        for the church.  Keep that in mind 
                        and all will be delivered as 
                        promised.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Then let me deliver.  What is this 
                        Luther’s offense?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        His followers burn our churches, 
                        terrorize our faithful.  He has 
                        scoffed at all advances to recant 
                        his blasphemies.  He seeks to 
                        destroy the church in Germany.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You brought me here for this.  A  
                        monk.  Why not send the Swiss Guard 
                        to arrest him?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        We are not starting a war.  We are 
                        hunting a drunk, a loudmouth.  Tell 
                        me if this will be too difficult 
                        for you--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Where is he?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        He is set to stand trial at Worms 
                        before Emperor Charles.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        What does he look like?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Probably like every other drunken 
                        monk, portly and weak.  Finding him 
                        might be difficult, but this task 
                        will be easy in comparison the war 
                        you’ve been waging.  The church 
                        does not want him airing his 
                        rhetoric in front of the Holy Roman 
                        Emperor.  Of paramount importance: 
                        He must not attend that trial.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        He won’t.  Now.  Where is Ignacius?
           Vitalo signals GUARDS at the end of the hall, who bring 
           Ignacius out from another passage.

           Sarmiento walks over to the boy, falling to his knees.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Forgive me, Ignacius.  For all I 
                        have done to you.

           Ignacius hugs his head innocently.

           Sarmiento holds Ignacius by the shoulders, the boy’s small 
           frame fills his hands.

                                 IGNACIUS
                        I am sorry.  I will clean up 
                        better, I promise.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        No, no.  You did well.  This is not 
                        your fault.  It is mine.

                                 IGNACIUS
                        Will you leave me again?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Only for a short while.

           Sarmiento pulls from under his robe the SIMPLE WOOD CRUCIFIX 
           hung around his neck.  He hangs it around Ignacius’ small 
           neck.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I will come for you.  I promise.  
                        This will soon be over.

           Vitalo places his hand on Sarmiento’s shoulder, the guards 
           flank the boy.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        So I can count on you?

           Sarmiento stares at Ignacius one last time.

           INT. GUEST QUARTERS - MORNING

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.)
                        Consider the monk dead.

           Brother Batiz rises from his sleep to find Sarmiento writing 
           in his missalette.  He counts his recent scars, cataloging 
           them in the blank pages of his book. 
           His cleaned pistols are displayed on a table, his sword and 
           knife have been oiled, and his armor has been stitched.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I have been asked by the church to 
                        murder Martin Luther, a German 
                        heretic.  I understand if you do 
                        not want to join me from here on 
                        out.  This... is not what I 
                        expected.

           Brother Batiz places his hand on Sarmiento’s shoulder as a 
           sign of solidarity.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Pray for my soul, brother.

                                 CARA (O.S.)
                        I have heard of your purpose here.

           Brother Batiz snaps around to find Cara standing at their 
           door.  Sarmiento is not surprised to see her.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Mind your own affairs.

                                 CARA
                        Your actions will imperil the 
                        standing of the church.  Killing 
                        this monk will only justify the 
                        people’s disdain.  I ask you, for 
                        the sake of the Holy See, go to 
                        Germany, and come back without 
                        finding him.

           Sarmiento turns to face her.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Do you care to tell me who you hear 
                        your rumors from?  Perhaps Cardinal 
                        Umbretto shares more than just 
                        words with you?

                                 CARA
                        Save your judgements.  You have no 
                        idea what is at stake--

           Sarmiento pushes her up against the wall.  She calmly stares 
           him down.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        I know exactly what is at stake. 
                        Furthermore, I would hold your 
                        tongue of such insurgent speak, 
                        censor.  I have experience with 
                        those who air their thoughts in 
                        such a manner, and the results are 
                        never favorable.

           Sarmiento winces, he looks down to see Cara holding a dagger 
           to his ribs.

                                 CARA
                        I came to advise you, nothing more.

           Sarmiento backs off.  Cara sheaths her dagger in her ORNATE 
           ROSARY CRUCIFIX.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Would God approve of a knife hidden 
                        in His cross?

                                 CARA
                        They call you “the Mace” in Spain?  
                        Certainly He wouldn’t approve of a 
                        butcher who wore his cloth.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        God makes us all what he needs, 
                        whether we like it or not.  And now 
                        he sends me to do his bidding once 
                        again.  Martin Luther put the blade 
                        at his own neck.  I live with far 
                        worse.

                                 CARA
                        Then let me leave you with this.   
                        There are more than just Lutherans 
                        running amok in Germany.  Be 
                        careful who you trust.

           Sarmiento closes the door on Cara...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE - MONTAGE 

           -Sarmiento and Brother Batiz ride across fields, through 
           villages, over mountains.  
                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.)
                             (talking to Brother Batiz)
                        He lectures across the country...

           -Sarmiento pulls a flier announcing a lecture by Martin 
           Luther from a post... the 95 Theses.  He crushes it, flinging 
           it to the ground.

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        ... speaking of the corruption 
                        within the church.  Heretical by 
                        any standard.  This man would have 
                        been hung in Spain long ago...

           -Sarmiento stops to speak to LOCALS, asking where he might 
           find Martin Luther.  

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        ... but yet, he does nothing to 
                        hide himself.

           -Sarmiento stands at a crossroads in a town, looking down 
           each thoroughfare, as if sensing Martin Luther’s location.

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        He must be mad, provoking the anger 
                        of the church.

           -Sarmiento and Brother Batiz stand before a burnt church, the 
           VILLAGERS finishing putting out the flames.

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        If he cares so little about the 
                        fate of his soul, then so shall I.

           INT. VILLAGE PUB - EVENING

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz enter the busy pub.  Brother 
           Batiz quickly takes a seat, pointing for the SERVER to bring 
           him an ale.  Sarmiento walks through the loud crowd of YOUNG 
           SCHOLARS and WORKERS who have gathered.

           Sarmiento singles out a SCHOLAR reading a leaflet... Martin 
           Luther’s work.

                                 SARMIENTO

                        Martin Luther, the Monk.  Do you 
                        know if he has lectured here 
                        recently?

                                 SCHOLAR
                        A foreigner comes into Germany 
                        asking questions about where to 
                        find Luther?  You must come on high

                        I merely seek answers.  There are 
                        men in your land, perhaps some of 
                        these people here, who burn 
                        churches in the name of Luther.

           The other patrons tune into their conversation, quieting the 
           pub a bit.

                        I see not one arsonist here, so you 
                        have great nerve to fling your 
                        accusations.  You will only find 
                        friends to his cause in these 
                        parts.  Luther bows to God.  He 
                        does not bow to the falsehoods that 
                        salvation lies anywhere else.

                        have you--

           Sarmiento, with shocking quickness, sweeps legs on the young 
           man’s chair, dropping him to the floor.  

           Sarmiento steps on his chest--

           --and points a pistol at him.

           Others move away, shocked by the violence.

           Sarmiento pulls the hammer back on the pistol, driving the 
           barrel into the scholar’s cheek.  The scholar urinates 
           himself.

                        yourselves.

           Sarmiento snatches the leaflet on the table, showing to the 
           people.

           He stuffs the literature into his pocket.

           Brother Batiz shakes his head, accustomed to Sarmiento’s 
           moodiness, lamenting that he couldn’t just enjoy a drink.  He 
           finishes his ale quickly, following Sarmiento out.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DUOHM - BURNT CHURCH - MORNING

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz ride into the center of town, 
           where stands the husk of a recently burnt church.

           Smoke still rises from the building.  Sarmiento finds 
           CONSTABLE ARNOLDT, an old town servant, leading the fire 
           brigade.
                                 SARMIENTO 
                        The people who did this, did you 
                        see them?

           The constable looks around discreetly before speaking.

                                 CONSTABLE ARNOLDT
                        Come with me.

           The men dismount and follow the constable into--

           INT. BURNT CHURCH

           The roofless church still smolders.  The ruined pews line the 
           wrecked passage to the altar, where a CHARRED BODY is nailed 
           to an ‘X’ shaped crucifix.

           Little of his face is intact, other than the morbid smile of 
           teeth exposed through scorched lips.  Brother Batiz prays at 
           the sight of the body.  

           Sarmiento makes his way to the foot of the body, kneels to 
           pray.  He eyes a MEDALLION hung from the body, bearing the 
           letter “L” on it.

                                 CONSTABLE ARNOLDT
                             (pointing to the medallion 
                              on the body)
                        Father Von Hof.  In red robes, they 
                        brazenly waited for the church to 
                        finish burning to arrange this 
                        atrocity.

           Sarmiento rises.

                                 CONSTABLE ARNOLDT (cont’d)
                        Many of the townsfolk heard them 
                        chanting the name “Luther” as they 
                        rode from town.  Some have taken to 
                        his message, but after this... they 
                        are wolves masquerading in the skin 
                        of men.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You saw them?  

                                 CONSTABLE ARNOLDT
                        Yes, they rode northwest on the 
                        pass.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        And you did... what?  To stop them?
                                 CONSTABLE ARNOLDT
                             (apprehensively)
                        I am but one man, there was nothing 
                        I could do--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Jesus was just one man.  Thankfully 
                        he did not exhibit your kind of 
                        bravery.

           Sarmiento takes the medallion from the corpse.

           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz gallop across the countryside, 
           racing by night to the next town.  Sarmiento spies a CLOAKED 
           RIFLED RIDER in the distance.  Brother Batiz traces his stare 
           to the far horseman.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        He’s kept his distance from us 
                        since we left Rome.  Perhaps the 
                        Cardinal’s faith in me extends only 
                        so far.

           The rider moves out of sight.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Or perhaps Luther’s reach is more 
                        extensive than I thought.

           INT. WITTENBERG - CHURCH - NIGHT

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz enter the church.  Every step is 
           accentuated by a dissonant echo that alerts FATHER HENNINGER.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am Arturo Sarmiento, this is 
                        Brother Batiz, of the Carthusian 
                        order.

           Father Henninger looks at Brother Batiz’s bare, dirty feet.

                                 FATHER HENNINGER
                        Yes, I see that.  I am Gerrit 
                        Henninger, the purveyor of St. 
                        Augustus.  What brings you here at 
                        this late hour?
                                 SARMIENTO
                        We are looking for accommodations 
                        for the night.  

                                 FATHER HENNINGER
                        I think I can find someplace.  
                        Follow me.

           Horse HOOVES POUND up to the building.  Voices can be heard 
           outside.

           Sarmiento peeks out the doors...

           A POSSE OF RED HOODED LUTHERANS on horseback raise their 
           torches and approach.  Sarmiento runs back to the two men.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The Lutherans have come to burn 
                        your church.
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Pick up the torches as they come.
                             (to Henninger)
                        Where is your font?

           They scramble to his orders.

                                 FATHER HENNINGER 
                        Do you propose to douse torches 
                        with blessed water?

           A flaming torch shatters a window and flies into the church, 
           igniting a wooden pew.  Sarmiento snatches it up before the 
           flames can spread.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        A more holy employment of the font 
                        there will never be.  Fill it!

           He checks his pistols.  Torches continue to smash through 
           windows.  He sneaks outside.

           EXT. CHURCH

           Sarmiento prowls his way behind a statue.  A LUTHERAN 
           HORSEMAN approaches.  Sarmiento reveals himself, aiming the 
           pistol, holding the torch to the flash pan.  The surprised 
           horseman unsheathes his sword, about to skewer Sarmiento-- 

           BLAM!  An iron ball explodes from beneath Sarmiento’ robe, 
           bursting the man’s head, tossing the limp Lutheran from his 
           horse.
           Sarmiento mounts the now available horse.  He rides up behind 
           another SPEEDING LUTHERAN HORSEMAN, readies his next pistol--

           POF! a dud shot.  The horseman drives at Sarmiento, but 
           Sarmiento uses their closing proximity to jump from his 
           horse, tackling him to the ground.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Let’s try this again.

           The Lutheran stabs at Sarmiento.  As the sword slices 
           Sarmiento’s shirt, he disarms the Lutheran in a graceful 
           spin.  With equal ease, he runs the Lutheran through.  

           One of the LUTHERANS, a YOUNG ONE by the look of his wide 
           eyes, is intimidated by Sarmiento, riding away in retreat.

           Sarmiento takes the moment to mount up again, only to find--

           TWO OTHER LUTHERANS on foot ignite the exterior of the 
           church, but they run for their horses at the sight of 
           Sarmiento, now wielding his sword.  

           Sarmiento cleaves one in the shoulder, dropping the man to 
           the ground.  

           The other mounts his horse, darting into town.  Sarmiento 
           gives chase.

           WITTENBERG STREETS

           Sarmiento rides up alongside the sword-bearing Lutheran.  
           Exchanging glancing stabs, the Lutheran pulls away as they 
           twist and turn through the narrow streets of Wittenberg.

           Sarmiento aims his pistol, but cannot get a clean line-of-
           sight on the Lutheran.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        God, forgive me...

           Using his flattened hand as a muzzle break from the wind, he 
           shoots the Lutherist’s horse, dropping them both like a ton 
           of stone.  The Lutheran’s head caves in, spilling blood onto 
           the cobblestone streets.

           CHURCH

           A few TOWNSFOLK, Brother Batiz and Father Henninger fight the 
           flames.  Sarmiento rides to the cleaved Lutheran.  
           Dismounting, Sarmiento squeezes the injured Lutheran’s wound, 
           making the man writhe in pain.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Was it Martin Luther who sent you 
                        to do the devil’s work?

                                 HURTING LUTHERAN
                        Yes--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        There were more of you here.  Where 
                        are your cohorts?  Where are you 
                        camped?

                                 HURTING LUTHERAN
                        You will never stop us from 
                        destroying the church--

           Sarmiento takes out his knife and puts it under his throat.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        That doesn’t answer my question, so 
                        I will keep you alive--

           He makes an small incision, the Lutheran yells in pain.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        --until you tell me what I want to 
                        know.

                                 HURTING LUTHERAN
                        He is headed for Karlsruhe!

           Sarmiento continues cutting through his ear and into his 
           scalp, the man writhes and screams all the while.

                                 HURTING LUTHERAN (cont’d)
                        Karlsruhe!  Preaching, speaking at 
                        universities!  Let me be!

           Sarmiento stops cutting, giving the Lutheran a moment of 
           relief.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You have no loyalty to God, none to 
                        your false prophet.  Spineless...  
                        irredeemable.

           Sarmiento pours gun powder from a pistol onto his head.

           The Lutheran fearfully grovels as Sarmiento snatches a torch 
           from a nearby ONLOOKER.  Father Henninger tries to stop 
           Sarmiento.
                                 FATHER HENNINGER
                        Stop this!  We will send him to 
                        Rome to answer for these 
                        depravities!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        This is mercy compared to the 
                        dungeon of St. Angelo.
                             (standing over the wailing 
                              Lutheran)
                        May God have mercy on your soul--

                                 HURTING LUTHERAN
                        I repent, I repent--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Let Him hear your pleas, for I have 
                        fallen deaf to you on behalf of 
                        Father Von Hof.

           Sarmiento drops the torch on the Lutheran’s head, igniting 
           him instantly.  He rolls around, slamming himself with open 
           hands to quell the flames.  The townsfolk are aghast.  The 
           Lutheran screams when--

           BOOM-- His thrashing stops.  Sarmiento puts the smoking 
           pistol away.  Father Henninger prays.  Brother Batiz covers 
           his mouth, aghast.

           Sarmiento, now self-conscious of his brutality, pushes his 
           way through the crowd.  

           Down a street, Sarmiento spies the CLOAKED RIFLED RIDER 
           watching.  The figure, with towering rifle slung behind him, 
           steps into the darkness and disappears.

           INT. CHURCH ATTIC - NIGHT

           The space is dimly lit by candle, cluttered with old 
           furniture, scattered granite stations of the cross and stacks 
           of books.  Sarmiento, stripped of equipment and freshly 
           bandaged, is nearly veiled by darkness.

           Sarmiento looks over the leaflet he took from the scholar, 
           shaking his head.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The world is consumed with who is 
                        right and who is wrong.  How is it 
                        that I always play a part...
           Sarmiento scratches himself, discovering blood on his 
           fingers.  

           Sarmiento counts his new scars and accounts for them in his 
           missalette.  Brother Batiz watches Sarmiento in disturbed 
           reverence from across the room.

           Sarmiento feels Brother Batiz’s eyes upon him.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Allow me to confess.

           Brother Batiz turns in his chair to face Sarmiento.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        How do I find peace with what has 
                        been made of me?  From soldier, to 
                        priest, to guard, to assassin.  How 
                        else can I draw blood in the name 
                        of God?  I have defiled the earth 
                        by putting my victims inside of it.  
                        How is my child to survive me... 
                        when his mother did not...

           Sarmiento turns his back on Brother Batiz, facing the third 
           station of the cross: The Collapse of Jesus. 

           The inscription in Latin reads, “Where do we fall?”

           Sarmiento back barely heaves, the look of a sobbing man.

           Brother Batiz, unable to help, drinks and keeps vigil of his 
           friend.

           EXT. KARLSRUHE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - DAY

           Sarmiento dismounts his steed, leaving it with Brother Batiz.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Wait for me here.  If I’m not back 
                        by morning, find your way to Rome.  
                        I ask you, as friend... break your 
                        silence if I do not return, and 
                        speak on Ignacius’ behalf.  Take 
                        him back to Spain with you.

           Sarmiento hands him a note.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        They will understand the message 
                        when you arrive alone--
           Sarmiento makes his way into town.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        --Germany is overrun.

           KARLSRUHE STREETS

           Sarmiento watches the bustle of the streets from an arms-
           width alley.  He spots a flier on a post:
                                      “MARTIN LUTHER
                                     on indulgences”

           The date and location are also printed below.  He takes the 
           flier, walking off into the tumult of the streets.

           INT. HALL

           PEOPLE listen intently as MARTIN LUTHER speaks.  He is a 
           stout man, robed outside of his traditional monks garb, 
           balding.

           His audience is captivated by his passionate presence.  
           Sarmiento listens to him speak from the back of the room.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        ... therefore those who say that by 
                        the Pope's indulgences a man is 
                        freed from every penalty have 
                        strayed from God’s path.  May the 
                        Almighty see them right.

           Martin Luther smiles, gratified his message is well received 
           with applause.  

           Sarmiento sees the effect of the speech on the mass.

           As Martin Luther steps down from the pulpit, the crowds 
           gather to shake his hand, touch him, thank him, congratulate 
           him.  

           Martin Luther walks past Sarmiento, who doesn’t budge in the 
           sea of exuberant commotion.

           KARLSRUHE STREETS

           The sun falls, the streets darken, candle lamps light up.  
           Sarmiento inconspicuously follows the GROUP that has followed 
           Luther from his mass to the streets.
           Martin Luther stops in front of an inn, the group stops with 
           him as they make small talk.

           Sarmiento mills across the road, blending in, while keeping 
           an eye on Luther.

           Sarmiento instinctively peeks over his shoulder--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        As expected, old friend... 

           He see his tail, the CLOAKED RIFLEMAN, watching him at the 
           end of the road.  The rifleman clearly knows Sarmiento is 
           aware of his presence, nodding to him respectfully.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I am sure we will meet soon enough.

           Sarmiento returns his attention to Martin Luther, who bids 
           the group farewell, and enters the inn.

           Sarmiento wastes no time in crossing the street, slipping 
           through the PEDESTRIANS towards the inn...

           When from the corner of his eye, he sees something that stops 
           him...

           He turns and looks through the pedestrians he passed...

           He recognizes a face, the pair of young eyes...

           Moving with the traffic...

           It’s Armanno, the young Swiss pikesman from the Vatican 
           Library, walking away, oblivious to Sarmiento’s presence.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (bewildered)
                        What...

           Sarmiento’s eyes narrow, unsure of what to do next, splitting 
           his attention on Luther...

           He looks for his rifled spy down the road, but he is gone.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        It is time for answers.

           Armanno turns at an intersection, disappearing in the crowd.

           But Sarmiento has disappeared as well.
           EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

           Away from the town, Armanno discreetly enters a quiet stable 
           on a small farm.

           INT. STABLE

           Once inside the dimly lit stable, Armanno walks through SIX 
           OF HIS FELLOW SWISS GUARDSMEN, dressed as townsfolk.  The 
           lofts and partitions cast dark shadows across the space.

           Armanno climbs a ladder to the loft, lying down to rest. 

           As the men below huddle around a small fire, cooking their 
           stews, keeping warm, a shadowy figure slips in through the 
           rear of the stable.

           Sarmiento stealthily creeps his way past the stalls, barely 
           stirring the HORSES within.

           Crawling along their heaped belongings, he spies the 
           disturbing color of inside one of the bags.

           He pulls the red cloth out... the robe of the Lutheran 
           occultist.  He finds a MEDALLION like the one he took from 
           the Father Von Hof’s burnt body as well.

           One of the men (PASCUAL) steps away from the fire, walking 
           past the hiding Sarmiento to the--

           BACK OF THE STABLE

           The man drops his pants, unrinating in a dark corner.  The 
           SOUND of pissing stops abruptly, when the light reveals a 
           knife under his neck.

           Sarmiento, veiled in the dark, covers the man’s mouth.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (quietly)
                        Continue pissing.

           The man, afraid, haphazardly ekes out some intermittent 
           urine.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        What are you doing here?  Killing 
                        Catholics, and burning our 
                        churches?
                                 PASCUAL
                             (frightened)
                        I know not of what you speak.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I saw the medallion.  I want 
                        answers.

                                 PASCUAL
                        I cannot tell you.  They will kill 
                        me.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Put your mind to what I will do if 
                        you do not tell me.

           AROUND THE FIRE...

           The men continue to warm themselves.  When they HEAR just the 
           slightest gurgling, a fading cry...

           Horses stir in the stalls... then silence.

                                 SWISS GUARDSMAN 1
                        Having trouble with your bowels 
                        again, Pascual?

           No response.  One of the young men stands (LUCIAN), grabbing 
           his sword, staring into the dark end of the stable.

                                 LUCIAN
                        Pascual?

           No response.  Now concerned, they all rise taking weapons.  
           Two of them begin walking back to check on Pascual when from 
           the darkness--

           BLAM!  BLAM!  Bursts of smoke flutter from the darkness, 
           dropping the two soldiers dead.  Four men left.

           Before the rest have time to react, Sarmiento rushes out from 
           the darkness, sword in hand.  He hacks into the shoulder of 
           one of the men, dropping him to the ground.

           The sliced man screams wildly as Sarmiento faces the other 
           men.

           FROM THE LOFT...

           Armanno, now on his feet, looks down on the commotion, to see 
           Sarmiento ambushing his cohorts.
                                 ARMANNO
                             (terrified)
                        My God, he found us...

           Armanno rushes down the ladder to enter the fray.  

           The screaming man continues to wail as Sarmiento continues 
           his onslaught.

           Two soldiers strike, cornering Sarmiento, who wields his 
           dagger and sword.  He bats away their strikes defensively, 
           stabbing at one while shoving the other away.

           Sarmiento, backed into a stall, throws his dagger into the 
           second man, then reaches into his robe to fire a pistol at 
           the striking soldier...

           POFF... misfire.  Sarmiento does not lament the mistake, 
           continuing his defense.

           He hops the next stall, slapping an already unsettled horse, 
           who kicks his hooves up at Armanno.  Sarmiento unties the 
           horse, who shoves his way out of the stall.

                                 ARMANNO (cont’d)
                             (panic, rage)
                        What are you doing here!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You have defiled your faith, 
                        heretic.

           Armanno puts up a strong attack. 

                                 ARMANNO
                        This is mandate, you maniac!  We 
                        come on the highest authority!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Blasphemy.

           Slicing wildly, Armanno cuts Sarmiento across the shoulder, 
           sending Sarmiento reeling when--

           BLAM!  Sarmiento next pistol finds its target, hitting 
           Armanno in his thigh.  Armanno staggers his way out of the 
           stable.  Three men left.

           Sarmiento rushes to the main drag of the stable, taking more 
           space.  He stabs the screaming man in the chest, silencing 
           him for good.  Two left.

           Sarmiento raises his sword, The remaining soldier defends...
           BOOM - Sarmiento shoots him through his robe.  The shocked 
           soldier swings his sword at Sarmiento in a futile effort.  
           Sarmiento drives his blade into the man’s belly, dropping 
           him.

           Amongst the bodies... only a frightened Lucian remains.

           Sarmiento stalks around him, a cat toying with a mouse.

           Lucian sees his cohorts... his sword lags by his side, 
           deflated.

                                 LUCIAN
                        Who are you to defy God!?

           Lucian stabs at Sarmiento, but is disarmed with ease.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am God’s bidding.  And you do not 
                        work for Him.  

           Lucian falls to his knees, crying, mumbling his begs for 
           mercy.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        You condemned and murdered innocent 
                        men.

           Sarmiento raises his sword to execute Lucian.  He sees Lucian 
           is still--

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        --so young.

           Sarmiento sees the tears stream down Lucian’s face.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (recalling Umbretto’s 
                              words)
                        Too young to understand your guilt.

           Sarmiento drops the hilt of his sword upon Lucian--

                                                                  BLACK

           EXT. KARLSRUHE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHT

           Brother Batiz sits near a small fire amidst thicket of trees.  
           He pulls the roasting pigeon off the spit, poking the breast 
           for tenderness, when his horse stirs.  
           Brother Batiz turns to find Sarmiento approaching the camp, 
           dragging a bound and gagged heap of Lucian behind.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        How goes dinner?

           Brother Batiz is shocked at the cool manner in which 
           Sarmiento has collected a prisoner.

           Brother Batiz sees a cut along Sarmiento’s side, 
           instinctively handing him his missalette.  Sarmiento spies 
           the wound.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Do me the favor--

           Brother Batiz, measures the wound with his finger, displaying 
           it to Sarmiento as he tends to the wound.  Sarmiento raises 
           his eyebrows, impressed with the length Brother Batiz

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (as he writes)
                        Keep an eye on this man.  He has 
                        questions to answer.

           After Brother Batiz chews up some paper and stuffs it into 
           the wound, Sarmiento hands him the missalette and walks back 
           into the darkness.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I shall return.  Keep my portion 
                        warm.

           Brother Batiz watches Lucian distractedly.  But not 
           distracted enough to keep him from tending to his food.

           EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

           Armanno hides in the dark, leaning along side a storage shed, 
           tending to the bullet wound in his leg.

           The CLOAKED RIFLEMAN steps forward, only his eyes revealed in 
           the darkness.  Armanno sees him, but is more concerned about 
           his injury.

                                 ARMANNO
                             (pressing the wound)
                        What now?
                                 SHADOW FIGURE
                        Sarmiento has made a fine mess of 
                        this, as I told them he would.  You 
                        must go back and report Luther is 
                        alive.   Tell them I ride to Worms 
                        and await the order to finish the 
                        job that Sarmiento could not.

                                 ARMANNO
                             (pained)
                        I don’t know if I will make it with 
                        this wound.

                                 SHADOW FIGURE
                        Rome is far.  It would be best if 
                        you got moving.

           INT. INN - NIGHT

           Martin Luther sits at a small desk, writing.  He is in deep 
           concentration, when a knock at the door disturbs him.  Luther 
           tries to ignore, but the knock persists.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Yes, yes, hold on.

           Luther opens the door, revealing Sarmiento.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont’d)
                        How can I help you?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am Arturo Sarmiento.  I’ve been 
                        trying to find you for several 
                        days.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Ah!  You were at the gathering.  I 
                        recognize your garb.  It is...

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Was.  Dominican.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        They’re none too pleased with me 
                        these days.
                             (they shake hands)
                        I am Martin Luther, please come in.

           Sarmiento enters.  They sit.
                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont’d)
                        So.  If you have come to hear me, I 
                        assume you are having a crisis much 
                        like mine?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        A crisis?

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Looking for God in the church, and 
                        not finding him there?  Why else 
                        would you look for me and not 
                        expect repercussions?  So what is 
                        it you seek?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I needed to hear you speak.  To see 
                        the man who drives this revolution--

           Luther laughs.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Is that what they are calling it?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        How did you do it?  I dream of the 
                        strength it would take me to turn 
                        my back on--

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        --the church?  I did not turn away.  
                        Pope Leo takes from the people, 
                        thinking he will build a temple 
                        high enough so he might walk into 
                        the gates of heaven by foot.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Perhaps this is God’s design.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        And perhaps it’s the meanderings of 
                        the lost.  I refuse to be led like 
                        that any longer.  I have found 
                        truth--

           Luther turns around to grab his Bible.  He turns back to see 
           a pistol pointed an inch from his forehead.  He begins to 
           sweat immediately.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont’d)
                        --in the Bible.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        This is the truth.  I was sent here 
                        to kill you on this night for your 
                        insults to God.  But I have crossed 
                        the red robed occultists who ride 
                        in your name, and there is more at 
                        work here than just an overweight 
                        satanic monk.  With whom do you 
                        conspire?

           Luther, shocked and afraid, mutters as he tries to find the 
           words to answer.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Occultists?  I know nothing of 
                        this!

           Sarmiento searches his pockets, tosses the medallion at 
           Martin Luther.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Medallions bearing your name.  Worn 
                        by a murderous horde.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Dear Lord, I’ve never seen anything 
                        like this in my life!

           Sarmiento, becoming impatient, grabs Luther by the collar, 
           pulling his face into the barrel of his pistol.

           Sarmiento closes the distance between them, whispering to 
           Luther’s ear.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Monk.  I have scourged men until 
                        they begged for death to find  
                        hidden truths within them.  Men who 
                        had far more calloused skin, who 
                        understood suffering long before I 
                        reached them, and who spoke with 
                        their actions and not with their 
                        mouths.  What makes you think I 
                        will not drive the truth from you?

           Martin Luther tries to compose himself, closing his eyes, as 
           if in prayer.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Do your worst, I know nothing of 
                        what you speak.  But let me ask 
                        you... what are you willing to live 
                        with?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont'd)
                        I am guilty of speaking against the 
                        church.  But I am innocent of all 
                        charges you have brought against me 
                        tonight.

           Sarmiento grits his teeth impatiently... he thumbs the hammer 
           on his pistol, but does not pull it back.

           After an uncomfortable moment of consideration, Sarmiento 
           throws Luther onto his ass.  Sarmiento pulls a robe from a 
           wall hook, throwing it at him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Put on your robe.  I want you to 
                        meet someone.

           EXT. KARLSRUHE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHT

           POV OF LUCIAN waking with a slap, bound, lying on his side.  
           Across the camp fire stands Brother Batiz and Luther in their 
           monks robe, looking fairly similar.

           Sarmiento takes a knee next to Lucian.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        How good of you to join us.  Now, 
                        you came from the Vatican.  And you 
                        are a Lutheran barbarian.  Would 
                        you care to elaborate which you 
                        really are?

           Lucian, confused and afraid, hesitates, but Sarmiento pounds 
           him again.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Which?

                                 LUCIAN
                        You saw the red robes.  I am a 
                        Lutheran.

           Sarmiento points to the two monks.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Which one is Luther then?

           Lucian scans the faces of the silenced monks.  Sarmiento 
           watches Lucian like a hawk, tracking every twitch and bead of 
           sweat on the young man.  Lucian takes too long to pick.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        As I feared.
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        It is not Luther who commands these 
                        men to burns the churches.  

           Sarmiento shakes his head in disappointment, taking out his 
           sword.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        There are answers in Rome.

           He drops the hilt on Lucian once again, pounding him out to--

                                                                  BLACK

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Sarmiento leads Martin Luther and Brother Batiz back through 
           the tight streets of Karlsruhe.  

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                             (trying to converse)
                        How did you come to this wicked 
                        service?  Your best thinking led 
                        you to this... hunting academics?

           Martin Luther waits, staring at him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I was taken for Ferdinand’s army as 
                        a boy.  Then, the Dominicans 
                        claimed me for the Inquisition.  
                        Then I spent...
                             (searches his mind, coming 
                              up empty)
                        I don’t know how long driving 
                        invaders from the gates of Spain.  
                        Since when did serving allow the 
                        luxury of choice?

                                 MARTIN LUTHER 
                        A shame.  A servant in the order of 
                        death.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I became what was needed of me.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        You’ve become this wolf in the 
                        cloak of the Vatican... where do 
                        you find your peace?
                                 SARMIENTO
                        My scars should tell you God 
                        renounced my peace long ago, old 
                        man.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                             (ponderously)
                        You... are right.  He doesn’t have 
                        anything to give you.  Why would 
                        He?  You haven’t given it to 
                        yourself.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        What I do now, I do for a child.  
                        So until I see him safe, I will not 
                        repent.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        A child saved by the tip of a sword 
                        has a fine edge to walk.

           Sarmiento stops at the inn, facing Luther.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Enough of me.  The business upon 
                        which I was sent here is erred.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        So it would seem.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You are not free of my suspicion.  
                        Should I learn you are behind this, 
                        I will find you...

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        I have nothing to hide, I will not 
                        change my path.  I will stand 
                        before the Emperor at Worms as I 
                        said I would, and I will make my 
                        case.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        There are those who use your name 
                        for wickedness.  What makes you 
                        think they will not come for you?  
                        You will not be safe--

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        You think me so unproficient that I 
                        cannot manage in my own country?  
                        You forget that I do have those who 
                        will harbor me here.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        Then ride to them, keep your 
                        appearances to a minimum.
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Go with Luther.

           Brother Batiz nods.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        I do not need an escort.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        This isn’t a favor.  He goes with 
                        you until I come back with answers.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Are you a man of God?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        He is Carthusian, in the throws of 
                        his vows.  He will not speak.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        No matter.  I have plenty to say 
                        for the both of us.

           Brother Batiz sighs, it’s going to be a long trip.  Sarmiento 
           steps away from the men, he gives Brother Batiz a deferent 
           bow before turning away.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE

           A MONTAGE of Sarmiento wheeling through the countryside, 
           leading another horse with Lucian bound as his prisoner.

           They do not rest as they ride through rain, sunshine, 
           villages, cobbled roads, muddied trail, fields, and sundowns.

           EXT. VATICAN CITY - DAY

           Sarmiento continues to drive relentlessly even up to the 
           gates of the Basilica.

           VIA DELLA POSTA

           Sarmiento shoves the gagged Lucian to the gates of a villa.  
           Two GUARDS block his path.
                                 GUARD
                        Halt!

           Sarmiento begins removing his weapons.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Under order of Cardinal Umbretto, I 
                        come with matters of urgency.  
                        Inform him I am here.

           The guards look at the exhausted and bound Lucian, unsure of 
           what to do next.

           INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

           Sarmiento waits, holding Lucian close.  The two guards flank 
           Cardinal Umbretto and Cara as they stride toward Sarmiento.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I assume there is reason you’ve 
                        returned with a prisoner when I 
                        sent you where there were no 
                        prisoners to take.

           Cara falls behind, hesitant to be part of the conversation.  
           Umbretto stops before Sarmiento.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The occultists who burn the 
                        churches.  They are not the 
                        followers of Martin Luther.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        And?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        With all due respect, Luther is no 
                        longer your biggest threat.  
                        Someone in Rome is orchestrating 
                        the destruction of the churches.  I 
                        suspect someone within the Vatican.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        So... Luther.  He is not...

                                 SARMIENTO
                        No.  He is not.

           Cardinal Umbretto paces in front of Sarmiento.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I did not believe when they told 
                        me.  You came with such a 
                        reputation, that I thought you’d 
                        lash the very idea of Luther from 
                        Germany.  But to hear this from 
                        you...

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I fear you do not understand--

           The Cardinal stomps into Sarmiento’s face, cutting him off.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        It is you who does not understand!

           Cardinal Umbretto waves his hand, the high double doors to 
           the hall open... a GARRISON OF SWISS GUARD enter.  One of 
           them is ARMANNO, whom Sarmiento shot in the leg.

           Sarmiento is in disbelief, turning to the cardinal.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I asked you to complete one simple 
                        task.  Why did you not do as 
                        instructed?   What would convince 
                        you to commit such a heresy?

           Cara is horrified by Umbretto.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I stopped the greater threat.  I 
                        held to our bargain, I protected 
                        the church--

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        No, I have stopped you from 
                        weakening it.  If it were not for 
                        the faith I have instilled in my 
                        subjects, my work would be ruined.
                             (to the guards)
                        Restrain him.

           Some guards seize the struggling Sarmiento, as others protect 
           the cardinal.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        My boy.  You must free him.  He has 
                        nothing to do with this.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Ah!  An admission... Vitalo will be 
                        disappointed to hear you confessed 
                        to me instead of him.  But I am 
                        sure he will wring revelations from 
                        you yet.

           Umbretto makes his way over to Sarmiento, inspecting him as 
           if he were an oddity or an insect.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                             (to Cara)
                        I should have kept your counsel, 
                        Cara.  You did not trust him.  And 
                        now the heretic hunter has turned 
                        heretic.  Such a waste.

           Cara averts her eyes from the struggling Sarmiento, unwilling 
           to watch him suffer. 

           Umbretto guides Cara out with him.

                                 CARA
                        He has a son.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Irrelevant.  He has betrayed the 
                        church for the last time, it ends 
                        here--

                                 CARA
                        He accused you of the burnings in 
                        Germany--

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        A sign of his delusion--

                                 CARA
                        But he stopped the horde.  This is 
                        unfair--

           The cardinal restrainedly grabs Cara’s hand.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                             (so none can hear)
                        My dear.  This conversation not 
                        only vexes me, but it borders on 
                        sacrilege.

           He squeezes her hand... the pain registers on Cara’s face.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        I decide what is fair.  And it was 
                        he who treated me unfairly.

           Umbretto releases her and continues walking.

           Cara, standing alone, watches Sarmiento struggle.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                             (to the guards)
                        Take him to St. Angelo’s.
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        We may not do it the way you did in 
                        Spain, but I hope you find our 
                        inquisition up to your standards.

           The guards drag him away.  Sarmiento calls out--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        My boy!  My boy--

           One of the guards smashes Sarmiento’s head, all goes to--

           BLACK

           IMAGES FADE IN AND OUT of blurry stairwells spiralling 
           downward, cold passages, cells smothering their hopeless 
           prisoners, muddled SOUNDS of chains, of creaking iron hinges, 
           of torture, of pain.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - CELL - DAY 

           Sarmiento awakens wearing nothing but sack pants.  He is 
           marked with red paint, indicating his heretic status.  

           In the dark, dingy cell watching him is PRINCE NASIR, the 
           Moorish prince.  Emaciated, sores and wounds cover the 
           prince’s abused body.  Sarmiento slowly comes to recognize 
           him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You were going home to bury your 
                        father.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        I was, until the Italian armada 
                        pillaged our ships.  They brought 
                        me here as a trophy.

           Sarmiento holds his head as if it were a fragile piece of 
           pottery.
                                 PRINCE NASIR (cont’d)
                        An ironic turn of events, is it 
                        not?  A cleric imprisoned in his 
                        own holy city.

           From across the way, BASIL SILBER, an Italian Jew, looks into 
           Sarmiento’s cell.  He too has been tortured, but is healthier 
           than the prince.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                             (suspiciously)
                        What kind of cleric?

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (to Basil)
                        A Dominican who hunted Jews.
                             (to Nasir)
                        And soldiered against the prince’s 
                        Moors.

           Sarmiento crawls to the bars and checks for guards.  The two 
           are silenced by Sarmiento’s blunt nature.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Better you hear it from me.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                             (pointing to the red paint 
                              on Sarmiento’s pants)
                        You bear the mark.  So for all your 
                        Jew hunting and Moor killing, you 
                        are still one of us.

           Basil withdraws into his dark cell, laughing.  Sarmiento, 
           hating the feeling of being watched, turns to Nasir.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Would you believe me if I told you 
                        I am here because I tried to save 
                        someone?

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        You will be put through the same 
                        atrocities by these barbarians like 
                        you inflicted upon others.  Do you 
                        remember?  You believed you were 
                        saving people then, too.

           Sarmiento hears ANGELO GUARDS coming.  He lies down, 
           pretending to sleep.
                                 ST. ANGELO GUARD
                             (to Nasir)
                        Has he awakened?

           Nasir says nothing.  The guard attempts to kick Sarmiento, 
           but Sarmiento catches the guard’s foot right before it lands.

                                 ST. ANGELO GUARD (cont’d)
                        A light sleeper... good to know.

           The two of them wrangle Sarmiento to his feet.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        Submit to God and find peace.

           Sarmiento hears him as he is dragged away.

           IGNACIUS CELL

           Cara, followed by her servant, is led to a cell by a GUARD.  
           He unlocks the gates.

                                 CARA
                        You can go.

           As ordered the guard leaves as Cara closes the gates behind 
           her.  She enters what seems to be an empty cell.

           Disgusted by the dirty conditions of the cell, she finds 
           Ignacius siting alone in a dark corner, his small stature  
           consumed by the darkness.

           She kneels, holding out her hand as she would to a stray dog.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Boy.  Are you hungry?

           Cara takes some fruit from the servant, holding it out to 
           Ignacius.  

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Don’t be afraid.

           He cautiously comes over to her, taking the food, eating 
           voraciously.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Where is your mother, boy?  Home, 
                        in Spain?

           Ignacius doesn’t know the answer, eating away naively.
           Cara delicately dusts Ignacius’ clothing with her hand, 
           coming across the WOODEN CRUCIFIX hanging from his neck.  She 
           thumbs it.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Who made this?  Your father?

                                 IGNACIUS
                        He made it for me for when I’m a 
                        man.

           Cara smiles at the boy, though her eyes betray her sadness.

                                 CARA
                             (to herself)
                        Who will care for you...

                                 IGNACIUS
                        My father.  He is coming for me.

           Cara settles her hands on his shoulders, looking the innocent 
           boy over.

                                 CARA
                        Yes.  He will.  I heard him make 
                        the promise.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - PIT - DAY 

           Sarmiento, flanked by two ST. ANGELO’S GUARDS, makes his way 
           down a tunnel.  A gate opens, he is shoved into a tight pit 
           that is large enough to hold a few men.

           SWISS GUARDS, SOLDIERS, Inquisitor Vitalo and Cardinal 
           Umbretto crowd around the rim above to see the oncoming 
           slaughter.  

           Sarmiento looks up the high walls to see Cara join the circle 
           of onlookers.  

           Cara and Sarmiento stare at each other for a moment before 
           the gates open again.  Three PURPLE-CLAD VIOLA SOLDIERS come 
           down the tunnel.  One of the Viola, MALON, enters the pit.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Those are Viola Guard, the elite of 
                        the Swiss.  I made you available 
                        for their education.

           Malon is much larger than Sarmiento, a true Viking.  They are 
           locked into the arena.
                                 MALON
                        You killed my brother in 
                        Wittenberg.  His wife is with 
                        child.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Let her know her husband was doing 
                        the devil’s work.

           Malon restrainedly looks up to Vitalo.  Vitalo nods soberly.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        Brother.  I derive no pleasure from 
                        this.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I understand.

           Vitalo raises his hand.

           Malon, without a moment to lose, kicks Sarmiento’s feet out 
           from under him.  He mounts Sarmiento at the chest, pummeling 
           away.  With no place to go, Sarmiento tries to cover his head 
           as best he can.

           Malon finds a lose brick to bludgeon Sarmiento, but has his 
           arm hooked, pulling him off, throwing the brick from his 
           hands.  Sarmiento tries to crawl away, when Malon punts him 
           in the ribs.

                                 MALON
                        Where is all that bravery without 
                        your cannons and swords?

           Malon circles Sarmiento... WHAM, another crushing kick.

                                 MALON (cont’d)
                             (to the crowd above)
                        This is the feared “Mace of God”?  
                        The famous inquisitor...

           Sarmiento, too numb to move, takes another kick.  The crowd 
           cheers.  Cara and Umbretto look on with no enthusiasm.   
           Vitalo is captivated by the violence.

                                 MALON (cont’d)
                        The wars in Spain must be between 
                        children and invalids. 

           Malon grabs him by his hair, and drives him headfirst into 
           the nearby brick wall.  Sarmiento falls flat.
                                 MALON (cont’d)
                        Get up!  It is the least I deserve.  
                        I want to face my brother’s killer 
                        before I take his life!

           Sarmiento slowly crawls up onto all fours, then takes a knee, 
           resting himself on his thigh.

                                 MALON (cont’d)
                        Face me, heathen!

           Sarmiento unexpectedly launches the same brick that 
           threatened to crush his skull, hitting him like a wrecking 
           ball to the face.  

           Malon falls back against a nearby wall, nose broken open.  
           The crowd is silenced.  Sarmiento rushes him, blocking 
           Malon’s poor attempt at a punch.  Sarmiento levies a blow to 
           the tottering Malon as if he had just started a fight with a 
           pillow.

           Malon shoves Sarmiento away.  He looks at the soldiers above.

                                 MALON (cont’d)
                        Help me!

           Cara looks at Sarmiento for a split second.

                                 CARA
                             (to a guard)
                        Drop your sword in there, for God 
                        sakes!

           The guard does as commanded--

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                             (before he has time to 
                              react)
                        No!

           The sword drops into the hand of Malon.

           But right as the weapon enters Malon’s hands... a punishing 
           kick slams into Malon’s crotch.  He drops the sword 
           immediately.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                             (to Cara)
                        That was a costly mistake...

           Cara turns away, concealing her satisfied smile.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        Reserve the sword for the next 
                        lesson.

           Sarmiento lands two damaging uppercuts, bobbling Malon’s 
           head.  He grabs Sarmiento loosely by the neck to keep him at 
           bay.  Sarmiento seizes one of his arms.  

           Sarmiento wrangles Malon using his gravity against him, and 
           breaks his arm at the shoulder so it hangs like a sock full 
           of coins.

           Malon screeches in unimaginable agony.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                             (to the surrounding 
                              guards)
                        Get someone in there, now!

           Two Viola guard enter cautiously, swords drawn.  Sarmiento 
           picks Cara’s sword up out of the sand, tests its balance.  
           The two attack him immediately.

           Umbretto leans to Cara, speaking in private.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        My apologies for yesterday.

                                 CARA
                             (wincing)
                        No, it is I who owes you an 
                        apology.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        This Luther business has taken its 
                        toll on me.  Ultimately, it doesn’t 
                        matter.

           The cardinal turns his attention back to the pit.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        We will get our money from those 
                        heathen one way or another.

           Sarmiento makes short order of one of the guards, stabbing 
           him in the stomach, then slicing three of his fingers off his 
           wielding hand.

           Cara looks at Umbretto, blown away by his callousness.

                                 CARA
                             (unbelieving)
                        Of course.  The money.
           The guard cradles the fountain of blood that used to be his 
           hand.  Sarmiento picks up the loose sword.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (to remaining guard in 
                              pit)
                        Next?

           The last guard backs up against the gate.  Sarmiento releases 
           a battery of attacks.  He disarms the guard, just as the gate 
           opens behind him.

           The two St. Angelo guards open the gate in an attempt to pull 
           the Viola into the passage, but Sarmiento jams a sword into 
           the hinge, readying an escape.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Oh my God...

           Sarmiento stabs the Viola guard through the iron bars, throws 
           open the gate, and runs into the passageway.  All that can be 
           HEARD down the tunnel is the Angelos guards fatally failing.

           The onlookers are stunned motionless.  Umbretto makes haste 
           leaving; Cara continues to watch the arena, smiling.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        A prisoner is loose!  Does that 
                        concern anyone?  Catch him!

           The guards rush off.  Vitalo looks at Cara, flabbergasted at 
           the turn of events.

                                 CARA
                        Well.  
                             (looks down on the two 
                              suffering men in the 
                              arena)
                        The Violas won’t be visiting much 
                        anymore.

           Vitalo draws his sword, storming off.

           ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS

           Sarmiento sneaks through the fortress.  He can HEAR the 
           guards frantically searching.

           Sarmiento shadows a solitary guard on patrol, covering his 
           mouth, placing a sword under his throat.

           It’s Armanno.  Again.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        You have very bad luck, young man.  
                        Perhaps you should pray more.

           Armanno face confirms his bad luck.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Where are the children?

           DUNGEON

           Sarmiento presses Armanno forward, looking into each cell as 
           he shoves him along, past the other beaten and maimed 
           PRISONERS.  They reach the final cell... 

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (O.S.)
                        Empty.

           Sarmiento reigns in Armanno forcefully, turning to find 
           Vitalo walking calmly towards them, sword in hand.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        Let me confess to you, brother. 
                        This was not as I intended. 

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Where is Ignacius?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        My intentions were to clear your 
                        name and release the boy.  But when 
                        word returned from Germany that you 
                        had not completed your task--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I will run this man through... 
                        where?

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I had intended this to different.  
                        You were always my favorite.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (raging)
                        Where is he!?

           Vitalo looks into the cell that used to house the children.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        His will be painless.  You have my 
                        word.  
           Sarmiento’s grip loosens on Armanno upon hearing those words.

           Armanno takes the opportunity to swing around, unhanding 
           Sarmiento of his sword.  But Sarmiento offers no defense... 
           he is defeated.

           Armanno stands between Vitalo and Sarmiento, his own rage 
           raising.

                                 ARMANNO
                        You are a menace, Spaniard.  And 
                        now I shall quell you for the good 
                        of the church--

           Armanno is about to drive the sword into the unflinching 
           Sarmiento, when Vitalo pierces the young man’s chest with his 
           own sword.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        That is not your right.

           Armanno falls to his knees, shocked, bleeding through his 
           shirt.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                             (to Armanno)
                        Look at him.  That is the face of 
                        communion.   Finally humbled by 
                        God’s providence.

           Inquisitor Vitalo tosses his sword at Sarmiento’s feet.  
           Armanno flops over dead.  Sarmiento is too overwhelmed to 
           react to anything.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        I am sorry it is this way, brother.

           Other GUARDS flood the passage, taking hold of Sarmiento, who 
           does not resist.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - TORTURE CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Odd and horrifying contraptions highlight the room.  
           Sarmiento, hung by shackles to a wall, is nearly naked, with 
           all of his old and fresh wounds on display.  

           Sarmiento’s skin, now seen in totality, is a testament to 
           surviving death in all it’s forms.

           His face drips blood, his eyes are swollen.  He is inches 
           away from losing his life.
           A GUARD opens the cell door, Cara enters, taken aback by the 
           sight of the flayed Sarmiento.

           She stands before him, but he does take notice.

                                 CARA
                        I heard what you said to the 
                        cardinal.  You were right.

           Sarmiento doesn’t budge.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        You are not who I judged you to be.  
                        I am sorry.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (through thick lips)
                        None are more sorry than I.

           Cara steps closer to him to speak outside of the guard’s 
           purview.

                                 CARA
                        I will try to help you, but you 
                        must continue your fight.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        “My fight”.  All my fights.  The 
                        brutality.  The suffering.  It rose 
                        to this.  My highest achievement.  
                        My boy is to die, as I am.

           Sarmiento fixes his eyes on her ROSARY CRUCIFIX, unable to 
           concentrate on her words.

                                 CARA
                        What you did in Germany was for the 
                        greater good... you have saved an 
                        innocent man, it was righteous.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (mocking her)
                        The right... 
                             (finally eye contact)
                        Your crucifix.  Still hides a 
                        blade?

                                 CARA
                             (she holds the crucifix)
                        Yes.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        Left of my throat.  The spot 
                        between the muscle and the wind 
                        pipe.  The dark vein.

           Cara steps away from the weak Sarmiento.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Feel the soft spot so the cut is 
                        true.  You must run the blade from 
                        left to right.

                                 CARA
                        No.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (whimpering a prayer)
                        God, afford me this moment of 
                        cowardice...

           She whispers to him.

                                 CARA
                        There will be a bloodless 
                        purification tomorrow.  If you 
                        choose to save yourself, I will try 
                        to help you then.

           Sarmiento musters his strength to yell...

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (wide, tearing eyes)
                        I have nothing left!

           Cara steps away from him, signalling the guard to open the 
           cell.

                                 CARA
                        No.  You cannot see it.  But I do.  
                        And your boy does too.

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           Sarmiento and Nasir squint as they are slowly wheeled out on 
           a wooden wagon into the bright sunlight flanked by guards.

           Nasir turns to Sarmiento.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        You prayed over the body of my 
                        father.
           Sarmiento’s beaten face remains stoic.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Pray for the life of my son.

           Sarmiento’s disposition changes.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Your son.  What is his name?

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Momar ibin Nasir.

           Sarmiento lowers his head, quietly invoking his prayer.  
           Nasir does the same in his language.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I invoked the prayer of Saint 
                        Ignacius.  May it not be a curse on 
                        your boy, as it was on mine.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        You are a father as well?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Was.

           Nasir turns his eyes away from Sarmiento deferentially.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Your son is in paradise, take 
                        solace.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        There is nothing in this world that 
                        God has given me to take solace in.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Your actions have denied Allah.  Do 
                        not deny him any longer.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        What would your God have me do?  
                        Fight the world to undo what I have 
                        done?  Sack Rome?  All of Europe?  
                        Bring Christianity to its knees?  I 
                        have given all to one God and He 
                        has shown me nothing.  What will 
                        Another have me do to please Him?
           Sarmiento turns his head down.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I never denied God.  It is He who 
                        hates me.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        No.  He loves you.  But your life 
                        has been a test, He has pushed you 
                        to see where your heart lies, and 
                        He has asked you to make a choice 
                        to believe, now.  For at this 
                        point, where we have descended to 
                        the closest point to Hell, He is 
                        nearest to you.  You hurt, this is 
                        his proof.  This calamity is his 
                        question.  It is never too late to 
                        make amends.  Never.

           EXT. TIBER RIVER PIER - DAY 

           Inquisitor Vitalo and a PLATOON OF SOLDIERS wait on the pier.

           ON a raised viewing platform, Pope Leo X, cardinal Umbretto 
           and Cara watch the executions.

           Two preceding PRISONERS are taken to the pier’s end.  Their 
           hands are tied to 100-pound anchor stones.  Vitalo invokes a 
           prayer, then gives the “Thumbs down”.  

           The guards tip the wagon, and the prisoners are plunged into 
           the river.

           Sarmiento and Nasir’s wagon slowly wheels onto the pier.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I have a question.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Ask it.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        What is As-Salamu Alaykum?

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Where did you learn this?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Your Moors would say this in 
                        Granada.
                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        It means “peace be upon you.”

           They reach the end of the pier.  The guards secure the ropes, 
           the preparations are met.

           ON THE VIEWING PLATFORM...

                                 POPE LEO
                        I do not know why I have to attend 
                        these things, Umbretto.  You know I 
                        abhor violence in my presence. 

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        It shows the people that your hand 
                        can guide as well as punish.  Fret 
                        not, we will be done shortly.

                                 POPE LEO
                             (casually)
                        What must be, must be, I suppose.
                             (swatting away flies)
                        How goes our problem in Germany?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                             (staring at Sarmiento)
                        Into the river in the near future, 
                        I promise you.  

           Cara and Umbretto watch the executions under shade.

                                 CARA
                             (to the Pope)
                        May I place my rosary on the 
                        Spaniard?  To save a soul at its 
                        last moment.

                                 POPE LEO
                        I am sure that man is as soulless 
                        as the stone he is tied to.  But as 
                        you wish.

           ON THE PIER

           Cara walks over to Sarmiento and places her ROSARY CRUCIFIX 
           around his neck.  Sarmiento stands rigidly as she whispers--

                                 CARA
                        Your fight is not over.

           Inquisitor Vitalo eyes Cara as she leaves the pier, returning 
           to the platform.  The cardinal eyes Cara for a moment, 
           expecting some response to their dialog.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Yes?

                                 CARA
                        I forgave him for his trespasses.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        How quaint.

           Vitalo addresses the two men on the wagon.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Heretics.  Do you recant your 
                        wicked ways at your last moment 
                        before Almighty God?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I spent my time in your dungeon 
                        like an animal tendered for 
                        slaughter.  And I was shamed.  But 
                        it is you who will kill a child 
                        who’s only offense is his 
                        existence.  This is not the Lord’s 
                        work.  I took part in this cabal, I 
                        am not above the blame.  Send me 
                        into the water so I may ask my 
                        Maker’s forgiveness to His face.

           Vitalo pulls the crucifix from around Sarmiento’ neck.  Cara 
           is quietly stunned at this turn of events.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I allowed you to confess to me, and 
                        you reject this gift.  Damn you to 
                        hell.

                                 PRINCE NASIR
                             (to all)
                        There is nothing to recant, as I 
                        bear witness to the one true God, 
                        Allah, and his prophet Muhammad. 
                        Blessings be upon him.

           The guards raise the plank, sliding Nasir’s stone towards the 
           water.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (to Nasir)
                        As-Salamu Alaykum, Nasir.  May God 
                        bless your son.
                                 PRINCE NASIR
                        Peace be with you and to yours as 
                        well.

           They peacefully smile to each other-- 

           The water breaks with a heavy swash, plunging Nasir below 
           cloudy water like a rag doll, disappearing instantly. 

           Sweat beads on Sarmiento’s face.

                                 CARA
                        What of the Spaniard’s child?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        This isn’t the time--

                                 POPE LEO
                             (overhearing)
                        His child?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Yes.  A formality.  Vitalo will 
                        handle it--

                                 CARA
                        You promised the boy would not be 
                        harmed.

           The Pope looks at Umbretto, taking interest in his response.  
           Aware he’s being watched...

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        And I will keep my word.

           Umbretto gives Vitalo the “thumbs down”. 

           The boulder dives from the pier into the water, dragging 
           Sarmiento below.

           UNDERWATER

           Sarmiento’s stone is driven to the floor, thudding onto weak 
           wood debris.  The water hangs him upside down, as the air in 
           his lungs pulls his body upwards.  Pulling at his binding, he 
           flips himself over to survey the opaque waterscape--

           He sees a GARDEN OF FRESH AND DECOMPOSED BODIES FLOATING 
           UPSIDE DOWN, gently swaying in the current. 

           Not far from him, he sees Nasir, gagging his air back in, 
           fighting the desire to breathe.
           TIBER RIVER PIER

           Cara restrains herself, but her panic is becoming noticeable.  
           Umbretto notices her discomfort.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        What.

                                 CARA
                        That rosary is damned now.  May I 
                        take it from Inquisitor Vitalo?

           The Cardinal holds his hand out, allowing her to pass.  Cara 
           walks over to Vitalo, putting her hand out.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        The crucifix, please.

           Vitalo dumps it in their hands.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Let this rosary be the last thing 
                        he sees before the river consumes 
                        him.  Might I?

           The Vitalo shrugs.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        If it helps you overcome this 
                        mess...

           Cara walks to the edge of the pier.  Aiming for the rising 
           bubbles, she throws her ROSARY CRUCIFIX into the water.

           UNDERWATER

           Still holding his breath, Sarmiento sees the CRUCIFIX float 
           down.  He tries to grab it, but it’s just out of his reach.

           Panicked, he searches for a solution.  There is none.  He 
           stares at the CRUCIFIX, when the wood debris gives way under 
           the weight of the stone, dropping him into range of the 
           knife, which he pulls from the muddy river floor.

           Frantically sawing at the rope, he undoes one hand.  He pulls 
           at the other, freeing it only after chafing his skin from his 
           wrists.

           He swims to his friend to cut his bindings, but Nasir can no 
           longer resist... he breathes--
           Nasir convulses immediately, a frantic expulsion of energy, 
           his demise upon him.

           His last jolt turns Nasir upside down like the others, 
           locking his dead gaze on Sarmiento.

           Unable to hold his breath any longer, Sarmiento begins his 
           mad dash to the surface.

           He enters the shadow of the pier, ascends, breaking the 
           surface of the water.

           ON THE VIEWING PLATFORM...

                                 POPE LEO
                        Thank God that’s finished.  I have 
                        a luncheon to attend.

           The Pope and his ENTOURAGE stir as they leave the platform.  
           Umbretto waits with Cara until they’ve left earshot.

                                 CARA
                        I am off to Florence.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        This is not the time to be 
                        traveling.  You will stay here.

                                 CARA
                        What is it that makes this time 
                        inopportune?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        The same thing that makes you test 
                        me as often as you have of late.  I 
                        cannot have any distractions.  My 
                        designs hang in the balance, and I 
                        do not want you caught were I 
                        cannot help you.

                                 CARA
                        You mean control me.

           Umbretto says nothing.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        There is a Censure that must be 
                        overseen.  Or do you not care that 
                        Luther’s work may have found its 
                        way to Italy?

           Umbretto turns back to the river, considering her question.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Go.

           Umbretto steps in her way before she can leave the platform.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO (cont’d)
                        Make haste.  I will not tolerate  
                        waiting for you should there be...

                                 CARA
                        Trouble?  I will not keep you 
                        waiting, I promise.

           UNDER THE PIER

           Sarmiento is caught between the automatic panic of breathing 
           his first breaths, and remaining silent to those above.

           The guard’s shadows cast through the cracks in the pier, 
           checking the water, making sure there are no survivors.  
           Sarmiento watches them pass overhead. 

           After a few moments, they leave.  He can hear others above 
           engaged in idle conversation.

           Sarmiento grabs hold of a pile.  And waits.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           UNDER THE PIER - NIGHT

           Cold and wet, Sarmiento shivers uncontrollably.  A small boat 
           floats its way towards him.  A cloaked Cara offers her hand 
           to Sarmiento.  She pulls him aboard and throws a blanket over 
           him to conceal his presence.  She continues to maneuver the 
           boat with the oar.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I should be dead.  And my son--

                                 CARA
                        Your son is sacrificed for you to 
                        enter the work of the greater good.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Too high... too much to bear...

           Cara does not know how to console the heaped Sarmiento, and 
           cannot look at him in this state.
                                 CARA
                             (focusing on the river)
                        When you returned to Rome, I 
                        learned of a shadow assassin 
                        ordered to Germany as insurance if 
                        you did not complete the task.  He 
                        now awaits Luther to arrive in 
                        Worms.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I saw this man.  He followed us.

                                 CARA
                        You are more powerful now as a dead 
                        man than you were alive.  No one 
                        will look for you.  You no longer 
                        exist.  This will give us an 
                        advantage when we head back to 
                        Germany.  There is enough time to 
                        stop Luther’s assassination.

           Sarmiento takes his eyes off her and instinctively curls up 
           to warm himself.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        What now...  am I to side with you?  
                        Or the church, after all this?  
                        Have I become the heretic I have 
                        sought to dispatch all these years?  
                        The only thing I know with 
                        certainty... my son had been marked 
                        for death the moment he was born.

                                 CARA
                        Then do not make his life and yours 
                        a waste.

           She uncovers weapons from under a cloth: a solitary pistol, a 
           bag of ballasts and gun powder... and a mace.  Sarmiento 
           handles the mace curiously.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        A mace.  Ironic.

                                 CARA 
                        I couldn’t recover your weapons.  I 
                        apologize.  This was all I could 
                        put together.  I did, however, find 
                        this.

           Cara hands him his missalette.  He palms the small book as if 
           he found the hand of a long lost lover.
           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 

           MONTAGE of Sarmiento and Cara riding across Europe.  Images 
           of them speeding through villages, stopping in an open field 
           to eat briefly, waiting in a barn to avoid the pouring rain.

           EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

           Cara sets up her sleeping area, Sarmiento is already lying 
           with his back to the orange glow of the fire.  Cara takes a 
           seat.  She looks over to the motionless Sarmiento.

                                 CARA
                        Your son.  He was born whilst you 
                        were a Dominican.

           Sarmiento says nothing.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Where is his mother?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Ignacius was half Moor.  And Vitalo 
                        set us upon Jew, witch and Moor 
                        alike, with all the vigor and 
                        resource imaginable. 

                                 CARA
                        And... what happened to her?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Vitalo would have you believe that 
                        our business was a hunt for purity 
                        by the purest... but what befell 
                        women if they were marked by the 
                        pent rages of the inquisitors was a 
                        Hell unleashed.  She was not 
                        ignorant of this reality.  And she 
                        was aware of my trade when the 
                        inquest turned to her village.

                                                              FLASHBACK

           INT. VILLA - DAY

           Through the muted gauze of distant memories, A BEAUTIFUL 
           MOORISH WOMAN kisses a hand wielding a pistol.  

                                 CARA (V.O.)
                        Tell me it was not left to you...
           The hand belongs to Sarmiento.  Tears stream down both their 
           faces. 

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.)
                        I made it to her before the others.  
                        I have come to see this as the 
                        final favor given to me by an angry 
                        God.

           She turns the weapon on herself, holding his hand through the 
           trigger guard.

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        I did not have the time, I could 
                        not devise a plan...

           Unable to deal with the horror of his situation... both in 
           the past and fresh in his mind in the present, he watches the 
           scene unfold in horror.

                                 SARMIENTO (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        She made the decision I did not 
                        want to make.

            The Moorish woman lifts her thumb onto his index finger...

                                                               FLASH TO

           CAMP

           Sarmiento eyes are shut, denying the haunting memory.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        This was how I came to run from the 
                        Order with a baby in hand.  I did 
                        not run far enough, it seems.  All 
                        I wanted was to raise him a 
                        Spaniard in peace.  There is 
                        nothing left to take from me now.

           Cara turns away from him as she straightens out her sleeping 
           arrangements, pursing her lips in guilt.

           She notices a wet spot on Sarmiento’s back.  She touches him, 
           surprising him out of his melancholy.

           There’s blood on her fingertips.

                                 CARA
                        You’re bleeding.
           He pulls his shirt up to see, but can’t see the wound.  Cara 
           is aghast by the obscene amount of scars covering him.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        You have never known a day’s mercy, 
                        have you?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Why would I. 

           He takes out his missalette and pencil, waiting for her 
           account.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        The wound.  Describe it to me.

                                 CARA
                        I have no idea how to describe it.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Try.

           Unnerved at the prospect, she studies it closely.

                                 CARA 
                        It’s jagged and inconsistent.  Not 
                        from a blade.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (remembering)
                        The wood beneath the pier.
                        How long is it?

           She measures it with her small finger.

                                 CARA
                             (showing him)
                        A quarter finger length.

           Sarmiento, concentrates on his notations, doesn’t notice her 
           placing her crucifix knife in the fire.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        Discolored liquid is bleeding from 
                        the wound.  It needs to be cleaned.

           The blade cooks for a moment, she wipes it down, and places 
           its broad side to the wound.

           Sarmiento launches, not expecting the burn.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        You must warn someone before you 
                        burn them alive!

                                 CARA
                        Stop it.  Sit down.

           He walks off the pain, then seats himself uneasily.  She 
           finishes the cauterization, tearing a strip from her bedding, 
           wrapping Sarmiento’s torso.  He finishes the wrap for her.

           He attempts to smile in thanks.  She smiles at his exchange, 
           and they share an awkward moment.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        We have a long ride tomorrow.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.  We do.

           They both lie down.  This time, they stare at each other 
           through the fire for a moment before turning away.

           EXT. WORMS - STREETS - DAY

           Sarmiento and Cara ride into the town of Worms, Germany.

           CHEERS can be heard nearby.  They ride over to an adjoining 
           street to see a procession, the streets lined with PEOPLE 
           cheering Luther’s arrival.  Martin Luther, overjoyed by the 
           unexpected turnout, rides a wagon, Brother Batiz sitting 
           behind him.

                                 CARA 
                        Come, we must warn him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        All your efforts to erase me will 
                        be wasted if this assassin spots 
                        us.  Follow the procession on foot.

                                 CARA
                        And where are you going?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I will try to find a better vantage 
                        point.  The assassin will make no 
                        attempt in front of these people 
                        here.
                                 CARA
                        If he does, he will disguise 
                        himself.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Or never be seen at all.

           They both look to the--

           ROOFTOPS 

           Sarmiento carefully traverses the rooftops following the 
           procession below.  He sees Cara moving through the crowd on 
           foot, cloaked to keep her presence unknown.

           He scans the profile of the buildings, searching for others.

           As he continues to move with the procession, his foot breaks 
           through a weak patching on a roof.  He pulls his foot free 
           and looks inside.  A MAID is looking back up at him through 
           the hole.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (embarrassed)
                        This hole... needs repairs.
                             (searching for a 
                              concession)
                        Bless this roof, may it... be 
                        fixed.

           He makes the sign of the cross and scurries away.  

           Sarmiento thinks he sees SOMEONE on another rooftop.

           The crowds continue to cheer as Luther’s wagon draws towards 
           the courthouse.  Sarmiento crawls, keeping low, so not to be 
           seen.  He again spots someone moving along the rooftop.

           He sees a long rifle being positioned.  As the rifled 
           assassin adjusts himself, belly down on the rooftop, 
           Sarmiento finally catches a glimpse of who it is: PINTADO.

           Sarmiento finds a better shooting position.  He preps his 
           pistol, pops up to fire, but Pintado is gone.  He looks 
           around frantically.

           He catches a glimpse of Pintado, ducks instinctively behind a 
           chimney-- 

           BOOM!  Pintado fires his powerful rifle, demolishing some 
           bricks that make up the smokestack.
           Sarmiento checks the crowd below.  The procession has moved 
           on; they are too loud to be alarmed by the gunshot.

                                 PINTADO
                             (taking cover, yelling 
                              from across the way)
                        I missed you.  Even though we were 
                        never far from each other.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Pintado!  Why?

                                 PINTADO
                        You take the tone of naivety.  
                        Perhaps now you should try learning 
                        from my decisions, brother, so you 
                        might make better ones in the 
                        future.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        This is evil work you’ve been put 
                        to.

                                 PINTADO 
                             (reloading his rifle)
                        Poor Sarmiento, still the bloodied 
                        idealist.  I followed you, and 
                        Inquisitor Vitalo, in his wisdom, 
                        spoke to me shortly after you left.  
                        He thought it fitting that I take 
                        up the tract you abandoned.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Pintado... please.  Put your weapon 
                        down and let me speak to you as a 
                        friend.

                                 PINTADO
                        Or?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I will ask only once.

           Pintado FIRES and runs for it.  The bullet lands dangerously 
           close to Sarmiento’s head.  Sarmiento rolls from his hiding 
           position to give chase.

           They run parallel to one another, firing their weapons, 
           missing by mere inches.  One of Pintado’s bullets flakes on a 
           nearby smokestack, cutting Sarmiento on the scalp.  They both 
           dive for cover.
                                 PINTADO
                        Why are you not along my side, 
                        ending the abhorrence of Luther?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Luther’s path will continue, with 
                        or without my help.

           Sarmiento touches his wound.  His hand is red with thick 
           blood.  He instinctively takes out the missalette... but 
           thinks better of it and puts it away.

                                 PINTADO
                        What has become of you, Sarmiento?  
                        You were once the cornerstone to 
                        the conquest of Christendom.  

                                 SARMIENTO
                        It is by God’s hand I have become 
                        this.  And today I fight for 
                        myself, as God wishes.

                                 PINTADO
                        Stop fooling yourself.  You and 
                        I... we have always fought for 
                        ourselves.

           Pintado fires at Sarmiento, then hides to reload his pistol 
           and rifle.

           Sarmiento looks down to the street: a good two stories down, 
           enough to break his legs if he falls.

           Sarmiento takes advantage of Pintado’s reloading.  He runs 
           towards the building across the narrow street and jumps--

           barely catches the edge of the building--

           STREETS

           Cara searches for any sign of Sarmiento, sees him hanging 
           from a rooftop in the distance.

           HANGING FROM ROOFTOP

           Sarmiento tries to pull himself up, but the weight of his 
           weapons drag him down; the loose wood shingles pull from the 
           roof like cards in a deck.
           Pintado turns from his hiding space to see his mentor in 
           peril.  He paces arrogantly over to Sarmiento, pulling a 
           pistol from Sarmiento’s hand, tossing it away.

           Pintado slings his rifle, and points a pistol to Sarmiento’s 
           head.

                                 PINTADO
                        This pistol is new.  Not given to 
                        me by the King of Spain, of course.  
                        You always had the best.

           Sarmiento sees Cara running towards the building in the 
           reflection of a nearby window.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Will you hear my confession, 
                        brother?  A final mercy for your 
                        mentor.

           Pintado is genuinely moved by the request.

                                 PINTADO
                        Of course, it would be... a great 
                        honor.  Please, go ahead.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I have committed great sin.

                                 PINTADO
                        That I know, brother.  Please, save 
                        the list.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I lost everything.  My family, my 
                        faith, my love.  I never realized  
                        I was at fault... I was too afraid.

                                 PINTADO
                        You, afraid?  Of what?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Afraid that there was a God, and 
                        that he hated me.
                             (tearing from his 
                              realization)
                        So I hated him back.  Forgive me, 
                        please.  God, forgive me.

           Pintado, captivated by Sarmiento’s genuine confession, snaps 
           out of it.
                                 PINTADO
                        I have little time, so I forgo the 
                        penance and forgive you all your 
                        trespasses.  May I have someone to 
                        do the same for me when I am at my 
                        end.

           Pintado makes the sign of the cross on Sarmiento’s forehead, 
           then compassionately touches his straining hands.

                                 PINTADO (cont’d)
                        Thank you, brother.  I will cherish 
                        that moment forever.

           Pintado presses the rifle to Sarmiento’s head, when an 
           BALLAST LODGES ITSELF IN PINTADO’S ARM.  He drops the rifle 
           off the building, staggering back, holding his spouting 
           wound.

           Sarmiento finds the strength to pull himself back up--

           ROOFTOPS

           Sarmiento takes the smoking pistol from Cara’s trembling 
           hands.  Pintado, agonizing over his arm, steps away from the 
           now armed Sarmiento.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Drop the musket.

           Pintado lowers his shoulder, letting the slinged rifle slide, 
           falling at his feet.

                                 PINTADO
                        If you would have only done what 
                        was asked of you--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        We both suffer from the same 
                        affliction then, Pintado.  We only 
                        do what we are asked, never what 
                        should be done.

           Pintado defiantly resists taking a knee... eventually 
           collapsing in pain.

                                 CARA
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        Are you okay?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.
           She notices he’s bleeding from his neck.  She walks over, 
           removing a sash to bandage his wound.  

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        It’s fine.

                                 CARA
                        No, it’s not.  Let me see.

           She tends to his wound, dabbing it clean.  Sarmiento diverts 
           his attention from Pintado--  

           BANG-- Cara shudders.  Smoke flutters from a new hole in 
           Pintado’s robe, revealing a new pistol.  Sarmiento’s eyes 
           widen as Cara falls.  He takes hold of her.

           Pintado staggers away from them.   He pulls the arrow from 
           his arm.  Sarmiento cocks his pistol and takes aim --

           CLICK.  Empty.  Pintado exhales in relief.  They stare at 
           each other.

           No longer able to hold her up, Sarmiento sits, keeping 
           pressure on her wound.

                                 PINTADO
                        Have I not learned?  You thought me 
                        incapable, uncompassionate?  Stay 
                        with her.  Let me finish what I 
                        came here for, and all will be at 
                        peace.  

           He runs off along the rooftops, picking up his rifle as he 
           goes.  Sarmiento is torn between staying with Cara and 
           chasing down Pintado.  

           He checks her wound; dark blood flows from the shot to the 
           chest.  He takes the sash and covers it.

                                 CARA
                        Do not bother to write this one in 
                        your missalette.

           She struggles to remove something from around her neck.  It’s 
           Ignacius’ WOODEN CRUCIFIX.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        He asked me to give this to you.  
                        Ignacius is alive, the cardinal 
                        promised his protection in front of 
                        the Pope.  Vitalo has not harmed 
                        him--
                                 SARMIENTO
                        My son... you lied to me?

                                 CARA
                        Forgive me... how could I get you 
                        here... I could not do this alone.  
                        Forgive--

           Sarmiento wraps the crucifix around his wrist.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        We must get you down from here--

                                 CARA
                        I will survive this wound, but 
                        Luther will not survive that 
                        assassin.

           She swats his hands off her wound.  He tries to invoke a 
           prayer for her, but she shoves him away.

                                 CARA (cont’d)
                        You fool, do not waste my time 
                        praying over my blood.  Go!

           She whips her head at him, angered by his lingering.  Pained, 
           she applies pressure to the wound as she watches him take off 
           in an all-out run following Pintado.

           EXT. WORMS - COURTHOUSE - DAY 

           Luther’s wagon drives towards the courthouse, crowds still in 
           tow.  Pintado now follows along in the mass, rifle hidden 
           under his robe.

           The wagon pulls up to the entrance of the building, Luther 
           and Brother Batiz dismount.  Pintado discreetly looks around 
           for a place to range his target.  He detours away from the 
           hordes.

           He sneaks his way onto a parked cart, and hides amongst the 
           baskets and sacks.  No one notices him taking aim at Luther 
           through the slats.

           POV - DOWN PINTADO’S RIFLE

           of Luther shaking hands, embracing his followers.  Brother 
           Batiz watches Luther, gratified for him.
           Pintado sets the matchlock to fire.  He fingers the trigger.  
           Right as he is about to fire, WATER POURS DOWN onto the 
           matchlock.

           Pintado searches for the source of the water, sees Sarmiento 
           looking down on him from the rooftop a story above, pouring 
           his wineskin.  

           Pintado bolts from the cart, Sarmiento jumps down to follow.

           Pintado makes his way through the crowd, straight for Martin 
           Luther.  He keeps his composure as he pushes his way forward.

           Sarmiento rushes towards him, desperate to stop Pintado.

           Brother Batiz is surprised and alarmed to see Pintado, whose 
           focus is squarely on Luther.  Brother Batiz blocks his path.  

           Before he is a mere two yards from Martin Luther, Pintado 
           draws his dagger discreetly.  As his hand readies for the 
           strike, Sarmiento grabs hold of his wrist, stopping Pintado.

           A silent arm wrestle for the knife begins.

                                 PINTADO
                        Don’t stop me--

           Brother Batiz sees Sarmiento and comes over to aid him--

           Martin Luther notices the struggle in the crowd, but is 
           distracted--

           Pintado kicks the portly monk, dropping him to his knees.  
           Sarmiento uses the diversion, releases Pintado, who 
           impulsively slices at him.  

           The moment the knife passes, Sarmiento strikes Pintado’s 
           neck, stunning him, then arm locks Pintado, disarming him.

           Using the downed Brother Batiz as a step, Pintado kicks free 
           of Sarmiento’s half nelson.  He reaches into Sarmiento robe, 
           grabs  his pistol, and points it at Martin Luther.  

           Before there is a chance to fire, Sarmiento DRIVES CARA’S 
           CRUCIFIX DAGGER INTO HIS CHEST. Pintado goes limp.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Your robe--

           The onlookers sees the tumult between the men, but Brother 
           Batiz throws his robe over Pintado’s wound.
                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                             (to onlooker)
                        The man is sick.

           Sarmiento is shocked to hear Brother Batiz speak, but wastes 
           no time dragging the body away before anyone notices.

           Martin Luther, largely unaware of the commotion through the 
           surrounding crowds, enters the courthouse unharmed.  

           ALLEY

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz pull Pintado behind a mound of 
           chopped wood in an alley.

                                 PINTADO
                             (final moments)
                        May I confess?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        We were both lied to.  We have been 
                        wronged, brother.

           Pintado tries to hold his breath, trying to sustain himself 
           longer... but he doesn’t have the strength to hold on.

                                 PINTADO
                        I am sorry...

           His lungs deflate, leaving him limp.

           Sarmiento hangs his head, tired of seeing those around him 
           perish.  Brother Batiz pats him on the back.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        I am glad to see you.

           Sarmiento embraces Brother Batiz.  He relaxes, perhaps for 
           the first time in years, feeling safe in his old friend’s 
           arms.  Sarmiento composes himself.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Your vow--

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        Had to be broken.  I would have 
                        gone mad if I didn’t tell Luther to 
                        shut up.  Did you ride alone?
           STREETS

           Sarmiento and Brother Batiz look up to the sloped roof where 
           Sarmiento left Cara.  She sits there, hunched over, eyes 
           looking into nothing, frozen still.  Her blood runs down the 
           roof, dripping into a puddle on the street.

           Sarmiento can do nothing but stare at her, undecided whether 
           to cry or to become angered.  Luther joins them.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Dear God.  This has been all too 
                        costly.

           Luther puts his hand on the motionless Sarmiento.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont’d)
                        I will pray for your suffering.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        That woman is the one who saved 
                        your life, Luther.  Pray for her.

           Squatting down to hide the welling tears in his eyes, 
           Sarmiento runs his hand through her puddled blood.  He rubs 
           his fingers together, feeling her for the first time.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        How does the hearing go?

                                 MARTIN LUTHER 
                        The emperor will side with Rome... 
                        but it makes no difference.  
                        Whether I am the face or someone 
                        else, the people want change.  It’s 
                        not what I wanted, but it’s not 
                        what the Pope wanted either.  Where 
                        will you both go now?

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                             (to Sarmiento)
                        To Spain?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        To Rome.

                                 Brother Batiz 
                        That’s suicide.  Let’s go back to 
                        Granada... seek your peace finally.

           Sarmiento raises his arm, showing Brother Batiz the WOODEN 
           CRUCIFIX.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        There is a chance Ignacius is alive 
                        somewhere in that fortress.  So I 
                        will return.  

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        God have mercy on any who stand in 
                        our way, he’s alive... to Rome 
                        then.

           Sarmiento pats Brother Batiz solidly.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER
                        Sarmiento...

           Sarmiento stops to listen.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER (cont’d)
                        Have you found God in this journey?

                                 SARMIENTO 
                        I have found myself.

           EXT. EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE

           MONTAGE of Sarmiento and Brother Batiz tearing through 
           Europe, day and night, only resting to change the exhausted 
           horses they pushes to the brink.

           Sarmiento takes out his missalette and makes a new notation 
           in his scripted, poetic cursive:

           “Ignacius.  My son.  I will not rest until you are by my 
           side.  

           Allana.  My love.  Forgive me.”

           Sarmiento closes the missalette and tosses it in a fire.

           EXT. ROME - NIGHT

           Speeding through the emptied streets of Rome, Sarmiento and 
           Brother Batiz stop at an--

           EMBANKMENT

           --near the Tiber river.  They tie their horses, leaving some 
           weapons within the horses’ packs.  
           He loads the remaining pistol, slings his mace, and takes 
           Cara’s rosary knife from a pack.  He hangs it from his neck.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        Are you ready?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Are you?  This could end up being 
                        very bloody... even costing your 
                        life.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        I’ve never had a better reason to 
                        live and die than this.

           Brother Batiz slings a sword on his back.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Very well.

           They make their way along the embankment toward the colossal 
           St. Angelo Fortress.

           TIBER RIVER

           A bored ANGELO’S GUARD paces the pier.  The low tide has 
           exposed the muddy river bank.  The guard leisurely looks down 
           into the mud... and notices a conspicuous rope moving under 
           the pier. 

           Curious, the guard makes his way under, wading through the 
           thick mud.  He grabs the end of the rope, seeing that it 
           leads back up onto the other side of the pier.

           He walks back up to the pier, still holding the rope, to see 
           it is tied to one of the drowning boulders.  

           Unease settles on the guard, he turns around to find Brother 
           Batiz smiling at him, and Sarmiento tossing a noose around 
           his neck, tightening to the point of strangulation, leaving 
           the guard only a wheeze as his cry for help.

           Sarmiento pulls the guard to the boulder, they tie him 
           tightly to the stone.

                                 ST. ANGELO GUARD
                             (wheezing)
                        Don’t kill me, please.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You’re fortunate today.  I am here 
                        to save lives instead of take them.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARMIENTO (cont'd)
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Prepare those boats, more will be 
                        returning with me.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        What are you planning?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I am a heretic, just like the men 
                        in that dungeon are now.  They 
                        deserve to be as free as my son or 
                        I.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        Go, all shall be ready for your 
                        return.

           Sarmiento slips into the night at the guard struggles.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ (cont’d)
                             (to the guard)
                        So.  I imagine you weren’t 
                        expecting an invasion tonight, were 
                        you?

           The guard shakes his head, defeated.

           EXT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - WALL - NIGHT

           Sarmiento scales the high walls of the fortress carefully, 
           making no sound to alarm the SENTRY above.  Sarmiento creeps 
           onto the walkway, behind the clueless man.

           The priest knocks the helpless sentry out without so much as 
           a struggle.

           Running along the fortress wall, he passes over the iron 
           barred barrier, takes note of a massive iron cauldron.  
           Inside, congealed oil.

           The next SENTRY unknowingly makes his way into a obscured 
           turret.  Sarmiento follows him in... a short and silent 
           commotion, and the threat is over.

           Sarmiento emerges from the turret and throws the alarm bell 
           into the muddy moat below.  He snags a torch from the 
           gangway, makes his way back to the cauldron, and ignites the 
           wood below it.
           COURTYARD

           A young guard MICKAEL patrols the courtyard lazily with 
           ANOTHER GUARD.  Mickael stops to adjust his shoe.  

           When he rises, his companion is dead a few feet in front of 
           him, with an arrow dug into his neck.

           Mickael is about to yell, when a pistol touches the back of 
           his head.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (from behind)
                        Not a sound, or I will remove your 
                        brain from your head.

                                 MICKAEL
                        You will not escape, the fort is 
                        shut tight.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        On the contrary, I am trying to get 
                        in.

                                 MICKAEL
                        What do you want here?

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (pointing)
                        I want you to push that cannon over 
                        there.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Mickael pushes the cannon from its position, pointing it at 
           the barrier separating the fort from Rome.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Where are the rest of the guards?

                                 MICKAEL
                        On duty in Tuscany, or at the 
                        Basilica.  The rest sleep.

           Finished pushing, Mickael submissively raises his hands.

           He reluctantly turns around to see his captor.
                                 MICKAEL (cont’d)
                             (recognizing Sarmiento)
                        My God... I saw you die in the 
                        river.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You did.  I’ve returned to haunt 
                        this place, as the Lord has cursed 
                        any who have come in contact with 
                        me.

           Sarmiento cold cocks Mickael, knocking him out.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - DUNGEON

           Sarmiento plucks the cell keys from a now DEAD GUARD.  

           THE PRISONERS remain silent, either too weak to make a 
           commotion, or too aware that Sarmiento might be their only 
           salvation.

           He looks at the men behind the bars.  Their spirits are 
           broken from torture and starvation.  Basil Silber snaps awake 
           when Sarmiento opens his cell.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        How is this possible...

                                 SARMIENTO
                        How often are the guards passing 
                        through?

           Basil rises to check the walkway and sees the dead guard.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        He was the only one.  What are you 
                        doing here?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Trying to undo what I have done.  
                        For whatever it’s worth.

           Sarmiento unlocks Silber’s cell.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        You intend to free all of us?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Everyone.
                                 BASIL SILBER
                        Have you gone mad?  We will never 
                        get out alive!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You can stay in your cell if you’d 
                        like.  I can assure you won’t 
                        survive what they have in store for 
                        you.

           Silber rushes out of his cell to grab the dead guard’s sword.

           Sarmiento tosses the keys to Basil.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I have secured a path to the river.  
                        If these men can survive the cold 
                        water... 

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        A sea of ice will not keep us here.

           They opening cells, aiding the weak prisoners out.

                                 BASIL SILBER (cont’d)
                        You came back.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Let’s hope my coup will go 
                        unnoticed for as long as possible 
                        so it has some meaning.

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Sarmiento leads the prisoners, some aiding each other, some 
           now wielding swords, across the courtyard to--

           TIBER RIVER

           Sarmiento and Basil aid the men down to the river bank where 
           some run into the water and swim away, others wade carefully, 
           trying to avoid a scene.

           The tied up guard watches droves of prisoners dash away into 
           the river.  He shakes his head soberly... he’ll be in deep 
           shit in the morning.

           Brother Batiz comes to Sarmiento.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        The boy?
                                 SARMIENTO
                        Not yet...

           A guard can be HEARD YELLING from a distant corner of the 
           fortress... they have been found out.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        Your son is in there?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Yes.  There is a chance he is still 
                        alive.  

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        Then I will stay with you.

           The remaining men come to Basil’s side and join him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I would try to dissuade you... but 
                        I need as much help as I can get.  
                        Follow me.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS

           Sarmiento, Brother Batiz, and the crew rush into the 
           fortress.  Guards can be heard stirring.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        There are only a few stairwells up 
                        and down... we will control those 
                        places.

           They run the halls.  Sarmiento points to different 
           stairwells, sending a few men up each one as they pass them.  
           The rest exit into the--

           EXT. COURTYARD

           Sarmiento points a few men over to the cannons as they stream 
           in.

                                 SARMIENTO
                             (pointing out the cannon 
                              he set up)
                        Pull the other cannons next to that 
                        one.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        It is pointed at the gate.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        I know.  I put it there.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        You plan on using cannons?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        If I could remember a time when I 
                        didn’t need cannons...

           Brother Batiz and the men pull the cannons to the desired 
           location.

           Sarmiento and a few other men run up another stairwell to the-

           WALL

           --where the prisoners dispatch a GUARD.  Sarmiento rushes 
           across the wall, past the now-boiling oil, to another GUARD, 
           who is ringing a bell.

           The guard defends himself, slashing wildly at Sarmiento.  Two 
           prisoners rush past Sarmiento and overcome the guard.

           Sarmiento looks into the courtyard, to see soldiers hustling 
           behind windows of a middle floor.  Using all his force, he 
           turns one of the cannons on the interior wall, packs the 
           barrel and... 

           BOOOM!  He fires the cannon, blowing a hole in the courtyard 
           walls!  Soldiers are flung across the room.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Prepare yourselves, it comes!

           INT. VITALO’S CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Awaken from the tumult, Vitalo shudders at the SOUND of 
           explosions roaring through his fortress.  He throws open the 
           door and grabs one of his PERSONAL GUARDS.

                                 PERSONAL GUARD #1
                        We’re under attack!

           Vitalo slaps the guard across the face.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I know that, you ass!  From where?!
           EXT. COURTYARD

           Sarmiento rushes into the courtyard as a pack of GUARDS come 
           out.  Sarmiento points to the makeshift cannoneers to stay at 
           their posts.

           Sarmiento attacks along side the armed prisoners.

           Vitalo looks into the courtyard through a demolished wall to 
           see the chaos of cannons and swords attacking St. Angelo’s.  

           He finds Sarmiento in the thick of the battle.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I cannot believe my eyes... you’re 
                        alive.

           Sarmiento sees Vitalo, pointing his sword at him.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I’ve come back for my son.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                             (to his guards)
                        Stop him!

           Vitalo runs back into the fortress.  Sarmiento pursues.

           INT. ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS

           Sarmiento rushes past the skirmishes, chasing after Vitalo 
           when--

           BLAM!  Sarmiento ducks the fragmenting stone from the wall.  
           Vitalo’s personal guard prepares another shot.

           One of the ARMED PRISONERS tries to stop Vitalo from 
           descending the stairwell, but Vitalo makes short work of the 
           prisoner, running him through with ease.

           As Vitalo and one of his guards race down the stairs, 
           Sarmiento chases up to the other who is about to point his 
           rifle--

           BLAM!  Sarmiento bats the rifle away, blasting a nearby wall.  
           The personal guard draws his dagger, but Sarmiento locks his 
           arm, continuing the direction of the draw--

           --directly into the guards own belly.  Sarmiento slices him 
           once more for good measure before taking off down the--
           STAIRWELL

           Sarmiento rushes down the stairs.  The commotion, cannon fire 
           and screaming can be hear from the fortress above.

           DUNGEON

           Vitalo, at the end of the block, tries to unlock a cell with 
           his various keys.  His guard stands watching the stairwell 
           tensely, his sword at the ready.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        Keep watch.

                                 PERSONAL GUARD #1
                        I know, I know!

           Vitalo fumbles with the keys, dropping them accidently.  He 
           picks them up frantically, returning to the lock.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        That man is more cunning that 
                        you’ll know, be ready--

           SLIKT... Vitalo turns around to see his guard... with a 
           dagger flung into his forehead.

           As the guard falls over dead, Vitalo turns calmly, staring 
           down the long hall at Sarmiento.  Vitalo cracks his knuckles 
           and draws his sword.

           Sarmiento, mace in hand, paces towards Vitalo.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        The Mace... and his mace.  Did you 
                        plan that for me?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Sadly, I am not that clever.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I was told not to harm the child.

           Sarmiento looks through the thicket of bars... making eye 
           contact with Ignacius.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        I knew that would come back to 
                        haunt me.
                                 SARMIENTO
                        You now have the chance to kill me 
                        again.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        What a penance you have delivered 
                        yourself, Arturo.

           They enter striking distance, immediately taking up a fray.  
           Sarmiento handles the mace adeptly, Vitalo strikes at 
           Sarmiento sharply, leaving little room for error.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        To continually die at my hands is a 
                        horror I do not even wish on you.

           Vitalo scores a small victory when he punctures Sarmiento’s 
           skin.  Sarmiento is surprised.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You are better than I remember.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO
                        I did not become the chief heretic 
                        hunter of Castille by kissing 
                        rings.

           Vitalo strikes again.  Sarmiento knocks him in the mouth, 
           drawing blood.  

           Sarmiento thuds him in the side with the mace.  Vitalo kicks 
           him back, almost enjoying the pain.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        I wish you were still by my side, 
                        brother.

           Sarmiento drives Vitalo back, plucking the sword from the 
           dead guard’s hand, doubling the attack.  Vitalo, however 
           stays in pace, the exchange is heated and even.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        Together, we could have stopped any 
                        fire at the gates of Rome.

           With precision, Sarmiento ducks a barreling slice from 
           Vitalo.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        But now, I will put you and your 
                        son in the fire for this.
           Sarmiento blocks another slice and stuns Vitalo with a 
           glancing blow to the head with the mace.  Sarmiento then 
           chops Vitalo’s hamstrings, folding him at the knees to the 
           floor.  

           Without hesitation, he drives the sword through Vitalo’s 
           stomach, staking the blade through to the ground.

                                 INQUISITOR VITALO (cont’d)
                        We are not through.  Our fates are 
                        intertwined--

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Then we will continue this fight in 
                        Hell.

           Sarmiento takes Vitalo’s sword in hand and drives it through 
           Vitalo’s chest, as a toreador would to a dying bull.

           Vitalo hangs dead, suspended by the two swords staked through 
           him.  Sarmiento drops the mace at Vitalo’s feet.

           After a moment catching his breath, Sarmiento takes the keys 
           from the floor, and opens--

           THE CELL

           Sarmiento enters, falling to his knees before Ignacius.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        I am sorry my son.

           Ignacius races into Sarmiento’s arms, hugging him tightly.

                                 IGNACIUS
                        I forgive you.

           Sarmiento cries into the boy’s shoulder.

           INT. VATICAN CITY - TOWER OF NICHOLAS - NIGHT

           The Pope, coughing thick bloodied phlegm, hears the turmoil 
           from his bed high up in his tower.  Cardinal Umbretto comes 
           to his side.

                                 POPE LEO
                             (groggy and weak)
                        What in blazes is happening...

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I don’t know.  We have sent a 
                        squadron of Viola to--
           Cannon blasts can be HEARD in the distance, buckling stone 
           walls.

                                 POPE LEO
                             (coughing)
                        A squadron?!  Send them all!  We 
                        are under attack, you imbecile!

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        As you order, your Excellency.  But 
                        please, come back in.  Your 
                        sickness will not be helped by this 
                        cold air.

           The cardinal closes the balcony doors.

                                 POPE LEO
                        Where is that infernal doctor?

           Umbretto pulls a vial from his pocket.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Let me prepare you another remedy.

           ST. ANGELO’S FORTRESS - WALL - NIGHT

           Cannonballs launch, soldiers and prisoners broil on all 
           floors, decimating the innards of the fort as if it were a 
           battlefield.

           Sarmiento returns to the courtyard with Ignacius in hand.  
           Brother Batiz sees the boy, and rushes over to him.  Brother 
           Batiz embraces the boy as if her were his own son.

           A LOOK-OUT PRISONER peeks over the wall to see the VIOLA 
           SQUADRON riding toward the bridge.  He calls down to 
           Sarmiento.

                                 LOOK OUT PRISONER
                        The Viola are coming!

           Sarmiento calls to OTHER PRISONERS on the wall.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Raise the barrier!

           The prisoners look at him as if he were crazy, and hesitates.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (to Brother Batiz)
                        Take the boy back to the horses.  
                        Wait there for me.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (to Ignacius)
                        I will be right behind you.

           Brother Batiz rushes out of the courtyard with the boy.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (to the prisoners)
                        I have fought hordes with less men 
                        than we have here.  Do as I say, 
                        and I promise you, we will have a 
                        chance.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        A chance?  That’s not very 
                        inspiring.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Inspiration comes easily to those 
                        who want to survive.

           Sarmiento points to the boiling oil.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Man that lift.  You’ll know what to 
                        do.

           Sarmiento stands at the mouth of the bridge, tempting them to 
           come.  The horses’ hooves pound the bridge as they race 
           towards Sarmiento.

           Sarmiento runs back through open gate.  Sarmiento takes up 
           fighting a guard right as the horsebacked Viola guard are 
           about to enter, when--

           The boiling liquid pours from the wall, burning horses and 
           riders alike, dropping them like withering flowers.

           COURTYARD

           The battle has taken a turn for Sarmiento’s forces, the 
           fighting has abated, aside from small skirmishes that still 
           rage within the fortress walls.

           The prisoner on the wall calls to Sarmiento once again.

                                 LOOK OUT PRISONER
                        More on the way!

           IN THE DISTANCE

           A BATTALION of Viola guard, Swiss Guard, wagons and horsemen 
           snake their way toward the fortress.
           Sarmiento can hear the insurmountable odds coming.  He runs 
           up a stairwell to the wall.

                                  SARMIENTO
                             (to look-out)
                        Use everything we have... collapse 
                        the bridge--
                             (he points)
                        At that corner stone.  Then run for 
                        the river.

           The battalion begins crossing the bridge.  The wall fires 
           into the mass.  Guards are flung off the bridge, into the 
           moat below... 

           The weight of the horses, soldiers and wagons collapse part 
           of the bridge.  Half are stranded on the Rome side, while a 
           portion now rush the Fortress on the remainder of the bridge. 

           Sarmiento, with the gate still open, points to his cannoneers 
           on the courtyard ground.  When they draw within range, he 
           signals them to fire-- wiping the remainder away.

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                             (to those manning the 
                              chain lock to the 
                              barrier)
                        Close the gate!

           The lock comes loose, dropping the barrier.

           COURTYARD

           Basil, bloodied from the battle, finds Sarmiento coming out 
           of a stairwell.

                                 BASIL SILBER
                        What now?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        They will be upon us with odds that 
                        we will soon not be able to match.
                             (to everyone)
                        Escape.  While there is any chance 
                        left.

           EXT. TIBER RIVER PIER

           Sarmiento aids a few of the injured as they make their escape 
           on a remaining boat.  The tied up guard continues to watch 
           the coup.
           Basil, ignoring the guard, pushes the boat off and watches 
           stoically as Sarmiento rushes down the embankment, and into 
           the darkness.

           EMBANKMENT

           Sarmiento sneaks up on Brother Batiz and Ignacius.  He takes 
           a horse.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        The soldiers will swarm that 
                        fortress and find nothing.  This 
                        gives me the space I need for the 
                        final ploy in this mess.

                                 BROTHER BATIZ
                        The Cardinal.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        It is only fitting he know the end 
                        to his own story.
                             (to Ignacius)
                        Then we go.

           EXT. ROME - STREETS - NIGHT

           Sarmiento rides at blazing speeds into the streets of Rome, 
           towards the Vatican.

           EXT. ROME - SIDE ENTRANCE TO VATICAN - NIGHT

           TWO LETHARGIC GUARDS stand watch at a small gate at the rear 
           of the Vatican.  They look like they’ve been given the worst 
           post... for good reason.  

           The streets are empty, not a soul is stirring.  In the very 
           distance they hear a gunshot--

           POP!  The wall fragments behind them.  Startled, one looks 
           around, more curious than alarmed.  The other inspects the 
           shattered brick.

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #1
                        What in blazes was that?

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #2
                        Looks like a ballast hit this.
           STREETS

           Sarmiento, driving his horse like a missile careening to it’s 
           target, readies his pistol again.  The side entrance to the 
           gate is at the very end of the long road-- 

           He’s basically taking shots at them from across the city...  
           BANG!

           SIDE ENTRANCE TO VATICAN

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #2
                             (referring to the gunshot)
                        Did you hear that?

           Another brick pops behind them, they are becoming alarmed.

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #2 (cont’d)
                        Are we being sacked?  Again?

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #1
                             (looking down the road)
                        Hey... look there--

           He points to Sarmiento riding towards them in the distance.

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #1 (cont’d)
                        A courier?

           STREETS

           Sarmiento readies his pistol.  As the horse draws closer to 
           the gate, he takes his time to aim...

           SIDE ENTRANCE TO VATICAN

           Both the guards squint, trying to make out the barreling 
           horsemen, when BANG! Another shot ring out.

                                 LETHARGIC GUARD #2
                        He’s shooting at us!

           A mere moment later--

           The ballast pounds the wall behind them.  The look at each 
           other... drop their pikes and run for it.

           Sarmiento rides up to the gate and enters.
           INT. VATICAN CITY - VILLA - NIGHT

           The Cardinal gathers his belongings, grabbing a SERVANT who’s 
           stirred by his commotion.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Where is Cara?  Go find her!  She 
                        should be back from Florence by 
                        now.  Take her to the country villa 
                        and make sure she waits for me 
                        there.  Understood?  She must be 
                        away for the coming turmoil.

           He shoves the servant away, continuing his panicked packing.

                                 SARMIENTO (O.S.)
                        The turmoil is within your doors, 
                        cardinal.  It is you who 
                        orchestrated this mess.  I will 
                        inform the Pope of your betrayal, 
                        and it will finally be you who 
                        hangs.

           The servant runs in fear upon hearing the disembodied voice.  
           The cardinal, however, doesn’t run, holding a coal lamp 
           aloft, illuminating the creeping Sarmiento.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Pope Leo is not taking audiences 
                        anymore.  He will not see the 
                        morning, as he is taken with the 
                        malaria... or whatever it is that 
                        the doctors will end up diagnosing.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You’ve fouled the church.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        I have saved it.  The Germans 
                        needed to see Luther as he is: the 
                        devil.  I merely helped reinforce 
                        the notion.  If it were not for me, 
                        the church would be lost in a few 
                        short years...

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You have lost more than you know. 

           Sarmiento tosses her ROSARY CRUCIFIX at his feet.  Umbretto 
           sees it is the same she threw into the water at the 
           executions.
           The cardinal drops the lamp... the hot coals spill across the 
           floor.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        Where... where is she?

                                 SARMIENTO
                        She died on a rooftop in Germany.  
                        Saving Martin Luther.  Can you 
                        suffer that betrayal?

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        My daughter... no.

           Sarmiento is paused by Umbretto’s disclosure.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Your child paid for your 
                        indiscretion with her life.  You 
                        are now like I was when you sent me 
                        to the bottom of the river... 
                        you’ve lost all.

           The flickering coals light a tapestry in the hall.  Neither 
           of the men budge, the fire is appropriate for the moment.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                             (tears and rage)
                        And whose side did you herald?  The 
                        reformers will not have you, the 
                        church has erased your name, you 
                        will be nothing, remembered by no 
                        one... all for your own cause.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I have my son.  I found myself.  
                        God favors me today.  Amen.

           The walls catch fire.

                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                        The only thing I had!  Cara... is 
                        dead!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        All for your own cause.

           The cardinal charges at Sarmiento, almost seeking consolation 
           in his arms.  Sarmiento grabs the weak old man by the throat, 
           holding him away as he trembles in despair, rage.
                                 CARDINAL UMBRETTO
                             (tears, panic)
                        For what!  What have I now!  Kill 
                        me!  Damn you, do what I ask!

                                 SARMIENTO
                        You do not get the honor of dying 
                        by my hand.

           Sarmiento shoves him back.  Umbretto falls to his knees, 
           heaped on the floor, crying as the building burns all around 
           him.

           The building whips into an inferno.  Sarmiento watches 
           Umbretto, who has no intention of leaving.  The flames become 
           even too much of a threat for Sarmiento.

           EXT. VILLA

           As Sarmiento walks out of from the fire, Umbretto screams, 
           both in sorrow and in pain.

           MONTAGE

           Brother Batiz and Sarmiento, with Ignacius saddled with him 
           slowly ride the countryside, back to Spain.

           EXT. SPANISH VILLA - DAY 

           Sarmiento stands at the porch of a quiet country villa, 
           watching Brother Batiz and Ignacius play in the grass.

           Ignacius runs over to Sarmiento, pulling him over to join 
           them.  Sarmiento finally smiles as his son leads him.

           Sarmiento overlooks his stretch of peaceful land... and sees 
           a SCOUT watching them from atop a hill.  Sarmiento maintains 
           his composure as he pats Brother Batiz on the back.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Take the boy inside for supper.  I 
                        am going for a brief ride.

           PAST THE HILL...

           Sarmiento rides over the hill to find TWENTY MOORISH RIDERS 
           waiting for him there.
           Sarmiento makes no motion for his sword or the battery of 
           pistols slung from his horse.

           A WARRIOR dismounts to face Sarmiento.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR
                        Allah has delivered you back to 
                        Spain.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        So it seems.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR
                        The sultan of Morocco, his 
                        greatness, Ahmad al-Araj demands 
                        your capture for the death of King 
                        Nasir.

           The warriors unsheathe their swords carefully, beginning a 
           ceremony of the utmost importance.

                        You will come to answer for your 
                        crimes.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I wash my hands of this.  Go back, 
                        find your resolutions elsewhere.  I 
                        seek only peace.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR
                        Prepare yourself, Christian.  You 
                        come with us, preferably alive, but 
                        dead will suffice.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        Soldier.  You saw me with my 
                        family.  We have both had our fill 
                        of blood.  Our God wants no more of 
                        this, I promise you.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR
                        Take your sword, Spaniard.

           Sarmiento goes to his horse, slaps it to drive it away from 
           him, showing he is unwilling to take his weapons.

           Another warrior tosses his sword at the feet Sarmiento.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR (cont’d)
                        I saw you fight.  I have heard 
                        others tell their stories.  You are 
                        a scorpion in the skin of man.  
           The sword rests as his feet.

                                 MOORISH WARRIOR (cont’d)
                        Two things are certain.  We came 
                        here for you.  And you will fight.  
                        You cannot help your nature.

                                 SARMIENTO
                        I heard your soldiers say many 
                        times, “may the merciful Allah 
                        choose my fate.”

           The warrior charges.  Sarmiento does not budge.  

           The warrior, sword now above head, is almost upon Sarmiento.

           The sword begins to fall.  Sarmiento takes his last breath--

                                 SARMIENTO (cont’d)
                        Forgive me...

           Before kicking the sword into his primed hands...

           Sarmiento blocks.  He slashes through to--

           BLACK
