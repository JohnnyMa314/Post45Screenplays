           FADE IN:

           An ornate, 14th-century medieval tapestry.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.)
                        In the middle ages, the most 
                        powerful and revered figures in all 
                        of Europe were knights. 

           We pan along the tapestry. Woven in cloth, four knights hold 
           their ground against a legion of foot-soldiers.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Becoming a knight took years of 
                        dedication and rigorous training. 
                        Swordsmanship, horseback riding, 
                        falconry, chivalry, and prayer. 

           Farther along the tapestry, we see a squire in a white tunic, 
           down on his knees. A lord taps his sword to the squire’s 
           shoulder.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        More than mere bodyguards for the 
                        lord, knights were committed to 
                        upholding virtues: chastity, 
                        fraternity, loyalty, and above all 
                        else... honor.

           The last image on the tapestry: four knights raise their 
           swords to the sky. A star forms at the tip of their blades.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        What follows is the story of four 
                        knights who, having forsaken their 
                        vows, must band together and defend 
                        the crown. I’m Oscar-winner Dame 
                        Judi Dench. Let our story begin.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NIGHT

           As if the tapestry’s come to life, the castle sits on a hill. 
           Moonlight shimmers off the moat and arrow slits hide in the 
           walls. A tower looms high above.

           A RUMBLE in the distance, louder than a hundred galloping 
           horses. Louder and louder. And then-- an AIRPLANE flies 
           overhead. 

           Below, cloaked in darkness, two SHADOWY FIGURES dart across 
           the clearing and approach the castle.
           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - DRAWBRIDGE - LATER

           Two British QUEEN’S GUARDS, in customary red uniforms with 
           puffy black hats, keep watch at the drawbridge. They’re about 
           to be CHOKED TO DEATH by the shadowy figures sneaking up from 
           behind. Hands grab their throats.

           The first assailant, SPLODER (grizzled and Irish; we’ll learn 
           about his name later) has a scar that runs down his face 
           through a milky eye. He whispers in the dying guard’s ear.

                                 SPLODER
                        Sorry boyos, but we’ve got a date 
                        with the Queen. 

           MCSORLEY, Sploder’s cohort, looks up from choking his guard.

                                 MCSORLEY
                        If she’s coming out here for a 
                        knighting ceremony, won’t there be, 
                        er, knights? To defend her?
                             (changes his choking grip)
                        You know with swords and armor and 
                        horses? 

           Sploder chokes his guard even harder.

                                 SPLODER 
                        What are ya, bonkers? Ya think Sir 
                        Elton John is gonna throw on his 
                        chain mail and sharpen his 
                        broadsword? Knights aren’t nothing 
                        more than overpaid celebrities. The 
                        Queen summons them when she wants 
                        tah see a play or hear silly songs. 
                        They’re jesters-- Court jesters of 
                        the British Empire.

                                 MCSORLEY
                        Ya got to admit, Goodbye Yellow 
                        Brick Road is a great song.

                                 QUEEN’S GUARD
                             (dying)
                        Gahhhhhhh... I love that song...

           Sploder and McSorley seem to agree. They sing Goodbye Yellow 
           Brick Road as they finish choking the guards to death. 

           EXT. SPACE - LOW-EARTH ORBIT - THE NEXT DAY

           100 kilometers up. High enough that we can see the curvature 
           of Earth’s horizon below. 
           Then a small, gleaming spaceship blasts past us. It’s not 
           NASA, because stenciled on the side  is a private company-- 
           FLETCHER GALACTIC.

           INT. FLETCHER GALACTIC ONE - SAME

           The cockpit. Earth grows in size as the ship rockets through 
           re-entry. Only two men fit behind the controls.  

           SKIP FLETCHER (billionaire CEO/adventurer, cocky goldenboy, 
           late 40s) pilots his baby. It shudders against Earth’s 
           atmosphere. 

           Next to him-- LARRY KORNBLUTH (late 20s, tall and lanky, our 
           reluctant hero), his assistant, holds on for dear life. 
           Fletcher turns away from the front window to face Larry.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Another first, Larry. How’s it 
                        feel?

           He smiles a winning, superhero smile. The ship seizures as 
           it’s engulfed by re-entry fire. Larry looks straight ahead, 
           frozen with fear.

                                 LARRY
                        I think we should both be looking 
                        at the monitors. Especially you.

           BEEP BEEP BEEP.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Something’s beeping!

                                 FLETCHER
                        Forget the beeping-- 

                                 LARRY
                        Why’s it beeping?

                                 FLETCHER
                        The present takes care of itself. 
                        Let’s talk about tomorrow’s 
                        schedule.

           Larry can’t look away from the red light, flashing and 
           beeping away.

                                 LARRY
                        It’s stupid, I’m sorry I even 
                        scheduled it. Please--
                                 FLETCHER
                        Your sales pitch, eh? Think you got 
                        something for Fletcher Industries? 
                        We’ve got time right now--

           The SHAKING increases.

                                 LARRY
                        Just fly! Fly this thing!

                                 FLETCHER
                        You love this idea, I can tell. 

                                 LARRY
                        After we land!

                                 FLETCHER
                        Now or never, man-- Your choice! 

                                 LARRY
                        WHY IS THE RED LIGHT BEEPING?!

                                 FLETCHER
                        I didn’t become the man I am today 
                        by trusting “buttons” or “gauges.” 
                        I trust my gut. And my gut wants to 
                        hear your pitch. Now go!

           The man’s never been wrong so there’s no convincing him 
           otherwise. The ship jerks and shimmies through the clouds.

                                 LARRY
                        They’re called Urban Laces...

           More and more alarms BEEP BEEP BEEP. Gauges spin out of 
           control. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        Stop looking at the gauges. They’re  
                        for babies. 
                             (mulling it over)
                        Urban Laces. I like it. Give me 
                        more!

                                 LARRY
                        They’re... wifi-enabled shoelaces. 
                        You power them when you move.

           Reentry complete, gravity grabs the ship hard, throwing 
           everything not clipped down straight at Larry.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHHHH!
           Fletcher eases the yoke and lands smoothly on the desert 
           runway. Larry breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                 FLETCHER
                             (shakes his head)
                        What about all the people who use 
                        Velcro? It’ll never work. 

           He points to his shoes. Velcro.

           EXT. PRIVATE RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Fletcher climbs out the hatch and waves to a cheering crowd.

           He stands on the roof as the ship gets towed down the runway. 
           He puffs out his chest with his hands on his hips like a 
           recruiting poster for greatness-- the Fletcher pose. He 
           clamps a cigar in his perfect jaw.

                                 FLETCHER
                             (enjoys every syllable)
                        Fantastic.

           EXT. PRIVATE RUNWAY - LATER

           Larry hangs back as Fletcher signs autographs and talks to 
           reporters.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Mark it, boys. The first solo 
                        flight for a privately-funded 
                        spacecraft.

                                 REPORTER
                        Weren’t there two of you?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Larry’s my assistant. In the grand 
                        scheme of things, he’s completely 
                        insignificant.

           Everyone laughs. Larry gives a genuine and enthusiastic 
           thumbs up. 

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        Setting space records is just a 
                        hobby for me. But Fletcher 
                        Galactic, the newest division of 
                        Fletcher Industries, will take me 
                        even higher... 
                             (clever smile)
                        ...on the Forbes 500.

           More LAUGHTER from the reporters.
           REX PULLMAN (40s, impeccably dressed, British) approaches. He 
           taps a WAX-SEALED ENVELOPE on his palm. 

                                 REX
                        Rex Pullman. I represent the Queen 
                        of England. She wishes to honor you 
                        at Castle Buroninstad. That’s 
                        right-- thee Castle Buroninstad. 
                             (proud)
                        You’re to be knighted, Skip 
                        Fletcher.

           Larry smirks-- just another day in the life of Skip Fletcher. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        Fantastic.

           INT. MID-SIZED VENUE - NIGHT

           Sir Gordon “DANGEROUS” Neville (early 50s, Cockney accent, 
           big gut, spent the 70’s partying and the 80’s in rehab) rips 
           a power chord on his guitar that cuts through the feedback. 
           He’s wearing tight, red leather pants and a wifebeater.

           He struts on stage, sweating profusely, drinking from a 
           bottle of vodka. He may be getting old, but he’s still 
           rocking pretty hard.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (singing)
                        I warned you ‘bout playing with 
                        fire. I warned you ‘bout high-
                        tension wires. 
                        I warned you ‘bout running with 
                        scissors. I warned you bout 
                        breaking your mirrors.

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        Seven years bad luck!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I warned you ‘bout playing on train 
                        tracks. I warned you ‘bout not 
                        paying income tax.

                                 ENTIRE BAND
                        They’re all so so so so Dangerous!

           Dangerous spreads his legs in a power stance. Thrusts his 
           crotch out. The stage goes black and then FTHOOM-- 
           Dangerous’s crotch ERUPTS in pyrotechnics. He twists his hips 
           to shower his fans with sparks. 
           But there are no fans. Most people are crowded around the 
           bar. They don’t see the spectacle of Dangerous and the band 
           holding magicians’ top-hats. POOF! Doves fly out of the hats 
           and-- 

           --Dange and the band bite off the doves’ heads.

           INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Back in the dressing room, Dangerous guzzles his remaining 
           vodka and pulls off his shirt-- covered in blood and 
           feathers. His saggy, wrinkled tattoos are drenched in sweat.

           A sharp-looking TOUR MANAGER (30s) quickly stubs out his 
           cigarette into an ashtray with several butts.

                                 TOUR MANAGER
                        Dange, baby--

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I saw ‘em, you see ‘em? Cameras. 
                        Way in the back. My reality show, I 
                        ‘spect.

           When he’s not on stage, his raspy cockney accent really 
           shines through. 

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        You don’t have a reality show.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Well, I’m not opposed to the idea.

                                 TOUR MANAGER
                        Fellas, listen up--

                                 BASS PLAYER

                        Whose fault is that? You missed the 
                        A minor during “Toaster in the 
                        Tub.” And where’s me drugs? Uppers, 
                        downers, lefters, righters-- fook 
                        it, I’ll crush up some aspirin if I 
                        have to. And where’re all the 
                        bloody groupies?

                                 TOUR MANAGER
                        Everybody shut the fuck up for a 
                        second!

           The band turns to him. Tour Manager lights another cigarette.
                                 TOUR MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Ticket sales are shit. Tour’s 
                        cancelled. Party’s over.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Fine wif me. My fans have always 
                        preferred the recorded sound 
                        anyway.

           A WOMAN IN A FEATHERED CAP enters and walks past a cage full 
           of scared, fragile doves. Dangerous leers at her.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        Now that’s more like it! A bit 
                        older than I’m used to, but she’ll 
                        do. I’ll take her tonight, and you 
                        boys can work out who gets her 
                        tomorrow.

           He gives her a wink. She ignores his advances and hands him a 
           WAX-SEALED INVITATION. He squints... eventually gets his 
           reading glasses.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        “Sir Dangerous, as a knight of the

                             (to the tour manager)
                        He’s one of me best mates. You’re 
                        going to have to cancel the tour.

           The tour manager shakes his head and sighs.

                                 TOUR MANAGER
                        Sure, Dange. Whatever you say.

           INT. WINTERGARDEN THEATER - BROADWAY - NIGHT

           The stage seems submerged in blue lights. Bright neon coral 
           sways in the background. A synthesizer MUSIC CUE rings out-- 
           delicate, but playful. Onto the stage drifts a man in a 
           beautiful FISH costume. He “swims” along the proscenium, eyes 
           wide, cheeks puffed.

                                 JAPANESE FIGHTING FISH
                             (singing)
                        I’m just a simple fighting fish. I 
                        know not what I do. 
                        I saw myself in the mirror and 
                        thought I was biting you.

           He leaps and bounds across the stage. Every word is 
           exaggerated and pantomimed.
                                 JAPANESE FIGHTING FISH (CONT’D)
                        ...and I CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP and I 
                        BITE BITE BITE and I BUBBLE BUBBLE 
                        BUBBLE...

           The audience: families with young children dressed in fish 
           costumes. They mouth the words along with him.

           INT. WINTERGARDEN THEATER - BROADWAY - LATER

           The house lights fade up. The audience applauds as an MC 
           steps out. The cast joins him-- dozens of grown men and women 
           in fish costumes. Eight people commanding a larger-than-life 
           neon octopus puppet.

                                 MC
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, in honor of 
                        its 20th anniversary, it is my 
                        utmost pleasure to present to you 
                        the creator, director, composer, 
                        choreographer, and conductor of 
                        Fishes, I give you-- now and 
                        forever-- Sir Jonathan Clark 
                        Wendell!

           A starfish is the first to clap. Everyone joins in as 
           JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (40s, entitled, British upper-class, 
           musical genius) crosses the stage.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (off-mic, to the MC)
                        I also designed the costumes.

           The MC glances at a two-man seahorse costume. Jonathan Clark 
           Wendell turns to the audience with perfectly calculated 
           charm.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                        Never in my wildest dreams did I 
                        think this possible. After two West 
                        End hits, how could I possibly top 
                        myself? But then my muse smiled 
                        upon me and the songs poured out as 
                        easily as milk into afternoon 
                        tea...
                             (a familiar melody)
                        Da da da, la la la...
                             (same tune, louder now)
                        “chomp chomp chomp, bite bite 
                        bite...”

           The audience applauds, recognizing the tune with him, and 
           joins in. The cast, too.
                                 ENTIRE THEATER
                        “Bubble bubble bubble!”

           A Jonathan Clark Wendell FANATIC leans over the mezzanine.

                                 JCW FAN
                        When do we get a new one?

           Jonathan Clark Wendell offers a politician’s smile to the 
           crowd.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I’m working on something wonderful 
                        right now.

           The audience APPLAUDS. Watching from the wings, another WOMAN 
           WITH A FEATHERED CAP clutches his SEALED INVITATION.

           INT. SPORTS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Hands tie the laces of ratty black soccer cleats. These 
           cleats are connected to the powerful legs of Sir NANDO (late 
           20s, Argentinian soccer phenomenon, has a smooth accent).

           His SPORTS AGENT (30s) hovers over his shoulder.

                                 SPORTS AGENT
                        For your first game in England. 

           A pair of blue and white Nike cleats lands on the bench next 
           to Nando. He nonchalantly brushes them aside.

                                 NANDO
                        My greatness is not for sale. I 
                        already wear the only cleats I will 
                        ever wear-- the cleats my mother 
                        made for me. Mi madre los hizo de--

                                 SPORTS AGENT
                        --Nando! Your dead mother wants you 
                        to wear these. 

           Nando puts on his Manchester United jersey.

                                 NANDO
                        What is more important to you, some 
                        stupid fucking Nike or the legacy 
                        of Nando? On wikipedia it says I 
                        have worn these shoes for my entire 
                        life. You want me to edit 
                        wikipedia? No one would believe it, 
                        they’d edit it back. I am Nando. I 
                        do not play for Nike shoes. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANDO (CONT'D)
                        I love football more than anything 
                        you have ever known. When I fuck a 
                        supermodel, it only reminds me of 
                        how much more pleasure I get from 
                        football.

           Nando kicks the Nikes into the trash.

           EXT. MANCHESTER UNITED STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           The stands are packed. Flares, flags, and chants. Nando 
           stands off to the side as the MANAGER speaks to the rest of 
           the team in a huddle.

                                 MANAGER
                        ...When it comes down to the wire, 
                        individuals always lose. But teams? 
                        Teams win. And we’re a TEAM!

           The team barks a rally cry back at the coach. Nando wanders 
           over to the huddle.

                                 NANDO
                        Good speech, Coach. Give me the 
                        ball and it will all be fine. Hands 
                        in.

           They all put their hands in. 

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        On three-- Uno. Dos. NANDO!

           The other players look at each other, caught off guard.

           EXT. MANCHESTER UNITED STADIUM - LATER

           Nando easily dribbles around defenders. His teammates make 
           runs, get open, but passing is not part of Nando’s plan. 

           On the sideline, security escorts another WOMAN WITH A 
           FEATHERED CAP. She hands a sealed invitation to the Manager.

           Nando SCORES. The entire stadium erupts with cheers. Nando 
           soaks in their love, hands in the air, and shouts his 
           rallying cry--

                                 NANDO
                        Nando!!!

           INT. LARRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           In his bathroom, Larry brushes his teeth as fast as he can. 
           He’s filling a toiletry bag at the same time. A car HONKS 
           outside. He brushes even faster.
                                 JACKIE
                        Was he even listening to your Urban 
                        Laces pitch?

           Next to Larry we see-- JACKIE (20s, very cute, wears hospital 
           scrubs) on the toilet. Larry doesn’t mind at all. She rips 
           off the last scrap of toilet paper and takes care of 
           business.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        The guy probably spent more time 
                        contemplating what to eat for 
                        breakfast.

                                 LARRY
                        The timing’s not right, that’s all.

                                 JACKIE
                        You’ve been all over the world with 
                        him-- even outer space. If he’s not 
                        going to promote you, what’s the 
                        point? Start your own company 
                        already. Grow up. I spend enough 
                        time around babies at work.

           Larry shrivels his face up like a baby.

                                 LARRY
                        Are you calling me a baby?

                                 JACKIE
                        Baby, scaredycat, wussy. Yeah all 
                        of those. Just quit. You’ll figure 
                        out a way to get Urban Laces 
                        started.

           Larry takes it all in. Wrinkles his nose.

                                 LARRY
                        What did you eat last night?

           She throws a sock at him. He leans down and kisses her. She 
           pulls him in for a deep embrace on the toilet.

           The car HONKS again. They share a smile and then he’s off and 
           running.

                                 JACKIE
                        Wait! I’m out of toilet paper!

           Jackie sits there, stuck. But the door bursts open and a 
           fresh roll of toilet paper flies into the bathroom.
                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        My hero.

           She wipes.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - TWILIGHT

           The hornpipe fanfare from Handel’s WATER MUSIC greets us as 
           limousines arrive at the castle from the beginning.

           Skip Fletcher steps out not from a limo but from his PRIVATE 
           HELICOPTER, looking “man at his best,” Esquire style. Cameras 
           FLASH. Larry crawls out behind him. In contrast to Fletcher, 
           Larry crouches to stay well below the whirling blades.

                                 FLETCHER
                             (to Larry, without 
                              looking)
                        Cigar.

           Larry’s already cutting it and passes it over right away. 
           Fletcher mugs it up for the FLASHING cameras. Larry blinks a 
           lot.

                                 REX
                        Welcome to Castle Buroninstad, 
                        gentlemen. 

           Rex Pullman meets them. Guides them along the red-carpeted 
           drawbridge. 

                                 REX (CONT’D)
                        Feel free to browse our exhibits-- 
                        the castle itself, a medieval 
                        forest, and over two kilometers of 
                        underground catacombs. The 
                        property’s a historical landmark. 
                        Twas here that the knights of 
                        Buroninstad trained and fought 
                        their final battle. And it’s been 
                        said that Dame Judi Dench comes 
                        here to rehearse in peace.
                             (as they cross the moat)
                        Watch out for Piranhas.

           He gives a musical laugh.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Fantastic.

           They pass two QUEEN’S ROYAL GUARDS.
           We recognize the twisted scar and milky eye of Sploder. After 
           Larry and Fletcher pass, we hold on him. His nose itches and 
           so he scratches it. The other guard snorts and spits.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - LATER

           Candelabra chandeliers hang from the vaulted stone ceiling of 
           the Great Hall. Fletcher mingles with the British upper-
           class.

           At the open bar, we find Larry soaking in the surreal event 
           with Rex at his side. Fletcher strides over to Larry like he 
           owns the place.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Larry, I--

           Larry gives him the drink he’s been holding.

                                 LARRY
                        Vodka tonic with a twist. 
                             (before Fletcher can ask)
                        Schwepps-- not Canada Dry. And the 
                        lime is Tahitian.

           Fletcher grins, winks, and walks off with his drink. Larry 
           slumps. Rex raises an eyebrow...

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Look-- It’s great, ok? I mean, the 
                        guy’s a genius-- his business is 
                        business, you know?

                                 REX
                        Truly an inspiration.

                                 LARRY
                             (justifying)
                        Yeah. He takes me mountain climbing 
                        in Nepal. We set a land-speed 
                        record last year. I’ve been to 
                        space, Rex.

                                 REX
                        And now Fletcher’s taken you on the 
                        greatest adventure of all. The 
                        knighting ceremony.

           Larry considers this. Then clinks glasses with him. Cheers.

           Sir Dangerous pushes between them, reaches over the bar and 
           grabs the entire bottle of whiskey. He disappears back into 
           the crowd. Larry stares...
                                 LARRY
                        Awesome.

           At the other end of the bar, Sir Jonathan Clark Wendell is 
           having trouble deciding on a drink.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Hmmmm... what a plethora of options 
                        before me. So many elixirs to 
                        choose from. I’ll have a gin and-- 
                        no, make that-- hmmm. Well, the 
                        Queen doesn’t drink. Maybe I won’t 
                        either...

                                 LARRY
                             (to Rex)
                        Where are the other knights? 
                        There’s only three here. My mom 
                        really wants Sir Ian McKellen’s 
                        autograph.

           The bartender starts mixing Sir Nando a drink. Nando pushes 
           him away, takes the shaker, and makes it himself.

                                 REX
                        Apparently some knights are “too 
                        busy” to celebrate the most 
                        important honorary title their 
                        country has to offer.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - LATER

           It’s dark now and everyone’s seated at tables. They’re 
           watching a Skip Fletcher slide show (to music like Green 
           Day’s TIME OF YOUR LIFE).

           --Young Fletcher cutting the ribbon on Fletcher Industries.

           --Fletcher throwing the first pitch at a Yankee game.

           --Fletcher, Larry, and Bono. Framed so Larry is half-cropped 
           out.

           At his table, Larry takes this omission in stride.

           --In Africa, Fletcher riding a giraffe. He’s having the time 
           of his life.

           --Still in Africa, Fletcher drives a Range Rover with a dead 
           giraffe strapped to the hood. Still having the time of his 
           life.

           At his table, Fletcher appreciates his life’s work. He puffs 
           out his chest and strikes his Fletcher pose.
                                 FLETCHER
                        Fantastic.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - LATER

           At the door, Sploder folds back his puffy red sleeve and 
           checks his watch. It’s time. He closes the iron lock on the 
           massive doors.

           The other sketchy guards exchange glances and nods. All 
           around the hall, doors close and lock. 

           INT. CASTLE - ANTE CHAMBER - LATER

           Larry, Fletcher, and the knights are in a small ante chamber 
           next to the Great Hall. A waiting room of sorts. Rex talks 
           Fletcher through the ceremony like a party-planner.

                                 REX
                        The Queen will offer a blessing, 
                        the orchestra plays the 
                        processional and all the knights 
                        walk out together. You’ll kneel, 
                        The Queen dubs you with her sword, 
                        and then it’s “Arise Sir Skip 
                        Fletcher.”

           Fletcher nods. Intense.

                                 REX (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be great.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I know.

           As Rex leaves for the Great Hall--

                                 LARRY
                        Excuse me, what’s the order? For 
                        the knights walking in.

                                 REX
                             (walking out)
                        Whatever you chaps decide.

           The knights eye each other, uncomfortable with this 
           proposition.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I’ll walk out first then.

           Fletcher, now primping in a mirror, calls over his shoulder--
                                 FLETCHER
                        Ha. Shouldn’t you be recording 
                        another comeback album?

           Dangerous is about to get the last word in, but Larry 
           interjects, geeked out by meeting his idol.

                                 LARRY
                             (soft)
                        Mr. Dangerous, I mean sir-- I have 
                        all your albums. We used to listen 
                        to PLAYING WITH FIRE on our family 
                        trips to Mohegan Sun.

           Dangerous suddenly brightens up, excited to talk about his 
           favorite thing-- himself.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Funny story bout that record. I 
                        played the entire session wif a 
                        dead iguana on me head.

                                 LARRY
                             (singing)
                        “Watch out, son, you gonna get 
                        burned!”

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Stop singing. You don’t sound like 
                        me. But God bless that record. 14 
                        times platinum. 

           Jonathan Clark Wendell steps between them.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Perhaps we should measure your 
                        music’s artistic merit before 
                        ordaining you first? 
                             (stage bow)
                        No doubt you’ve seen Fishes.

                                 LARRY
                        You’re Jonathan Clark Wendell?

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        “Four time Tony award winner” 
                        Jonathan Clark Wendell. And surely 
                        you know my other works: The First 
                        Seder or The Rainbow Gang?

                                 LARRY
                        I LOVE Fishes. 
                             (singing)
                        “Bubble bubble bubble...”
           Nando approaches the group, singing Fishes in Spanish.

                                 NANDO
                             (suddenly serious)
                        I love that song too, man. But I 
                        have scored more goals than any 
                        player in the history of football. 
                        I should go first. Although you 
                        should go second.

           Everyone starts arguing at once, pushing each other to be in 
           front. Fletcher joins in. Then from a dark corner of the 
           chamber:

                                 IRISH VOICE (O.S.)
                        Not so fast, boyos. I’ll be goin’ 
                        out there first... 

           From the darkness steps Sir DANIEL O’MALLEY (40s, heavy Irish 
           accent, intense). The guys take a big step back.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (in awe)
                        ...Daniel O’Malley.

                                 DANIEL
                        Good tah see you, Jonathan Clark 
                        Wendell. I loved that shite you 
                        wrote about the ocean. Really silly 
                        and bizarre. Tickled me, it did.
                             (then)
                        But I negotiated peace in Northern 
                        Ireland. After I sat everyone down, 
                        the bombs stopped.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Peace is a precious gift. But it’s 
                        my ceremony. 

           Strangely nervous now, Daniel checks his watch. From the 
           Great Hall, a trumpet FANFARE rings out. Daniel pushes past 
           Fletcher to the front.

                                 DANIEL
                             (vaguely threatening)
                        Peace is about making concessions, 
                        boyo. 

           Rex steps back into the ante chamber. Jazz hands.

                                 REX
                        It’s magic time. 
           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - SAME

           The orchestra plays the fanfare. Guests rise to their feet.  
           The Queen stands at the pulpit.

           In the back of the hall, Sploder reaches into his red jacket. 
           The other guards exchange glances and do the same. The guests 
           turn their attention to the door.

           Sploder throws down his red coat to reveal-- he’s wired with 
           EXPLOSIVES. But the guests are focused on--

           --Daniel O’Malley as he steps out into the great hall.

           Sploder charges toward the Queen. Daniel sees him coming. He 
           reacts, maybe about to be a hero, but no. 

           He pulls out a pistol and CLICK-- forgets the safety. He 
           fumbles with it-- no big deal-- then FIRES INTO THE AIR.

           The other “guards” open fire too. Gunsmoke fills the great 
           hall. PANIC.

                                 DANIEL
                        Everyone down, please! Hands in the 
                        air.

           He fires another shot over their heads.

           EXT. CASTLE - PARAPET - SAME

           Up on the parapet, A terrorist TACKLES a secret serviceman. 
           Down below we see the same thing happen.

           EXT. CASTLE - MAIN GATE - SAME

           Secret service men are grabbed from behind and terrorists 
           take their places.

           INT. CASTLE - ANTE CHAMBER - SAME

           Fletcher stands frozen at the ante chamber door.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Good lord.

           Larry pulls him back and out of harm’s way.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - SAME

           Daniel shouts over the panic.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’re not going to hurt you!
           The crowd quiets down. Cowering.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Yer bein’ held prisoner until me 
                        seven brothers are freed from 
                        Belmarsh prison. The minute they’re 
                        safe, we’ll let everyone go. In the 
                        meantime let’s just relax and enjoy 
                        each other’s company. I’m a man of 
                        peace!
                             (stepping forward)
                        But if anyone tries to be a hero, 
                        me mate here will blow the castle 
                        into a million pieces.

           Sploder leaps onto a table, brandishing his detonator.

                                 SPLODER
                        The name’s Tommy the ‘Sploder. 
                        Pleased tah meet ya.

           Sploder grins. He’s missing most of his teeth and his busted 
           eyeball oozes puss.

           INT. CASTLE - ANTE CHAMBER - SAME

           Larry backs away from the Great Hall door--

                                 LARRY
                        Oh shit oh shit oh shit...

           --Right into A TERRORIST GUARD (McGrath) who waits in the 
           corner with a loaded gun. Larry whirls, scared. Dangerous 
           steps up to the guard, real friendly.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Oi, cowboy-- what do you want from 
                        me? Autograph? Drugs? iTunes gift 
                        card?

           Fletcher steps up and CLOCKS the terrorist HARD in the nose. 
           The terrorist collapses. Fletcher kisses his fist.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Still got it.

           He takes the gun and cocks it with pleasure. 

           Larry peeks out a back door-- it leads to a stone hallway. He 
           glances back. Fletcher is still across the room at the door 
           to the great hall.

           Larry gestures towards his way out.
                                 LARRY
                        Skip, you have an appointment with 
                        let’s get the fuck out of here.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Wait. We can’t presume to know 
                        where this avenue will lead us. Do 
                        you have a map? And what if there 
                        are terrorists or attack dogs. 

           Larry pulls Skip’s arm. Oblivious, Jonathan Clark Wendell 
           continues weighing their options. He’s stuck in a loop of 
           indecisiveness, like when he tried to order a drink at the 
           bar.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                        For all we know it leads to 
                        Asterion the Minotaur of Crete! Our 
                        best course of action might be to 
                        remain calm and wait for 
                        inspiration to overtake our senses, 
                        however long it takes.

           They hear MORE GUNFIRE from the great hall. Fletcher pushes 
           away from Larry. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        What about all those beautiful 
                        people? Who’s with me? Dangerous?

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Too dangerous.

           Dange leaves through Larry’s exit.

                                 NANDO
                        I would rather save Nando first.

           He follows Dangerous. Jonathan Clark Wendell holds his 
           ground, paralyzed.

                                 LARRY
                             (like speaking to a child)
                        Skip, your shareholders depend on 
                        you to stay alive.

           Fletcher’s eyes narrow. Defeated, for now. He pushes past 
           Larry, determined to at least lead their escape. Larry grabs 
           Jonathan Clark Wendell on the way out.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NIGHT

           In the valet parking lot, the limo drivers have gathered in 
           one of the limos. They’re watching The Bourne Ultimatum.
           Outside, MCMILLIN, another terrorist, knocks on the window 
           with his pistol. 

           INT. CASTLE - UPPER HALLWAY - SAME

           Larry, Fletcher, and the knights slink down the corridor. 
           Dangerous notices a subtle outline on the floor.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Looks like a trap door to freedom.

           He pulls a conspicuous wall sconce. The trap door drops open. 
           The knights look down-- it clearly leads to a dungeon.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        Freedom!

           Dangerous leaps in. Larry catches him by the shirt collar and 
           pulls him back.

                                 LARRY
                        That’s a dungeon.

           Dangerous brushes himself off.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I knew it didn’t look like freedom. 

           INT. CASTLE - TURRET - MOMENTS LATER

           They find a stone window. Below, they see McMillin marching 
           the limo drivers into the castle. When they’re out of sight--

           Nando climbs into the windowsill. He looks down at the 20-
           foot drop.

                                 NANDO
                        Nando!!!

           He LEAPS out like a flying squirrel and soars impossibly 
           across the moat, then lands in the grass below. Athletic 
           perfection.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                             (waving to follow)
                        Now you!

           The knights exchange a look. Nando shrugs and disappears into 
           the night.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - LATER

           Terrorists walk the floor. Sploder collects cell phones. Rex 
           complies, and follows it up with his watch. 
                                 SPLODER
                        This ain’t a robbery, potato-face. 
                        Just give me the phone. 

           INT. CASTLE - NEAR THE DRAWBRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coming inside, McMillin passes mannequins dressed like 
           medieval peasants-- one of the castle’s exhibits. 

           CLOSE ON LARRY’S FACE-- he’s scared shitless.

           Something about them catches his eye. He Slowwwwly approaches 
           them. 

           CLOSE AGAIN ON LARRY-- hiding somewhere, biting his lip.

           McMillin LEAPS around the mannequins, but there’s no one 
           hiding behind them.

           Around a corner, Fletcher, Larry, and the knights witness the 
           whole thing from a DIFFERENT hiding spot.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (super soft)
                        Like we’d hide back there? I’m 
                        surprised he didn’t fink we’s 
                        pretending to BE the mannequins.

           McMillin, suddenly suspicious, spins around and SHOOTS the 
           mannequins just in case. Dange shrugs.

           McMillin moves on. When the coast is clear...

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - DRAWBRIDGE - LATER

           Fletcher leads them out of the castle. They sprint across the 
           drawbridge, where Nando waits for them.

                                 LARRY
                        England is so crazy. Has this ever 
                        happened before?

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (dry)
                        Oh sure. Twice at my knighting.

           After he crosses the drawbridge, Dangerous scoops up some 
           dirt and eats it.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Delicious freedom!
                                 LARRY
                        We’re not out yet. There’s still a 
                        big ass wall around the whole 
                        place.

           Dangerous spits.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I knew it didn’t taste like 
                        freedom. 

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - SAME

           Sploder passes Daniel the bag of cell phones. He pulls out a 
           sheet of paper.

                                 SPLODER
                        Guest list-- we’re five short.

           McGrath, his face swollen from Fletcher’s punch, plays dumb.

                                 MCGRATH
                        Yeeeeeeeeeeah, that’s mysterious. 
                        Cryptic, even.

           Daniel looks from McGrath’s bruises to the ante chamber door. 
           Daniel puts on his meanest face.

                                 DANIEL
                        Where. Are. They?!

           EXT. CASTLE - VALET PARKING LOT - LATER

           Cars parked in a field. Fletcher, Larry, and the knights 
           slink among them. Every car has an open gas-cap. There’s a 
           trail of sand on the ground. 

           Larry reaches through a car window. The keys are there. He 
           tries the ignition-- nothing.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NEAR THE WALL - LATER

           The drawbridge CLANKS up and closes. Iron slats lower across 
           the windows. 50-Cal machine guns poke through the castle’s 
           arrow slits. The celebratory spotlights redirect into 
           searchlights and terrorists start patrolling the parapets.

           Larry leads them along the exterior wall.

                                 LARRY
                        This must be the outer wall. 
                        There’s only one gate. Ummm... this 
                        way.
                                 FLETCHER
                             (proud, to the others)
                        I pay him to know everything.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        So you don’t have to know nothing?

           Fletcher thinks for a second, not used to being insulted.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I know why I dropped you from 
                        Fletcher Records.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (to the others)
                        I chose to leave.

           INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - SAME

           Terrorists overturn pews and push them against the wall. They 
           unload laptops and guns. Daniel barges in and grabs a walkie-
           talkie from this makeshift operations center.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’re missing five.
                             (into radio)
                        Main gate status?

                                 MCFARLAND (V.O.)
                        Main gate secure.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - MAIN GATE - LATER

           Fletcher slows them down when they see the immense iron gate 
           ahead. Several men patrol it. They chat with Irish accents.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Let’s kill them one by one.

                                 LARRY
                        Or we could sneak past them.

                                 FLETCHER
                        ...past their dead bodies.

           They crouch down against the wall.

                                 NANDO
                        I can outrun their bullets.
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Surely there is another way out. 
                        Have we exhausted all underground, 
                        aquatic, and aerial methods of 
                        debarkation? We could--

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (absurdly loud)
                        You scared, Jonathan Clark Wendell?

           At the gate, the terrorist guards perk up at the noise.

                                 LARRY
                        Shhhh!

           INT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - TOWER - LATER

           Daniel and Sploder march the Queen up a spiral stone 
           staircase.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’re in a castle. What are they 
                        gonna do-- lay siege?

           The Queen laughs-- an unsettling cackle, then--

                                 THE QUEEN
                        You better believe it. They’re 
                        probably planning a rescue right 
                        this second.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NEAR THE WALL - LATER

           Dangerous walks by the enormous perimeter wall, talking on 
           his cell phone.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (into phone)
                        Am I on TV yet? What about MTV? 
                        This is big news, come on-- it’s a 
                        breaking story! Listen call Johnny-
                        whatshisname about me reality show, 
                        tell him I’m going to VH1 if he 
                        doesn’t get on wif me right this 
                        second...

           We find Nando as he ties his shoes-- the only cleats he will 
           ever wear.

                                 NANDO
                        I will get us help. 

           Nando looks up at the twenty-foot wall.
                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        I will climb this wall. 

           Larry scratches his chin. Nando hops in place a few times, 
           loosening up.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Uno. Dos. NANDO!!!

           He sprints towards the wall, leaps, and scrambles, but--

           --it gets him nowhere. He tries again. And again. It’s too 
           high, but reality means nothing to Nando. He tries again. 

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Start cheering my name. I almost 
                        have it.

           He does not almost have it.

                                 LARRY
                             (nervous, losing it)
                        Shhhhhh. No-- please-- no one 
                        cheer.

                                 NANDO
                        Nando!!!

           EXT. CASTLE - MAIN GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           The terrorist guards perk up at the distant shouting...

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Who in tha blazes is that?

                                 NANDO (O.S.)

                        Nando!!!

           EXT. CEMETARY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - LATER

           We find Larry talking quietly with Fletcher.

                                 LARRY
                        We’ve got to get you out of here.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Adrenaline, Larry. You feel it? 

                                 LARRY
                             (realizing)
                        The helicopter. Arturo could be 
                        here in five minutes.
                                 FLETCHER
                        Touch my bicep. Squeeze it.

           Larry’s dials his blackberry one-handed as he begrudgingly 
           squeezes Fletcher’s bicep.

           EXT. CLEARING - SAME

           Fletcher’s private helicopter GRINDS to life. It takes off.

           EXT. CEMETARY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - LATER

           Larry and the knights hide among the ancient graves. The dark 
           castle looms in the distance. Fletcher paces, enjoying the 
           excitement and ignoring the danger. He notices a mausoleum--

                                 FLETCHER
                        The tomb of Lord Buroninstad. This 
                        is a piece of history. You know I 
                        love learning, Larry.

           He kicks the stone like a man kicking tires. It moves 
           slightly. Larry pushes it back into place.

           They hear a WHIRL of the approaching helicopter. The Fletcher 
           Industries chopper soars towards them from the horizon. 
           Arturo the pilot gives a friendly wave. Nando waves back.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        What a glorious sight! O heavenly 
                        winged angel of mercy!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        First thing I’m gonna do on the 
                        other side? Give up drugs forever.

           KA-BOOM!!! The helicopter EXPLODES.

           Dangerous gulps a handful of pills. 

           Larry stares as the mangled helicopter CRASHES to the ground.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Let’s send flowers, Larry.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - PARAPET - SAME

           MCMANIMAN adjusts the empty rocket launcher on his shoulder. 
           He grins to MCDONALD.

                                 MCMANIMAN
                        I’ve wanted to do that ever since I 
                        was a wee lad.
           INT. CASTLE - TOWER - LATER

           In the highest tower, Daniel looks out the window at the 
           flaming wreckage.

                                 DANIEL
                        It didn’t have to come to this, 
                        Majesty. For fifteen years, I tried 
                        askin’ ya nice. 

           The Queen sits on a decorative 16th century sofa next to 
           Sploder.

                                 THE QUEEN
                        You didn’t say “please.”

                                 DANIEL
                             (sweetly)
                        Oh I said it with sugar on top. Who 
                        negotiated peace in Ireland when 
                        all your other diplomats failed?

                                 THE QUEEN
                        You didn’t do that to free your 
                        brothers.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh but I did. I was sweet as could 
                        be. But now? 

                                 SPLODER
                             (shouting in her face)
                        --Now your teeth are gonna rot!

           Daniel makes a call.

                                 DANIEL
                             (into phone)
                        Is this conversation being 
                        recorded, dearie? Alright then. My 
                        name is Daniel O’Malley and I’ve 
                        got-- yes. It’s really me. No. Stop 
                        talking!
                             (softer)
                        I’ve got yer Queen and a boatload 
                        of hostages. You listenin’ now?

           His call continues as we cut to--

           INT. MINISTRY OF DEFENSE - LATER

           A reel to reel tape is playing before a group of somber-
           looking BRITISH OFFICIALS.
                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                             (recorded)
                        I want me seven brothers out of 
                        Belmarsh. Prison’s no place for an 
                        Irishman. They’ve done some bad 
                        deeds, yes. But they need to see 
                        the sun-- One more day at the 
                        beach. Let em go free. Free as the 
                        day they were born.
                             (then)
                        There’ll be a plane for me brothers 
                        waiting at London City Airport. You 
                        have 24 hours before we blow up the 
                        castle!

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS - MAIN ROAD - LATER

           VRRRRRRRMMMMM! Out of a huge dust cloud emerges a convoy of 
           jeeps, humvees, trucks, and tanks.

           REPORTERS document their arrival.

           From the main gate, McFarland monitors their approach with 
           binoculars. 

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATE - LATER

           A flurry of activity. SOLDIERS hurry this way and that, 
           pitching tarps and connecting generators. 

           Through this chaos walks COLONEL WESTLAKE (40s, formidable 
           moustache). He carries a clipboard in one hand and a pen in 
           the other.

           When a jeep arrives carrying GENERAL HOWSON (50s, even better 
           moustache), Westlake is ready to greet him.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        I’ve already spoken to the Prime 
                        Minister. He’s prepared to release 
                        the O’Malley brothers in exchange 
                        for the Queen.

           Westlake offers General Howson the clipboard and pen. We see 
           it’s a complex legal document.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE (CONT’D)
                        Sign here and we’ll start 
                        evacuating hostages.

           General Howson’s nostrils flare. He snaps the pen in his 
           hands.
                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Those potato-cunting Irish arsebags 
                        killed half the royal family. All 
                        the Queen’s children. Or did that 
                        slip your bloody mind? 

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Sir, the Queen is in danger!

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        We’re not letting those shamrock-
                        shagging wankers out of prison! 
                        They’ll kill again, they bloody-
                        well will.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Daniel’s not like his brothers. 
                        Ireland, 1999-- the man’s a born 
                        negotiator. Let’s let him negotiate 
                        one more time.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        We’ve made peace, moved on-- 
                        there’s no going back to the old 
                        ways. The O’Malley brothers will 
                        die in prison for what they did.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Sir, may I speak freely?

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        No you may not, goddammit!

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        They’ve fortified castle 
                        Buroninstad into an impregnable 
                        fortress. There are bombs 
                        everywhere. Any attempt to breach 
                        the perimeter will--

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        You are way out of line!

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        TOMMY THE SPLODER’S IN THERE!

           The stand-off comes to an abrupt pause. 

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                             (sotto)
                        My God... what has Daniel O’Malley 
                        gotten himself into.
           EXT. CASTLE - CEMETERY - DOWNED CHOPPER - NIGHT

           Fletcher picks through the smoldering helicopter wreckage. 
           It’s literally in a million pieces.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I’m gonna be honest here. I think 
                        we can rebuild it.

                                 LARRY
                        Someone will come for us. Let’s 
                        just be cool.

                                 FLETCHER
                        The main rotor’s still intact. This 
                        bird will fly again, Larry.

           Dangerous sits Indian style nearby. He inhales deeply.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        That smell takes me back to me 1968 
                        tour. Did all the pyrotechnics 
                        meself.

           He starts laughing hysterically. More pills fall from his 
           pocket.

                                 LARRY
                        Are you high?

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I can’t hear you cause I already 
                        escaped in my mind.

           He falls face-first into the dirt.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        May I present to you a plan in four 
                        parts? This is one of several ideas 
                        that could perhaps possibly 
                        succeed. I’m not sure. 
                             (then)
                        Might we distract them long enough 
                        to escape? We’ll need a stage 
                        curtain, eleven sandbags, a red 
                        scrim, and a ballet dancer. Nando, 
                        can you pirouette?

                                 NANDO
                             (sad)
                        No.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Then all is lost.
           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - COMMAND POST - NIGHT

           Colonel Westgate SLAMS down a map of Castle Buroninstad.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        The reality of the situation is-- 
                        we’re out here...

           He points to the edge of the map, outside the perimeter 
           walls.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE (CONT’D)
                        And our primary objective is here.

           He slides his finger over the map. Across the wall, through 
           the forest, past a stable, beyond the graveyard, and to the 
           castle.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        A tactical assault--

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        --would end with massive 
                        casualties. SAS and SRR agree-- 
                        there’s no way our troops are 
                        getting over that wall, sir.

           General Howson strokes his immense moustache.

           EXT. CASTLE PERIMETER WALL - LATER

           At the top of the wall, a Fletcher Robotics army sentry robot 
           rises into view. Hydraulics from below push it up and over. 
           It rolls along the top of the wall like a mars rover.

           DOWN BELOW, The General looks up at the wall. He salutes.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Godspeed, robot. You’re our only 
                        hope.

           Colonel Westlake shakes his head.

           ON THE WALL, we see a long line of bombs stretching as far as 
           the eye can see. In fact, all along the wall, there are 
           mirror relays and laser tripwires.

           As the robot moves, a vibration-sensing needle quivers.

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - NEAR THE WALL - SAME

           KA-BOOM! The sentry robot EXPLODES.
                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Damn you, Sploder!

           EXT. CEMETARY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - SAME

           Fletcher perks up at the explosion. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        That came from outside the walls.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Soldiers probably found out they’d 
                        get to meet me and exploded from 
                        excitement.

                                 LARRY
                             (scared)
                        We might be on our own in here.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Just the way I like it. 

           Larry tenses. He knows that look...

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATE - LATER

           In the distance, PHOTOGRAPHERS strain against barricades. In 
           a roped-off area, Colonel Westlake has just finished 
           addressing REPORTERS. An ARMY RUNNER meets him.

                                 RUNNER
                        I have a “Skip Fletcher” calling 
                        for you, sir. 

           The runner hands him a satellite phone.

           EXT. CEMETARY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - SAME

           Fletcher stands tall. His intense, piercing eyes stare off 
           into the distance.

                                 FLETCHER
                             (into phone)
                        To whom am I speaking?

           Crouching nearby, Larry rolls his eyes.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE (V.O.)
                        This is Colonel Westlake. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        I don’t normally speak to someone 
                        of such low rank, but it’s an 
                        emergency.
           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATE - LATER

           With newfound purpose and the phone to his ear, Colonel 
           Westlake finds General Howson yelling at the Sentry tech.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        I don’t care if you have to go down 
                        to the robot factory and build one 
                        yourself!

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Excuse me, sir--

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                             (to Westlake)
                        DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT BRING ME A 
                        NEW ROBOT?!

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - COMMAND POST - LATER

           Under a tarp, General Howson and Colonel Westlake discuss the 
           situation.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        There might be an alternative to 
                        direct assault.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Some sort of... robot assault?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        I’ve got five men on the inside.

           Westlake pitches the idea with passion and intensity.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE (CONT’D)
                        They already slipped past the 
                        terrorists once, undetected. 

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        They have stealth training?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Fletcher has a pistol. Says he was 
                        a soldier of fortune for a short 
                        time in the 80s. And Sir Nando is 
                        an athletic star-- he’s in better 
                        shape than any one of our soldiers. 

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        They’re... knights?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Knights.
                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Knights!?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        They’re already inside!

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Knights!!!

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        They can save the Queen.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        KNIGHTS!!!!!!

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        The terrorists are watching US. Out 
                        here. They’re not going to expect 
                        anyone from inside.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        It’s crazy.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Sometimes when you’re all out of 
                        options, you gotta drink from the 
                        crazy bucket. And thank God that 
                        bucket is full.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                             (intense)
                        I don’t drink out of buckets.

           Colonel Westlake gets right in his face. Moustache to 
           moustache.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Well I do.

           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Fletcher sharpens the end of a stick with his trusty Fletcher 
           Amalgamated Steel pocket knife.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You ever killed a bear with a 
                        spear, Larry? 

           Larry bites his lip.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        Killing a man’s even easier. 
                                 LARRY
                        Don’t you think you’re being a bit 
                        hasty?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Was it hasty when we started 
                        selling Fletcher cell phones before 
                        cell phone networks even existed? 
                        Ten billion dollars says it wasn’t.

           He hands Larry a spear, but Larry still looks unsure.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        How’s quadruple overtime sound? 

                                 LARRY
                        They have machine guns.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I don’t want to make any promises, 
                        but I could see your Urban Laces 
                        going into development at Fletcher 
                        Labs. 

           Larry stares down at the spear.

           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Larry and Fletcher cross through the cemetary towards the 
           knights. Larry can see the castle, dark and ominous, looming 
           in the distance. He takes a few calming breaths.

           He lags behind and makes a call-- speed dials JACKIE.

                                 LARRY
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Wanda, it’s Larry. Can I talk 
                        to Jackie?
                        It’s kind of important...
                        Yes, I understand that delivering 
                        babies is important too... 
                        Can you just put her on for a 
                        minute? 

           EXT. CEMETARY - NEAR THE CRASH SITE - LATER

           Without Larry, Fletcher addresses the knights near the 
           crashed helicopter.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Huddle up, soldiers. Get in here, 
                        Nando. Take a knee.
                                 NANDO
                        I will do no such thing.

           The other knights gather round.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You’re my corporate raiders and 
                        it’s time for a hostile takeover.

           They stare.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        How can I say this in a way you’ll 
                        understand? In soccer we all know 
                        that sometimes the starters get 
                        injured. 

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Soccer?

                                 NANDO
                        Don’t you ever say that word again.

                                 FLETCHER
                        In “football,” if all the starters 
                        get injured, it’s up to the subs to 
                        win the match.

           Everyone nods.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        Right now, the army can’t help us-- 
                        the starters are injured. They’re 
                        counting on us to save the Queen. 
                        We are the subs. We will win this 
                        match.

                                 NANDO
                        I am not a sub.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Tonight you are.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You don’t honestly expect me to 
                        play football at a time like this?

                                 FLETCHER
                        Not football-- soccer.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        What in the fucking hell are you 
                        babbling on about?
                                 NANDO
                        Sub?! I AM NANDO!

           EXT. CEMETARY - SAME

           Larry’s still trying to negotiate his way to Jackie.

                                 LARRY
                             (on the phone)
                        Please, my situation here is kind 
                        of intense...
                        Yes, I understand that nothing is 
                        more intense than the miracle of 
                        childbirth. But turn on your TV. 
                        It’s a matter of life or death... 
                        Yes, I understand that you deal 
                        with life or death situations every 
                        day. 

           He heads for Fletcher and the knights.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Just tell her I called? Wait, tell 
                        her I love her. But say it in a way 
                        that’s not like the normal way. Let 
                        me hear you say it as serious as 
                        you can... 
                        No, you sounded like Austin Powers.

           EXT. CEMETARY - NEAR THE CRASH SITE - LATER

           Fletcher stands before the knights in his usual pose.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You’re suggesting we... storm the 
                        castle?

                                 FLETCHER
                        And save the Queen. Easy-peasy.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I’m Jonathan Clark Wendell. The 
                        Times called me “a beautiful and 
                        unique gift to the world.” They 
                        don’t want to write my obituary.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Honestly? I’m not in any big rush 
                        to leave the graveyard. I’m sure 
                        I’ll find plenty of new fans among 
                        the skeletons and what have you. 

           Fletcher turns to Nando.
                                 NANDO
                        No.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NIGHT

           From the edge of the cemetary, it’s about 100 yards across a 
           clearing to the castle. Searchlights sweep lazy patterns 
           across the open field.

           EXT. CEMETERY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - NIGHT

           Fletcher and Larry hide behind the Buroninstad mausoleum. 
           Fletcher holds the pistol. Larry a spear.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Okay, as soon as that light goes 
                        over there, we’re booking it. 

                                 LARRY
                        Can I have the gun? 

           Fletcher laughs heroically. As the spotlight moves away, he 
           twirls the gun like a cowboy.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Let’s go kill some Micks.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - MOMENTS LATER

           The drawbridge is up. The castle walls are 2 stories tall. 
           The moat is 20 feet wide. Buroninstad has never seemed more 
           ominous.

           Fletcher and Larry sprint towards the castle under cover of 
           darkness.

           They reach the edge of the dark moat. Fletcher wades in.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Now we cross.

                                 LARRY
                        What about Piranhas? 

                                 FLETCHER
                        They’re delicious. 

           Larry cautiously follows him into the cold water. He waits 
           for a moment, but no piranhas bite him. Safe. 

           They wade across.

           They are flush against the castle now. Ten feet above them is 
           an overhanging ledge with a hole in it. 
           A hole that dumps into the moat. Just wide enough, they could 
           maybe squeeze through.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        Follow me up this medieval toilet.

                                 LARRY
                        What if someone, you know... uses 
                        it.

                                 FLETCHER
                        I forgot you don’t have your own 
                        castle.
                             (slowly, like to a child)
                        This toilet is 500 years old. It’s 
                        for show. 

           Larry cups his hands together to boost Fletcher. He climbs 
           up, then onto his shoulders and grabs hold of the toilet 
           hole. 

           Fletcher disappears up into the dark toilet. 

           INT. CASTLE - MEDIEVAL BATHROOM - SAME

           Fletcher contorts and climbs his way out of the primitive 
           stone toilet. He turns back and reaches down for Larry.

           EXT. CASTLE - UNDER THE TOILET - SAME

           Fletcher’s arm pokes through the hole above Larry. He shivers 
           in the cold water. Fletcher stretches his fingers down to 
           him. Larry hesitates, looks back toward the graveyard.

                                 LARRY
                        We could use their help.

           INT. CASTLE - MEDIEVAL BATHROOM - SAME

           Fletcher reaches down into the hole.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Forget them, Larry.

                                 LARRY
                        Maybe there’s a safer way in?

           BEHIND FLETCHER, one of the terrorists cautiously creeps down 
           the hall. MCSORLEY silently steps up to the bathroom door. 
           Confused, he watches Fletcher with his head and hands in the 
           toilet.
                                 FLETCHER
                             (into toilet)
                        Come on. It’s just you and me. 

           McSorley blinks-- is he talking to his...?

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        I need you covering my ass up here!

           McSorley wrinkles his nose. Fletcher pleads into the toilet.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        We’re a team. You and me, together 
                        to the end!
                             (his fury building)
                        Don’t you leave me up here! I made 
                        you! You piece of shit! I MADE YOU! 

           Finally McSorley cocks his gun and levels it at Fletcher.

                                 MCSORLEY 
                        You gotta let that shite go, boyo. 

           Fletcher kicks out his foot and SLAMS the door shut on 
           McSorley. He holds his foot against the door to keep him out.

           EXT. CASTLE - UNDER THE TOILET - SAME

           Larry backs away from Fletcher’s hand.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Now, Larry!

           BANG BANG!! Larry can hear McSorley SMASH away at the door.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        The two of us can take him 
                        together. 

                                 LARRY
                        Get back down here!

                                 FLETCHER
                        I can reach you! For England!

           INT. CASTLE - MEDIEVAL BATHROOM - SAME

           McSorley breaks through the door, machine gun in hand. 
           Fletcher’s caught with his hands in the toilet. Defenseless.
           EXT. CASTLE - UNDER THE TOILET - SAME

           Larry hears the scuffle above-- several men fighting with 
           Fletcher. His hand disappears up the toilet and out of 
           Larry’s view. 

                                 FLETCHER (O.S.)
                        AAAAHHHHHHH!-- LARRY!
                             (then)
                        YOU’RE FIRED!

           --And then nothing but the quiet murmur of the moat.

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATE - SAME

           The army watches a satellite view of the castle. Larry wades 
           back through the moat alone.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        That could have gone better.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        They’re only human.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                             (disgusted)
                        Humans...

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - CEMETERY - LATER

           Fog rolls in through the eerily quiet graveyard. Larry creeps 
           through the darkness alone. His soaking wet shoes SQUISH with 
           every step.

           He gets back to their spot and looks around. No sign of 
           anyone.

                                 NANDO
                        They left.

           Nando hangs upside-down from a tree limb doing sit-ups.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Once I finish my workout, I too 
                        will leave.

                                 LARRY
                        What do you mean, they left?

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - NEAR MAIN GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dangerous walks along the dirt road that leads to the main 
           gate. Larry runs from behind him and catches up.
                                 LARRY
                        Where are you going?!

           He realizes that Nando is walking with Dangerous.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                             (out of breath, to Nando)
                        Wait how’d you get here before me?

                                 NANDO
                        You are very slow.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Glad you could join us, man. We’re 
                        going out the front gate.

                                 LARRY
                        Are you insane!?

                                 NANDO
                        They will not shoot Nando. 

                                 LARRY
                        The WILL shoot Nando. They will 
                        definitely shoot Nando!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Look here, Yankee Doodle. I don’t 
                        pay for liquor or getting me 
                        sausage tickled, and I certainly 
                        don’t wait in line at clubs. And 
                        what is a hostage situation if not 
                        like a reverse nightclub where 
                        getting OUT is the hard part?

                                 LARRY
                        This isn’t a nightclub!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I said “reverse nightclub.” Try to 
                        pay attention.

                                 LARRY
                        Where’s Jonathan Clark Wendell? 
                        He’s the only one with a brain 
                        around here--

           Larry trips to the ground. Finds himself face to face with--

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Shhhhh.

           We can just barely make out his eyes, as he’s camouflaged in 
           a costume of--
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                        A decoupage of leaves, twigs, 
                        branches and grass. The perfect 
                        botanical disguise for sneaking out 
                        the gate.

           Larry leaps to his feet.

                                 LARRY
                        You really think they’re going to 
                        let you walk out that gate? They’ll 
                        shoot you. They already got Skip.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        S’okay. Not one of me best mates, 
                        anyway.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        They can’t shoot what they can’t 
                        see.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell disappears into the foliage.

                                 LARRY
                        Nando?!

                                 NANDO
                        I am a man of instinct. 

           Nando powers ahead. Dangerous pats Larry on the back.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I’d say it’s been nice meeting you, 
                        but I don’t even know your name.

                                 LARRY
                             (annoyed)
                        I’m Larry!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Oh that’s adorable. You thought we 
                        was becomin’ friends? In the summer 
                        of ‘82 I thought I was becoming 
                        friends with my tour manager. But 
                        then after six months of rocking 
                        around the world I didn’t see him 
                        for a year.

                                 LARRY
                        Your tour was over.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Right. Today is like a really 
                        really short tour. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANGEROUS (CONT'D)
                             (Dange walks away)
                        Goodbye, tour manager.

           Exhausted, Larry stops and they leave him behind.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - MAIN GATE - LATER

           McFarland and McGrath keep watch. We can see the army camp 
           just outside the gate.

           They look up and see Dangerous marching towards them, his 
           jiggling gut leading the way. Nando marches beside him.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        ‘Allo mates, step aside, celebrity 
                        coming through. Prep the champagne 
                        room on the other side please-- 
                        Extra strippers as usual.

           At first the terrorists are too shocked to even move.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        Yup. It’s really me. I know the 
                        presence of greatness can be 
                        shockin’.

                                 NANDO
                        It is not polite to stare.

           From the dirt road in the distance, Larry watches, unsure 
           what to do. He realizes a tree is moving, a tree with legs 
           and arms. It’s Jonathan Clark Wendell, silently closing in on 
           his freedom from the side.

                                 DANGEROUS
                         But seriously now, step aside. 

           The terrorists lower their weapons and OPEN FIRE. Dangerous 
           and Nando stagger backward before running away. Larry watches 
           in terror.

           Suddenly McFarland glances to the treeline.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Hey! That tree’s moving!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        No it’s not!

           BRAT-TAT-TAT!!! JCW sheds his branches and leaps to the dirt. 
           He crawls away.
           EXT CASTLE - NEAR MAIN GATE - SECONDS LATER

           Jonathan Clark Wendell, Dangerous and Nando sprint away from 
           the gate towards Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        I told you!

           The terrorists give chase. McGrath reveals a grenade. Pulls 
           the pin. He lobs it.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Scatter!

           Larry, Dangerous, and JCW dive. But Nando stands tall.

                                 NANDO
                        All will be fine.

                                 LARRY
                        Nando, no!

                                 NANDO
                        Nandoooooo!!!!

           He does a bicycle kick. Slow motion-- the grenade flies 
           towards him. Nando spins in the air, always the hero. His 
           cleats, the only shoes he will ever wear, connect with the 
           grenade to kick it back.

           The terrorists dive out of the way.

           And as Nando’s foot touches it-- the grenade explodes. Nando 
           crashes to the ground. Looks down and sees a stump.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        My mother’s shoe!

           His foot’s been blown clean off. 

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Your foot’s been blown clean off!

                                 NANDO
                        AND THE CLEAT MY MOTHER MADE ME!!! 

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Forget the bloody cleat.

           He scrambles away. Larry scoops up the injured Nando into his 
           arms.

                                 NANDO
                        Mi madre los hizo de--
                                 LARRY
                        Your foot is gone!

           Larry and knights take off running for the forest. The 
           terrorists regroup-- some stay, some give chase.

                                 NANDO
                        Find the shoe. FIND THE SHOE!

           Larry passes a single black shoelace. All that’s left. He 
           wraps the shoelace as a tourniquet and ties it off to stop 
           the bleeding. 

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                             (delirious from pain)
                        You are very good with a shoelace. 

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - PARAPET - SAME

           Through binoculars, Daniel sees the unfolding fire-fight from 
           up above. He whips around. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Tommy, we agreed no shootin’.

           Sploder picks at his teeth with a knife.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I gave them a direct order.

                                 SPLODER
                        Oh Danny boy, you know me mates get 
                        itchy trigger fingers. Can’t ‘spect 
                        them to obey every order.

                                 DANIEL
                        But that’s exactly what I expect. 
                        Why wouldn’t I expect that?

           Sploder spits on the ground.

                                 SPLODER
                        Your brothers always knew what to 
                        expect.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well I’m not me brothers.

           Sploder spits again. This time on Daniel. He’s speechless.

                                 SPLODER
                        Your brothers woulda ‘spected that.
           EXT. FOREST WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - MOMENTS LATER

           Bullets SNAP overhead. They sprint through the forest and 
           Larry struggles to keep up with Nando in his arms.

                                 NANDO
                             (to JCW)
                        Sing to me, little bird. Sing me 
                        the last song I will ever hear.

                                 LARRY
                        He’s in shock.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (not impressed)
                        I’ve lost more blood in bowel 
                        movements.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You’re not going to die.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Not till they catch us, anyway.

           They weave through the trees. Nando starts weeping.

                                 NANDO
                             (hoarse whisper)
                        Sing to me, Jonathan Clark Wendell! 
                        Siiiiiiiiiiing to me!

                                 LARRY
                        Just sing to the man.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Wasn’t Fishes enough for you?

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Give him a little ditty.

                                 NANDO
                        Sing me to heaven!!!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Leave me alone, you vultures.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You’re all mouf and no trousers, 
                        man.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        THERE’S TOO MUCH PRESSURE!!!
           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - PARAPET - SAME

           Bullets ring out in the background. Daniel’s voice quivers.

                                 DANIEL
                        Tommy. We said it would be a 
                        peaceful negotiation. 

           Sploder gets right in his face. Cheeks flushed.

                                 SPLODER
                        I want yer brothers out, same as 
                        you. Hell, I loved them more than 
                        you ever did.

           Daniel tries to hide the sting.

                                 SPLODER (CONT’D)
                        That’s the only reason me and me 
                        boys are out here tonight. Not for 
                        you. For them. So we’re doin’ 
                        things my way.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m-- I’m in charge here.

                                 SPLODER
                        If you question me again I’ll blow 
                        up your house, your mom’s house, 
                        and yer doghouse!
                             (super intense)
                        Do I make myself clear?

                                 DANIEL
                             (super scared)
                        Crystal.

           Sploder blinks.

                                 SPLODER
                        What’s ‘at mean?

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s how clear I am. Crystal.

           Sploder shakes his head. Still not getting it.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s a thing people say to show how 
                        clear they are. You know? Crystal. 
                        The fancy glass. Like Waterford or--
                                 SPLODER
                        Never seen it. I grew up poor in 
                        Northern Ireland, unlike you, ya 
                        prissy boarding-school pansy fook. 
                        Now I don’t want to hear about 
                        crystal ever again. Do I make 
                        myself clear?

                                 DANIEL
                             (after a moment)
                        ...as clear as glass.

           EXT. CEMETERY WITHIN THE CASTLE WALLS - LATER

           Larry and the knights sprint through the cemetery. Glancing 
           behind them-- the terrorists haven’t yet followed them out of 
           the woods.

                                 LARRY
                        Wait!

           Larry whirls around and approaches the loose BURONINSTAD 
           mausoleum entrance.

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETARY - LATER

           The terrorists emerge from the trees and patrol the graves.

           They notice the mausoleum entrance is slightly off-kilter. 
           McGrath pushes it aside. They look down into the dark 
           passageway beneath the graveyard.

           INT. BURONINSTAD CATACOMBS - SAME

           Larry and the knights hurry through semi-darkness. Dange 
           lights the way with his cigarette lighter. Larry still 
           carries Nando, who moans in pain.

                                 NANDO
                        Put me in, coach. I can still 
                        score. Larry. Put me down! I can do 
                        this! Help is for the weak! LARRY!

           Larry covers his mouth and hurries onward. Dangerous turns 
           back to Jonathan Clark Wendell.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Havin’ a spot of writer’s block? 

                                 LARRY
                        Shhhhh!
                                 DANGEROUS
                        You ain’t written a song in twenty 
                        years.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I’m the best-reviewed writer in the 
                        history of musical theater. What if 
                        I write something bad-- imagine all 
                        the awful things they could say! 
                        There’s so many dreadful 
                        possibilities.

                                 NANDO
                             (delirious, singing)
                        “Bubble bubble bubble.”

           Larry looks off into the darkness, terrified. 

                                 LARRY
                        Shhhh! They’re right behind us!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        What the fook does “bubbles” even 
                        mean?!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        They’re fish. Shall I deny them 
                        their bubbles?

           INT. CATACOMB TUNNEL - SAME

           The terrorists follow their trail, listening for the SOUND of 
           their distant argument.

           INT. CATACOMBS - SAME

           Larry and the knights come to a halt.

           The tunnel splits into multiple branches. One. Two. Three 
           tunnels lead into darkness. Nando looks very afraid. A fourth 
           tunnel leads deeper underground and SKULLS ON POSTS mark its 
           entrance.

                                 NANDO
                        It is a tunnel of death.

           Larry tries to lead them down the tunnel of death. 

                                 LARRY
                        They’d be crazy to follow us. 
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You’re daft, Lawrence. That 
                        portentous path shall lead to our 
                        demise. Three safer options at our 
                        disposal, but which to chose?

           Dangerous ignores them all and takes off down the third 
           tunnel, away from the tunnel of death.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell reluctantly follows. 

           Larry takes off his tux jacket and throws it down a different 
           tunnel. Then he follows Dangerous’s light.

           INT. BURONINSTAD CATACOMBS - LATER

           The terrorist patrol makes its way to the split. They find 
           Larry’s jacket in the second tunnel. They go that way-- the 
           wrong way.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Larry pushes a rock aside and climbs up from underground. 
           Nando’s on his back. The knights follow them into the fresh 
           air, freedom.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        At last, liberation! I’m finally 
                        done with you plonkers.

                                 LARRY
                        Jonathan--

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        And YOU! Here’s a play for you. 
                        Scene one: 
                             (stomping around)
                        “I’m Lawrence! I want to save 
                        Fletcher! He doesn’t give two twats 
                        about me, but I love him and I want 
                        to marry him!”

                                 LARRY
                        Ummm...

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Scene two: “I’m Jonathan Clark 
                        Wendell. I don’t want to marry 
                        Fletcher. I want to go the bloody 
                        hell home, and that’s what I’m 
                        going to do.” Toodles, wankers.

                                 LARRY
                        We’re still inside.
           Two perimeter walls converge into a concave corner. For a 
           brief moment, JCW tries digging under the wall like a dog. 
           Larry and Dangerous get pelted with dirt clumps. He stops.

           He proudly brushes himself off and lifts his chin.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Well. You’re still wankers.

           INT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - THE CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Daniel is alone, deep in prayer. His hands pressed together.

                                 DANIEL 
                             (sotto)
                        Are you there, God? It’s me, 
                        Daniel. 

           BAM! The door flies open. McSorley and Sploder drag a beat-up 
           Fletcher into the Chapel. 

                                 SPLODER
                        If yer prayin’ for queers then God 
                        was listening.

                                 DANIEL
                        Where’d ya find him?

                                 MCSORLEY
                        Talking to his poop, sir.

           McSorley throws Fletcher to the chapel floor.

                                 DANIEL
                        Skip Fletcher. Ya fled with three 
                        knights. Where are they?

                                 FLETCHER
                        My photographic memory seems to 
                        have failed me.

           Daniel leans in close, his face half-hidden in darkness.

                                 DANIEL
                        Tell me where they are!

           Ribs bruised, Fletcher has trouble puffing out his chest, but 
           he manages to stand up. He speaks slowly and clearly.

                                 FLETCHER
                        They’re hiding in your mother’s 
                        butthole.
           After a sigh and dainty gesture from Daniel, McSorley 
           unleashes a vicious barrage of upper cuts and hooks. 

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        If you’re gonna beat me up-- oof-- 
                        then you better not stop until I’m 
                        dead-- augh-- cause I will break 
                        every bone in your body.

           Daniel turns his head, unable to watch the beating.

                                 SPLODER
                        What’s a matter Danny boy? Don’t 
                        have the stomach for this line of 
                        work?

           EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

           Crickets chirp. Trees sway in the wind. In a clearing, we 
           find the knights. Larry checks out Nando’s stumpy leg.

                                 NANDO
                        I will play football again, you 
                        think so?

           His ankle looks like it’s been mauled by a bear.

                                 LARRY
                        Yyyyyyyyyyeah, I don’t see why not.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Your ankle looks like a vagina. 
                        How’s it feel?

                                 NANDO
                        Pain is temporary. Greatness is 
                        forever.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (smug, to JCW)
                        I meant how’s it feel to have 
                        writers block?

                                 LARRY
                        We’re going to die out here and you 
                        want to antagonize him about 
                        music?! Who cares who’s better!

           Dangerous fidgets.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (soft)
                        I’m better.
           Larry takes a calming breath through his clenched jaw.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                             (super soft)
                        Right, Larry?

                                 LARRY
                        Stop it! 

           Larry points at Nando’s foot.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        We should be hiding safe in the 
                        graveyard! But now they’re looking 
                        for us. This is your fault. So now 
                        you have to deal with it!

           Larry storms off into the forest alone. Nando tries to rise 
           and follow him.

                                 NANDO
                        Wait, Larry! Aughhh...

           He falls and passes out. Dange and JCW stare at his limp 
           body.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        One of us should carry him while I 
                        lead.

           JCW scoffs, pushes past Dange, and follows Larry. Dange goes 
           too, leaving Nando’s unconscious body in the clearing. All 
           alone. The wind picks up.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell stomps back. He grabs Nando’s arms and 
           drags him away.

           EXT. DEEPER IN THE FOREST - LATER

           Larry sulks through the forest by himself. He glances back 
           and sees the knights following at a distance, trying to look 
           like they’re not following. Larry walks faster.

           Dangerous and JCW-- carrying Nando-- match his pace.

           Above them, A Raven CAWS and swoops down over Dange’s head. 
           He swipes at it. Watches longingly as it flies away.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I’m so hungry.
           EXT. EVEN DEEPER IN THE FOREST - LATER

           Very dark now. The knights have closed the distance between 
           them and Larry. Larry looks worn-out, too tired to fight 
           them. He pushes through brambles to find--

           --A wooden structure. Hidden in the forest. A small shaft of 
           sunlight hits the building’s straw-thatched roof.

           INT. STABLES - LATER

           The door CREAKS open. Light from outside spills in around 
           Larry’s silhouette. Dust settles. He gestures and Dangerous 
           tosses him the cigarette lighter. He steps inside.

           Floorboards CREAK with every step. Larry squints in the 
           darkness and fumbles with the lighter.

           After several tries, the lighter finally sparks and 
           illuminates the room. It reveals the ghoulish spectre of--

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.

           She blows the lighter out.

           INT. STABLES - NIGHT

           Moonlight pours in the now-open shutters. Bales of hay line 
           the walls. Nando lies in a bed of hay. Unconscious.

           DAME JUDI DENCH serves Larry and the knights tea heated over 
           the fireplace. She wears a tunic, her hair in buns.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Dame Judi Dench, I haven’t seen you 
                        since the old days.

           Dame Judi Dench stomps on the floor-- BANG BANG BANG!

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.

           She clutches her bosom and looks to the door. Larry follows 
           her gaze. Dangerous hides.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        All hail Macbeth. Hail to thee, 
                        Thane of Cawdor.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL

                        tickets, of course.

                                 LARRY
                        One-woman Macbeth?

           She curtsies.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Welcome to my stables, fair 
                        knights. I have made them my home 
                        and I pray thee shall rest here if 
                        your journey permits.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (realizing)
                        She’s method acting.

           Judi Dench pulls a roasted turkey leg from the fire and GNAWS 
           a huge chunk.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        She’s crackers, what she is.

           EXT. STABLES - NIGHT

           A few birds chirp at this late hour. Larry steps out of the 
           stables, answering his cell phone as he walks into the 
           forest.

                                 LARRY
                        This is Larry.

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - COMMAND POST - SAME

           Under the harsh army floodlights, Colonel Westlake is calling 
           with the Satellite phone.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Are you or are you not Skip 
                        Fletcher’s executive assistant?

           INTERCUT with Larry wandering through the dark woods:

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, I actually don’t have Skip at 
                        the moment... um, can he call you 
                        back?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Fletcher’s gone, you know what that 
                        means? 
                                 LARRY
                        We’re fucked?

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        It means you’re our only hope. 
                        You’ve still got three men. There’s 
                        still a chance. The Queen’s life 
                        depends on it!

           Larry isn’t listening anymore. In fact, he’s stopped dead in 
           his tracks, because on his walkabout he stumbled across--

           --ONE OF SPLODER’S BOMBS. Out here, deep in the forest. Wired 
           to a radio antennae with an ominous red light. 

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE (CONT’D)
                        Stop being a baby and answer me, 
                        goddammit!

           INT. STABLE - LATER

           Nando’s eyes flutter open. He groans. Dangerous and Jonathan 
           Clark Wendell are huddled around him. Dame Judi Dench 
           finishes wrapping cloth around his stumpy leg. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        It won’t get infected. I’ve sealed 
                        your wound, good sir knight.

           Nando’s eyes flash to a hot branding iron by the fire.

                                 NANDO
                        Who is this white woman? 

           He moves to stand up. Jonathan Clark Wendell steadies him. 
           Nando pushes his hand away and falls back into the hay.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        You’re going to be in a lot of 
                        pain.

           Dangerous reluctantly digs in his pocket. He hands Nando--

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Valium, Percocet, Oxycontin. I was 
                        saving these for the afterparty. 

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - DAWN

           The sun rises from behind the castle. It casts a long shadow 
           across the graveyard.
           EXT. STABLES - SAME

           Larry sits on the roof of the stable watching the sunrise. A 
           few birds chirp. Then the CHIRPING of his phone interrupts 
           this peaceful moment. He answers:

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Larry? I’m so glad I got through-- 
                        I’ve been trying for hours. Tell me 
                        your okay. Tell me you’re not 
                        there.

                                 LARRY
                        I’m fine. I’m not in the castle. 
                        I’m hiding.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        That’s great. Just stay in the 
                        background and let other people 
                        handle the hard stuff. 

           Larry peers over the trees, to the castle in the distance.

                                 LARRY
                        You know me, babe. Just like I 
                        always do.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Good.

                                 LARRY
                        But... if for some reason I do get 
                        myself into... a situation... and 
                        something should happen, you 
                        already know this, but I love you.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Don’t you die on me, Larry. God, 
                        that sounded stupid.

                                 LARRY
                        I’ll pick up toilet paper on the 
                        way home. Quilted Northern?

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        I love you.

           He hangs up. Listens to the birds chirping. In the distance 
           he hears a soft rhythmic CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK. He follows 
           the noise. 
           EXT. BEHIND THE STABLES - MOMENTS LATER

           Dame Judi Dench practices fencing moves against a tree with a 
           wooden sword. CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK. For an old lady, her 
           swordsmanship is impeccable. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Turn hellhound, turn! Get thee 
                        back, my soul is too much charged 
                        with blood of thine already.

                                 LARRY
                        Who me?

           She throws him a wooden sword. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        I have no words, my voice is in my 
                        sword.

           She thrusts at him with all her might. Larry has no idea what 
           to do. She WHACKS him across the face. He doubles over in 
           pain. Judi plunges the wooden sword into the mossy ground.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me, kind sir--

                                 LARRY
                        --What the hell!--

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        --for I thought thee a knight.

                                 LARRY
                        That sword’s pointy-- you could 
                        have stabbed me. You were so quick 
                        and accurate, I couldn’t stop it.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        I am a dame of the British Empire.

                                 LARRY
                        You’re like a Shakespearean Vin 
                        Diesel.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        I know.

           Larry looks at the wooden sword. Then gazes up at the 
           towering figure of Dame Judi Dench, silhouetted by the rising 
           sun. 

                                 LARRY
                        Can you... teach us?
           Dame Judi Dench offers Larry her hand.

           EXT. FOREST NEAR STABLES - NIGHT

           Larry, Dangerous, Nando, and JCW stand around the bomb. The 
           red light blinks rhythmically.

                                 LARRY
                        This is what we’re up against.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Keep your knickers on, mate. All we 
                        have to do is get far enough away 
                        from it.

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LATER

           In a different part of the woods, Larry and the knights stare 
           down at a different bomb.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (shrugs)
                        He’s thorough, that Sploder-- I’ll 
                        give ‘em that.

                                 LARRY
                        They’re everywhere. The way I see 
                        it, we have two choices. Either we 
                        try to end this ourselves, or we 
                        explode.

           They stare down at the bomb. 

                                 NANDO
                        I would like a third choice, 
                        please.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You can’t know that. There’s a 
                        million possible endgames-- oh 
                        lord, there’s too many to even 
                        consider!

                                 LARRY
                        The guy’s name is SPLODER. Every 
                        inch of this place is wired. The 
                        minute they get what they want? We 
                        explode. That’s how he’s always 
                        done business.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell gets real friendly with him. Pats him 
           on the shoulder.
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I understand, Larry. You wish to 
                        make your mark on the world and all 
                        that poppycock. But we’re already 
                        more important than a thousand of 
                        you. We’re knights. We’re too 
                        significant to risk our lives.

           Larry nods for a long time. Buying time, or stalling, as he 
           searches for something in himself. Then he UNLOADS on them--

                                 LARRY
                        You’ve been coddled celebrities 
                        your whole lives. Everything you 
                        ever wanted, you got it. But it’s 
                        time to stop being little bitches.

           The knights are taken aback, but Larry keeps going-- 
           appealing to their ego.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Dangerous-- I know you picked 
                        fights every night in the 70’s. I 
                        mean, you named yourself DANGEROUS.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I beat up three vicars on two 
                        separate occasions.

                                 LARRY
                        Nando-- you scored in the 90th 
                        minute against Italy while you had 
                        a broken leg. 

                                 NANDO
                        ...and three broken ribs.

                                 LARRY
                        And Jonathan Clark Wendell-- The 
                        whole world knows you’re a creative 
                        genius. Let’s use that big brain to 
                        fight these terrorists.

           Dange and Nando consider...

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I was quite the bruiser in my time. 
                        I’m in.

                                 NANDO
                        Nothing good has ever happened 
                        without Nando.

           JCW stares at Larry with beady dark eyes.
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        My interest in suicide is minimal.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        That’s fine, we don’t need a second 
                        creative genius.

                                 LARRY
                        Fine, fine. Let me just a recorded 
                        statement for all your fans.

           As Larry pulls out his cell phone and gets ready to record--

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Put that away, how dare you, you 
                        twat, you tossrag you--

           Larry hits record on his camera phone. JCW instantly smiles.

                                 LARRY
                             (super friendly)
                        Jonathan Clark Wendell! Will you 
                        save the Queen?

           Jonathan Clark Wendell fights to maintain his public smile. 
           His face is a battlefield of fury hidden under the happiness.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        It would be... an honor.

           Larry puffs out his chest.

                                 LARRY
                        Fantastic.

           INT. STABLES - DAY

           A pile of fancy clothes sits in the corner. Now wearing gray 
           tunics, Larry and the knights line up in front of Dame Judi 
           Dench. She paces before them not unlike a drill sergeant. 

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        If you are to do this, you must 
                        harken back to the days leading up 
                        to your knighting ceremonies.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You mean when that lady put the 
                        sword on me shoulder?

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        No! The six weeks of rigorous 
                        training before that.
           Dange nods. He gets what she means.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You mean heroin?

                                 NANDO
                        I train every day.

           She whirls and SHOUTS at them.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        DO YOU EMBRACE YOUR INEVITABLE 
                        DEATHS?

           They’re all taken aback. Then, timidly...

                                 LARRY
                        Yes... my liege?

           She nods-- good. Waits for the others.

                                 NANDO
                        Yes, my liege.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Yes, my liege.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Erm...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                             (spittle in his face)
                        DO YOU EMBRACE YOUR INEVITABLE 
                        DEATH?

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Yes, my liege.

           She resumes her drill sergeant pacing.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Although you have been knighted, 
                        you are not yet knights. This will 
                        be the hardest, most grueling 
                        challenge of your lives. AND I 
                        DON’T THINK YOU’RE UP FOR IT. 
                        You’re going to want to stop, take 
                        a break, take it easy, read Parade 
                        Magazine on the toilet, go home and 
                        suckle your mother’s teat.

           Dangerous leans over and whispers to Larry.
                                 DANGEROUS
                        I’d suckle HER teat.

           WHAM! Judi punches him bare-knuckle right in the nose.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        OW! BLOODY CHRIST!

                                 LARRY
                        He didn’t mean it.

           WHAM! She hits Larry. He goes down. Scared, Jonathan Clark 
           Wendell flinches.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Back in line!

           She clocks him one-- WHAM!

           Dame Judi Dench stands over their groaning bodies. Nando 
           stands perfectly still on one foot. But then pride gets the 
           best of him.

                                 NANDO
                        Just give me a sword and I will 
                        take care of it.

           WHAM! She nails him in the face. He shakes it out, then he 
           hits her back. She DECKS him with an UPPERCUT and launches 
           him in a sailing arc to the ground. 

           MONTAGE, to Dangerous’s rock anthem, “Broken Seatbelt” (a la 
           Black Sabbath’s “Paranoid”):

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Wooden swords CLICK-CLACK against each other.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A knight must be quick.

           Larry and the knights practice dueling.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Don’t even know why I’m learning 
                        this.
                             (weirdly proud)
                        I’m a pacifist.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Dame Judi Dench, Dangerous, and Larry hold out their arms. 
                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A knight is a friend to animals.

           SKREEEE! A WAR FALCON dives down and lands on Judi’s arm. 
           Another one lands on Larry’s. He feeds it a treat.

           CAKAWW! A third falcon attacks Dange’s face. He grabs the 
           bird and shoves its head into his mouth. He’s about to CHOMP 
           but Larry stops him.

                                 LARRY
                        A knight doesn’t eat his falcon.

           Dame Judi Dench nods. Correct.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Force of habit.

           EXT. STABLES - DAY

           Judi CLANGS on an anvil-- forging hot metal from the fire 
           into--

           --A medieval prosthetic foot.

           EXT. STABLES - LATER

           Wooden swords CLACK. Larry and Dangerous battle. JCW battles 
           Nando. Nando has trouble keeping balance, even with his new 
           foot.

           He falls. JCW catches him, but--

                                 NANDO
                        I can do it.

                                 LARRY
                        We’re a team, Nando.

           He pushes JWC away. Then falls into the mud. Dange hits him 
           over and over with the sword for good measure.

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Nando leads the group in seated stretches-- something he can 
           do. He reaches as far as he can. The group can’t come close. 
           Judi can.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A knight is flexible.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You look a little gay, Nando.
                                 NANDO
                             (in a full split)
                        What is “gay” is how inflexible you 
                        are.

           EXT. STABLES - DAY

           Judi’s horse rears back.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A knight must ride.

           Larry momentarily rides a horse before being BUCKED OFF. Same 
           with Nando. Jonathan Clark Wendell rides side-saddle with 
           expert grace. As he passes Judi, she grabs his legs and pulls 
           into the mud.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        Mount the damn horse like a man.

            Dangerous rides like a true jockey. 

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Oooo. I love feeling horsehair on 
                        me goolies. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Wooden swords CLACK. Our boys duel. They’re getting better.

           INT. STABLE HOUSE - LATER

           Intense concentration on Larry’s face.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        A knight honors his master.

           He’s concentrating on her toenails as he paints them. She 
           relaxes naked in a bath. The other knights brush her hair, 
           massage her, file her fingernails. JCW reacts in horror.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Your cuticles are a train wreck. 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           They all hold wooden swords, thrusting and parrying with 
           equal grace.

           Judi watches them, pleased.

           Sitting near the map of the castle, Colonel Westlake stares 
           at his satellite phone. His link to the knights.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Ring, damn you. RING.

           A furious General Howson appears behind him.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        I just spoke to the Prime Minister-- 
                        he’s chopping off our balls.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        Just give my knights time.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        For the love of figgy pudding and 
                        all things holy! Your precious 
                        knights have left us no other 
                        option.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        You wanted them to fail!

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        Because of you, we’re about to free 
                        seven deadly brothers the likes of 
                        which England’s never seen.

           He gets on his knees and clings to the general.

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        One more chance-- I’M BEGGING YOU!

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                             (disgusted)
                        Colonel Westlake, you don’t deserve 
                        to wear that mustache.

           Keys jingle. A GUARD opens the lock. The cell door slides 
           open. He reads from a list, scared out of his mind...

                                 BELMARSH GUARD

           A single old man stares back at him.

                                 OLD BLACK MAN
                        Sure, if it gets me out of here.

                             (sinister)

           General Howson paces on the phone. He’s sweating up a storm,

                        We’ve done everything you’ve asked.
                        But, you have to understand these

           Daniel listens, phone to his ear. Pistol in the other hand. 
           The Queen watches from the bed. Sploder glowers by the door. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I can’t believe it! A thousand

                        bring to have one more day at the 
                        beach. Ah, how Dougal loved the 
                        feeling of sand between his toes.
                             (lost in memories)

                        Enough Dougaling!

                                 DANIEL
                        So how long til I see the boys, 
                        especially Dougal-- an hour, a day? 
                        Don’t worry about that deadline.

                        We weren’t really going to hurt 
                        anyone.

           Sploder can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 SPLODER
                        Gimme that, ya priss.
                             (into phone)
                        Listen to this, ya limey shite 
                        bastards!

           Sploder darts his hand around Daniel’s pistol. Locks his 
           finger over Daniel’s trigger finger. Before Daniel knows 
           what’s happening, Sploder squeezes-- they pull the trigger 
           together. 

           KRACK-- they shoot the Queen in the leg. She screams.

           Daniel is horrified. Sploder holds out the phone, shouts to 
           it.

                                 SPLODER (CONT’D)
                        Here that? That’s the sound of 
                        freedom! Yeh got four hours left.

           He throws Daniel onto the bed.

                                 SPLODER (CONT’D)
                        The two of yeh deserve each other.

           He locks them inside as they SCREAM and we CUT TO--

           INT. STABLES - DAY

           Exhausted, Jonathan Clark Wendell throws his wooden sword 
           aside and collapse into a pile of hay.

           Near the fireplace, Nando tinkers with his iron foot. He 
           inspects it closely.

                                 NANDO
                        With the power of iron, perhaps now 
                        I can kick the ball twice as far.

                             (half-asleep)
                        That makes sense.

           Dangerous brushes a pony’s tail. Larry enters.

                        My friends call me Dange. Other

                        People who ain’t me friends. I’m a 
                        complicated man with a complicated

                                 LARRY
                        We might have to kill some people. 
                        Hey, have you ever killed a bear 
                        with a spear?

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Yeah one time at the zoo, but it 
                        was an accident. I’m a pacifist, 
                        remember?

           Dange sizes Larry up, like he’s seeing him as a human being 
           for the first time.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        You seem like a smart fellow,

                        wanker like Skip Fletcher?

                                 LARRY
                        Actually, he just fired me.

                        It sucks. The last guy who had my 
                        job came up with a cheaper way to 
                        package tennis balls. Now he’s the 
                        head of Fletcher Sports. Another 
                        year and I would have had my own

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You mean-- Fletcher Laces. 

           Dangerous rubs the horse’s back. He gets a philosophical 
           twinkle in his eye.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)

                        What, “Dange.”

           Larry smiles, ready to bask in his new friend’s wisdom.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Everyone’s always talking bout 
                        horsecocks like they’re so 
                        impressive. But you know what never 
                        gets any credit for being fucking 
                        massive?

           Larry stares.

           INT. CATACOMBS - DAY

           Pitch darkness. Footsteps come towards us.

           Their torches lighting the way, Dame Judi leads Larry and the 
           knights through the catacombs.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        You’re almost ready, but first 
                        you’ll need weapons and armor. 

                                 NANDO
                        Even with one foot, I am still more 
                        deadly than any weapon.

           INT. CATACOMBS - TUNNEL JUNCTION - LATER

           They stand before the skull-laden tunnel of death.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Get ye to the tomb of Lord 
                        Buroninstad. That’s right, thee 
                        Lord Buroninstad.

                                 NANDO
                        Through the tunnel of death?

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I think it’s actually MORE knightly 
                        NOT to go.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Make no mistake-- ‘twill be most

                        But you need weapons and armor, and 
                        this is where they be found. Use 
                        your training and prove your worth.

           Larry takes a step forward. Judi grabs his shoulder.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH (CONT’D)
                        Be warned-- the path you tread will 
                        be guarded. Touch nothing until you 
                        reach the tomb itself. Return to 
                        me, if ye survive.

           Larry creeps across the threshold. The walls are made 
           entirely of BONES. After a moment, the others follow.

           INT. CATACOMBS - LATER

           Larry leads the knights deep into the tunnel of death. The 
           only sound is their heavy breathing. 

           Then, Larry hears an ominous CLICK under his foot.

           A pendulum swings out of the darkness. Wooden spikes, like 
           deadly golf tees, adorn the end. Larry screams but it’s too 
           late.

           The spikes nail him in the face. POOF-- a cloud of dust 
           surrounds his head. He keeps screaming--

                                 LARRY
                        Oh God! Oh God! I’m dead!

           The dust settles. The pendulum and all its rotted, wooden 
           spikes disintegrated on impact, leaving only an imprint on 
           Larry’s face.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Nice face. It’s a marked 
                        improvement.

           JCW examines the rotted boobytrap.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        It didn’t stand the test of time, I 
                        suppose.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        “Marked.” It was a pun. Fuck you 
                        for not laughing at me jokes.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:
           --Dangerous accidentally steps through a tripwire. POISON 
           DARTS shoot from the wall. Most bounce harmlessly off his 
           chest but one dart sticks him. Panic, but then he smiles.

                        Just enough poison to get me 
                        feeling good.

           --Jonathan Clark Wendell studies a complex stone puzzle as 
           SPIKED WALLS close in on them. He thinks and thinks. He 
           reaches out towards the puzzle, but then pulls his hand away 
           and thinks some more. The walls SPEED UP. Inches from their 
           bodies, JCW solves the puzzle and the walls stop.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        With plenty of time to spare.

           --Nando passes through a sliver of light. A GIANT SAW BLADE 
           slices out of the wall and cuts off his foot. His iron foot.

                                 NANDO
                             (popping the foot back on)
                        Thank God I blew off my foot or 
                        that would have been trouble.

           --Larry steps on a weighted stone. Above them, a wooden 
           ceiling panel BURSTS OPEN. Hundreds and hundreds of snakes 
           rain down on them. Snake skeletons, that is.

                                 LARRY
                             (genuinely touched)
                        Poor little guys starved to death 
                        up there.

           INT. CATACOMBS - TUNNEL JUNCTION - SAME

           Dame Judi Dench peers into the darkness of the tunnel of 
           death. Worried about her knights.

           Then she hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. She crouches low and 
           sees a terrorist search party.

           Their flashlight beams play above her. She presses down as 
           low as she can. The terrorists pass her without noticing.

           They head straight for the tunnel of death. 

           Dame Judi Dench clenches her fists. She knows what she has to 
           do. She charges--

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Something wicked this way comes!!!
           She’s quick. The terrorists take aim. She leaps side to side, 
           strafing, but she’s not quick enough. They OPEN FIRE.

           A hail of bullets tear through her robe. She seems to dance 
           as machinegun fire riddles her body. But they can’t stop her. 
           Bullets shredding her like confetti, she finally reaches the 
           terrorists and SNAPS THEIR NECKS.

           All three collapse.

           INT. CATACOMBS - BURONINSTAD’S TOMB - LATER

           Larry holds his torch high, leading the knights into...

           A massive underground burial chamber. 12-foot statues, maybe 
           Lord and Lady Buroninstad, adorn the back wall.

                                 LARRY
                        No one’s been down here for like 
                        500 years.

           The knights fan out among the four STONE COFFINS. 

           Larry scans the walls. Nothing. He looks around the dark 
           floor. No armor anywhere. 

           Larry pushes one of the coffins with all his might. The stone 
           lid BANGS to the ground. He stares down inside.

           INT. CATACOMBS - BURONINSTAD’S TOMB - MOMENTS LATER

           BANG! BANG! BANG! The knights open the other coffins. Each 
           one contains--

           --An ancient medieval knight’s body. Buried in his armor.

                                 LARRY
                        The knights of Buroninstad.

           INT. CATACOMBS - BURONINSTAD’S TOMB - LATER

           Larry and Nando take swords. Jonathan Clark Wendell-- a bow. 
           Dange’s eyes light up.

                        Now that’s a fookin’ axe.

           He lifts a giant axe like a guitar.

           INT. CATACOMBS - BURONINSTAD’S TOMB - LATER

           Larry and the knights don their new gear. 
           They put on chain mail. Then battle armor-- chestplates, 
           gauntlets, boots-- except Nando, who tightens his remaining 
           cleat. Finally, helmets, one by one.

           KNIGHTS. They stand four abreast, a proud fighting force.

           INT. CATACOMBS - TUNNEL JUNCTION - LATER

           Larry and the knights emerge from the tunnel of death. 
           They’re all smiles, until they find--

                                 LARRY
                        Dame Judi!

           She lies face-down in the tunnel junction. Her robe soaked 
           with blood. JCW covers his mouth, backs away. 

           Larry cautiously checks for a pulse. She GRABS his arm.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                             (with great effort)
                        Larrrrrry...

                                 LARRY
                        Where are they!

           Judi summons every ounce of strength and points--

           --at two dead terrorists. Broken necks. Guns and empty clips 
           littered all around them.

           Larry cradles her mangled body. She wheezes. Doesn’t have 
           long. The knights crowd around.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                             (seeing their armor)
                        You boys look great.
                             (she coughs blood)
                        Now you must confess your sins. 

                                 LARRY
                        Don’t try to talk...

           She clutches his breastplate.

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        There is one final test. Confession 
                        is the only way to purify your 
                        spirits. Without it you’re doomed 
                        to fail. You won’t be truly bound 
                        as brothers until you accept your 
                        faults and become whole.

                        Does chastity include the rump?

           With her final ounce of strength...

                                 DAME JUDI DENCH
                        Yes. And the mouth.

           She dies.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell starts to weep quietly.

                                 LARRY
                        She should have won an Oscar for 
                        NOTES ON A SCANDAL.

                                 NANDO
                        I like the James Bond movies.

                                 LARRY
                        She’s so much better than Helen 
                        Mirren or Maggie Smith. 

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Why, Judi, why!

           They hold her body tightly.

                                 LARRY
                        I feel like I had an intimate 
                        connection with her.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (confused)
                        I thought I was the only one who 
                        slept wif her.

           Larry stands up, vengeance on his face.

                                 LARRY
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        What about Confession? The final 
                        test?

                                 LARRY
                        They’re gonna blow up the castle in 
                        two hours.
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Heaven forbid we listen to Dame 
                        Judi Dench, the woman who gave her 
                        life to train us!

                                 LARRY
                        We’re definitely ready.

           MONTAGE, to Dangerous’s “Undercooked Chicken” (a la AC/DC’s 
           “Highway to Hell”):

           INT. STABLES - DAY

           The doors burst open. Larry and Nando gather supplies. Rope 
           from the horse post. Pulleys from the hay lift. Stakes from 
           around the fire pit.  

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - VALET LOT - LATER

           A limousine trunk opens. Dangerous and Jonathan Clark Wendell 
           peer inside. Dangerous removes a black case. 

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Me concert belt. Never leave home 
                        without it.

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Larry and Nando return with supplies piled high, just as JCW 
           and Dange return with the black case.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - DAY

           Stakes are hammered into the ground. Rope thrown over thick 
           branches.

           Nando scampers up a tree. He ties a pulley to a branch.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell frets over every detail. He keeps 
           retying the rope. Unsure.  

           INT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - QUEEN’S ROOM - DAY 

           Daniel rips fabric from the bed. He starts wrapping the 
           Queen’s leg. She pushes him away and finishes it herself. 

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - DAY

           Larry huddles up with the knights. Jonathan Clark Wendell is 
           still tinkering with part of the rigging.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        One moment.
                                 LARRY
                        Jonathan Clark Wendell...

           He adjusts the ropes, ignores Larry.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s perfect.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        It’s not perfect. A moment, 
                        Lawrence, that is all I require.

           Larry sighs.

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - PARAPET - DAY

           The sun sits high in the sky. Up on the parapet, McManiman 
           and McDonald nervously watch the Army camp. British forces 
           have massed all around the castle’s outer wall.

           He scans the perimeter. Sees something that confuses him.

                                 MCMANIMAN
                             (into radio)
                        Might want to take a gander at 
                        this.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - PARAPET - LATER

           Sploder, McManiman, McDonald, and McSorley peer out with 
           binoculars.

           Up on the parapet, the terrorists are looking at--

           --two figures on horseback, waving to them from the treeline. 
           Only about 200 yards away. A third figure stand against a 
           tree, hands in the air.

                                 SPLODER
                        Looks like McGrath and McAndrews.

                                 MCSORLEY
                        They caught somebody.

           They’re so focused on the waving mystery men, they don’t 
           notice-- Larry and the knights sprinting toward the castle 
           from the side.

           EXT. CASTLE BURONINSTAD - LATER

           The massive DRAWBRIDGE clanks down across the moat. McSorley 
           and two other terrorists jog out towards the waving figures.
           The drawbridge begins to CLANK back up. As it does, Larry and 
           the knights rise from the moat. They grab hold and throw 
           themselves inside as it closes.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           McSorley cautiously approaches the two waving terrorists. He 
           gets close enough to make out the details--

           --ropes tied to their arms and waist. Strung up through 
           pulleys. Counterweights. Both of them sit on horses.

                                 MCSORLEY
                        What are yeh boys doin ridin these 
                        horses? Davey, I thought yeh was 
                        petrified of the beasts.

           The dead bodies move on their own like marionettes, waving 
           again and again.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I think they’re... dead.

                                 MCSORLEY
                        Don’t be stupid.
                             (to his dead friends)
                        Quit wavin, I’m right here! And I 
                        expect me two best friends to look 
                        at me when I’m talkin’ to ‘em.

           Necks broken, their heads face backward.

           Confused, McSorley sees the person his “friends” have 
           captured.

                                 MCSORLEY (CONT’D)
                        And what kinda kinky shite are ya 
                        doin’ with Dame Judi Dench?

           Her body leans against a tree. McSorley takes a step toward 
           her and his foot catches on a rope. The last thing he sees is 
           a black cylinder strapped to her waist. 

           FTHOOM-- her crotch ERUPTS in pyrotechnics-- Dange’s concert 
           belt. Ropes twist her hips to shower the terrorists with 
           sparks. 

           They catch fire and run.

           INT. CASTLE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Larry peeks around the corner. Coast is clear.
                                 LARRY
                        Shhhh!

           CLANK, CLANK! CLANK, CLANK! Their armor makes a huge racket 
           as they walk down the hall. 

           Dange stops them where the hallway splits.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Alright loverboys. Priority number 
                        one, as we all know, is saving me 
                        fans. All two hundred of ‘em in the 
                        great hall. A distant number two is 
                        saving the Queen.

                                 LARRY
                             (used to it)
                        That’s a good idea, Dange. But, I 
                        think the Queen’s their bargaining 
                        chip, so we save her first. 

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I doubt she’s a fan. 

           Dangerous CLANKS off down the left hallway.

                                 NANDO
                        Yes, this is a good idea. I will 
                        save the Queen all by myself and 
                        take all the glory. 

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (coming back)
                        Just hold on a goddamn minute. 
                        Let’s vote on it.

                                 NANDO
                        We all vote for the Queen.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Shut up Nando, you don’t have a 
                        foot.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        What’s the plan for getting those 
                        people out? I have many ideas, but 
                        firstly I was thinking we could, 
                        well, it’s only slightly more 
                        complicated than what we did 
                        outside. All we need is a garlic 
                        press and two tons of sheet metal.

                                 LARRY
                        Good idea, Tony Stark.
                                 DANGEROUS
                             (to Larry)
                        You believe this guy? He’s always 
                        thinkin’ real hard. Too hard, if 
                        you ask me. Nutcracker wants to 
                        build a rocketship out of 
                        spaghetti, but he can’t even write 
                        a song.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I can certainly compose songs. I 
                        have the ability to put words to 
                        music. But what is the point of 
                        creating anything unless it will 
                        generate a stir? It must not only 
                        be good-- it must be great.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You gotta fly by the seat of your 
                        pants, man. It’s like wif groupies-- 
                        if it feels right, do it.

           Larry notices a security camera in the corner.

                                 LARRY
                        Guys, we can’t just stand here--

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        My fans expect a certain level of 
                        quality. I’m not like you, 
                        Dangerous. I can’t write “Toaster 
                        in the Tub” and call it art.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I wouldn’t expect you to 
                        understand. That song? A girl I 
                        loved for seven years, she got an 
                        abortion an’ broke me heart. She 
                        threw her toaster in me tub, 
                        metaphorically speaking.
                             (then)
                        In retrospect I’m glad she did 
                        cause child payments are a bitch.

                                 LARRY
                        Queen! Now!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Nary a soul has heard that song! 
                        Every year, you release a new 
                        album. A “comeback” album, and it’s 
                        always codswallop.

           Larry hears FOOTSTEPS from somewhere nearby.
                                 LARRY
                             (urgent whisper)
                        Come on!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        But what about “Trapped In an 
                        Abandoned Refrigerator?”

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You’ve officially exhausted every 
                        metaphor on danger. 

                                 NANDO
                        He never sang about rusty nails.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        You think anyone wants to do a 
                        reality show about you? You’re a 
                        delusional has-been, yesterday’s 
                        news-- you’re NOTHING!

                                 SPLODER
                        Don’t ya think that’s a little 
                        harsh?

           They whirl-- Sploder stands at the end of the hallway.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Finally someone who’s willing to 
                        back me up. You’re a real friend.

           Sploder grips a conspicuous sconce on the wall. Larry looks 
           down, sees the CRACK in the floor. He realizes what’s 
           happening but it’s too late--

           --Sploder pulls the sconce like a lever. The floor underneath 
           Larry and the knights DROPS. The trap door. They fall into 
           the DARKNESS.

           INT. CASTLE - DUNGEON - LATER

           Again and again, Dange and Nando BANG their weapons on the 
           metal dungeon bars. They’re trapped.

           The 20-foot cell was probably used for torture at one time. 
           Spiked poles. A vise. Iron cuffs on the wall.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Keep chopping, Nando. I think we’re 
                        denting it!

           Nando’s sword breaks.
                                 NANDO
                        I have failed?

           Larry snatches the broken sword out of Nando’s hand and grabs 
           Dange’s axe. He throws them across the room, disgusted. They 
           CLANG against the wall.

           They hear a weak chuckle from behind them. They whirl to see-- 

                                 FLETCHER
                        There’s no way out of here.

           Fletcher’s body has been stretched to the limit on a rack. 

           Larry rushes to his side and unties him. He’s a mere shadow 
           of his former self-- his confidence beaten out of him. A 
           broken man. He’s been crying a lot.

                                 LARRY
                        Skip!

                                 FLETCHER
                        Who are you? Get away from me!

                                 LARRY
                        It’s me. It’s Larry. I--

                                 FLETCHER
                        Don’t stretch me! DON’T STRETCH ME!

           Watching from the corner, Jonathan Clark Wendell’s fury 
           builds. Nando helps Larry.

                                 NANDO
                        The man cries like he’s lost a 
                        foot...

           Fletcher weeps silently. Rage boils over for JCW.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        O SPLODER! FROM THE DARKEST BOWELS

           EXT. BELMARSH PRISON - DAY

           Prison guards escort the O’Malley brothers onto a bus, chain-
           gang style. The driver cringes as they board. The pale-
           skinned brothers squint in the sunshine. 

                                 DOUGAL
                        What if we can’t adjust to society? 
                                 CONNOR
                        Whatcha mean “adjust?” We’re gonna 
                        kill as many people as possible.

                                 DOUGAL
                             (earnest)
                        Oh right. I forgot.

           EXT. ARMY STAGING AREA - COMMAND POST - SAME

           Under the command post tarp, General Howson briefs Colonel 
           Westlake.

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        They’re on their way to the 
                        airport. 

           Westlake sweeps the map and their preparations off the table. 

                                 COLONEL WESTLAKE
                        They’ll never make it in time! 
                        He’ll blow up the castle!

                                 GENERAL HOWSON
                        DON’T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?!!!!

           Howson kicks the center pole. The tarp collapses on top of 
           them. 

                                 BOTH OF THEM
                        DAMMIT!!!

           INT. CASTLE - DUNGEON - LATER

           Larry sits in the corner, defeated. We hear footsteps coming 
           down the stairs. Larry, Nando, and JCW look up from sulking. 
           Fletcher doesn’t even move.

           Sploder approaches their cell.

                                 SPLODER
                        ‘Twas a valiant effort, boyos, and 
                        I thank yeh for tryin. Cause now I 
                        get to do me favorite thing in the 
                        world.

           Sploder reveals a shoebox-sized device.

                                 SPLODER (CONT’D)
                        Here’s a little baby boomer jus’ 
                        fer you. I wouldn’t have it any 
                        other way. Ten minutes should do 
                        the trick.
           He sets the explosive down in the dungeon hall. An L.E.D. 
           timer counts backwards. 

           Sploder waves goodbye and disappears from sight. Dange 
           presses his face to the bars. 

           Just out of reach, Sploder’s bomb ticks down past 9 minutes.

           Larry slouches even lower. Nando sits like an athlete shamed 
           with a cloth draped over his head.

           Dangerous supports his back and sits down with an aching 
           sigh. He watches the timer tick down. Shaving seconds from 
           his life.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (soft)
                        Who would want to watch a show 
                        about me? People don’t even come to 
                        me concerts no more. 
                             (a sad realization)
                        I mean, you know what’s really 
                        dangerous? Sub-prime mortgages and 
                        high cholesterol, that’s what. I’m 
                        a no-good old geezah. 

           Larry sees the hurt and desperation.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, mates. You’s me band and 
                        I’ve been actin’ like a typical 
                        asshole frontman. Well, now I’m 
                        ready to listen to the band.

           The others sulk quietly. Nando too stares at the timer as it 
           passes 7 minutes.

                                 NANDO
                        I have let you all down. You are my 
                        team. When it comes down to the 
                        wire, individuals lose. Teams win. 
                        I mean, what kind of football 
                        legend has zero assists? A little 
                        bitch, that is what kind.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell watches the timer tick down to six 
           minutes.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I think other people think I think 
                        too much, I think. Wait...
                             (deep breath)
                        I definitely think too much.

                        I’ve written nineteen musicals 
                        since Fishes, but I threw them 
                        every single one in the shredder 
                        and then fed them to my Shetland 
                        pony. I don’t even know if they 
                        were good or not. I was paralyzed, 
                        worrying myself to death about what 
                        other people would think.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I think... it’s probably for the 
                        best that you die down here.

           They all turn to Larry. He looks at the timer. Five minutes. 
           They’re still staring at him. He takes a deep breath. Feels 
           their gaze. Waiting for him to speak. Finally--

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah. I’m a huge pussy. I spent the 
                        last seven years answering phones 
                        and getting coffee cause I was too 
                        scared to ask for what I wanted. I 
                        never spoke up, I never took 
                        charge, not at work or anywhere 
                        else either. Like with sex? 
                        Jackie’s always on top.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        That’s my kind of confession! One 
                        time I had sex with a girl who had 
                        a penis for a vagina.

                                 NANDO
                        Yes. That was a man.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        A wuh?

           They stare at Dangerous. He holds his chin up.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        Larry, you should continue with 
                        your confession.

                                 LARRY
                        I’ve had some good ideas, but I 
                        couldn’t get Skip to see it. I 
                        didn’t try hard enough.

           Fletcher speaks up from his dark corner. 
                                 FLETCHER
                        That’s cause you’re a failure. 
                        We’re all failures. And we’re going 
                        to die as failures. 

           Four minutes to go. 

                                 LARRY
                        Are we?

           Larry starts pacing. He fidgets, planning something. Working 
           it out. His eyes light up--

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Nando-- I need your shoelace.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Enough with the shoelaces. It will 
                        never work, Larry! NEVER!

                                 NANDO
                        I will not take off my only cleat. 

                                 LARRY
                        Keep the shoe-- I just need the 
                        lace.

                                 FLETCHER
                        What are you even doing here-- 
                        Didn’t I fire you?

                                 NANDO
                        Mi madre los hizo de--

                                 LARRY
                        Give me the lace!

           Larry’s so intense-- so on fire-- that Nando slowly nods.

           Nando unties the ultra-long soccer lace with the gentle hands 
           of a lover and passes it to Larry.

           He loops it around and makes A SHOELACE LASSO.

           He lobs the loop through the bars. In the hallway, his lasso 
           catches the end of Sploder’s BOMB. Verrrrrry carefully, Larry 
           uses the shoelace lasso to drag the bomb towards their cell.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Don’t bring it CLOSER!

           Larry reaches through the bars and picks it up. He offers it 
           to Dangerous. Dange snorts-- yeah, right.
                                 LARRY
                        You told me you wired all the 
                        pyrotechnics on the ‘68 tour.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Summer of Danger. What of it?

           The timer ticks down past the TWO MINUTE mark. Dangerous 
           realizes what Larry’s suggesting...

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t thought about this stuff 
                        in years. I wouldn’t know where to 
                        begin.

                                 LARRY
                        Try. Go back to that summer. You’re 
                        up on stage. It’s hot. You’re 
                        rockin out. Groupies draped over 
                        your amps. Um, delicious birdhead 
                        in your mouth? 

           Dange closes his eyes.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Chew that birdhead, Dange, chew it.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I didn’t start eating birds till 
                        ‘72! I thought you was a fan! ‘68 
                        was a pure time for me!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        A minute thirty!

                                 LARRY
                        FOCUS, Dange!

           Dange’s eyes shut. Face contorts. He pounds on his skull.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        The man’s never worked his brain so 
                        hard in his life.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        You’re making it worse!

                                 LARRY
                        Focus! Get back to that summer!

           Dange jumps up and down.

                                 FLETCHER
                        We’re already dead.
           Maybe not. Jonathan Clark Wendell digs deep within himself...

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (soft singing)
                        I warned you ‘bout playing with 
                        fire. I warned you ‘bout high-
                        tension wires. 

           Dange starts nodding, getting into it. He mouths the lyrics.

           One minute left.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing more beautifully)

                        Seven years bad luck!

           JCW keeps singing. Thirty seconds left. Really in the zone 
           now, Dange examines the bomb with a trained eye. He opens the 
           lid and starts tinkering.

                                 LARRY
                        Don’t disarm it completely. Can you 
                        make the explosion really small?

                             (getting it)

                        You’re so so so so Dangerous!

           CLICK-- Dangerous removes two of the C4 blastcaps. He sticks 
           the remaining blastcap right against the cell door.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (realizing, to JCW)
                        You know me music!

           JCW stops singing. He smiles shyly.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        I came to six shows that tour.

           Dange grins-- all is forgiven.

           3, 2, 1... BLAM!!!
           They hear SHOUTING from upstairs. Triumphant, Larry tries to 
           rouse Fletcher. Gets close to him, whispers.

                                 LARRY
                        Skip, Come on. We need you.

           Fletcher pushes him away. 

                                 FLETCHER
                        You shouldda let that bomb kill me.

           He weeps quietly to himself. Curls into a ball and softly 
           rocks back and forth. The other knights stare. Larry knows 
           it’s over.

           He rises, leaving Skip Fletcher behind.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        God save the Queen.

                                 LARRY
                        No.
                             (closes his helmet visor)
                        WE save the Queen.

           INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - LATER

           Sploder waits with his men. They watch the news-- the 
           O’Malley brothers arriving at London City Airport. 

           McMillin runs in, panicked--

                                 MCMILLIN
                        They’ve escaped! The knights have 
                        escaped!

           INT. CASTLE - KEEP - MOMENTS LATER

           Larry and the knights charge out from the dungeon and head 
           towards the staircase.

           EXT. CASTLE - PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           McDonald peers through his binoculars. 

           He scans the army encampment outside the perimeter walls. He 
           spots the officers and their laptop. He adjusts focus on the 
           computer screen-- 

           It’s a satellite view of him (McDonald) looking through 
           binoculars. Four knights are standing around him. One rears 
           back to punch him in the face.
           McDonald spins around still holding the binoculars. WHAM! 
           Larry’s magnified fist punches him in the face.

           EXT. CASTLE - PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           McMillin charges at Larry. They struggle. With the knights’ 
           help, Larry THROWS HIM OVER THE SIDE.

           McMillin SPLASHES, seemingly safe in the moat below. But then 
           he SCREAMS and THRASHES in the water as--

           --Piranhas bite him all over. He’s skeletonized within 
           seconds. Larry looks down at the mess.

                                 LARRY
                        I knew it.

           JCW smiles proudly.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Behold the power of fish. 

           EXT. PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           McSorley retreats towards the Queen’s tower, shooting as he 
           goes. The bullets ricochet off their armor.

           Dangerous adopts a power stance and POINTS at him. 

           SKREEEEE!!! Dange’s falcon DIVE BOMBS and attacks McSorley. 
           It claws the gun out of his hand. McSorley retreats inside.

           The falcon lands safely on Dangerous’s arm. He pets it 
           tenderly, good job. Then bites its head off.

           EXT. PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           MCNICHOLS-- the hugest Irishman we’ve ever seen-- beckons 
           Nando into hand to hand combat. They trade blows. Nando 
           overpowers him, until--

           McNichols SWEEPS HIS BAD LEG. Nando’s prosthetic foot soars 
           off into the moat.  

           Nando crumples to the ground. McNichols moves in for the 
           kill. He wraps his hands around Nando’s neck. 

                                 NANDO
                        Jonathan Clark Wendell, Help!

           Jonathan Clark Wendell looks up, shocked. What are those 
           words coming from Nando’s mouth? 
                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Did I hear right? 

                                 NANDO
                             (struggling to breathe)
                        Yes. Please. I need help!

           Jonathan Clark Wendell pulls back his bow. TWIP! An arrow 
           pierces McNichols side. 

                                 MCNICHOLS
                        Is that all you got?

           He rolls over, dead. 

                                 NANDO
                             (catching his breath)
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. CASTLE - PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           Jonathan Clark Wendell fires off arrows. REVEAL: Nando tied 
           to his back.

                                 NANDO
                        Behind us, behind us!

           JCW whirls and shoots an arrow at another terrorist. He leaps 
           away for cover. 

           Nando, unable to participate, continues to call out 
           directions. Leading the team.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Down below!
                             (calling off)
                        Larry-- watch your back!

           They get into a rhythm-- Nando pointing, Jonathan Clark 
           Wendell firing. JCW gets into the groove and begins humming 
           an upbeat tune to himself.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Are you writing a song?

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (suddenly stopping)
                        It’s nothing!

           EXT. PARAPET - MOMENTS LATER

           KRACK KRACK KRACK! McManiman unloads his pistol. Larry and 
           the knights charge along the parapet, seemingly invincible in 
           their armor.
           McManiman loads his rocket launcher. Right before he can 
           fire, Dange swings his axe and LOPS OFF HIS HEAD. 

           FWOOSH-- He’s drenched in gallons of blood. Like he’s playing 
           in a Brooklyn fire hydrant.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Bloody hell.

           Blood continues to blast him. Dange is shocked. 

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        That is significantly more blood 
                        than I was expecting.

           Larry can’t believe what he’s seeing.

                                 LARRY
                        I thought you were a pacifist!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        A wuh?

           INT. CASTLE - SPIRAL STAIRCASE - LATER

           Larry and Dange bound up the staircase. Behind them, Jonathan 
           Clark Wendell struggles to keep up with Nando on his back.

                                 NANDO
                        There’s that song again-- and you 
                        are mumbling words! Sing it for me!

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        It’s not ready yet.

           Larry and Dange get to the top of the stairs and face the 
           gigantic door. They exchange a look, then Larry rears back 
           and KICKS the door open. 

           INT. CASTLE - TOWER - SAME

           Larry busts into the room with Dange behind. It’s empty.

           Out the window, they see--

           --Four terrorists approaching the front gate. They’re carting 
           something in a wheelbarrow.

           Larry steadies himself.

                                 LARRY
                        We’re too late...

           In the wheelbarrow lies the Queen’s lifeless body.
           Jonathan Clark Wendell catches up with Nando. He takes one 
           look outside and breaks down.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Oh villainy! Oh treachery! Heaven 
                        make me free of this pain in my 
                        heart!

           Strapped to his back, Nando is forced to stare out the rear 
           window. He squints-- something out back catches his eye.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        When I wrote the song, God Fuck the 
                        Queen’s Dead Skull, I never thought 
                        I’d live to see it happen.

                                 LARRY
                             (horrified with grief)
                        No one’s having sex with her dead 
                        skull.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        God is.

                                 NANDO
                             (looking out the back)
                        Excuse me...

           The others watch the terrorists surrendering the Queen’s body 
           at the front gate. Jonathan Clark Wendell blinks away tears.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        She was so young.

                                 NANDO
                        For the love of Pele! That’s not 
                        the Queen!

           In the back of the castle grounds, they see Sploder forcing 
           the Queen and Daniel into a car.

           KABOOM! An entire section of the back perimeter wall 
           EXPLODES. Sploder drives through the smoking hole and off the 
           castle grounds.

           Larry turns. At the front gate, Colonel Westlake is yelling 
           about something. He holds a wig in his hands. “The Queen” is 
           now standing-- it was McFarland-- and he’s tackled to the 
           ground.

           INT. SPLODER’S GETAWAY CAR - SAME

           The Queen weeps in the back. Up front, Daniel stares out the 
           window. Sploder floors it.
                                 SPLODER
                        Stick with me, Danny. Me men did 
                        what they had to do so we could 
                        escape. We’re almost to the 
                        airport. And once we’re out of here 
                        safe and sound with yer brothers? 
                        We’ll give England the ol’ Belfast 
                        Blitzkrieg.

           Daniel nods vacantly.

           INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - LATER

           Larry CHOPS the lock off. He kicks open the doors. Rex and 
           the prisoners stare at this fully-armored knight.

                                 REX
                        ...Larry?

                                 LARRY
                        Get these people out of here.

           INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           As Rex leads the prisoners towards the gate, Larry and the 
           knights come charging into the sunlight. And there, in the 
           courtyard, almost too good to be true--

           They find three pristine motorcycles.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Think we can catch him?

           Jonathan Clark Wendell loads Nando into a sidecar. Larry 
           looks at his fellow Knights. All together. All ready for the 
           final battle.

                                 LARRY
                        Let’s ride!

           He twists the ignition. Nothing. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Dammit! 

           There’s sand in all the gas tanks. Dangerous tastes the sand.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (thoughtfully)
                        It’s... sand.

           JCW starts humming a mournful lullaby.
                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        What’s the terrible sound?

           He hums louder.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        You constipated?

                                 NANDO
                        Shhhh... it’s happening.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (singing)
                        All is lost and there’s nothing 
                        left. Dark clouds forming overhead. 
                        We failed the Queen.
                        Who could have forseen?
                        it’s our fault she’ll soon be dead.

           He looks up to the heavens, holding the final mournful note 
           as--

           Larry looks back over his shoulder at something we don’t see. 
           His eyes widen and he smiles. The knights follow his gaze.

           Jonathan Clark Wendell changes his tune. His song slowly 
           builds, the preamble to an epic theme song.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Dun da da dun da da dun...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Cars make slow but steady progress through thick traffic. We 
           hear Jonathan Clark Wendell’s SONG building and building.

           INT. SPLODER’S CAR - SAME

           Sploder changes lanes, weaving through traffic. Getting away. 
           He lays on the HORN. Sploder glances in the rearview mirror. 
           Does a double take.

                                 SPLODER
                        Sweet Jayzus an’ Mary dancing naked 
                        on the blarney stone.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME

           We hear Jonathan Clark Wendell’s “dun dun dun” build-up 
           nearing a climax. Coming up fast behind Sploder’s getaway 
           car, weaving among the cars, we find--

           FOUR ARMORED KNIGHTS RIDING FOUR BEAUTIFUL HORSES. 
           They gallop as fast as they can. Other drivers stare, 
           awestruck. Cars and trucks ahead of them pull over like a 
           parting sea. 

           Dangerous cradles a LANCE. He swings it wildly and SMASH-- it 
           rips off the side-view mirror of a truck.

           As they ride, Jonathan Clark Wendell’s song explodes into the 
           soundtrack. We hear a full orchestra backing him up. The 
           KNIGHTS THEME song--

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (singing)
                        Knights! 
                        We got weapons and armor! 
                        Knights! 
                        We stand for honor! 

           Jonathan Clark Wendell leans into the wind, riding hard and 
           belting it with all his might.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Knights!
                        We fight for the people! 
                        Knights! 
                        We work on the Sabbath! 

           Without cars in their way, All four of them ride side by 
           side. The others join in the song.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Knights!
                        We hate Irish people! 
                        Knights! 
                        Seriously they’re the worst! 

           AHEAD OF THEM, in the getaway car-- Sploder hands Daniel a 
           PISTOL.

                                 SPLODER
                        Take care of ‘em, Danny boy.

           Daniel considers the gun in his hands. He leans out the side 
           window. Aims for the knights.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                             (singing)
                        Knights!
                        We could have stopped 9/11! 
                        Knights! 
                        We can breathe underwater!
           Daniel glances in the backseat and sees the Queen wheezing. 
           Her eyes plead with him.

           He lowers his aim to the back tire and SHOOTS. WHAP-BOOM! 
           Sploder skids left and right, and the car eventually stops.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Knights! Knights! Knights!

           We zoom in close on his face.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        And no one can stop us.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER

           The knights catch up.

           They leap from their horses and surround the car. Daniel and 
           Sploder throw up their hands in surrender. Through the back 
           window, the Queen manages a faint smile for Larry.

           But then Sploder throws open the door and charges at him.

           Larry swings his sword. A miss. Dange swings his axe-- hits 
           Larry’s armor by accident-- CLANG!

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Sorry, mate.

           Sploder gets a good punch in and manages to pry off Larry’s 
           helmet. He reveals his pistol and aims at Larry’s head.

                                 SPLODER
                        First I’m gonna shoot ya! Then I’m 
                        gonna shoot yer friends! How ya 
                        like that!?

                                 LARRY
                        I thought you hate guns?

                                 SPLODER
                        Each bullet is a mini-splosion!

           He presses the barrel against Larry’s forehead. As Sploder’s 
           finger tightens on the trigger...

           Dangerous removes his helmet.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Are you crackers, man? I have three 
                        number-one albums. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANGEROUS (CONT'D)
                        Playing Wif Fire went 14 times 
                        platinum! And you want to shoot HIM 
                        first?

           Sploder aims back and forth between them, confused.

           Larry can’t believe it. Sploder sweats, gets ready to shoot 
           Dange instead. Jonathan Clark Wendell takes off his helmet.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Perhaps we should measure his 
                        music’s artistic merit before 
                        shooting him first? Have you ever 
                        seen Fishes?

                                 SPLODER
                        Shut up!

           Nando removes his helmet.

                                 NANDO
                        I have scored more goals than any 
                        player in the history of football. 
                        Although you should shoot Jonathan 
                        Clark Wendell second.

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        Thanks, mate.

           Larry is amazed. From the car, Daniel watches in wonderment. 
           Dangerous steps up to Sploder. He guides his gun to his 
           forehead.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        Don’t listen to ‘em. I’m a living 
                        legend. Blow me brains out-- you’ll 
                        go down in history! You think 
                        anyone will care if you shoot these 
                        idiots? They’re two-bit hacks. I’M 
                        FUCKING DANGEROUS!

           With that, he HEADBUTTS Sploder and knocks the gun from his 
           hand. Nando tries to kick it away but has no foot. JCW kicks 
           it for him.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!

           Sploder grabs a CROWBAR from under the car seat. He swings 
           for Larry’s head-- CLANG! Larry blocks with his sword. They 
           duel, sword against crowbar. Thrust, dodge, parry.

           Sploder backs him to the edge of the overpass. Larry teeters 
           along the barrier, about to fall backwards. 
           Sploder knocks him again-- he falls back and down on his ass. 
           Head and shoulders hanging over the side. 100 foot drop below 
           him.

           The other knights surround them. Sploder plants his foot on 
           Larry’s neck.

                                 SPLODER
                        Another step and I break his neck!

           They freeze. 

           Larry’s fading fast. All he can see are the details of 
           Sploder’s sneaker. Velcro.

                                 LARRY
                        Velcrooooooooooo!

           A new wave of determination hits him. He pushes with every 
           ounce of repressed anger. Sploder stumbles back and Larry’s 
           on him in a FLASH.

           CLANG-- He KNOCKS the crowbar away. Larry holds his sword to 
           Sploder’s neck. We hear SIRENS in the distance.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s over. We’ve got you.

                                 SPLODER
                        Do ya now?

           Sploder explodes. His guts SPLATTER all over the knights. 

                                 JONATHAN CLARK WENDELL
                        He wired himself to explode. Not 
                        surprising actually.

           Dange wipes his finger on his bloody face. Tastes it.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (proud)
                        I bet Mick Jagger’s never tasted a 
                        sploded person before. It’s like 
                        gazpacho.

           From the back of the car, the Queen catches Larry’s eye. She 
           nods a subtle thank you. In the front seat, Daniel gives a 
           similar nod.

           Larry swaggers over to the black crater. He picks up what 
           looks like a garage door opener-- Sploder’s detonator. It’s 
           charred black, partially melted, and completely busted.
                                 LARRY
                        I guess he won’t be needing this 
                        anymore.

           He presses the button. KA-BOOM! The ground SHAKES. On the 
           horizon-- An explosion and a billowing cloud.

           Larry blinks.

                                 NANDO
                        You blew up the castle.

           He drops the detonator.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        I’m sure they have bomb insurance.

           INT. BELMARSH JAIL CELL - NIGHT

           A small Charlie Brown Christmas tree in the corner. Eight 
           stockings tacked to the wall. Daniel and his brothers eat 
           Christmas treats.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh Dougal, Dougal, Dougal... just 
                        bein’ with me brothers is all I 
                        ever wanted.

                                 DOUGAL
                        Really? All I ever wanted was to be 
                        a free man. 

           Daniel swallows. He hands out presents. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I bought these a few months ago...

                                 CONNOR
                             (deadpan)
                        Oooh, a bathin’ suit.

           The ROAR of a crowd overtakes us and we CUT TO:

           EXT. EL MONUMENTAL STADIUM, ARGENTINA - DAY

           The Argentinian national team has the ball. They pass back 
           and forth gracefully like choreographed ballet. 

           The FORWARD has a shot but at the last second passes to an 
           open MID-FIELDER who heads the ball in for a GOOOOAAALLLL!
           The entire team celebrates. They hop on one foot and point to 
           their coach on the sideline--

           --Nando. He hops on one foot and points back at them. 

           INT. WINTERGARDEN THEATER - BROADWAY

           On stage, an all-male chorus line of Leprechauns does an 
           Irish jig. They use machine guns as canes. 

                                 IRISH DANCERS
                             (singing)
                        Let me brothers run free. 
                        Let em play with me. 
                        Put their fingers in the sand. 
                        Let them smell the sea.

           Jazz hands! Then BAM-- lights out.

                                 DANGEROUS
                             (with much bravado)
                        You goddamn green-wearing goat-
                        fuckers!

           The audience is shocked. A SPOTLIGHT pops on center stage. 
           Dangerous is there. He busts out his power stance. His crotch 
           explodes, BOOM-- and he showers the leprechauns with 
           pyrotechnic sparks. They dance in faux agony.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)

                        I need some Jonathan Clarks!

           A six-foot-five beautiful masculine man steps out.

                        I’ve got your back. 
                        Now let’s attack!

           He fights the Irish leader, WEST SIDE STORY style. The crowd 
           laughs and applauds. In the orchestra pit, the real Jonathan 
           Clark Wendell conducts. He’s loving every minute of it.

           EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

           The hornpipe fanfare from Handel’s WATER MUSIC. Again.

           INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - ANTE CHAMBER - NIGHT

           In a waiting room, Fletcher primps in the mirror. Adjusts the 
           bow tie of his tux. A hand slaps him on the back. 
                                 LARRY
                        You look great, Skip. Like your old 
                        self again.

                                 FLETCHER
                        What are you talking about-- I’ve 
                        never looked bad in my entire life.

           Larry gives him a pointed look. Fletcher looks away.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been thinking. Perhaps I fired 
                        you as my assistant so that I could 
                        rehire you as...
                             (proudly)
                        ...the head of Fletcher Laces.

                                 LARRY
                        I appreciate that.

                                 FLETCHER
                        Good man. 

                                 LARRY
                        But. I’m giving it a shot by 
                        myself. I’m my own boss now-- no 
                        more taking orders. And I found 
                        three investors who believe in 
                        Urban Laces.

           Fletcher nods, getting it.

                                 FLETCHER
                        You remind me of a young version of 
                        myself. Little tip? Change the name 
                        to Larry Laces and you’re gold.

           Rex peeks his head in.

                                 REX
                        It’s magic time.

           INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GREAT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone turns to the door to see the guest of honor. But 
           it’s not Fletcher.

           Out steps Larry. His guests applaud him. With freshly shaved 
           faces, General Howson and Colonel Westlake salute. Sir Skip 
           Fletcher takes a seat with some real-life knights. 

           Sir Elton John whispers--
                                 SIR ELTON JOHN
                        I heard Dangerous ate Tommy the 
                        Sploder. 

           Sir Mick Jagger is amazed. Possibly Jealous. 

           Up front, Larry approaches the Queen’s throne. He passes 
           Jackie.

                                 JACKIE
                        My hero.

           He winks. Next, he passes Sir Nando, Sir Jonathan Clark 
           Wendell, and Sir Dangerous. All beaming with pride. A 
           CAMERAMAN stands behind Dangerous-- his reality show.

                                 DANGEROUS
                        We’re proud of you, Larry.

           The cameraman turns the camera on Larry.

                                 DANGEROUS (CONT’D)
                        No, no. Keep it on me. 

           INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Larry reaches the throne. He kneels before the Queen. 

                                 LARRY
                        I’m sorry I blew up your castle.

                                 THE QUEEN
                        We have a lot of them. May I ask 
                        you a question? Wherever did you 
                        learn to fight like that?

                                 LARRY
                             (thoughtfully)
                        Dame Judi Dench.

                                 THE QUEEN 
                        I should have known.

           She touches her sword to his shoulder. 

                                 THE QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Arise, Sir Larry Kornbluth. 

           Larry stands, a true knight. Cheers and applause. 

           Jonathan Clark Wendell’s KNIGHTS THEME rises and we FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
