                                     (cid:13)           EXT. CITY STREET CORNER -- DAY

           (MUSIC:  BAND OF HORSES' "THE FUNERAL")

           A GROUP OF PEDESTRIANS stands waiting for the light to change. 
           They represent a wide range of humanity--from the
           BUSINESSWOMAN to the DELIVERY BOY, the CONSTRUCTION WORKER
           to the VAGRANT.  All appear to be miserable...except for:

           THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN IN THE DESIGNER SUIT standing front
           and center, doing a little dance.  Happiest guy in the world.

           This is JERRY (late 20s).  We might not like him.

           A passing car zooms through a puddle, soaking everyone but
           Jerry...who miraculously remains bone dry.

           Everyone but Jerry staggers back from the curb, stunned and
           furious.  Jerry turns around, offering a shrug and a smile.

                                 JERRY
                        Good things just happen to me.

           Then he GETS DRILLED BY A SPEEDING CAR THAT HOPS THE CURB,
           CRASHING HORRIBLY O.S.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They used to, anyway.  All the time.

           TITLE CARD:  "GREETINGS FROM JERRY"

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - HALLWAY -- DAY

           A pair of doors burst open and a TEAM OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL
           PROFESSIONALS hurrying a gurney through as they urgently
           attend to its passenger:  JERRY, A BLOODY MESS.

           EACH DOORWAY the dying Jerry glances into as he rolls by it
           shows not a hospital room, but a GLIMPSE INTO HIS OWN PAST...

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        Some people have a hard time making
                        friends.  I never did.

           DOOR #1:  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- SIX-YEAR-OLD JERRY
           IS DANCING ON A DESK, TO THE DELIGHT OF HIS CLASSMATES.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But my social skills had no negative
                        effect on my academic performance.
           DOOR #2:  SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- NINE-YEAR-OLD JERRY PROUDLY
           HOISTS A SPELLING BEE CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He who exceeds in the classroom
                        flounders on the field of play, right? 
                        Not in my case.

           DOOR #3:  BASEBALL FIELD -- TWELVE-YEAR-OLD JERRY IS MOBBED
           AT HOME PLATE AFTER A GAME-WINNING HOME RUN.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And I never had much trouble
                        navigating the greatest obstacle in
                        the history of mankind.

           DOOR #4:  HIGH SCHOOL HOUSE PARTY -- FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD JERRY
           IS FEELING UP A GIRL; ANOTHER GIRL TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                                 TEENAGE FLASHBACK GIRL
                        Want to see if mine are better?

           CURRENT JERRY -- Vomits blood, being rushed ahead into...

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           DOCTORS and NURSES work feverishly to keep Jerry alive,
           affixing, detaching and exchanging assorted medical devices.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        I might very well have been the kind
                        of person you hate.  But let me say
                        in my defense that every good thing
                        I achieved in my life, both large
                        and small, was a result of absolutely
                        no effort on my part.

           Jerry violently convulses before his heart monitor FLATLINES.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That probably didn't come out right.

           (END MUSIC.)

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. PLATTITUDES BUILDING -- DAY

           An overdesigned, hipper-than-thou structure on a needlessly
           expansive stretch of property.  A sign at the front drive
           bears the logo of "PLATTITUDES - 'GREETINGS WITH ATTITUDE'".
           INT. PLATTITUDES - HALLWAY -- DAY

           Jerry (A FEW YEARS YOUNGER than when we last saw him; MID-
           20S) steps up to a closed office door.  Behind him is MUG
           (mid-20s)--unassuming and gentle, perpetually ill-at-ease.

                                 MUG
                        Can I tell you a secret?  

           About to open the door, Jerry stops.

                                 MUG (CONT'D)
                        I'm kind of nervous.

                                 JERRY
                        Can I tell you something obvious? 
                        You need better secrets.
                        (extends fist)
                        Let's do this.

           Mug high-fives Jerry's fist-bump.  Jerry opens the door into--

           INT. PLATTITUDES - SETH'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry hop-steps and chucks a rubber ball at a CO-WORKER,
           knocking the Xbox controller out his hands: this is PHILIP
           (mid-20s)--loud and boisterous, eager to please.

           Mug throws his own ball across the room at SETH (mid-20s)--
           hipster-geek cool, casually confident--who's working at his
           desk.  The ball goes wide, knocking over a lamp.

                                 JERRY
                        Two-on-one, Seth.  Philip's out.

                                 PHILIP
                        I thought we were on break.

                                 JERRY
                        There are no breaks in Throwball. 

                                 SETH
                        My lamp looks pretty broken.

                                 JERRY
                        I'll give you a free shot at Mug.

                                 MUG
                        Hey...

                                 PHILIP
                        Take it like a man.
                                 SETH
                        I don't want to play.

                                 JERRY
                        So you're conceding?

                                 SETH
                        Yes.  You and Mug can be the all-
                        time office dodgeball champions.

                                 JERRY
                        It's not dodgeball, it's Throwball! 
                        "Dodgeball" implies escape and
                        empowers the victim.

                                 MUG
                        Throwball favors the strong!

                                 JERRY
                        And we are the all-time champions.

           Jerry extends a fist, which Mug high-fives.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Really?

                                 PHILIP
                        "All-time" going back to when you
                        invented the game...this morning?

                                 JERRY
                        Technically, last night.

                                 SETH
                        At any point while you were hammering
                        out the game's myriad details, did
                        you get a chance to work on the
                        proposal for the new series that you
                        were supposed to turn in this morning?

                                 JERRY
                        No.

                                 MUG
                        {Bleep} gave you more time?

                                 JERRY
                        No.  I worked the ideas out on the
                        drive to work today and gave them to
                        Fat Asshole first thing.

                                 PHILIP
                        Bullshit.
                                 SETH
                        There's no way that's going to fly.

           In the doorway appears FAT ASSHOLE (30s)--the guys' boss.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Hey, douchebags.  I'm treating us
                        all to a liquid lunch today.  And
                        maybe if you're lucky, Jerry will
                        give the rest of you free advice on
                        how to do your fucking jobs.
                        (to Jerry)
                        One of the best proposals I've ever
                        seen, J-Dog.  The whole series is a
                        go.

           Fat Asshole ducks back out of the room, and everyone turns
           to glare enviously at Jerry.  Seth flings a ball past him.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, now you want to play.

           EXT. CITY STREETS -- DAY

           (MUSIC:  DOES IT OFFEND YOU, YEAH'S "WE ARE ROCKSTARS")

           A line of brand-new luxury vehicles snakes its way through
           traffic at unsafe speeds.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        I had a very easy, insanely high-
                        paying job, and I owed it all to the
                        friends I made in college.

           AT THE WHEEL OF THE MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE IS SETH.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Seth was the one who started it all. 
                        He was always a hustler, and he had
                        the job at Plattitudes lined up even
                        before our senior year.  He made his
                        name in the peer-to-peer teenage
                        market, and opened the door for the
                        rest of us.

           DRIVING THE CADILLAC ESCALADE IS PHILIP.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Philip followed Seth, and what he
                        lacked in seniority he quickly made
                        up by carving himself the biggest
                        slice of pie in the greeting card
                        industry: immediate-family birthdays.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He might not have been the most
                        creatively challenged, but he was
                        the top earner out of all of us.

           RIDING SHOTGUN WITH PHILIP IS MUG.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Nobody was quite sure how it happened,
                        but Mug ended up cornering the market
                        on pet cards: cards to people from
                        their dogs, cards to dogs from other
                        people's cats, cards congratulating
                        people when their cats and their
                        dogs have kittens and puppies.  You'd
                        be surprised how well those things
                        sell.  You might also want to be
                        depressed by it...but good for Mug.

           JERRY DRIVES THE BMW M6.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was the all-purpose romance guy. 
                        The cards could be funny, the cards
                        could be sad...but no matter what,
                        they always read as completely
                        heartfelt and genuine.  Truth be
                        told, I was just a softie at heart.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Nice new fixtures, nice new furniture, nice new plasma TV. 
           An enviable bachelor pad.

                                 JERRY (O.S.)
                        (building in intensity)
                        I'm a happy person with happy things. 
                        I'm a happy person with happy things. 
                        I'm a happy person with happy things.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry's in bed, banging away at a FEMALE ESCORT.

                                 JERRY
                        (approaching climax)
                        I'm a happy person with happy things! 
                        I'm a happy per...  Happy!  Things!

           Fin.  Jerry rolls off of the escort, spent.  She sits up and
           hangs her legs over the side of the bed, lighting a cigarette.

                                 ESCORT #1
                        Do you always say that during sex?
                                 JERRY
                        (genuinely unaware)
                        What was I saying?

           A SECOND ESCORT appears on the other side of Jerry, her
           attention on an end table.

                                 ESCORT #2
                        Hey, can I finish this coke?

                                 JERRY
                        Knock yourself out.

           While the escort sets up lines of cocaine for herself and
           her colleague, Jerry reaches into an end table drawer.  He
           produces a check register and a pen.

           ECU CHECK REGISTER -- The pen records a debit of "$2000"...but
           pauses at the "DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION" column.

           JERRY -- Thinks for a moment...

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        When you think of highly lucrative
                        careers, "greeting card writer"
                        probably isn't at the top of your
                        list.

           ECU CHECK REGISTER -- Jerry writes in: "RESEARCH".

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That's where Fat Asshole comes into
                        play.

           EXT. CITY STREETS -- DAY

           Back to the RACING LUXURY VEHICLES.

                        In a world that made sense, a
                        brainless degenerate of his vile
                        sort would be lucky to live off of
                        pre-owned urinal cakes.  But the
                        world does not make sense... 

           Taking the lead is a HUMVEE with FAT ASSHOLE at the wheel,
           swigging from a flask and HOWLING like a drunken frat boy.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So Fat Asshole, of course, happened
                        to have been sired by the billionaire
                        CEO of one of the most powerful media
                        conglomerates in the world.

                        Smart enough to not put his jerkoff
                        son in charge of anything important,
                        daddy created a whole new offshoot
                        for the sole purpose of keeping Fat
                        Asshole busy and out of jail.  Thus
                        was born:

                        Provided that you believe in neither.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Jerry, Seth, Philip and Mug are in a booth, throwing back a
           few happy hour drinks.  Mug raises a toast.

                                 MUG
                        To Jerry.  The man of the hour.

                                 PHILIP
                        And {bleep}'s current golden boy.

                                 JERRY
                        Fuck that fat asshole.  It wasn't
                        that long ago when he was dropping
                        hints he was going to fire me if my
                        cards didn't start selling.

           The guys drink their drinks, and set down their glasses.  As
           if on cue, Philip's cell phone RINGS.
                                 PHILIP
                        Whup.  That's the old ball and chain.

           He stands and moves away from the table, answering the call.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        When a guy refers to his significant
                        other as "the old ball and chain",
                        he's usually being sarcastically
                        affectionate.  But in Philip's case,
                        his girlfriend was as close as a
                        human being could get to actually
                        taking the form of steel.

           A WHITE FLASH AND CLICK INTRODUCE:

           AN INSERT SEQUENCE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC SLIDES

           SLIDE #1 depicts PHILIP and his UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND, sitting
           on a couch.  He is smiling for the camera while she is looking
           out of frame at something in ugly annoyance.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        Philip met her not long after college,
                        literally the day before he got rich
                        from his first big commission. 
                        Whenever he would indulge the
                        occasional doubt about his
                        girlfriend's commitment...

           CLICK.  SLIDE #2 depicts a BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR PHILIP'S
           UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND.  She's surrounded by a smiling PHILIP
           and OTHERS (including JERRY and MUG), piles of gifts and a
           beautiful cake in front of her.  She's smoking, disinterested.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He'd take solace in the fact that
                        she was technically with him before
                        he hit it big.  Like she deserved
                        credit for sticking with him through
                        "the hard times"--those twelve hours
                        when all he had to live on was his
                        trust fund.

           CLICK.  SLIDE #3 depicts PHILIP and his UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND
           on BOURBON STREET DURING MARDI GRAS.  He's overjoyed; she
           looks like she's waiting in line at the DMV.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Philip would never be anything more
                        to her than a warm body and an
                        increasingly fat bank account.

                        Deep down, we all knew it, but none
                        of us had the balls to say it to his
                        face.  None of us, including Philip,
                        was ever much good at confrontation. 
                        Or truth.

           A WHITE FLASH AND CLICK TAKE US BACK TO:

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Where we RESUME SCENE.  Philip returns, standing by the booth.

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey, Mug...  I don't suppose you
                        feel like driving me home, do ya?

                                 MUG
                        Yeah, no, it's cool.  I was gonna
                        leave soon, anyway.

                                 JERRY
                        You were?

           Mug nods, sliding out of the booth.  

                                 MUG
                        I'll see you guys.

           Philip salutes Jerry and Seth, before departing with Mug. 
           Jerry gets up and takes a seat across the table from Seth,
           balancing out the abandoned side of the booth.

                                 JERRY
                        That was weird.

                                 SETH
                        (checking his phone)
                        That happens every time you guys go
                        out.

                                 JERRY
                        Said as if he knew it firsthand. 
                        All your cool friends are busy
                        tonight, huh?

           Seth laughs, busted; he puts away his phone.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- LATER

           The bar has become PACKED.  Jerry and Seth have maintained
           their booth, now accompanied by TWO YOUNG WOMEN (both mid- 
           20s).  DAPHNE--cute and unassuming--is on Seth's side; her
           DRUNK FRIEND is on Jerry's.

                                 DRUNK FRIEND
                        So, okay, wait.  So, was that, like,
                        your guys' major in college?  You
                        majored in greeting cards?

           Everyone laughs--Drunk Friend, a little too loudly.

                                 JERRY
                        No.  We majored in English.

                                 DAPHNE
                        How'd that work out?

                                 JERRY
                        Me think us both be talk good now.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I mean how did you get from one thing
                        to the other?

                                 JERRY
                        (gestures to Seth)
                        That's a question for the social
                        climber.  He had the connections, I
                        just went along for the ride.

                                 DRUNK FRIEND
                        You're a "social climber"?

                                 SETH
                        Offensive notion.  Suggests that I'm
                        not already at the top.

           Drunk Friend laughs too loudly again.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (to Drunk Friend)
                        Come to the bathroom with me.

           The girls slide out of the booth and move off; Jerry and
           Seth wait the cursory five seconds before talking.

                                 JERRY
                        Are you leaning in a particular
                        direction?

                                 SETH
                        The drunk one.
                        (off Jerry's surprise)
                        Rather not make an effort tonight.
                                 JERRY
                        Bless your misogynistic heart.

           INT. JERRY'S BMW -- NIGHT

           Daphne and Jerry are making out in the car, which is parked
           in the street outside DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.  Daphne
           pulls away but stays close, her eyes filled with lust.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.  I think I have to go inside.
                        (off Jerry's look)
                        I mean by myself.

                                 JERRY
                        Wow.  For future reference?  There
                        are several much less suggestive
                        ways to deliver that previous line.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe you could show me how to do it
                        in a greeting card.

                                 JERRY
                        Ouch.  Ouch.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (laughs)
                        I'm just jealous because your job is
                        cooler than mine.

                                 JERRY
                        What's not cool about being a banquet
                        waitress?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Har, har.  You don't talk like a
                        greeting card writer, you know.  You
                        haven't said a cheesy thing all night.

                                 JERRY
                        You doubt my capacity for cheesiness?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Show me what you got.

           They separate.  Jerry takes a moment to "get into character":

                                 JERRY
                        With so much unknown in life, the
                        only promise worth anything is the
                        one made blindly.
                        (dramatic turn)
                        Promise me, Daphne.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Promise you what?

                                 JERRY
                        Promise what you don't know.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (beat, amused)
                        Okay.  I promise.

                                 JERRY
                        (drops act, gloating)
                        You just promised to give me your
                        phone number.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh, burn!  Guess what, though?

           Daphne reaches into her purse, producing a scrap of paper.

                                 DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                        I wrote it down an hour ago.

           She hands the paper to Jerry, kisses him several times
           quickly, and skoots out of the car...leaving Jerry LAUGHING.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. PLATTITUDES - CONFERENCE ROOM -- MORNING

           A VIDEO MONITOR is playing in the otherwise DARKENED ROOM.  

           ON THE MONITOR:  A YOUNG WOMAN stands in a kitchen, having
           just discovered a very well-lit GREETING CARD.  Reading it,
           she is moved to tears.  She looks up to see her apologetic-
           looking BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND in the doorway.

                                 COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.)
                        The words are already in your heart. 
                        We just connect them to hers.

           As the happy couple embraces, the PLATTITUDES LOGO appears.

           As THE LIGHTS COME UP in the room, A SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE
           rings out.  Jerry, Seth, Philip and Mug are seated around a
           table with Fat Asshole, who now rises.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        That spot starts airing in every
                        major market next week, just before
                        the second printing of Jerry's
                        phenomenal male-to-female general
                        romance series hits the shelves.
           He initiates ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE, one that Jerry
           abstains from, expressing bashful thanks to his friends.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        The rest of you abortions go and see
                        if you come up with something half
                        as good as that.

           The guys begin to file out of the room, Jerry last.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        J-Dog.  I want to talk to you in my
                        office.  I'm about to make your year.

           INT. PLATTITUDES - FAT ASSHOLE'S OFFICE -- LATER

           In the enormous office, Fat Asshole sizes up Jerry from across
           his enormous desk.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        There were many things that I disliked
                        about Fat Asshole.  But the one thing
                        that I hated above all else was his
                        goddamn word-a-day desk calendar.

           P.O.V. JERRY:  FAT ASSHOLE'S DESK CALENDAR.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        The fact is, J-Dog, you're in the
                        zone right now.  You're getting things
                        done.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        What bothered me wasn't that he owned
                        one, that he bought himself a new
                        one every Christmas.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        I look at you and I can see the gears
                        turning in your head.  You're bursting
                        with ideas.  

           TODAY'S WORD IS: "PARTURIENT (adj.) -- (1) About to bring
           forth young; being in labor.  (2) Of or relating to giving
           birth.  (3) About to produce or come forth with something,
           such as an idea or a discovery."

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        It wasn't even that he spent every
                        day forcing that day's word into
                        every conversation as many times as
                        possible.
                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        You're parturient with them.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        What really drove me insane was that
                        Fat Asshole would never, without
                        fail, have any recollection whatsoever
                        of the previous day's word.

           Jerry glances at Fat Asshole's trash can.  Though the previous
           day's page is crumpled, he can still make out: "MUNIFICENT."

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        That's munificent of you to say.

           Fat Asshole stares blankly, unfamiliar with that word.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        I want to capitalize on your hot
                        streak, J-Dog.  How would you feel
                        about tripling your commission rate?

                                 JERRY
                        I'd feel pretty good about it.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Then let's take your parturient skills
                        on the romance end and apply them
                        bereavement and Spanish.

           Jerry stares at Fat Asshole, unable to compute.

                                 JERRY
                        Bereavement and Spanish?

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Romance is covered--it's out there,
                        it's selling.  But the marketplace
                        is parturient with customers who are
                        dying and speaking and Spanish--some
                        people are doing both--and we're not
                        reaching them.  I need you to work
                        your magic on those two markets.
                        (beat)
                        Whaddya say, Jerry?  Are you my boy?

           Jerry holds his look on Fat Asshole, his confidence wavering
           for just a moment.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        When I was a kid and my father had a
                        new book to promote, he'd always
                        bring us with him on the one leg of

                        the trip that took him from where we
                        lived then to where I live now.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (delayed grin)
                        You bet.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WATERFRONT PIER -- DAY

           A MASSIVE CROWD packs every inch of this tourist trap that
           boasts something for everyone: restaurants, carnival rides,
           a central arcade, and so on.

           Just outside the arcade, a THRONG OF CHILDREN is mesmerized
           by a PUPPET SHOW.  Within the stage, two hand puppets have
           their puppet hands stuffed with candy.

                                 PUPPETEER (O.S.)
                        Who wants candy?!

           The children all SCREAM for the treats, raising their arms
           in the air.  Among them is a SIX-YEAR-OLD JERRY, his hand as
           high as anyone's.  Next to him is his father, GERALD (40s)--
           Clark Gable handsome, impossibly both masculine and refined.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        My legal name was 'Jerry'--it wasn't
                        short for 'Gerald', which was my
                        father's name.  That was the one and
                        only decision in my father's life
                        that he left to my mother.  He spent
                        every day that followed refusing to
                        acknowledge that it ever happened.

                                 GERALD
                        Put your hand down, Gerald.  You
                        look like a homosexual.

           Six-Year-Old Jerry lowers his arm, heartbroken.  Unconcerned,
           Gerald takes a ponderous drag of his Chesterfield.

           EXT. WATERFRONT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Six-Year-Old Jerry reluctantly follows his father along the
           shoreline, growing progressively further from the fun pier. 
           Gerald carries an ornately designed cane as he walks.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        For most of my life, my father walked
                        around with a cane that he didn't

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        need for any physical reason.  He
                        prided himself on being a
                        distinguished man and, as such, he
                        believed that a cane reinforced the
                        impression to any objective observer.

           Six-Year-Old Jerry reacts with embarrassment as A GUY IN A
           WHEELCHAIR rolls past in the opposite direction  

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I thought it made him look like a
                        douchebag.

           Gerald comes to a gradual stop, turning to face the water.  

                                 GERALD
                        Infinity, Gerald.  It's what we all
                        want to achieve.

           Six-Year-Old Jerry gazes longingly at the distant pier.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        All I wanted was some candy.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - STAGE -- MORNING

           Gerald sits on a couch, being interviewed on-air by the CHEERY
           FEMALE HOST and CHEERY MALE HOST.

                                 CHEERY FEMALE HOST
                        Your latest book is titled 'The
                        Magellan Cipher', and it features
                        the return of your very popular
                        recurring character, Professor Desmond
                        Booker.  What made you decide to
                        write another Booker adventure?

                                 GERALD
                        I find myself coming back again and
                        again to the Booker character because,
                        to be honest, I'm mysteriously
                        obsessed with him...

           BEHIND THE CAMERAS -- While the interview continues, Six-
           Year-Old Jerry is standing by the craft services table,
           staring down an unappealing spread of vegetables.  

           A CUTE P.A. GIRL (20s) is ostensibly watching over him,
           staring starry-eyed at Gerald.

                                 CUTE P.A. GIRL
                        Your daddy is a genius.

                        I love every one of his books.  I
                        know they're too grown up for you
                        right now, but when you start reading
                        them, you're going to find out how
                        lucky you are.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        What I would find out is that I was
                        the son of an author of highly
                        forgettable, glorified airport novels
                        whose plots usually dealt with paper-
                        thin government conspiracies leading
                        to races against time and whose
                        dialogue and characterizations were
                        piss-poor across the board.

                        I would also find out that my father's
                        obsession with his most frequently
                        recurring character, 'Professor
                        Desmond Booker', often described as--

                        pepper hair and a masculine jawline,
                        the distinct contours of his muscular
                        build visible even beneath his high-

                        ...Was perhaps not so mysterious.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - HALLWAYS -- LATER

           Six-Year-Old Jerry is wandering the hallways, grossly
           unattended and completely lost.

                                 GERALD (O.S.)
                        (quietly, muffled)
                        I'm a happy person with happy things. 
                        I'm a happy person with happy things.

           Six-Year-Old Jerry follows the sound of his father's voice,
           which leads him to a closed dressing room door.
                                 GERALD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm a happy person with happy things.  

           Without hesitation, Six-Year-Old Jerry pushes the door open--

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           To find himself staring at his father's naked ass, pants
           around his ankles as he bangs away at the Cute P.A. Girl.

                                 GERALD
                        I'm a happy person with happy things!

           Neither one of them notices Six-Year-Old Jerry; they just
           keep going at it.  Little Jerry just stares, perplexed.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        My mother never came with us on the
                        promotional tours.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Daphne crosses the room from a bookshelf to a console table,
           a large hardcover book in hand.  She looks between the book
           jacket and something on the table, then smiles to herself.

           Jerry emerges from the kitchen, carrying a couple of after-
           dinner drinks.

                                 JERRY
                        That food we brought home is just
                        going to sit in my fridge until it
                        breeds.  You should really take it.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Looking at the rest of your books, I
                        couldn't figure out why you had so
                        many by this guy--they don't fit in. 
                        But I just solved the mystery:

           She holds up the book jacket photo of Jerry's dad, comparing
           it to a framed photo, on the console table, of HIM WITH JERRY
           AT A GRADUATION CEREMONY.

                                 DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                        This guy's your daddy.

           Jerry takes the book from Daphne's hand, closing it.

                                 JERRY
                        I hope you don't think any less of
                        me.
                                 DAPHNE
                        I'd never even heard of him.
                        (beat, backpedaling)
                        Not that that means a damn thing...

                                 JERRY
                        (laughs)
                        It's better for me that you haven't.  

           He returns the book to its place on the shelf.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Those all the books he ever wrote?

           Jerry nods.

                        That last one's from ten years ago. 
                        What happened?  He run out of two-
                        word titles?

                                 JERRY
                        (uncomfortable)
                        No.  He's, uh...

                                 DAPHNE
                        Jesus.  I am on fire tonight... 

                                 JERRY
                        He's not dead.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh, thank god!

           Overjoyed, Daphne wraps Jerry in a hug.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- LATER

           Jerry and Daphne are all over each other on the bed.  A good
           deal of clothing has been pulled apart, if not off entirely. 
           One of Jerry's hands in spending a good deal of time in
           Daphne's southern hemisphere, until she finally stops him.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.

           All motion ceases.  Jerry and Daphne stare at each other.

                                 DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                        I'm having fun.

           Jerry grins, moving to resume activity--but Daphne holds up.
                                 DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                        So I should probably go.

           Maintaining his smile...Jerry sighs.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jerry is seeing the fully dressed Daphne out the door.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I want to tell you something, but
                        I'm afraid it's going to make me
                        look like a psycho chick.

                                 JERRY
                        You want to boil my rabbit.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You don't have a rabbit.

                                 JERRY
                        Lucky for him.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don't want to boil your rabbit.  
                        (then)
                        Unless you want me to.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, wow--you made it a euphemism.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I'm just a little weirded out because
                        I've never wanted to boil somebody's
                        rabbit so soon, okay?  And the fact
                        that I do might mean that there's
                        something...  That you and I...
                        (off Jerry's look)
                        Okay, see?  See?  You know what I'm
                        going to say, and now I am the psycho
                        chick.  I apologize profusely, thank
                        you for everything, I will see you
                        in the next life.

           Daphne tries to hurry out, but Jerry stops her.

                                 JERRY
                        Can't do next life--I'm booked solid. 
                        How about next weekend instead?

           Daphne smiles...and pulls Jerry in for a deep kiss.  Then
           she backs away, moving out of the apartment and into the
           night.  Jerry watches her go, all the way.
           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - OFFICE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Beer in hand, Jerry sits down in front of his computer. 
           Types in a few words on the keyboard.

           ON THE SCREEN -- Is a document with the heading: "BEREAVEMENT
           CARD IDEAS".  And nothing else.

           JERRY -- Pulls his hands back from the keyboard.  Stares at
           the screen.  Sips his beer.  Stares at the screen.

           Has a thought.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- LATER

           Jerry is banging away at someone in bed.

                                 JERRY
                        I'm a happy person with happy things!

           A FEMALE ESCORT (a different one from the previous two) and
           Jerry are sitting up in bed.  She's smoking a cigarette;
           he's writing in his checkbook register.

                                 ESCORT #3
                        That was kinda weird.

           INT. PLATTITUDES - JERRY'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           Mug is seated at Jerry's desk, playing on the computer. 
           Foam basketball in hand, Jerry "fakes out" the completely
           uninterested Mug, before crossing to the far end of the room
           where he manages to brick a wide-open slam dunk attempt.

                                 JERRY
                        That counts.  Goaltending.

           Mug doesn't react, staring dead-eyed at the computer game.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Are you calling me a liar?

           That gets Mug's attention...but he shakes off his thought.
                                 MUG
                        Aren't you a little worried that
                        it's been a month since {bleep} gave
                        you that new assignment and you still
                        haven't come up with anything?

                                 JERRY
                        You know I do my best work when I
                        don't focus and just let time take
                        its course.  I'll pull something out
                        of my ass at the last second.

                                 MUG
                        Oh, that's right.  I hate you.

                                 JERRY
                        There's my guy.

           Fat Asshole barges in, his hands firmly on Philip's shoulders.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        We're closing up shop early today,
                        boys.  Looks like I was the last one
                        to find out about this poor bastard's
                        engagement, so we're all going out
                        right now to celebrate.

                                 JERRY
                        (beat; stunned)
                        Philip...  You got engaged?

                                 PHILIP
                        I thought you knew already.  Mug
                        didn't tell you?

                                 JERRY
                        (to Mug, incredulous)
                        You were supposed to tell me this?

           Mug shrugs, staring at the floor.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Looks like I'm not the chump after
                        all.  Whaddya think about our boy
                        tying the knot?

                                 JERRY
                        (in spite of himself)
                        I think it's awful.

           Dead silence.  

           Then...everyone but Jerry--even Mug, a little--LAUGHS. 
           Realizing he's off the hook, Jerry chuckles falsely.
           INT. RITZY RESTAURANT/BAR -- NIGHT

           Fat Asshole has commandeered the lounge area for the
           engagement celebration, which has continued past dinner. 
           There is a LARGE CROWD OF PARTYERS in attendance.

           Philip and his Unpleasant Girlfriend, in the flesh--now his
           UNPLEASANT FIANCÉ (mid-20s)--are holding court on a central
           couch.  Jerry is seated nearby.  A WAITRESS sets down a few
           drinks, including one for Unpleasant Fiancé.

                                 UNPLEASANT FIANCÉ
                        Excuse me.  That looks like a lime. 
                        I ordered a vodka tonic with lemon.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll get you a slice
                        of lemon.

                                 UNPLEASANT FIANCÉ
                        No, you won't.  You'll take the whole
                        drink back, and get me what I ordered.  

           The waitress takes the drink back and moves off.

                                 UNPLEASANT FIANCÉ (CONT'D)
                        Fucking cunt.

           Philip pats her leg consolingly.  Appalled, Jerry looks away.

           Seth--just ending a phone call--approaches with a CUTE GIRL.

                                 SETH
                        We're taking off.

                                 JERRY
                        Of course you are.

                                 SETH
                        Seen Mugsy?

                                 JERRY
                        He left as soon as dinner was over. 
                        Why's he been acting so weird today?

                                 SETH
                        He's Mug.  He's weird.

           While Seth moves to say goodbye to Philip and Unpleasant
           Fiancé, Fat Asshole approaches.  He tussles playfully with
           Seth before slumping into a chair next to Jerry.
                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        These lightweight friends of yours

                        Coke, whores, the whole fuckin' thing.

                        I've actually got to watch it myself
                        tonight.  Flying back for my dad's
                        sixtieth birthday this weekend.  And
                        at some point, I've got to put the

           INT. AIRPORT -- MORNING

           Jerry is sprinting through the terminal, a bag slung over
           his shoulder.  Cell phone to his ear, he waits for the BEEP.
                                 JERRY
                        (panting heavily)
                        Hey, {bleep}, it's Jerry.  I apologize
                        for calling so early--I know it's
                        only six o'clock.  But the thing is,
                        I'm getting on a plane in literally
                        seconds and I wanted to leave you a
                        message before I fell out of contact.  
                        (looking O.S., alarmed)
                        Shit!

           UP AHEAD -- Still nearly a hundred yards away, the ATTENDANTS
           at Jerry's gate are preparing to close the door to the jetway.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (a mile a minute)
                        Anyway, here's the thing:  I realized
                        late in the day yesterday that I'm
                        really not satisfied with any of the
                        mock-ups that I came up with, and I
                        came up with a bunch of new ideas
                        that I all liked better.  So I'm
                        going to give those to you sometime
                        next week instead.

           Frantically waving his boarding pass, Jerry arrives at his
           gate just before the attendants close off the jetway.  He
           grins sheepishly as they scan his paperwork.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (gasping, to phone)
                        If you have a problem with that, too
                        fucking bad.
                        (beat, laughs)
                        Just kidding, man.  Call me later.

           The annoyed attendants usher Jerry through the door and onto
           the jetway.  He's happily exhausted to have made it.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           Gerald--now 60ish--is encased in an IRON LUNG.  
           To be fair, it's a modern "negative pressure ventilator". 
           The tank has a clear acrylic lid, giving full view of Gerald's
           supine, bodysuit-laden form.  His head sticks out through a
           malleable gasket that allows him to roll from side to side.  

           Gerald's nurse/housekeeper, VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA--mid-
           40s, plump--is seated by Gerald's head, on hand to flip the
           pages of the copy of The New Yorker that he is perusing.

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        (heavy accent)
                        I think is wonderful what you do for
                        your father, Mister Jerry.  Throw
                        him such big party for his birthday.

           ACROSS THE ROOM -- Jerry is seated in the furthest chair,
           sipping a glass of Scotch.  CATERERS are bustling back and
           forth, carrying various platters as they set up for the party.

                                 GERALD
                        I'm going to pretend to be asleep
                        for the duration, Gerald.  I do not
                        share Venezuela from Venezuela's
                        enthusiasm for your little soiree.

                                 JERRY
                        (beat)
                        We're calling her that in front of
                        her now?

           Jerry's older sister, MARGOT (30ish), enters from the kitchen.

                                 MARGOT
                        Dad, most parents would be grateful
                        if one of their children spent the
                        money that Jerry did putting this
                        together.  
                        (to Jerry)
                        The caterers didn't bring the right
                        crab puffs.  But I know how to make
                        them.  Feel like running to the store?

           Jerry gets to his feet.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I need Ricotta cheese, either part
                        skim and not lowfat or lowfat, not
                        skim.  Got it?

           INT. GROCERY STORE -- DAY

           Jerry is standing in the dairy aisle, a container of Ricotta
           cheese in each hand.  One advertises itself as "PART LOWFAT,
           PART SKIM"; the other, "SKIM", no mention of lowfat.  
           He stares at the two containers, confounded. 

           His PHONE RINGS.  Balancing both containers in one hand,
           Jerry uses the other to answer.

                                 JERRY
                        Hello?

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        Oh...hi, Jerry.  It's Noreen, from
                        Plattitudes.  I thought I would get
                        your voicemail.

                                 JERRY
                        I only duck work calls during the
                        work week.  What are you doing making
                        one on a Saturday?

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        {Bleep} heard the message you left
                        this morning...  I guess he wasn't
                        too happy about it.  He asked me to
                        relay a message of his own.

           A lengthy pause.

                                 JERRY
                        We go to commercial, Seacrest?

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        You're fired.

                                 JERRY (O.S.)
                        (beat, smirks)
                        Hilarious.  Tell {bleep} I'll call
                        him back later.

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        He won't be taking your calls anymore.

                                 JERRY
                        I admire your commitment to the bit,
                        Noreen.  Why don't you "accidentally"
                        put me through to his cell, then.

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        No, Jerry.  I don't want to lose my
                        job, too.  I'm sorry.

           DIAL TONE.  Jerry's face falls.
           THE CHEESE CONTAINERS HIT THE FLOOR WITH A SPLAT.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry comes barreling out of the store, phone to his ear.  

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (O.S.)
                        Sucks that you missed me.  Talk to
                        the beep.

                                 JERRY
                        (after the BEEP)
                        You either owe Noreen a huge bonus
                        or you should fire her ass.  I know
                        I'm late with those mock-ups,
                        but...c'mon.  She took it too far. 
                        Call me back, all right?

           Jerry hangs up, thinks for just a second, then dials another
           number.  Phone to his ear, he continues to pace.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        You've reached Seth.  I'm unavailable
                        to take your call...

           Annoyed, Jerry hangs up.

                                                           JUMP CUT:

                                 MUG (O.S.)
                        Hey, it's Mug.  Leave a message.

           Jerry hangs up.

                                                           JUMP CUT:

                                 PHILIP (O.S.)
                        Hi, you've reached Philip.  Sorry I
                        missed your call--

           Jerry hangs up, reeling.  This is really happening.

                                 JERRY
                        Holy shit.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Jerry is back in his chair as he was before, with two
           differences:  The house is FILLED WITH PARTY GUESTS, and
           Jerry's glass of Scotch is accompanied by a bottle.

           Margot approaches and sits down next to him.
                                 MARGOT
                        You're being awfully social.

           Jerry finishes his glass and immediately refills it.  Margot
           looks around the room, studying the party guests.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        If Mom were here, she'd totally screw
                        up the ex-wife plastic surgery
                        sequence.  

           THROUGHOUT THE ROOM -- We spot THREE DIFFERENT EX-WIVES OF
           GERALD, each a different age. 

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Pretty inconsiderate of her, never
                        getting any work done.  Maybe that's
                        why she didn't come.  Didn't want to
                        offset the visual chronology.

           Jerry sips his Scotch, staring across the room at Gerald,
           who--as promised--is pretending to be asleep in his machine.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        You should call her, you know.

           Jerry drains his glass and sets it down.

                                 JERRY
                        Fuck that fat asshole.

           He abruptly gets to his feet and moves off, leaving Margot
           alone.  A pause.

                                 MARGOT
                        I'll go ahead and assume you're
                        talking about someone else.

           INT. TOWNIE BAR -- LATER

           Very suburban, very sad.  Jerry is seated at the bar.  As he
           signals for a refill, TRACY (mid-20s)--a pleasant-looking
           townie girl--appears alongside him.  Does a double-take.

                                 TRACY
                        Jerry?

           Jerry looks at Tracy, trying to place her.  She helps:

                                 TRACY (CONT'D)
                        Tracy.  I haven't seen you since
                        high school!
                                 JERRY
                        Oh, my god.  Tracy!  How are you?

                                 TRACY
                        Do you remember Liz?

           She points ACROSS THE ROOM to a GROUP OF ROWDY YOUNG WOMEN,
           one of whom--LIZ (mid-20s)--wears a costume bridal veil.

                                 TRACY (CONT'D)
                        We're having her bachelorette party!  

           INT. TOWNIE BAR -- LATER

           Jerry is the center of attention at the bachelorette party
           table.  He and Liz are racing to see who can chug an Irish
           Car Bomb faster.  Jerry wins.  Laughing, Liz sets down her
           half-full drink, spilling some of it near a pile of gifts.

                                 TOWNIE GIRL
                        Lizzie, watch out!  The presents!

           Jerry helps the girls clear the gifts to safety.  He glances
           at an already opened greeting card that he's picked up.

                                 JERRY
                        Holy shit.  I wrote this!

                                 LIZ
                        Like, for your work?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  We each have our own little
                        signature that they put on the back...

           Liz and the girls gather around, staring at--

           THE BACK OF THE GREETING CARD -- Towards the bottom is a
           SMALL FACSIMILE OF JERRY'S HANDWRITTEN FIRST NAME.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        See?  "Jerry".

                                 LIZ
                        Ohmigod, that's so crazy!

           EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE TOWNIE BAR -- LATER

           Partially hidden in shadow, Jerry and Liz are making out
           against a wall.  From O.S., we can hear Tracy and the other
           girls CALLING OUT FOR LIZ.  

           The voices grow closer, until the group appears around a
           corner.  Jerry and Liz stop, drunkenly embarrassed.  
           Tracy marches over to them, grabbing a hold of Liz.

                                 TRACY
                        C'mon, Liz.  We're taking you home.

                                 LIZ
                        (laughing, to Jerry)
                        Bye.  Thanks for all the drinks...

           As she leads Liz away, Tracy stares daggers at Jerry.

           Before the girls are even out of sight, Jerry's dropped his
           pants and is pissing all over the wall.

           INT. JERRY'S RENTAL CAR -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jerry's at the wheel, ROCKING OUT TO LITA FORD'S "KISS ME
           DEADLY" ON THE RADIO.  Drunk-driving city.

           And, as it happens, FLASHING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS appear
           through the rear window.

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. SUBURBAN POLICE STATION - HOLDING AREA -- MORNING

           Jerry is curled up on a bench in a tiny cell, unconscious. 
           An OFFICER appears, loudly sliding open the cell door.

                                 SUBURBAN COP #1
                        Wake up.  Time to go.

           INT. SUBURBAN POLICE STATION - OFFICE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jerry stands defiantly at a desk, where his release is being
           processed by ANOTHER OFFICER while the first stands nearby.

                                 SUBURBAN COP #2
                        Is whoever's picking you up going to
                        pay your bail?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm paying my own bail, thanks.

           He makes a show of flipping through his credit cards, before
           throwing down a platinum one.

           EXT. SUBURBAN POLICE STATION -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           WIDE ON the front of the station as Jerry stands centered to
           the building.  A stretch limo ROLLS INTO FRAME.  The DRIVER
           hops out and hurries around to open the back door.  
           Jerry gets in; the driver gets in; and the limo rolls away.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. AIRPORT -- AFTERNOON

           WIDE ON the arrival terminal as Jerry stands centered to it,
           bag in hand.  A stretch limo ROLLS INTO FRAME.  ANOTHER DRIVER
           hops out and hurries around to open the back door.  Jerry
           gets in; the driver gets in; and the limo crawls away.

           INT. SETH'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - HOME OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           While working at his desk, Seth answers his ringing phone.

                                 SETH
                        What's up, Jerry.

           INT. LIMOUSINE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry is riding in the back of the limo, drink in one hand,
           phone in the other.  CUT BACK AND FORTH:

                                 JERRY
                        You still have that contact at
                        Hallmark?

                                 SETH
                        Yeah.  Why?

                                 JERRY
                        You think you could get me a meeting
                        with the guy?

                                 SETH
                        Probably.  Now I've got to know why.

                                 JERRY
                        You haven't seen Fat Asshole this
                        weekend?

                                 SETH
                        You know I only see him socially
                        when I absolutely cannot avoid it.  

                                 JERRY
                        It's complicated.

                                 SETH
                        Why the rush?  Couldn't you just
                        live off your savings for a while?

                                 JERRY
                        Have you seen how I live, Seth?
                                 SETH
                        I'll put in a call tonight.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           Jerry enters, setting down his bag.  He puts the house phone
           on speaker, dialing up his messages.  As they play, he flips
           through his mail.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        (recorded message)
                        Hey, Jerry.  It's Daphne.  

           Jerry stops, listening up.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm just calling because I haven't
                        seen you in a while.  I'm sure that
                        you've been busy.  But if you get a
                        chance, I was wondering if you wanted
                        to get together sometime.  Maybe
                        this weekend.  So...give me a call
                        when you can.  Okay?  I hope you're
                        doing well.  Bye.

           Jerry checks his watch, mulling it over.  And...he sits down
           on the couch, flipping on the TV.

           INT. BAMBI'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Jerry's curiously sexy attorney, BAMBI (late 30s), sits on a
           corner of her desk, facing Jerry in a chair.  She maintains
           a bubbly attitude very much in keeping with her name. 

                                 BAMBI
                        You're fine, sweetie.  Since it's a
                        first offense, all you're gonna have
                        to do is pay a few fines and attend
                        a drug and alcohol information class
                        once a week for a couple of months.

                                 JERRY
                        So I'm not going to get locked up,
                        or anything?

                                 BAMBI
                        Oh, god, no.  You're too cute to be
                        on the inside.

                                 JERRY
                        Thank you so much, Bambi.

                                 BAMBI
                        Of course, sweetie.  Hugs.
           Bambi extends her arms for Jerry, who stands and somewhat
           awkwardly joins her in an embrace.

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BAMBI'S OFFICE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           As Jerry is about to get into his car, his cell phone RINGS.

                                 JERRY
                        (answering phone)
                        Hello?

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        Hi, Jerry.  It's Noreen, from
                        Plattitudes.  {Bleep} would very
                        much like to see you in his office
                        right away.  It's urgent.

                                 JERRY
                        Is he going to offer me my job back?

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        I certainly don't think so.

                                 JERRY
                        Tell him to find the word "urethra"
                        in his calendar and blow it out that.

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        If you don't come and meet with
                        {bleep} before the end of the day,
                        Jerry...he will be forced to initiate
                        legal proceedings against you.

           INT. PLATTITUDES - OFFICE HALLWAY -- LATER

           Jerry marches down the hall with a head full of steam.  He
           passes by PHILIP'S OFFICE--Philip and Mug are inside.

                                 MUG
                        Hey!

                                 PHILIP
                        Jerry!

           They come out into the hallway and begin following Jerry,
           but he doesn't even acknowledge them.  He passes by SETH'S
           OFFICE, and Seth hops right out, looking concerned.

                                 SETH
                        Jerry, I need to talk to you...

           Seth joins the power-walk chase.  Jerry takes a few more
           steps before barging into--
           INT. PLATTITUDES - FAT ASSHOLE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Startled, Fat Asshole jumps out of his desk chair...revealing
           that his belt is unbuckled and his fly is wide open.

                                 JERRY
                        (pause; revolted)
                        Why are your pants undone?

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Why are you trying to set meetings
                        with Gunther Anspaugh?

                                 JERRY
                        Who the hell is Gunther Anspaugh?

           Seth, Philip and Mug crowd the doorway behind Jerry.

                                 SETH
                        (quietly)
                        The guy.  The Hallmark guy.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        You think you could set up a meeting
                        with my biggest rival and not have
                        me find out about it?  Don't you
                        know who I am?

                                 JERRY
                        You mean who your father is.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        You're lucky Gunther has ethics. 
                        You're lucky he contacted me before
                        agreeing to meet with you.  Because
                        as it is, I already have grounds to
                        sue you.  When you came to work for
                        me, you signed a contract.

                                 JERRY
                        And that contract became void when
                        you fired me on Saturday!

           Philip and Mug REACT, stunned; Jerry's confused by that.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        That was just something I told Noreen
                        to say because I was pissed at you. 
                        You weren't really fired.

                                 JERRY
                        (apoplectic)
                        ...What??
                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        You sure as hell are now, though.

                                 JERRY
                        You can't do that!  You can't just
                        tell somebody they're fired and not
                        mean it!

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        You want to talk about things you
                        can't do?  You can't coast for three
                        years just because your friends
                        vouched for you.  You can't accept a
                        bonus in advance of work and never
                        turn the work in.  You can't claim
                        payments to escort services as a
                        research expense!

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, I can.  I write cards about
                        love.  Sex is its physical
                        manifestation.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        That's a little pedantic.

           A beat.  Jerry's eyes go right to the word-a-day desk
           calendar, which Fat Asshole defensively snatches up.

                                 JERRY
                        I will eat that fucking calendar if
                        today's word doesn't just happen to
                        be 'pedantic'.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        So what if it is?  I already knew
                        that word, anyway.

                                 JERRY
                        No, you fucking didn't!  You don't
                        know anything!  You are barely able
                        to function as a human being!  If
                        you hadn't been born into obscene
                        wealth, you'd be blowing people on
                        the street for nickels!

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        Make fun of me all you want, asshole. 
                        You're the one who's fired.
                        (presses intercom)
                        Noreen, send security up to my office.

           Jerry develops a thousand-yard stare, defeated.
                                 JERRY
                        Fat Asshole called me an asshole.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        What?

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        That was supposed to be a voiceover.

           INT. PLATTITUDES - RECEPTION AREA -- MOMENTS LATER

           As Seth, Philip and Mug look sadly down from a few floors
           above, Jerry is ushered towards the exit by TWO BURLY SECURITY
           GUARDS.  They pass by the front desk, where we only get a
           FLEETING GLIMPSE OF NOREEN (mostly her hair), on the phone...

                                 NOREEN (O.S.)
                        Yes, {bleep}...Tim 'Ace' Jones is
                        confirmed for ten o'clock tomorrow.

           As the guards pause to open the doors, Jerry turns to stare
           suspiciously at Noreen.  Then he gets yanked outside.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Jerry, Philip and Mug are in a booth, just about the only
           people in the place.  Jerry's hammered, face down on the
           table.  Philip and Mug aren't in the best shape, either.

                                 JERRY
                        This is such a cliché.  Guy loses
                        job, guy immediately drowns sorrows
                        in alcohol while lamenting.

                                 MUG
                        Yeah, but you got fired twice from
                        the same job in three days.  So your
                        situation is made unique by
                        extenuating circumstances.  

                                 PHILIP
                        It's not unlike the Ashley Judd
                        thriller 'Double Jeopardy'...
                        (checks time)
                        I really gotta get out of here.

                                 JERRY
                        (lifts his head)
                        What?  It's still early!

           ALL OF THE LIGHTS COME ON IN THE BAR.  It's closing time.
           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry, Philip and Mug step outside.

                                 PHILIP
                        I don't think I should drive.  Mugsy,
                        what say you about giving me a ride?

                                 MUG
                        Sure.  Jerry, you want one, too?

                                 JERRY
                        Nah.  I'm good to drive.

           INT. JERRY'S BMW -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry slides in behind the wheel and closes the door.  Instead
           of starting the car, he produces his phone and dials a number.

           INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Daphne is sound asleep in bed while her phone RINGS AND RINGS.

           INT. JERRY'S BMW -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry frowns as the ringing goes to voicemail.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        (recorded message)
                        Hi, it's Daphne.  Please leave a
                        message.

                                 JERRY
                        (after the BEEP)
                        What are you doing, not answering
                        your phone?  You can't be asleep,
                        it's only--
                        (checks time)
                        Two-thirty a.m. on a Tuesday.  I'll
                        tell you what I'm gonna do:  I'm
                        gonna call back one more time, give
                        you another chance.  But that's it.

           INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- LATER

           Daphne's phone is RINGING AND RINGING AND RINGING.  It finally
           wakes her up.  She takes a moment to catch her bearings,
           looking at the time.  Groggily, she answers the phone.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hello...?
           INT. JERRY'S BMW -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry is flying down the road, phone to his ear.  CUT BACK
           AND FORTH:

                                 JERRY
                        Finally!  I only called you, like,
                        fifty times!

                                 DAPHNE
                        What are you doing?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm coming to see you.

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, Jerry.  I don't think so.

                                 JERRY
                        Don't tell me that now!  I'm almost
                        to your house!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Something tells me you should not be
                        operating a motor vehicle right now.

                                 JERRY
                        If you get your way, I'll be operating
                        one all the way back home.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (thinks for a moment)
                        Fine.  Only because I don't want
                        your death on my head, I'm gonna let
                        you come over.  But you're giving me
                        your keys and sleeping on the couch.

                                 JERRY
                        The keys are yours.  I think we can
                        debate the second condition...

                                 DAPHNE
                        (laughing)
                        No, we can't...

           Jerry looks in his rearview mirror, seeing THE FLASHING LIGHTS
           OF A POLICE CAR.  His face falls.

           INT. URBAN POLICE STATION - OFFICE -- MORNING

           Jerry, looking haggard in his clothes from the previous night,
           is settling his bail with an URBAN DESK COP.  She's just run
           his platinum card.
                                 URBAN DESK COP
                        Still won't go through.  You got
                        another one?

           Concerned, Jerry digs into his wallet.

           EXT. URBAN POLICE STATION -- DAY

           Jerry sits on the front steps, phone to his ear.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        (recorded message)
                        ...I really want to know what happened
                        to you.  I'm worried.  I hope you're
                        okay.  Please call me back.

           The message ends.  Jerry looks at his phone, thoughtful...but
           then he pockets it.  A small coupe pulls up to a stop--no
           limo this time.  At the wheel is Mug.

           INT. MUG'S COUPE -- LATER

           Mug's driving; Jerry rides shotgun.

                                 MUG
                        So, um....was there any, like...man-
                        on-man action in jail?

                                 JERRY
                        No.  But even without the forced
                        sodomy--not a recommended experience.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE -- DAY

           Jerry is standing on the front landing, waiting for someone. 
           His phone RINGS; he looks at the display:

           HIS PHONE -- Indicates that "DAPHNE" is calling.

           FOR A FLASH -- DAPHNE IS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF JERRY.

           JERRY -- Hesitates for a moment, before selecting "IGNORE".

           Bambi comes out of the building, joining Jerry.

                                 BAMBI
                        Good news and bad news.  The good
                        news is now you don't have to start
                        taking those weekly classes right
                        away.  The reason for that, though,
                        is the bad news:  You have to first
                        do two weeks in a rehab clinic.
                                 JERRY
                        A rehab clinic?  Rehab is for drug
                        addicts and alcoholics!

                                 BAMBI
                        In this state, it's also for second-
                        time DUI offenders.  You won't be
                        registered as a patient.  They'll
                        know why you're there.

           Jerry begins pacing, despondent.

                                 BAMBI (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry, sweetie.  It was the
                        best I could get for you outside of
                        actual prison time.  
                        (pause)
                        Hugs?

           They hug.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jerry, looking depressed as all hell, is packing a duffel
           bag.  He shows no interest in answering his RINGING phone.

           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           Duffel bag by the door, Jerry is locking down his apartment. 
           Passing by the phone, he dials up his voicemail on speaker.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        (recorded message)
                        Jerry, it's me again.  I hate to
                        keep calling you and leaving all
                        these messages, but I still haven't
                        heard from you.  I don't know if
                        you're mad at me, or what--

           Jerry presses a button.

                                 RECORDED VOICEMAIL CUE (O.S.)
                        Message saved.

                                                             CUT TO:

           THE REHAB CLINIC MONTAGE

           (MUSIC:  "NOTHING'S GONNA STOP ME NOW (THEME FROM 'PERFECT
           STRANGERS')")

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - RECEPTION AREA -- MORNING

           Duffel bag at his feet, Jerry is facing the RECEPTIONIST.
                                 REHAB CLINIC RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you want to pay the entire fifteen
                        hundred now or do you want to use
                        the payment plan?

                                 JERRY
                        What's the payment plan?

                                 REHAB CLINIC RECEPTIONIST
                        Half now, half when you check out.

           Jerry frowns, producing his last working credit card.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Jerry's in session with his rumpled REHAB COUNSELOR (50s),
           who's reading questions from a list.

                                 REHAB COUNSELOR
                        Have you ever had any blackouts after
                        drinking?

                                 JERRY
                        No.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - SMOKING ROOM -- DAY

           Jerry is crammed in the tiny space with SEVERAL RESIDENTS
           puffing on cigarettes.  Among them is a PREGNANT WOMAN.

                                 SMOKING PREGNANT LADY
                        (emphysema voice)
                        People can judge me all they want. 
                        It's my fucking baby.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

                                 REHAB COUNSELOR
                        Have you ever been absent from work
                        or lost a job because of drinking?

                                 JERRY
                        The opposite, actually.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - MEETING ROOM 'A' -- AFTERNOON

           A MUSCLEBOUND, GOOGLEY-EYED PSYCHOPATH WITH A HANDLEBAR
           MOUSTACHE is "in group", Jerry a part of it.

                                 GOOGLEY-EYED PSYCHOPATH
                        The sticker on my truck said there
                        was a fuckin' raccoon in there.  Did
                        the cop really fuckin' think there
                        wasn't gonna be a raccoon?
           INT. REHAB CLINIC - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

                                 REHAB COUNSELOR
                        Do you ever drive after drinking?
                        (beat)
                        Oh.  Right.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - JERRY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           In the narrow room with two beds along either wall, Jerry is
           lying in his small bed, reading.  His SQUAT, BALD HISPANIC
           ROOMMATE is pacing back and forth, fuming.

                                 REHAB ROOMMATE
                        (heavy accent)
                        Fuck that fucking security guy, making
                        me get off the fucking phone!

           He grabs the largest hardback book in Jerry's pile.

                                 REHAB ROOMMATE (CONT'D)
                        Can I borrow?

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - MEN'S RESIDENTIAL HALLWAY -- SECONDS LATER

           Jerry pokes his head out the door and into chaos:  Down at
           the corner of the hallway--near a payphone--Jerry's roommate
           is mercilessly pummeling a SECURITY GUARD with Jerry's book.

           The OTHER RESIDENTS appear at their doorways, entertained by
           the show.  Chagrined, Jerry slinks back into his room.

           INT. REHAB CLINIC - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

                                 REHAB COUNSELOR
                        Based on what I've observed, I
                        wouldn't describe you as an alcoholic. 
                        I'm going to classify you as an
                        "occasional social abuser" of alcohol.

                                 JERRY
                        You mean like everyone who drinks?

                                 REHAB COUNSELOR
                        (annoyed)
                        I could review your file again and
                        focus on the alcoholic tendencies...

           Jerry is quickly on his feet, snatching the paperwork.

           END REHAB CLINIC MONTAGE.
           EXT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT BUILDING -- AFTERNOON

           As a taxi drives away, Jerry lugs his bag to his front door. 
           Taped to it is a piece of paper that reads:

           "THREE DAY NOTICE - PAY RENT OR QUIT"

                                 JERRY
                        Awesome.

           Jerry rips the paper off the door and heads inside.

           INT. AMERICAN GREETINGS OFFICE -- DAY

           The sprawling, impressive office is appropriate for one of
           the industry's leading companies.  So is the handsome, well-
           tailored INTERVIEWER seated across from Jerry.

                                 AMERICAN GREETINGS INTERVIEWER
                        You're a talented guy, Jerry--your
                        work certainly speaks to that fact. 
                        Nothing's been decided yet, but I
                        want to be up front with you about
                        something:  Should you make the cut
                        to the final group of candidates... 
                        You'd have to take a drug test.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

                                 AMERICAN GREETINGS INTERVIEWER
                        The test would be able to tell if
                        you'd had any drugs in your system
                        over the previous thirty days.

                                 JERRY
                        That's fine.

                                 AMERICAN GREETINGS INTERVIEWER
                        (highly skeptical)
                        Really.

           He jots something down on a notepad.  Jerry frowns, puzzled.

           INT. FEELINGS INCORPORATED OFFICE -- DAY

           Lesser company, lesser office, lesser INTERVIEWER.

                                 FEELINGS INTERVIEWER
                        This a crucial stage in our company's
                        development.  Any right move could
                        make us, and any wrong one could
                        break us.  Bringing somebody in with
                        your talent, that could make us.
                                 JERRY
                        That's very nice of you to say.

                                 FEELINGS INTERVIEWER
                        On the other hand, bringing in
                        somebody with a history of drug
                        problems...that's a move that could
                        break us.  So what is someone in my
                        position to recommend?

                                 JERRY
                        Um...the first option?

           The interviewer snorts, as though such a suggestion is absurd,
           and jots something down.  Again, Jerry looks confused.

           INT. STEVE'S GREETING CARDS AND HANGING PLANTS -- DAY

           Not so much an "office" as it is a "filthy apartment". 
           Jerry's seated on a metal fold-out chair while STEVE himself--
           the cracked-out owner and sole employee--frantically digs
           through the large boxes and piles of trash strewn about.

                                 STEVE
                        All right, fuck it.  I can't find my
                        business card.  But it's awesome. 
                        It says, like, "Steve's Greeting
                        Cards and Hanging Plants", and it's
                        got, like, a picture of a plant.

                                 JERRY
                        And a greeting card?

                                 STEVE
                        Huh?  No.

           Steve digs up a crumpled sheet of paper and a pencil, and
           hands them both to Jerry.

                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        I want you to write down a number
                        that you think is reasonable, and
                        that you think I will think is
                        reasonable.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh.  Okay.  Are we talking annual,
                        or bi-monthly, or...

                                 STEVE
                        We're talking ten figures.

           Jerry reacts, puzzled by the juxtaposition of what Steve
           just said and the sight of A CAT CRAPPING ON THE FLOOR.
                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        A phone number.

           Jerry looks back to Steve, stumped.  A lengthy pause.

                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        Your dealer's phone number, dude. 
                        Hook me up and you're totally hired.

           EXT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

           Jerry is seated with Philip and Mug at a table, an island in
           the sea of his belongings: yard sale.  OLD LADIES,
           TWENTYSOMETHINGS and WEIRDOS are poring over the remnants.

                                 JERRY
                        I'm going to kill that fat asshole.

                                 PHILIP
                        There's no proof that {bleep} spread
                        rumors through the industry that
                        you're a drug addict.

                                 MUG
                        Although we did hear that one thing
                        about the phone call.

                                 JERRY
                        What phone call?

                                 PHILIP
                        I thought that really happened.

                                 JERRY
                        What phone call?

                                 MUG
                        {Bleep}, I guess, told some people
                        that you called his house at, like,
                        three in the morning, and you were
                        all cracked out and rambling.

           Jerry stares in disbelief at Mug, rage boiling.

                                 JERRY
                        First of all, how do you hear
                        something like that and not tell me?

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        (to Jerry)
                        How much for that console table?

                                 MUG
                        I didn't want you to be embarrassed.
                                 JERRY
                        I wouldn't be embarrassed, because
                        it didn't fucking happen!

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        Excuse me.

                                 JERRY
                        One time, I did call him pretty early. 
                        I had to because I was going to be
                        traveling all day.

                                 PHILIP
                        Jerry, how much is the console table?

                                 JERRY
                        But it wasn't three-thirty, it was,
                        like, six.  And I called the office,
                        not his house, specifically because
                        I didn't want to wake him up!

                                 PHILIP
                        Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        And I was talking to him about work! 
                        I wasn't rambling!  I might have
                        sounded a little frenzied, but that
                        was only because I was running to
                        catch a plane!  Man, fuck that fat
                        asshole!

                                 PHILIP
                        Jerry!

                                 JERRY
                        The console table is fifty dollars!

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        Fifteen?

                                 JERRY
                        Five-zero.

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        I'll give you forty if you put it in
                        my car.

           Jerry gets up and walks over to the console table.

                                 JERRY
                        I should seriously sue him for
                        defamation of character, or something.
                                 PHILIP
                        You wouldn't have enough to go on.  

                                 JERRY
                        He told potential employers that I
                        was a drug addict!

           Jerry picks up the table, following the woman to her car.

                                 PHILIP
                        But you would have to prove that
                        that is specifically what prevented
                        you from getting any of those jobs.

                                 MUG
                        Yeah.  If you tried to say that
                        weren't a drug addict, {bleep} could
                        point out that you had been in rehab.

           The Uptight Woman stops on a dime, wheeling around.

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        No.  I'm not going to support your
                        habit.  I don't want the table. 

           Jerry, Mug and Philip stare in shock at the woman.

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        I was going to get the Ab Roller,
                        too, but forget it.

                                 MUG
                        (hesitant)
                        Actually...the Ab Roller's mine.

           Jerry turns to Mug, rendered speechless by his own anger.

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        How much?

                                 MUG
                        Fifteen.

           The Uptight Woman hands Mug cash and takes an "Ab Roller"
           off the table.  She sneers at Jerry as she walks past:

                                 UPTIGHT WOMAN
                        Get a job, addict.

           Jerry's eyes of fury remained locked on Mug.
           INT. JERRY'S NICE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           Just about EVERYTHING IS GONE, save for the couch and the
           enormous TV, which Jerry failed to turn off before passing
           out.  An army of fallen beer bottles surrounds him.

                                 PHONE COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.)
                        (blaring)
                        Someone is waiting to hear from you.

           Jerry snaps awake, alarmed.

           ON TV -- A COMMERCIAL FOR A LONG-DISTANCE PHONE COMPANY shows
           a GRANDMOTHER receiving a phone call from a LITTLE GIRL.

                                 PHONE COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Whether you're brightening someone's
                        day...

                                 LITTLE GIRL (ON T.V.)
                        Happy birthday, Grandma!

           The commercial CUTS TO a YOUNG SOLDIER, talking on the phone
           with his relieved PARENTS.

                                 PHONE COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.)
                        Setting someone's heart at ease...

                                 SOLDIER (ON T.V.)
                        I'll be home soon, Mom and Dad.

           Inspired, Jerry picks up his phone and dials a few numbers.

                                 PHONE COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.)
                        Or just letting someone know that
                        you're a fucking scumbag...

           Jerry pauses, looking in confusion at the TV.

           The commercial now shows DAPHNE, having received a phone
           call from JERRY.

                                 JERRY (ON T.V.)
                        Sorry I haven't called you in a while. 
                        I was busy getting fired and arrested
                        for multiple DUIs.  But good news:
                        I'm out of rehab!  Wanna hang out? 
                        We should probably do it at your
                        place, since I sold all my furniture.

           TV Daphne looks appalled.

                                 PHONE COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (V.O.)
                        Vericom will bring you together.
           THE REAL JERRY -- Stops dialing, setting his phone down.  He
           turns off the TV, disturbed.

           Then the phone RINGS.  Jerry answers immediately.

                                 JERRY
                        Daphne?

                                 SUMMER (O.S.)
                        Um...hi.  Is this Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah...

                                 SUMMER (O.S.)
                        This is Summer.  I'm buying your car
                        on Ebay?

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. HILLY RESIDENTIAL AREA -- AFTERNOON

           Jerry's BMW climbs a steep, twisting road in a neighborhood
           of obvious affluence, each house more impressive than the
           next.  Mug's coupe is following it.

                                 MUG (O.S.)
                        We just passed the two-and-a-half-
                        hour mark.  

           INT. MUG'S COUPE -- CONTINUOUS

           Mug's on his cell phone while driving.  

                                 MUG
                        You couldn't have just waited until
                        she could come pick it up?

           INT. JERRY'S BMW -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry's at the wheel, phone to his ear.  CUT BACK AND FORTH:  

                                 JERRY
                        My landlord's going to start eviction
                        proceedings if I don't pay my back
                        rent by tomorrow.  I can't wait for
                        this money.

                                 MUG
                        (beat, squinting)
                        I think one of your brakelights is
                        out.

           Jerry looks at Mug in his rearview mirror.
                                 JERRY
                        Are you shitting me?

                                 MUG
                        WATCH IT!

           Jerry looks ahead to see an ELDERLY NUN crossing the street
           in front of him, completely oblivious.  He jerks the wheel--

           EXT. HILLY RESIDENTIAL AREA -- CONTINUOUS

           Tires SQUEALING, Jerry's car misses the nun by inches as it
           careens of the road and right into an oak tree, its entire
           front end instantly demolished.

           Mug's car pulls up to a stop behind Jerry's and Mug jumps
           out.  The nun has remained completely unaware of the incident,
           finishing her shuffle across the road towards a CHURCH.  

           Mug runs up to the wrecked BMW to find Jerry, bleeding from
           the head and looking dazed, fighting the deployed airbag.

                                 MUG
                        Jerry!  Are you okay??

           Jerry opens his mouth to answer, but he's interrupted by the
           DING of a maintenance alert.  A dashboard warning light comes
           on to indicate: "LEFT BRAKELIGHT OUT".

           Jerry and Mug both stare at the light in awkward silence.

           INT. SUMMER'S FAMILY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Through the large front window of the magnificent house, we
           see Jerry's crumpled car sitting dead in the driveway, as a
           tow truck is driving off.

           Jerry--pressing a cold compress to his head, clearly suffering
           from a mild concussion--and Mug are seated on a couch.  Facing
           them from across a coffee table are SUMMER (16)--in the flesh,
           BAWLING uncontrollably--and her ANGRY FATHER (50s).

                                 ANGRY FATHER
                        Just to get you fucking criminals
                        out of my house, I'm going to buy
                        what's left of the car for a thousand.

           From his pocket he produces a fat roll of hundred-dollar-
           bills, counts out ten, and drops them on the coffee table.

                                 JERRY
                        (slurred)
                        We're not criminals.  I was only in
                        rehab 'cause of the DUIs.
           Mortified, Mug snatches the bills and gets to his feet.

                                 MUG
                        Let's go, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Wait.  A thousand dollars?  That's,
                        like...a fortieth of the price we
                        agreed on.

                                 ANGRY FATHER
                        Since you're so good at math, why
                        don't you figure out how much it's
                        gonna cost me to get that thing back
                        to working condition?

           Disinterested, Jerry lets his eyes settle on the nubile
           Summer.  His grin is delirious and entirely unsavory.

                                 JERRY
                        I'm a happy person with happy things.

           With that, Jerry pitches forward--knocking his head on the
           coffee table--and falls onto the floor, unconscious.

                                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. JERRY'S CRAPPY APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

           At long last, Jerry has succumbed to reality and downgraded
           his living situation.  A much crappier-looking building in a
           much crappier-looking area than his previous residence. 

                                 PHILIP (O.S.)
                        Our presents for you are very similar.

           INT. JERRY'S CRAPPY APARTMENT - "LIVING SPACE" -- CONTINUOUS

           The living room and the bedroom are one and the same; the
           kitchen/bathroom area is partially visible in the background. 
           Jerry is seated on his bed, facing Philip and Mug in a couple
           of chairs.  Each of them is holding a wrapped present.

                                 PHILIP
                        But that's a deliberate two-pronged
                        attack.

                                 MUG
                        My idea.

                                 PHILIP
                        Since you've got your big-ass TV but
                        no TV signal, you're probably going 
                                 (MORE)

                        to be watching a lot more DVDs.  And
                        we our proud to present you with two
                        titles that have heretofore been
                        shamefully lacking in your collection.

           Jerry unwraps the DVD from Philip, revealing:

                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        'Under Siege'...

           Mug thrusts his gift towards Jerry, very excited.

                                 MUG
                        And 'Under Siege 2: Dark Territory'!
                        (then)
                        I wanted to get you the sequel so I
                        could say "Under Siege Two: Dark
                        Territory".

           Jerry stares at the DVDs, nodding ponderously.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           The place is packed.  Jerry and some FRIENDS--including Philip
           and Mug--are crammed into a table in the back.  At the urging
           of the crowd, Jerry throws back a shot, adding another glass
           to the sea of empties.

                                 FEMALE FRIEND
                        Jerry, you didn't open my card!

           Jerry finds the envelope she's pointing to, reading the seal.

                                 JERRY
                        (to Mug and Philip)
                        Plattitudes!  Some of your guys'
                        work, perhaps.

           He tears it open and reads the card, smiling politely.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Jennifer.
                        (holds up card)
                        Philip?  Mugsy?  This either one of
                        yours?

           Mug and Philip shake their heads, Mug looking tense.

                                 PHILIP
                        No, sir.
                                 JERRY
                        Maybe Seth is here in spirit, even
                        if he couldn't bring himself to be
                        here in person...

           He flips the card over to check the "signature" on the back,
           finding that it reads:  "ACE".

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Who the fuck is 'Ace'?

           Suddenly, the air has been sucked out of the party.

           INT. MUG'S COUPE -- LATER

           Jerry rides shotgun, cooking with rageahol.  Mug is driving;
           Philip is passed out in the backseat.

                                 JERRY
                        I just think it's funny that you
                        guys have been friends with my
                        replacement all this time but were
                        afraid to tell me.

                                 MUG
                        We're not friends with him!  We hardly
                        even know him!

                                 JERRY
                        Philip said he was nice!

                                 MUG
                        Philip's hammered, and so are you!

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, so he's not nice?

                                 MUG
                        No!  Yes!  I don't know!

                                 JERRY
                        If he's so nice, why didn't he come
                        with you guys tonight?  Is he too
                        busy, out spending my money?

           Mug sighs, shaking his head.  Jerry simmers for a few moments.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        "Tim 'Ace' Jones"...  Where the fuck
                        does someone get off calling himself
                        'Ace'?  Is he a fighter pilot?  Or
                        the lead guitarist for KISS?
                                 PHILIP
                        (shifting, groggy)
                        Nah, man...  He's nice.

           Philip lovingly pats Mug's shoulder and falls back asleep.

           Jerry stares daggers at Mug...who turns up the radio.

                                                             CUT TO:

           THE SPIRALING INTO OBLIVION MONTAGE

           (MUSIC:  THE KILLS' "FRIED MY LITTLE BRAINS")

           EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT SIDEWALK -- DAY

           Jerry walks down the street, looking hopeful.

           INT. BANANA REPUBLIC -- DAY

           PAN ALONG a line of JOB APPLICANTS, ALL OF THEM FIFTEEN- AND
           SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRLS, who are folding clothes as quickly
           as possible for the approval of a MANAGER.  All of the piles
           are looking pretty good, until we reach--

           JERRY: no pile; struggling with a cashmere turtleneck sweater.

                                 JERRY
                        I don't quite understand what to do
                        with the neck, here.

           EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT SIDEWALK -- LATER

           Jerry walks in the opposite direction, looking defeated.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Jerry is seated among a GROUP OF FRIENDS as Philip is
           standing, raising a toast.

                                 PHILIP
                        Here's to Mug, who's been put in
                        charge of his entire department!

           Jerry partakes in the CHEER for the sheepish Mug.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT BLOCK -- DAY

           Jerry walks down the street, looking hopeful.
           INT. HIGH-END RESTAURANT -- DAY

           Jerry is seated at a round table group interview session
           with OTHER SERVER APPLICANTS, looking positively stumped
           under the inquisitive stare of the RESTAURANT MANAGER.

                                 JERRY
                        What region of France would I
                        recommend someone select a wine from
                        if they ordered fish?

           EXT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT BLOCK -- LATER

           Jerry walks in the opposite direction, looking defeated.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Jerry is standing on the fringes of a GROUP OF PEOPLE raising
           their glasses to Philip.

                                 SETH
                        Let's hear it for the new President
                        of Creative Division at Plattitudes!

           Jerry tries to appear game as everyone CHEERS.

           EXT. TOURIST DISTRICT SIDEWALK -- DAY

           Jerry walks down the street, looking hopeful.

           INT. BARNES & NOBLE STORE -- DAY

           Jerry is tailing the FEMALE STORE MANAGER through the aisles.

                                 BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        This might seem weird, since it wasn't
                        you who wrote them, but...

           She stops at a section of books that were all written by
           Jerry's father.  Jerry sighs, tensing.  The manager takes a
           copy of The Magellan Cipher off the shelf, pen in hand.

                                 BOOKSTORE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        Would you mind signing one?

           Jerry stares blankly at her for a moment.  Then he just turns
           away, loosening his tie as he heads for the escalator.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

           Jerry is standing at the bar, his absence not noticed by the
           GROUP OF PEOPLE in back who are surrounding SETH.  
           After the toast, Mug peels away from the group and comes
           over to Jerry.

                                 MUG
                        Guy gets to start his own brand,
                        bankrolled under the company umbrella. 
                        I still can't fucking believe it.

           Jerry says nothing, setting down his empty glass.

                                 MUG (CONT'D)
                        Need another one?

           As Mug waves down the BARTENDER, Seth approaches, happily
           inebriated.  He throws an arm around Jerry.

                                 SETH
                        You see Debbie?

           Jerry follows Seth's extended finger to a corner of the bar...

           Where DAPHNE is with a GROUP OF HER FRIENDS.

           JERRY -- Blanches.

                                 JERRY
                        Daphne...

                                 SETH
                        Right.  You guys had a good thing
                        going for a while, didn't you?  What
                        ever happened with that?

           Gathering his courage, Jerry stands up and walks across the
           bar towards Daphne's group.  He stops a couple of feet from
           her, unnoticed as of yet.  Unsteady.

           Abruptly, he makes a beeline for the exit.

           DAPHNE -- Looks up only to catch a fleeting glimpse of what
           might be Jerry disappearing out the door.

           AT THE BAR -- Mug, turning to hand Jerry his drink, looks
           confused.  Seth takes it, his eyes on Daphne's group.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        I wonder if Debbie's friend is here. 
                        That chick is a freak...

           Mug frowns, watching Seth gulp down the drink meant for Jerry.
           INT. DRUGSTORE -- NIGHT

           STEELY DAN'S "DIRTY WORK" IS PIPING THROUGH THE LOUDSPEAKERS
           as Jerry wanders through the nearly unoccupied store, unkempt
           and completely shitfaced.  He's barely able to stay on his
           feet, knocking items off shelves as he veers in the aisles.  

           He eventually finds himself in: THE GREETING CARD AISLE. 
           TWO YOUNG WOMEN--both of them still dressed up from a night
           out and a little tipsy--are perusing the cards.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #1
                        God, they don't have shit here.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #2
                        Just pick one and let's go.

                                 JERRY
                        What's the occasion?

           The girls pause briefly, but are drunk enough themselves to
           indulge Jerry in conversation.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #2
                        Her anniversary with her fiancé.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #1
                        I already got him a gift and
                        everything, but the card's kind of a
                        big deal this year.  'Cause we've
                        been together for like a really long
                        time, and ever since we got engaged,
                        we've both been kind of worried that,
                        like, the magic's gone.  Y'know what
                        I mean?  But all they've got left
                        are these blank cards.

                                 JERRY
                        You got a pen?

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #2
                        I do...

           Girl #2 digs into her purse, producing a pen.

                                 JERRY
                        (to Girl #1)
                        Use that blank card you're holding,
                        write this down:  General salutation,
                        name, "On Our 'X' Anniversary"...

           Girl #1 is confused, but writes as dictated.
                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        "The day that I met you was one of
                        the greatest days of my life.  It
                        was when I first began to dream of
                        how exciting my life could be... 
                        And I would never want to go back to
                        it."

           The girl takes pause, but writes what Jerry says.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        "Because if I did, I would miss every
                        day that I've lived since...when
                        you've made that dream come true."

           The girls look at each other, duly impressed.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        "Here's to our life together and may
                        I never sleep again, happy
                        anniversary, love"--your name.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #1
                        That's really good.

                                 JERRY
                        That's what I do.  I write greeting
                        cards for a living.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #2
                        Seriously?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  I'm Jerry.  The romance guy. 
                        I write the words that make people
                        love each other...

           Jerry attempts to kiss Girl #2--who shoves him away, appalled.

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #2
                        What the fuck are you doing?!

                                 GREETING CARD GIRL #1
                        Let's go.

           Both of the girls hurry away.

                                 JERRY
                        (calling out)
                        Whatever!  Joke's on you, 'cause
                        guess what?  It's all fake!  Made-up
                        shit off the top of my head, every
                        time, all the time!
           At the end of the aisle behind Jerry appears a SECURITY GUARD.

                                 DRUGSTORE SECURITY GUARD
                        Sir, I think you better leave the
                        store.

           Jerry wheels around, redirecting his rant without pause.

                                 JERRY
                        But is that what I got fired for? 
                        No.  I never got called out on that. 
                        You know what I got fired for? 
                        Spanish and bereavement cards!  That's
                        what I went out on!  That was the
                        end of Jerry!  Un-fucking-believable,
                        right?  I mean, who the fuck really
                        cares about Spanish and bereavement
                        cards?

           The guard's eyes briefly dart to a section of cards.  Jerry
           follows his gaze to a DIVIDER THAT READS: "SYMPATHY - SPANISH"

           JERRY -- Loses his footing and stumbles into the rack,
           dragging a pile of cards with him as he falls to the ground.  

           The guard advances.  Jerry staggers to his feet, pulling
           greeting cards off of himself as he makes a run for the exit.

           INT. JERRY'S CRAPPY APARTMENT - "LIVING SPACE" -- NIGHT

           Jerry is slumped on his bed, watching his DVD of Under Siege.

           More specifically, he's watching it on pause as he masturbates
           to A FROZEN IMAGE OF A TOPLESS ERIKA ELANIAK.

                                 JERRY
                        I'm a happy person...  I'm a happy
                        person...  I'm a happy person...

           Approaching climax, Jerry desperately looks for something he
           can use for cleanup.  He grabs the nearest piece of paper--

           Seeing that it is a FINAL NOTICE FROM THE ELECTRIC COMPANY.

           POP.  Every electrical appliance in the apartment shuts off
           simultaneously, leaving Jerry in DARKNESS AND SILENCE.

                                 KID ON PLANE (O.S.)

                        My job.
           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - COACH CABIN -- DAY

           Jerry is squished into a middle seat on a full flight.  The
           KID in front of him is leaning over his seat, focused on the
           GREETING CARD MOCK-UP on which Jerry is working.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        What's your job?

                                 JERRY
                        I write greeting cards.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        Like birthday cards?

                                 JERRY
                        Sometimes.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        Is that a birthday card?

                                 JERRY
                        No.  This is a very special kind of
                        card.  Nobody's ever made one like
                        it before.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        What kind is it?

                                 JERRY
                        A suicide card.

           That gets the attention of the TWO PEOPLE sitting on either
           side of Jerry.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        What's suicide?

                                 JERRY
                        It's when you kill yourself. 

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        No way.

                                 JERRY
                        Way.  A lot of times, when people
                        kill themselves, they leave a note
                        for other people to read explaining
                        why they did it.  They want these
                        notes to be unique, poetic and
                        emotionally impactful.  But the
                        problem, Billy, is that people are
                        stupid.
                                 KID ON PLANE
                        My name's not Billy.

                                 JERRY
                        Your average American can't string
                        together a coherent sentence, never
                        mind effectively convey any kind of
                        genuine emotion via the written word. 
                        Since the dawn of the greeting card
                        industry, people have turned to it
                        to speak for them on birthdays,
                        anniversaries, for get-wells and
                        apologies.  So why have they taken
                        matters into their own hands when it
                        comes to arguably the most important
                        thing they'll ever say--their last
                        words?  More or less religious-based
                        moral hypocrisy is why, Billy, but
                        that's a much larger issue.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        My name's Tyler.

                                 JERRY
                        I say, no more.  As a professional
                        and--at one time--rather accomplished
                        greeting card writer, I'm smashing
                        the only taboo in the business and
                        opening the floodgates to a previously
                        untapped and potentially very
                        lucrative market.  What you're looking
                        at is the prototype for the first-
                        ever mass-produced suicide card.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        What does it say?

                                 JERRY
                        Since it is a prototype, I'm sticking
                        to primarily generic yet poignant
                        language.  But, like on any card,
                        there'll be plenty of space for the
                        customer to fill in the blanks. 
                        Y'know:  "My existence is cursed... 
                        There's no sense in fighting it... 
                        I'm pushing thirty and I have to
                        move back into my father's house, I
                        had ask my sister to buy me the plane
                        ticket just so I could do that..." 
                        That kind of stuff.

                                 KID ON PLANE
                        Is it going to make you rich?
                                 JERRY
                        It's going to make somebody rich.

           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT leans across Jerry's row to hand a snack
           box to the OVERWEIGHT MAN in the window seat.

                                 OVERWEIGHT MAN ON PLANE
                        (to Jerry)
                        I don't think it's right to be talking
                        to a little kid about that.

                                 JERRY
                        And your fourth snack box of the
                        flight is, what--the pinnacle of
                        sound thinking?  Let me know if you
                        find my lower right quadrant.  I'm
                        seriously fucking worried about it.

           With a glare, Jerry gets back to work.

           Jerry is clearing aside stacks of cardboard boxes, trying to
           uncover some semblance of HIS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM.  

           In the doorway stand Gerald--dressed in a monogrammed bathrobe
           with an oxygen cart at his side--and Venezuela from Venezuela.

                        Despite what you may think, Gerald,

           Following the PREGNANT MARGOT inside, Jerry sets his bags

           Weeks have passed, as indicated by the room's progression
           towards a pseudo-functional living space/home office.

           Jerry is seated at a desk, facing a laptop computer whose
           screen displays a spreadsheet of cold-call phone numbers. 
           Phone to his ear, he's reading aloud from a printed script:

                        "Christmas Special" is just a name,

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           The house is PACKED WITH UPPER-CLASS REVELERS.  Jerry's first
           in line outside the bathroom, obviously having been waiting
           for a while.  The door swings open and a STOCK BROKER-TYPE
           and his GIRLFRIEND come stumbling out, giggling.

                                 STOCK BROKER GUY
                        All yours, chief!

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry steps into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. 
           He's barely taken a step towards the toilet when he spots: 
           A MAGAZINE-PAGE POUCH OF COCAINE, LEFT OPEN ON THE COUNTER.

           JERRY -- Stops in his tracks. 

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        In my defense...it was the Holidays.

           STOP-MOTION JERRY, all coked up, is at the center of a GROUP
           OF STOP-MOTION PEOPLE, anxiously jibber-jabbering:

                                 STOP-MOTION JERRY

           Alone, Stop-Motion Animated Jerry snorts some more cocaine.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - DEN -- NIGHT (STOP-MOTION)

           Coked-up Stop-Motion Jerry is in the depths of an "intense"
           conversation with a few other FUCKED-UP STOP-MOTION STRANGERS.

                                 STOP-MOTION JERRY
                        You guys--I'm serious.  You guys--
                        you gotta understand something.  I
                        fucking love you guys.  I'm serious. 
                        Nothing else matters.  All the rest
                        is bullshit.  It's all about us.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - STORAGE ROOM -- DAWN (STOP-MOTION) 126

           Stop-Motion Jerry finishes his latest dip into the cocaine,
           then dials up a number on his cell phone.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)

                        Uh...I know we haven't talked in a
                        while.  I just wanted to say hi,

                        hope you're doing well.  Okay?  Call

                        Okay.  Okay.  Uh...bye.

           He hangs up the phone, licking at the loose fragments of
           cocaine dust and rubbing a finger along his gums.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           The house is DEAD SILENT.  Jerry is tossing and turning on
           the couch, wide awake in the worst way.

           Eventually, we hear SHUFFLING ABOUT O.S.  Venezuela from
           Venezuela--in her robe, just having woken--pads into view.  

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        Oh--Mister Jerry.  Merry Christmas.

                                 JERRY
                        Huh?  Yeah.  Do you have any downers?

           Venezuela from Venezuela stares at Jerry, confused.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Like, drugs...to relax.  To slow
                        down?  Sleepy drugs?  Vicodin?  Xanax? 
                        Anything like that around?

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        Mister Gerald's old medicine?

           Now Jerry's confused.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER HOME - GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry looks on as Venezuela from Venezuela moves aside junk
           to get at some storage boxes.  She opens one up.

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        Mister Gerald can't take anymore,
                        because of lungs.

           Jerry peers into the box...and is utterly dumfounded.
                                 JERRY
                        ...And to all a good night.

           He's staring at A STOCKPILE OF MEDICINAL MARIJUANA.

                        I know what you're thinking.  But I
                        actually don't like pot.  It gives
                        me a headache.

           Jerry--HAVING SHAVED OFF HIS HOMELESS-MAN BEARD--is seated
           at his desk, a spreadsheet on his laptop screen...

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        You know who does like pot, though? 
                        Pretty much everyone else on Earth.  

           But he's no longer telemarketing.

           TWO NERVOUS-LOOKING HIGH SCHOOL KIDS enter the room.  One of
           them hands Jerry cash; he counts it, then hands the kids a
           pre-measured baggie full of weed.  The kids hastily exit;
           Jerry records the transaction on his spreadsheet.

           A MIDDLE-AGED HIPPIE enters Jerry's "office"; the transaction
           goes forth just like the last one we witnessed.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        My shit wasn't that good, but my
                        prices were.  Or maybe it was the
                        opposite.  What the hell did I know?

           Through the window, we see that WINTER IS ENDING...

           Through the window, we see that SPRING HAS SPRUNG.  A
           HOUSEWIFE waits patiently as Jerry counts her money.
                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        All I cared about was the fact that
                        I was no longer selling fucking coin
                        storage units over the phone. 

           Jerry hands the housewife her product with a wink and a smile. 
           She exits, and he records the transaction.

                        And in some sense, I really did feel
                        like a productive member of society.

           Jerry, fully dressed and looking haggard, is dead asleep on
           the couch after his latest night of debauchery.

           Venezuela from Venezuela is cleaning the area around the TV;
           she accidentally turns it on and "THE TODAY SHOW" BLARES TO
           LIFE.  Jerry awakes with a start.

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        Oh!  Mister Jerry!  I'm so sorry!  I
                        turn off!

           While Venezuela from Venezuela fumbles with the remote, Jerry
           can't help but focus on the broadcast. 

           ON TV -- MATT LAUER is introducing a guest...

                                 MATT LAUER (ON T.V.)
                        When you buy a greeting card, you
                        probably don't think much about who
                        wrote it.  

                                 JERRY
                        Wait.  Leave it on.

                        But if that card is specifically
                        either for or from someone between
                        the ages of thirteen and eighteen,
                        there is over a fifty percent chance
                        that it was created by our guest
                        today.

           ON TV -- "The Today Show" switches cameras to reveal SETH.

                        Seth, you're not even thirty years
                        old, and you're about to introduce
                        your second brand of greeting cards. 
                        How did it all happen?

           Jerry sits up, bitterly fixated on the television.  Venezuela
           from Venezuela exits, leaving the remote at Jerry's side.

                                 SETH (ON T.V.)
                        To be honest, Matt, it will actually
                        be my first standalone brand.  My
                        previous line of cards and merchandise
                        was and is still released entirely
                        under the umbrella of Plattitudes, a
                        great company run by my great friend
                        {bleep}.

                        He's the guy who got me started in
                        the business, and without him, I
                        wouldn't be where I am right now.  

                                 MATT LAUER (ON T.V.)
                        Tell me about FlipWordz.

                                 SETH (ON T.V.)
                        We won't be officially up and running
                        until the fall, but FlipWordz is
                        going to be the first ever
                        international brand of greeting cards,
                        online greetings and related
                        merchandise to be produced exclusively
                        for the teenage market...

           An envelope hits Jerry in the face, startling him. 

                                 GERALD (O.S.)
                        Mail call.

           Gerald is standing over the couch, oxygen cart in tow.

                                 GERALD (CONT'D)
                        (re: Seth)
                        Didn't you used to know him?

           Jerry turns off the TV, agitated.
                                 GERALD (CONT'D)
                        I almost threw that out with your
                        latest backlog.  Looks like a wedding
                        invitation.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  My friend Philip.  I'm supposed
                        to be a groomsman.

                                 GERALD
                        "Supposed to"?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm not sure if I'm going.

           Jerry glances out the front window, noticing a TEENAGE STONER
           loitering at the edge of the lawn.  Gerald sees him, too.

                                 GERALD
                        You should.  I have a feeling you
                        could get the time off.

           Gerald moves off.  Jerry looks puzzled...then concerned.

           INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - GARAGE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jerry is tossing aside boxes in a panic, digging to get to
           his marijuana stockpile.  He reaches where it should be...

           And finds AN EMPTY SPACE.  Gerald trashed the stash.

                                 JERRY

           Jerry is on the phone, glassy-eyed with a tumbler of Scotch
           in hand.  His printer is slowly churning out a document.

                                 JERRY
                        What if you had to use a payphone? 
                        Are your coins organized enough for
                        that kind of situation?

           The line goes dead just as Jerry's printer finishes...
           THE SUICIDE CARD, IN ITS COMPLETED FORM.  ITS HEADING READS:
           "LET'S SHARE THE BLAME".

           All is quiet, save for the RHYTHMIC, MECHANICAL "BREATHING"
           of Gerald's negative pressure ventilator, inside of which
           Gerald currently sleeps.

           Standing over him is Jerry, out of his mind.

                                 JERRY
                        You look at me like I'm a

                        the man you are.  I've got news for

                        are.  I took the first thing that
                        came easy to me and made an
                        unreasonably good living at it.  I'm
                        well aware that my contribution to
                        the world was absolute bullshit.  So
                        was yours.  Deep down inside that
                        little black heart of yours, I think
                        you might even know that.  But here's
                        where our lives differ:  I will not
                        ignore the fact that the jig is up. 
                        I tried to keep coasting for a while,
                        sure...but it just wouldn't take. 
                        You called it--props for that.  Props
                        also for your capacity for self-
                        delusion that has allowed you to
                        live with your head in the sand for
                        fucking decades...another talent I
                        did not inherit.

           Jerry raises a BOTTLE OF CARPET SHAMPOO.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        That's why I'm checking out.
                        (removes cap, beat)
                        But I wouldn't feel right doing myself
                        in without first setting my house in
                        order--or in this case, yours.  I'm
                        going to do something for you, Dad,
                        that you should have done for yourself
                        a long time ago.
                        (contemplative pause)
                        I guess I'll see you in hell.

           Jerry leans down and unplugs the ventilator...  Then he
           straightens up and chugs the entire contents of the bottle.
           But...the ventilator is STILL "BREATHING".  And--for the
           first time--we realize that there HAD BEEN ANOTHER SOUND
           occurring in the background.  One that has suddenly STOPPED.

           THE LIGHTS POP ON as Venezuela from Venezuela enters the
           room, looking puzzled.

                                 VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
                        Mister Jerry?  Why you unplug vacuum?

           Jerry pulls the empty bottle away from his lips, chemical
           foam bubbling from his mouth.  Stunned, he looks at the still-
           plugged-in ventilator, then back at Venezuela from Venezuela.

                                 JERRY
                        (gurgle)

           Jerry keels over and dies.

           BLACK OUT.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        Jerry...  Jerry, wake up, honey. 
                        Everyone's waiting.

           FADE IN:

      133C INT. JERRY'S OCEANSIDE MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY
                                                                     133C

           Jerry blinks awake, finding himself tucked into imported
           Italian sheets on what looks like the most comfortable bed
           in history.  Everything--including Jerry's silk pajamas--is
           PRISTINELY WHITE, interrupted only by the SPARKLING BLUE
           WATER seen through the enormous window.

           Daphne--looking like the sexiest woman alive--is sitting on
           the edge of the bed, having nudged Jerry out of his slumber.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Think you slept long enough?

                                 JERRY
                        (overwhelmed)
                        Oh my god, Daphne...you would not
                        believe the dream I had.  My life
                        was just one disaster after
                        another...I was a total failure.  At
                        the end, I killed myself by drinking
                        carpet shampoo.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That's you in a nutshell, baby.  A
                        total failure.
           Daphne leans in, giving Jerry a deep kiss.

      133D EXT. JERRY'S OCEANSIDE MANSION - PATIO -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
                                                                     133D

           There are patios, and then there are patios.  Jerry's is a
           sprawling, multilevel veranda ending in an infinity pool
           that overlooks the beach below.

           Jerry and Daphne step out into a LOW-KEY PARTY in progress. 
           All the HAPPY AND GOOD-LOOKING ATTENDEES REACT in unison to
           Jerry's appearance, raising their glasses in salute.  As
           Daphne leads Jerry through the crowd, FAMILIAR FACES pop up.

                                 PHILIP
                        Nice of you to make it to your own
                        party, Jerry...

                                 MUG
                        Dude, the shrimp is really good.  I
                        keep telling myself I'm going to
                        stop eating it when you run out...but
                        you're not running out of it!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Then keep eating it!

           As Daphne and Jerry approach the end of the balcony, Seth
           looks up from a conversation with some HIGH-SOCIETY TYPES.

                                 SETH
                        This is guy you should be talking
                        to.  He's the social climber.

                                 JERRY
                        Don't listen to him.  I'm already on
                        top.

           Everyone LAUGHS, leading inexplicably into...

      133E EXT. JERRY'S OCEANSIDE MANSION - PATIO -- CONTINUOUS
                                                                     133E

           A CHOREOGRAPHED, KARAOKE-STYLE MUSICAL NUMBER SET TO KANSAS'
           "CARRY ON WAYWARD SON"

           It starts just after the 1:00 mark of the song; EACH MAIN
           CHARACTER GETS TO "SING" INDIVIDUAL PARTS.  Around the 3:00
           mark--while MUG IS "PERFORMING" THE GUITAR SOLO--Jerry and
           Daphne happily leap off the edge of the patio...

           JERRY AND DAPHNE'S SEX-PLUMMET -- Takes on a PSYCHEDELIC
           ATMOSPHERE; wrapped in one another's arms, they effortlessly
           tear away their clothes and begin to make love...
                                 GERALD (O.S.)
                        For God's sake, Jerry!  Let her go!

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

      133F OMITTED
                                                                     133F

      133G INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - MASTER BEDROOM -- DAWN
                                                                     133G

           Venezuela from Venezuela is desperately trying to escape
           Jerry's clutches, as he's turned her lifesaving resuscitation
           of him into a BLUE VOMIT-SOAKED MAKEOUT SESSION.

           Abruptly getting his bearings, Jerry releases Venezuela from
           Venezuela; she scrambles away, MUTTERING PRAYERS IN SPANISH.

           Gerald is awake and on his feet, staring down at Jerry.

                                 GERALD
                        The reason I hire women who look
                        like that, Gerald, is specifically
                        to avoid lawsuits that might arise
                        from just that sort of behavior.

           Gerald heads off after Venezuela from Venezuela.  

           Jerry remains flat on his back, mortified.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

      133H INT. JERRY'S FATHER'S HOME - STORAGE ROOM -- DAY
                                                                     133H

           Jerry lies in bed, watching his DVD of Under Siege.  Margot--
           FURTHER ALONG IN HER PREGNANCY--is seated at his side.

                                 MARGOT
                        So the doctor said no permanent
                        damage.  That's good, huh?

           ON TV -- STEVEN SEAGAL stuffs a rag into a coffee cup, douses
           the rag with what appears to be some type of alcohol and
           fills the cup with water.  He then places the mixture inside
           a microwave oven and starts the timer.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Pretty lucky for you that Venezuela
                        from Venezuela found the card, since
                        she can't read English.

           Jerry tenses, FAST-FORWARDING THROUGH THE DVD.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Even luckier for you that I was the
                        first one she showed it to.
           Margot flips THE SUICIDE CARD onto the bed.

                                 JERRY
                        That's just a work thing.

                                 MARGOT
                        For the job you don't have anymore?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm looking to get back in the game.

                                 MARGOT
                        It's got your name on it.

                                 JERRY
                        So did every other card I wrote.

                                 MARGOT
                        Not on the inside.

           An extended silence.  Jerry PAUSES THE DVD.

                                 JERRY
                        For the sake of argument, let's say
                        that what happened the other night
                        was an attempt to end my own life. 
                        I failed, Margot.  Just like I have
                        at every other fucking thing for
                        what seems like the last thousand
                        years.  Business as usual.

                                 MARGOT
                        Maybe the greeting card thing isn't
                        for you, Jerry.  Or maybe it will
                        be, but it just isn't right now.  In
                        either case--so what?  You're smart,
                        you're talented, and all the setbacks
                        in the world are no reason to give
                        up on life.
                        (beat)
                        Whatever happened with that girl you
                        were seeing?  The waitress?  I thought
                        that was going somewhere.

           Discomfited, Jerry RESUMES THE DVD.  Margot takes the hint.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        I know Dad's expecting you to prove
                        something to him, but fuck that. 
                        The only person you have to prove
                        anything to is yourself.  It's time
                        you figured out what I--and a lot of
                        other people--already know, Jerry...
           ON TV -- TOMMY LEE JONES and GARY BUSEY are arguing in the
           galley when the MICROWAVE BEEPS.  Everyone SCREAMS and dives
           for cover as STEVEN SEAGAL'S HOMEMADE MICROWAVE-BOMB EXPLODES.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        You're a productive person who's got
                        something to give to the world.

           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - COACH CABIN -- DAY

           Jerry has a seatback in his lap, a LAUGHING WOMAN elbowing
           him on one side, a SLEEPING MAN drooling on him on the other
           side and THREE KARATE KIDS pummeling his head from behind.

           But his expression remains blank.  Jerry is the living dead.

      134A EXT. PHILIP'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- DAY
                                                                     134A

           The spacious and extravagant home is an ostentatious testament
           to Philip's success.  Seated at the edge of the diving board
           over the very large pool is Jerry, nursing a can of soda.  

           He begins to let himself very slowly--almost imperceptibly--
           tilt forward.  Closer and closer towards the water...

                                 PHILIP (O.S.)
                        Don't do it!

           Jerry snaps up to see Philip--drunk and smiling--approaching
           with two piña coladas in hand.  

                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        You can't kill yourself without having
                        a real drink first.

           Philip flops down next to Jerry and passes him a cocktail.

                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        I know the missus said you weren't
                        allowed, but she ain't the missus
                        until tomorrow.  The liquor cabinet's
                        still all mine.

           Producing a small key, Philip lays it next to Jerry.

                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        All I ask is that it not be bare
                        when we get back from the honeymoon.

           Jerry frowns, annoyed by the dig.  Philip doesn't notice.
                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        (reflective)
                        Can't believe I'm getting married
                        tomorrow.  Could you ever have
                        imagined, freshman year, that you
                        and I would be sitting here one day? 
                        I have a lot of great things in my
                        life, Jerry.  A lot of great things...

           Jerry is chewing through his straw to bite his tongue.

                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        But do I deserve what I have?  More
                        importantly: do I want it?

                                 JERRY
                        I'll take it off your hands.
                        (then, quickly)
                        Most of it.

                                 PHILIP
                        You ever wonder if the life you're
                        living isn't the one you're supposed
                        to be living?

                                 JERRY
                        Let's see...I used to live in an
                        awesome apartment; now I live at my
                        father's house.  I used to make a
                        living calling my own shots; now I
                        sell coin-storage units over the
                        phone.  I used to have money; now I
                        couldn't afford to stay at a hotel
                        for your wedding.  I used to have
                        friends; now they all think I'm a
                        fucking joke.

                                 PHILIP
                        Nobody thinks you're a joke, Jerry--

                                 JERRY
                        I don't wonder if I'm living the
                        wrong life, Philip.  I know I am. 
                        It's proven by every second of my
                        miserable existence.

                                 PHILIP
                        Everyone's got problems.

                                 JERRY
                        (scoffs)
                        I'm the only one sitting here who
                        has any.
                                 PHILIP
                        (angered)
                        You know what, Jerry?  You couldn't
                        even imagine the problems in my life.

           Jerry stares at Philip in disbelief.

                                 JERRY
                        You're joking, right?
                        (beat; slow burn)
                        I don't have to imagine your life,
                        Philip--because it used to me mine. 
                        And there were no problems.  It was
                        a fucking cakewalk!  In fact...

           Jerry stands up, his anger getting the better of him.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        You don't deserve what you have! 
                        Your whole life is the result of
                        blind fucking luck!

           Philip rises, his emotional level matching Jerry's.

                                 PHILIP
                        And your life is, what--the fruits
                        of hard labor?

           Jerry looks like he could punch Philip in the face...but he
           holds back, taking on a false air of calmness.

                                 JERRY
                        And there it is.  I'm one of "those
                        people" now.  The people who--unlike
                        you, and Seth, and Mug--actually
                        know what it feels like to not get
                        every single thing you want.

           Jerry makes his way towards the door.

                                 PHILIP
                        You think we've gotten everything we
                        wanted, Jerry?  You think I have??

                                 JERRY
                        (stops, wheels around)
                        What haven't you got, Philip?!  What
                        the fuck haven't you got??

           Philip suddenly falls silent, looking over Jerry's shoulder.

           Jerry turns to see Unpleasant Fiancé--a gargoyle of skin,
           hair and nail treatments-in-progress--in the doorway.
                                 UNPLEASANT FIANCÉ
                        What the fuck is going on out here?!

                                 PHILIP
                        (cowed)
                        I'm sorry, sweetie.

                                 JERRY
                        I'm sorry too, sweetie.  Rest assured,
                        I will behave cordially tomorrow, so
                        as not to ruin your magical day.  
                        (to Philip)
                        Then I'll disappear into history as
                        one of the unlucky ones.

                                 PHILIP
                        Jerry, wait...

           Jerry heads inside, flashing the liquor cabinet key to
           Unpleasant Fiancé as he slides past her.

                                 JERRY
                        Got your booze, Yoko...

                                 PHILIP
                        (desperate)
                        I'm trying to be honest with you!

           But Jerry is gone.

                                 REVEREND (O.S.)
                        You may kiss the bride.

           INT. CATHEDRAL -- AFTERNOON

           Philip--in a tuxedo--and Unpleasant Fiancé--in a bridal gown--
           smooch before a REVEREND.  Behind them, the place is PACKED
           BEYOND SIGHT.  Might as well be a Kennedy wedding.

           As everyone APPLAUDS, Philip and Unpleasant Fiancé--now
           UNPLEASANT WIFE--bask in the attention.

           Off to the side are Philip's tuxedoed GROOMSMEN--Seth, Mug,
           and Jerry among them--all clapping and smiling.  Some of
           them fake-smiling.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - DINING AREA -- NIGHT

           "Grand and ostentatious" is the theme, evident from the scope
           of the hall to the last detail of the flatware.  Formalities
           have been attended to and the party is in full swing--i.e.,
           everyone's drunk.
           Seated away from the center of the action, Jerry and Seth
           are kicking back with a couple of beers, taking it all in.

                                 SETH
                        How long are you staying out here?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm leaving tomorrow.

           They both sip their beers.  Moments pass.

                                 SETH
                        I'm out of town the next two days. 
                        Would it be at all possible for you
                        to extend your trip until Tuesday? 
                        I want to take you to lunch, talk to
                        you about something.

                                 JERRY
                        What did I do?

                                 SETH
                        It's nothing bad.  I'm just too drunk
                        to get into it right now, not to
                        mention the fact that I've got a
                        seven a.m. flight tomorrow.
                        (checks watch, dismayed)
                        Holy shit.

                                 JERRY
                        (looking O.S., stunned)
                        Holy shit.

           Jerry has spotted a WAITRESS across the room...

           A waitress who is DAPHNE.

                                 SETH
                        So you think you could you stay in
                        town for a couple extra days?

                                 JERRY
                        (inspired, re: Daphne)
                        Uh...yeah.  Definitely.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - FOYER -- LATER

           Outside the dining area, the wide central hall leading to
           the main entrance is intersected by two smaller passageways:
           one hosting the public restrooms, the other leading to the
           kitchen and trafficked exclusively by STAFF MEMBERS.

           Jerry is lingering outside the former, a glass of champagne
           in his hand.  Soon enough, Daphne emerges from the latter.
                                 JERRY
                        Miss, I have a complaint.  I think
                        someone's been watering down this
                        champagne.

           Needing only a beat to mask her obvious surprise, Daphne
           matter-of-factly approaches Jerry.  She takes the flute from
           him, downs its contents, and hands back the empty glass.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What champagne?

                                 JERRY
                        I have a second complaint.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (re: tuxedo)
                        You were in this wedding?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, you met my friend Philip.  I
                        was one of his groomsmen.

                                 DAPHNE
                        (beat, confused)
                        I thought he was...
                        (then)
                        Is that guy Mug here?

                                 JERRY
                        (oblivious)
                        I saw you a little while ago and I
                        couldn't believe it.  I can't believe
                        it.  What are the odds we'd run into
                        each other like this?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Don't take this the wrong way, Jerry,
                        but I didn't have the odds of you
                        being alive as very good.
                        (then)
                        I got your message you left on
                        Christmas Eve.

           A beat.  Jerry isn't quick enough to cover his blank stare.

                                 DAPHNE (CONT'D)
                        You don't remember leaving me a
                        message on Christmas Eve...  

                                 JERRY
                        Daphne, I did a lot of things wrong.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        I was all fucked up; I didn't treat
                        you nearly as well as I should have. 
                        Not even close.  But not a day has
                        gone by when I haven't thought about
                        you.  And now, running into you like
                        this...at the risk of sounding
                        cheesy...I think it's fate.

           Jerry and Daphne lock eyes, hopeful.

                                 DAPHNE
                        No.

           Daphne looks as surprised as Jerry does at her own response.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay, "fate" might be too strong a
                        term.  What I'm saying is, this is
                        our second chance.

                                 DAPHNE
                        It might be your second chance.  But
                        it would be my, like...thirtieth.  

                                 JERRY
                        I said I was sorry...

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, you didn't.

                                 JERRY
                        (beat)
                        Okay, well, I'm saying it now.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Thanks.  But you and I are long past
                        apologies, Jerry.  That ship sailed
                        after the first hundred times I tried
                        to reach you and heard nothing back...

                                 JERRY
                        So if we're past apologies...

                                 DAPHNE
                        ...Where the hell were you?

                                 JERRY
                        ...Where are we?

           A heavy silence.

           Then Daphne abruptly steps forward, wrapping Jerry in a loving
           embrace.  A goodbye-forever embrace.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Promise me, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Promise you what?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Promise what you don't know.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.  I promise.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You just promised to take care of
                        yourself...
                        (beat, choking up)
                        And to never call me again.

           Daphne moves off faster than ripping off a Band-Aid, making
           sure not to look back as she disappears around a corner.

           And Jerry simply stands alone...looking like he could put a
           bullet in his head that very second.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           OMITTED

           EXT. UPSCALE DINER -- DAY

           It's pouring rain on the hip little joint and the rest of
           the world.

           INT. UPSCALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Jerry--staring at the rain--is at a window table with Seth.

                                 SETH
                        I'm really excited about FlipWordz. 
                        You know the kind of stuff we thought
                        we were going to be doing when we
                        started working for {bleep}?
                        (no response)
                        Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        (blinks out of reverie)
                        Things that require thought and aren't
                        completely patronizing and clichéd?

                                 SETH
                        That's what it's going to be.
                                 JERRY
                        How did Fat Asshole ever allow you
                        to break away with such a plan? 
                        It's contrary to everything he knows.

                                 SETH
                        I made him a lot of money at
                        Plattitudes.  And, due to the fact
                        that he staked me in FlipWordz, he's
                        going to get a big piece of the pie.

                                 JERRY
                        He's still going to be making money
                        from your company?

                                 SETH
                        Only up to a predetermined ceiling
                        of net profit.  We're projecting
                        that it'll be mine, free and clear,
                        after the first year.  The important
                        thing is that I'm going to have
                        complete artistic control from the
                        get-go.  Speaking of which...

           Seth finishes a bite of his lunch and wipes his hands.  

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        I was wondering if you'd want to
                        come work for me.

           JERRY -- Is stunned.

                                 JERRY
                        Like...as a janitor?

                                 SETH
                        More like running a creative division.

                                 JERRY
                        Are you shitting me?

                                 SETH
                        You're the most talented out of all
                        of us, Jerry.  You always have been.

                                 JERRY
                        I live with my dad and I sell coin
                        storage units for a living.

                                 SETH
                        You're also the laziest out of all
                        of us, and always have been.
                                 JERRY
                        Your compliments are confusing...

                                 SETH
                        I didn't come here to compliment
                        you, Jerry.  I came here to offer
                        you a job.  And if you accept it--
                        even though you'll be coming in at a
                        high level--I'll be watching you
                        more closely than I'll watch mailroom
                        employees.  

                                 JERRY
                        That's harsh.

                                 SETH
                        I've got a lot on the line, here. 
                        If you're afraid of getting your
                        feelings hurt, walk away.  But I'd
                        like to think that you're willing to
                        stop coasting, get back on the rails
                        and seriously apply your talent--
                        maybe for the first time ever.

           Jerry sits back, thoughtful.

                                 JERRY
                        You already have mailroom employees?

                                 SETH
                        Not yet, actually.

                                 JERRY
                        (beat, smiles)
                        Good.  I want to be the first one to
                        fire one of those lazy bastards.

           Jerry leans forward and clasps hands with Seth, who grins.

                                 SETH
                        Cancel that return flight.  We've
                        got a lot of work to do.  And go buy
                        yourself some new clothes, while
                        you're at it--on the company tab, of
                        course.  Try to took professional.

           They both LAUGH.  Jerry's happier than we've ever seen him.

           And just like that...outside, THE RAIN STOPS.  Jerry and
           Seth look out the window in surprise as the sun is already
           starting to break through the clouds.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        That was a close one.
           INT. DESIGNER MEN'S STORE -- DAY

           Jerry is being fitted by a TAILOR for a suit, talking on his
           cell phone.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        What the hell was I thinking, ever
                        considering suicide?  I was the guy
                        for whom things always just worked
                        out!

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Seriously, Mom, this is the break
                        I've been waiting for for years...

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK -- LATER

           Jerry navigates the CROWDED sidewalk with a spring in his
           step, looking dapper in his brand-new designer suit.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        All that bad stuff that happened to
                        me?  That was like a test. 

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (to phone)
                        I'll be honest with you, Margot,
                        things were pretty bad for a while...

           EXT. CITY STREET CORNER -- LATER

           Jerry stands at an intersection, on the phone, standing with
           a CROWD as they wait for the light to change.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        I had to let all that terrible shit
                        happen so I would appreciate it when
                        the good shit came back around.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        ...When he wakes up, Venezuela, you
                        tell him that I said I'm a wiser man
                        for the experience.  Okay?  Thanks.

           Jerry pockets his phone, pleased as punch.  Unlike the CROSS-
           SECTION OF HUMANITY he's at the center of, he looks exactly
           like a person for whom all is right with the world.

           A passing car zooms through a puddle, soaking everyone except
           for Jerry...who miraculously remains bone dry.

           As the other people stagger back from the curb, stunned and
           furious, Jerry turns to face them with a shrug and a smile.
                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Good things just happen to me.

           ANGLE ON THE OTHERS: THE BUSINESSWOMAN, THE DELIVERY BOY,
           THE MOTHER, THE VAGRANT, ET AL, ALL STARING IN DISBELIEF.

           Then A BLUR OF ANOTHER CAR CUTS THROUGH FRAME, PUMMELING THE
           O.S. JERRY AND CRASHING HORRIBLY.  Everyone reacts, horrified.  

           Everyone, that is, but the VAGRANT...who smiles.

           BLACK OUT.

           GRADUALLY FADING UP is the HIGH-PITCHED WHINE of JERRY'S
           HEART MONITOR FLATLINING.

                        Clear!

           The ZAP-THUMP of the defibrillator paddles against Jerry's
           chest...then the CONTINUOUS BEEP becomes BROKEN UP.

                                 ER NURSE #1 (O.S.)

           P.O.V. JERRY - FADING IN AND OUT:

           We're staring directly up into a harsh fluorescent light on
           the ceiling as the quickly-moving, BLURRY HEADS AND HANDS OF
           DOCTORS AND NURSES pop in and out of view from all sides.

           FADE TO BLACK.

                                                       FADE BACK IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Jerry is in bed, propped up and monstrously fucked-up.  His
           swollen face is black and purple and covered with abrasions;
           his jaw is wired shut; a feeding tube is secured to his mouth. 
           Everything down one side of his body--arm, hip and leg--is
           immobilized in large braces with pins sticking out.  

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        Stupid and irritating people would
                        say that I'm lucky to be alive.  But
                        that sentiment only applies to
                        individuals who hadn't received a
                        new lease on life less than an hour
                        before they were almost killed.

           Jerry's good hand gives a couple of clicks on the morphine
           button to which he's hooked up.

           Mug is standing near the far wall, having affixed a mini-
           basketball hoop like the one from Jerry's old office.  He
           takes a practice shot, and the hoop falls.

                                 MUG
                        (losing it)
                        Fuck!
                        (then)
                        I'm sorry, Jerry--I can't fucking
                        deal with this anymore!  I'm sorry...

           Mug storms out of the room.  Jerry looks confused.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Jerry's still bedridden, though his facial wounds have
           improved somewhat and the pins have been removed from his 
           various body braces.  His jaw is still wired shut.  An
           unfamiliar, UPTIGHT MALE LAWYER is seated at his side.

                                 STRANGE LAWYER
                        As you know, the man who struck you--
                        who was killed in the accident--was
                        uninsured.  We have since discovered
                        that he had no viable assets, income,
                        or even any next of kin that could
                        be required to compensate you for
                        the damages incurred.  Theoretically,
                        you could file a claim against the
                        city, but Bambi feels that it would
                        be imprudent of her to move forward
                        on any new cases for you until you
                        have settled up your outstanding
                        debts with our office.  I don't
                        suppose you could write a check now...

           Jerry stares stonefaced at the lawyer, clicking his morphine
           button a few times.

                                 STRANGE LAWYER (CONT'D)
                        In any case, Bambi is terribly upset
                        that she hasn't been able to visit
                        you yet.  I was authorized to purchase
                        this for you at the gift shop...

           The lawyer reaches into a bag at his feet, producing a small
           stuffed bear with the phrase "HUGS" stitched onto its belly.

                                 STRANGE LAWYER (CONT'D)
                        Which Bambi would like to represent
                        a proxy hug on her behalf.

           Jerry snatches the bear, clutching it to his chest.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        If nothing else, I can take solace
                        in the fact that this is a bad as
                        things are going to get for me.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING

           Jerry--his jaw wire finally removed and his facial wounds
           even more cleared up--is asleep.  He blinks awake...

           Finding himself nose-to-nose with a grinning Fat Asshole.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        (overly enthusiastic)
                        WHAT'S UP, MOTHERFUCKER!
           LAUGHING at Jerry's horrified reaction, Fat Asshole backs
           up, taking a seat.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry I came so early, but it's the
                        only time I could fit you in.  So I
                        heard you just got the jaw unlocked. 
                        You've been eating liquid food this
                        whole fucking time, dude?  That's
                        woebegone.

           Jerry musters a condescending grin.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        (abruptly angered)
                        Fuck you, man.  I was just trying to
                        keep the mood light, here, 'cause of
                        why I came.

           Jerry looks concerned.  A pause.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        The thing with Seth isn't happening.

           JERRY -- Couldn't find the words even if he could speak.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE (CONT'D)
                        Due to your medical condition, it's
                        not financially advisable for Seth
                        to have you on staff.  It's a startup,
                        so he needs everybody operating at a
                        hundred percent.  I know it seems
                        harsh, J-Dog, but what are you gonna
                        do?  It's a real woebegone situation.

           Jerry's eye is twitching.  Rigid, he begins clicking his
           morphine button with a vengeance.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           It's the dead of night and Jerry is wide awake, rhythmically
           clicking his morphine button:  He's doped out of his mind.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        Once you've given up on life, the
                        worst thing you can do is reconsider. 
                        Because if the first fall is a long
                        one...the second one is forever.

           Just to the side of Jerry's bed is a LARGE WINDOW looks out
           into the HALLWAY.  Quite inexplicably, the window appears to
           BRIEFLY FLASH WITH STATIC, as though it were a TV SCREEN.  
           Even more inexplicably, the next STATIC FLASH gives way to a
           SPLIT-SECOND GLIMPSE of STEVEN SEAGAL PERFORMING A ROUNDHOUSE
           KICK.

           Jerry turns to look at the window--or, as it happens...

           HIS MORPHINE-ADDLED SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS INTERACTIVE DISPLAY.

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- SETH, PHILIP, MUG, FAT ASSHOLE, DAPHNE
           and GERALD are all POINTING AND LAUGHING at Jerry.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        What are you laughing at?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You, loser.  Everybody knew you'd
                        fail.

                                 FAT ASSHOLE
                        I told everyone you would.  And I
                        was right.

           Everyone LAUGHS HARDER.

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up!

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- Suddenly it's just STEVEN SEAGAL.

                                 STEVEN SEAGAL
                        Make them.

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- Suddenly it's just TOM BRADY, looking
           sexy as all get-out as he lights a cigarette.

                                 TOM BRADY
                        They told me about you.

                                 JERRY
                        I don't think you can smoke in here...

                                 TOM BRADY
                        I can do whatever the fuck I want. 
                        I took over your life.

                                 JERRY
                        Who are you?

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- It's just Steven Seagal, showing off
           some karate moves with a very angry face.

           FLASH -- Then it's just Tom Brady again, smoking and grinning.
                                 TOM BRADY
                        I'm Tim 'Ace' Jones.

                                 JERRY
                        Bullshit.

           DAPHNE SLIDES UP INTO VIEW alongside Brady, wiping her mouth.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don't know, Jerry.  His cock sure
                        tastes like it.

                                 JERRY
                        (horrified)
                        Oh my god!

           Tom Brady and Daphne POINT AT JERRY AND LAUGH MANIACALLY.

           Jerry struggles to leave his bed, without success.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Get the fuck away from her!

                                 TOM BRADY
                        FUCK YOU!  I'M TIM 'ACE' JONES!

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- Suddenly it's just Gerald.

                                 GERALD
                        I told you so.

           FLASH -- Then it's Seth, Philip and Mug, all smoking cigars
           and LAUGHING as they THROW PILES OF MONEY AROUND.

                                 SETH
                        Where's yours, Jerry?

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah, Jerry...where is yours?

           FLASH -- Then it's just Steven Seagal.

                                 STEVEN SEAGAL
                        Make them pay.

                                 JERRY
                        What?  Who?

           FLASH -- Then it's FAT ASSHOLE, LAUGHING and RUBBING MONEY
           ALL OVER HIS BODY as TOM BRADY AND DAPHNE DANCE AROUND HIM.

           FLASH -- Then it's just Steven Seagal.
                                 STEVEN SEAGAL
                        The ones who did this to you.

           FLASH -- Then it's just Daphne.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I love it when anyone but you fucks
                        me.

                                 JERRY
                        God dammit!

           FLASH -- Then it's Seth, Philip, Mug and Tom Brady, all
           SMOKING CIGARS and LAUGHING.

                                 TOM BRADY
                        Best friends forever!  You might as
                        well be dead!

                                 JERRY
                        FUCK YOU!

                                 SETH
                        You mean he's not?

           Everyone outside the window LAUGHS HARDER.

           FLASH -- Then it's just Daphne, looking forlorn.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I loved you, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        I loved you!  I think I still do!

           Daphne presses herself up against the glass, lustful.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Kiss me.

           Jerry begins violently yanking his whole bed towards the
           window, straining to hop it towards the imaginary Daphne. 
           Just as he's about to reach her...

           FLASH -- It's just Steven Seagal.

                                 STEVEN SEAGAL
                        You know what you have to do.

           Startled, Jerry flails off of the bed and onto the floor.

           END MORPHINE-ADDLED SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS INTERACTIVE DISPLAY.
           His face squished against the linoleum, Jerry mutters
           incoherently as he drifts into unconsciousness.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Jerry is free of his casts and braces, seated in a wheelchair
           by the window.  In his arms he holds his BABY NEPHEW.  

           Margot is seated in a chair next to Jerry.

                                 MARGOT
                        Has the physical therapy helped?

           Jerry shrugs.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        You've got to at least be excited
                        about getting out of here.

                                 JERRY
                        I've got nowhere to go.

                                 MARGOT
                        I thought you were staying with your
                        friend Philip and his wife.

                                 JERRY
                        Not for long.  

                                 MARGOT
                        What's the plan after that?

                                 JERRY
                        I'm so grateful that you guys came
                        out to see me.  I know it wasn't
                        easy, traveling with the baby and
                        everything--and you, Will, getting
                        the time off work...  

           WILL -- Futzing with the TV, gives a "don't mention it" wave.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        It meant a lot to me to see somebody
                        from my family.

           Margot takes the baby from Jerry and hands him to Will.

                                 WILL
                        (to Jerry)
                        Hang in there, pal.  We'll see you
                        soon.
           Will exits with the baby.

                                 MARGOT
                        I've had a couple things with me
                        this whole time, but I promised I'd
                        wait until I was leaving before I
                        gave them to you.

           Margot reaches into a bag at her feet, producing a large,
           oblong, gift-wrapped box.  She holds it out for Jerry.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        From Dad.  It's probably going to
                        make you mad, but you have to
                        understand that he really thinks
                        it's a nice gesture.

           Reluctantly, Jerry takes the gift.  He tears away the paper
           and opens the box, revealing...

           GERALD'S ORNATELY DESIGNED CANE -- The very same one from
           Jerry's childhood.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        You are going to need something for
                        walking around...and, I mean, that's
                        better than a crutch, right?

                                 JERRY
                        Is the other thing worse or better?

           Margot gets to her feet and gathers her belongings, a simple
           greeting card envelope cinched in her fingers.  She bends
           down to give Jerry a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

                                 MARGOT
                        Love you, Jerry.

           She straightens up, having left the envelope in Jerry's lap.

                                 MARGOT (CONT'D)
                        Everybody does.  In their own way.

           With that, Margot leaves.

           Alone, Jerry stares at the envelope.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Jerry is sitting up in bed, staring worriedly at the still-
           unopened envelope, on which HIS NAME IS WRITTEN IN A FEMININE
           HAND.  Slowly and indecisively, Jerry peels it open.
           He removes the greeting card, and begins to read it...

                                 JERRY'S MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Jerry.  It rips my heart out that I
                        haven't been able to be by your side
                        since the accident.  As soon as I
                        found out about it, I started making
                        plans to come see you.  But when I
                        called the hospital about sending
                        something ahead for you, I found out
                        some very scary news that only made
                        what happened that much worse...

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        It hadn't even occurred to me that
                        I'd lost my health insurance when I
                        got fired from Plattitudes.

           As he continues to read, Jerry looks increasingly nauseated.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        My mother had taken out a loan and
                        gotten a second job to pay her thirty-
                        year-old son's hospital bills.  Not
                        only did that keep her from having
                        the time to come out and see me, she
                        couldn't afford it.  She never even
                        told my dad...who could have paid
                        easily.

           Jerry begins to CRY, reading the last of the note...

                                 JERRY'S MOTHER (V.O.)
                        I hope you can forgive me, Jerry,
                        for not being there for you in person. 
                        This was not an easy decision to
                        make, and I wish more than anything
                        that I could have done both.  I love
                        you with all my heart, and I hope to
                        see you soon.  Love, Mom.

           Jerry drops the card in his lap, now SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY. 
           All the shitty things that have happened to him, all the
           things he's done wrong, a lifetime of holding it in...it's
           all pouring out now.

           He happens to glance at the back of the card, which has
           flipped over in his lap.  It's a "PLATTITUDES" card...and
           the author "signature" belongs to:

           "ACE".

           JERRY -- Stops crying on a dime, his expression of sadness
           and release replaced by one of insane rage.
           AT THE HALLWAY WINDOW -- An inexplicable FLASH OF LIGHTNING,
           and there stands STEVEN SEAGAL, staring at Jerry and nodding: 
           You know what must be done.

           JERRY -- Nods back at Steven Seagal, a maniacal glint in his
           eye:  Fuck yeah, I do.

                                                             CUT TO:

           Jerry, dressed in the suit he was wearing when he got hit by
           the car--it's badly torn in several places and still showing
           traces of blood stains--pimp-walks through the parking lot
           with purpose, relying on HIS FATHER'S CANE.

           ...On his shoulder, he carries A MICROWAVE OVEN.

           INT. PLATTITUDES - FAT ASSHOLE'S OFFICE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jerry sweeps clear some space on the desk in the otherwise
           unoccupied office and sets the microwave on it.  

           He opens its door and removes a bottle of alcohol, a jug of
           water, a rag and a coffee mug: the ingredients for the Steven
           Seagal Under Siege microwave bomb.

           Jerry assembles the concoction in the mug, and places it
           back in the oven.  He checks his watch, trying to figure out
           how much time to put on the clock...when his eyes happen to
           fall upon THE WORD-A-DAY DESK CALENDAR.

                                 JERRY
                        Please be something having to do
                        with vengeance or retribution...

           Jerry grabs the calendar, seeing that--

           THE WORD OF THE DAY IS: "GLABROUS (adj.) -- Smooth; having a
           surface without hairs, projections, or any unevenness."

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (beat, shrugs)
                        Whatever.

           Jerry places the calendar on top of the microwave and sets
           the oven timer for 15 minutes. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?
           Jerry freezes, not turning around.

                                 JERRY
                        {Bleep}?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        No.  I'm Tim.

           ON JERRY -- As fireballs explode behind his eyes.

                                 JERRY
                        TIM 'ACE'--

           Jerry wheels around, finding himself face-to-face with TIM
           "ACE" JONES (40s)--a small-statured gentleman with a shy and
           pleasant demeanor...a superstar quarterback, he is not. 

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (rage derailed)
                        ...Jones?

                                 MAN/TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        How'd you know that?

                                 JERRY
                        (pause; searching)
                        I'm very familiar with the company. 
                        I'm their microwave oven supplier.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        Does {bleep} owe you money or
                        something?  'Cause that 'Under Siege'
                        microwave bomb isn't gonna work.

           Jerry attempts to stifle his surprise.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES (CONT'D)
                        You set the timer for fifteen minutes,
                        which is when {bleep} would normally
                        get back from lunch.  But even if
                        you could predict the exact time
                        that a homemade bomb like that is
                        going to explode--which you can't--
                        the mixture's going to detonate way
                        before then. 

                                 JERRY
                        (playing dumb)
                        A bomb...?  'Under Siege'...?  

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        Steven Seagal did set the timer for
                        fifteen minutes, but you've neglected 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES (CONT'D)
                        to account for the fact he turned
                        the power off when he left the galley. 
                        When Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey
                        came into the galley later, they
                        turned the power back on and then
                        the bomb exploded.

           The two men stare at the running microwave, ponderous.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES (CONT'D)
                        It's a pretty good movie.  

                                 JERRY
                        If you view it ironically.
                        (then)
                        Why aren't you at lunch with everyone
                        else?

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        I never go out to lunch.  Way too
                        busy.

                                 JERRY
                        (scoffs)
                        At this job?

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        I know it sounds stupid, but writing
                        greeting cards is the only thing
                        I've ever wanted to do in my life. 
                        Problem was, I never used to be much
                        good at it.  Not to say that I'm
                        great at it now...but I'm getting
                        better every day.  Or at least I'm
                        trying to every day.

                                 JERRY
                        You were good enough to get a job at
                        this place.  Take a fucking lunch
                        break once in a while.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        I don't want to get complacent. 
                        I've worked too hard to let myself
                        take things for granted.  The way I
                        see it, if you make your living doing
                        something that always comes easy to
                        you...you're not doing it right.

           ON JERRY -- As that hits him like a ton of bricks.
           A HISSING SOUND emanates from the microwave.  Tim 'Ace' Jones
           grabs Jerry and pulls him to the floor as the microwave bomb
           EXPLODES, blasting debris everywhere.

           Jerry and Tim poke their heads up, surveying the damage. 
           Shreds of the word-a-day calendar float gently in the air.

                                 JERRY
                        Thanks, Tim.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        Call me "Ace".

                                 JERRY
                        No thanks, Tim.

           Both of the guys get to their feet.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        Too bad {bleep} didn't get to see
                        this happen.  Guy's a real asshole.

           Jerry smiles, loving Tim 'Ace' Jones.

                                 JERRY
                        I should split before he gets back.

                                 TIM 'ACE' JONES
                        I don't think he's coming back today. 
                        There was some kind of accident with
                        one of the guys who works here.  I
                        didn't get the details before
                        everybody took off, but apparently
                        it's pretty bad.

                                 JERRY
                        (alarmed)
                        Which guy?

      152A OMITTED
                                                                     152A

           EXT. PHILIP'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- DAY

           (MUSIC:  DEVOTCHKA'S "THE LAST BEAT OF MY HEART")

           SLOW-MOTION:

           Mug, Seth and Fat Asshole come running around from the front,
           finding the backyard to be a crime scene.  POLICE OFFICERS
           and PARAMEDICS roam among NEIGHBORS that have wandered over.  

           Mug, Seth and Fat Asshole head straight for the pool area,
           which has been cordoned off with police tape.  All three of
           them react in abject horror to the sight of:
           PHILIP'S BODY, in nothing but swimming trunks, floating face
           down in the water.  An upturned drink glass floats near him.

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        "Accidental drowning" was the official
                        word.

           MUG -- Falls to his knees, pulling at his hair.  His mouth
           opens in an anguished scream that we cannot hear.  His eyes
           wander across the pool, seeking out--

           UNPLEASANT WIFE.  She's standing by the back door with some
           FRIENDS and a couple of DETECTIVES, her mascara having run
           down her face in now-tried tears.  As she exhales a stream
           of cigarette smoke, her eyes meet Mug's.

                                 JERRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But we'll always call it something
                        else.

           Mug leaps to his feet, charging at Philip's widow.  Seth and
           Fat Asshole grab Mug before he can get to her; POLICE OFFICERS
           intervene.  Mug strains to break free, a raging madman.

           UNPLEASANT WIDOW -- Stares blankly back at Mug, unaffected. 
           Takes another drag of her cigarette.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY

           Unpleasant Widow, now dressed in mourning clothes, is still
           wearing the same expression, staring O.S. at someone.  But
           now the someone staring back at her is--

           JERRY.  He's standing at the lectern, about to deliver a
           eulogy to the PACKED HOUSE at Philip's funeral.

           Jerry reaches into his jacket pocket, starting to pull out
           some folded papers--his prepared remarks.  But he appears to
           have second thoughts, taking his hand off them.  He's going
           to speak from his heart.

           But then...eyeing the crowd, Jerry thinks better of it.  He
           produces his speech, and begins to read from it.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. PHILIP'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           Jerry is seated apart from EVERYONE AT THE FUNERAL RECEPTION,
           not drinking, not knowing what do with himself.  He looks
           through the glass doors that open to the backyard.
           P.O.V. JERRY:  The backyard is clear of any people, save for
           the ONE GUY seated on the diving board...

           Who happens to be PHILIP.

           (END MUSIC.)

           EXT. PHILIP'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry comes limping with the cane out of the house, a glass
           of Scotch in his hand.

                                 JERRY
                        You can't kill yourself without having
                        a real drink first.

           Philip looks up, giving Jerry a halfhearted smile.  Jerry
           sits down next to Philip, handing him the glass.

                                 PHILIP
                        Nice eulogy.

                                 JERRY
                        You know what I thought?  I really
                        thought I was going to have one of
                        those dramatic moments where the guy
                        has prepared remarks to give, and
                        then at the last second, he throws
                        them aside and gives a heroic speech
                        from the heart.

                                 PHILIP
                        If anybody knew how to really speak
                        from the heart, guys like you and me
                        would be out of business.

                                 JERRY
                        You and me are out of business.

                                 PHILIP
                        Easy for you to say.

           A painful pause.

                                 JERRY
                        I shouldn't have walked away from
                        you, Philip.  Maybe if I had stayed,
                        maybe if I'd listened to you...

                                 PHILIP
                        You could've sat out here with me
                        until the cows came home and I might
                        never have said what I'd wanted to 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PHILIP (CONT'D)
                        say.  And even if I had...it was
                        already too late.

                                 JERRY
                        If I'd been a better friend to you,
                        it never would have gotten that far.

                                 PHILIP
                        You were working with limited
                        information, Jerry.
                        (then)
                        Why am I trying to make you feel
                        better?  Who's the dead one here?  

                                 JERRY
                        I was, until a couple days ago.  At
                        least that's how I saw it--and how I
                        wanted everyone else to see it.  My
                        problems were the worst problems in
                        the world, Philip.  There was no one
                        on earth who was suffering as I was
                        suffering...especially not my friends.

                                 PHILIP
                        And we weren't.  Problems are like
                        snowflakes.  Except...horrible.

                                 JERRY
                        Things go so right for so long, you're
                        not equipped to handle it when there's
                        a bump in the road.  So you ignore
                        it, which drives you right into
                        another bump, then another, and
                        another, and the next thing you know--

                                 PHILIP
                        You're a corpse, floating facedown
                        in your own pool?

                                 JERRY
                        I was going to say "you're driven
                        right off the road", but the song
                        remains the same. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Mine was more topical.

                                 JERRY
                        Abandoned the theme, though--
                        (regroups)
                        Point is...we were close friends who
                        didn't really know each other.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        And I think that's because our entire
                        friendship was based on the good
                        times.  Neither of us--none of us,
                        including Mug and Seth--were ever
                        willing or able to deal with the bad
                        times.  So when things went bad,
                        individually--and boy, did they go
                        bad--all any of us could do was turn
                        inward.

                                 PHILIP
                        Didn't want to ruin the party.

                                 JERRY
                        We were so full of shit, Philip.  We
                        made our living compressing the range
                        of human emotion into brightly-
                        colored, easily digestible single
                        servings available for three-forty-
                        nine apiece.  And the better somebody
                        gets at that--and we were fucking
                        good--the less capable a person makes
                        himself of facing anything that
                        doesn't have a gift-wrapped,
                        guaranteed satisfactory result. 
                        Whether it's something that makes us
                        unhappy, something we're afraid of...

           Jerry follows Philip's gaze into the house, finding UNPLEASANT
           WIDOW.  Stepping in to block her from view is MUG.

                                 PHILIP
                        Something we really want.

           JERRY -- Is floored by his realization.

                                 JERRY
                        Holy shit.  That's what Daphne was
                        talking about!

                                 PHILIP
                        Smart girl, that Daphne.  Probably
                        shouldn't have fucked that one up.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, you think?

           Jerry and Philip LAUGH as Philip finishes his drink.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Jerry?
           Jerry looks up to see that Seth and Mug have come outside. 
           He turns back to Philip...

           Finding only A FULL GLASS OF SCOTCH sitting next to him.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Can I talk to you for a minute?

           EXT. FLIPWORDZ BUILDING -- AFTERNOON

           Seth's new company.  Prime real estate; cutting edge
           architecture just being finished.

           OMITTED

      158A INT. FLIPWORDZ - ELEVATOR -- SAME
                                                                     158A

           Seth, Mug and Jerry--still with the cane--are ascending.

                                 MUG
                        I still say it's bullshit.  At least
                        one of you guys didn't know.

                                 JERRY
                        I didn't know until late in the game,
                        but I did know before you told us.

                                 SETH
                        I'd known for so long that I'd almost
                        forgotten about it.

                                 MUG
                        And you never said anything.

                                 JERRY
                        He never told me, either.

           The elevator DINGS, having reached the top floor.

                                 SETH
                        I'm a self-involved bastard.  That's
                        what has brought us here today.

           The doors open onto:

      158B INT. FLIPWORDZ - CREATIVE EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS
                                                                     158B

           The ultra-modern, expansive space has been partially divided
           into three identical offices--all of which are stocked with
           pristine, top-of-the line furnishings and materials.

                                 SETH
                        I call middle.  Work it out between
                        yourselves who gets either side. 
           Jerry and Mug react, flabbergasted.

                                 SETH (CONT'D)
                        Philip has put everything in
                        perspective...as Mug can certainly
                        attest to.
                        (then)
                        It was {bleep}'s idea to rescind
                        your job offer when you were in the
                        hospital, Jerry--not mine.  But what's
                        truly awful about that is the fact
                        that I let him talk me into it without
                        a fight.  I'm ashamed of myself.  I
                        want to set things right, focus on
                        what's important.  You, me and Mug,
                        on our own--like it always should
                        have been.  

                                 MUG
                        This is unbelievable, Seth.

                                 SETH
                        This is just the beginning.  The
                        three of us are going to turn the
                        industry on its head.  Anything you
                        guys need, it's yours.

           Jerry limps over towards a large sketch easel, fully equipped
           with full catalog of writing instruments.

                                 JERRY
                        I've never actually owned one of
                        these.  Always did my work on scraps
                        of paper and cocktail napkins...
                        (then, looking up)
                        Mug's right.  This is unbelievable. 
                        This company is going to be great. 
                        You--both of you--are going to kick
                        ass.  For me to say no to this would
                        be the most difficult thing I've
                        ever done.
                        (heavy pause)
                        So that's why I'm saying no. 

           Seth and Mug react, surprised.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        (re: easel)
                        Love to take this with me, if I could.

           EXT. BLUFFS OVERLOOKING WATERFRONT PIER -- EVENING

           In the distance below is the same pier from Jerry's childhood. 
           Pulling to a stop above is a brand-new INFINITI. 
           INT. MUG'S INFINITI -- CONTINUOUS

           Mug is at the wheel; Jerry sits shotgun.

                                 MUG
                        You think Philip would've liked it? 
                        He always giving me shit about not
                        spending money on myself.

                                 JERRY
                        It's a nice car, Mug.  He would have
                        loved it.

           Mug extends a fist; Jerry high-fives it.  They sit in silence
           for a few moments.

                                 MUG
                        What are you going to do now, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        (beat, smiles)
                        Can I tell you a secret?

      160A OMITTED
                                                                     160A

           EXT. WATERFRONT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Carrying his easel in its case, Jerry walks with his cane
           along the shoreline, moving away from the pier.  The same
           path he once walked with his father.

           EXT. SHORELINE -- "MAGIC HOUR"

           Jerry has finished setting up the easel.  He stares at the
           blank canvas before him and the expanse of water beyond it. 

           A FATHER and SON walk past.

           Jerry reaches into his pocket and produces a lollipop, which
           he unwraps and puts in his mouth.  

                                 JERRY (V.O.)
                        I'm going to see what I can make
                        happen.

           Jerry raises a marker to the canvas.

           WHITE OUT.
