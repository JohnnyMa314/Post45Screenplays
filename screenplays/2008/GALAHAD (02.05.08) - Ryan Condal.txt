                 "With this sword, I have given you the highest order 
                  which God has made and commanded: It is the Order of 
                  Chivalry, which shall be without wickedness."

                                        -The Knighting of Perceval,
                                         Chrétien de Troyes
           FADE IN:

           EXT. ALBION COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The midday sun lances through a veil of storm clouds, bathing 
           this lush, rolling Albion countryside in light and warmth.

           Hooves THUNDER the earth where a cloud of dust rises like 
           vapor around an approaching brigade of RIDERS ON HORSEBACK.

           A SPRAWLING MEDIEVAL ESTATE sits in the valley below.

           THE APPROACHING RIDERS crest a hill woven in high grass.

           SIR GALAHAD OF AVALON (30s) wears a silver-black beard over 
           his weather-worn face. Wavy black hair hangs over his broad 
           shoulders. His gray eyes survey the termendous estate.

           With him is a small MILITIA DETACHMENT, all wearing identical 
           heraldry: a dragon’s head roaring in a circle of flame.

           LYNETTE (26), Galahad’s wife, rides up beside him. She is a 
           comely woman with full features and flowing brown hair.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Does this please my Lady?

           Lynette studies her new lands. Without a word, she leaves 
           Galahad to begin the descent down the hill toward the estate.

                                 LUCAN (O.S.)
                        All of this is ours, father?

           LUCAN (7) pulls his mount up beside Galahad. There is an 
           intelligence set in the boy’s young features.

                                 GALAHAD
                        When a Knight pledges himself to 
                        the Round Table, he surrenders 
                        everything in service of the King. 
                        In exchange, he receives lands and 
                        an estate that will be held for him 
                        until his service is complete.

                                 LUCAN
                        How long will that be?

                                 GALAHAD
                        After tomorrow, the next time I lay 
                        my eyes upon my son, he will be a 
                        grown man, likely with a wife and 
                        children of his own.

           This is a sobering reality for Lucan.
           INT. STABLES - DAY

           Ruddy and perspiring from a day’s ride, Galahad and Lucan 
           remove the saddles from their horses.

                                 LUCAN
                        I am proud of you, father.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (laughing)
                        Oh? And what has your father done 
                        to deserve such acclaim?

                                 LUCAN
                        You are to join the Round Table. 
                        The King’s personal bodyguard, the 
                        six greatest warriors in the realm.

           Galahad sets his saddle on a high peg inside the stall.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Not the greatest warriors, Lucan. 
                        The finest knights. Do you know 
                        what it is that separates the 
                        warrior from the knight?

                                 LUCAN
                        Only the King or a high lord can 
                        make a knight.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (shakes his head)
                        Honor. A warrior is just a weapon 
                        on the battlefield. A knight must 
                        possess conscience. 

           Galahad’s eyes narrow. He places a hand on Lucan’s shoulder.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Honor is the greatest virtue a man 
                        can possess. It is above valor, 
                        above glory. Above even compassion. 
                        Any fool can wield a sword. The man 
                        who does so with conscience, with 
                        honor, is the true knight. 

           Galahad musses Lucan’s hair before putting an arm around him 
           and escorting him from the stables.

           INT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

           Galahad wakes in the darkness of an expansive master 
           bedchamber to find that his wife has left their bed. 
           He slides from the down coverings and passes through the 
           gossamer canopy that tents the bed.

           Pulling on a pair of trousers, Galahad joins Lynette at the 
           arched bedchamber window.

                                 LYNETTE
                        All that I look upon is ours.

           The drapery over the window flaps in the outside breeze.

                                 GALAHAD
                        And more, my love.

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW lies the moonlit landscape of their new 
           estate. Treetops are like dark heads looking out from the 
           pale blue of the night sky.

                                 LYNETTE
                        I look upon now all I wish to have.

           She’s looking at Galahad. His bare torso is chiseled from 
           stone, his skin a living history of battles lost and won. 
           Galahad takes his wife’s face into his hands:

                                 GALAHAD
                        I do this for us, Lynette. For our 
                        son. My father had nothing. But my 
                        son will want for nothing.
                             (this does not sway her)
                        It is the King’s own command that I 
                        join The Six. I would dishonor him 
                        to refuse. And dishonor my family.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Honor cannot warm my bed at night. 
                        I want my husband, Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        You know I will return to you.

                                 LYNETTE
                        When I am a withered old crone?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I will be the oldest knight ever to 
                        take a seat at The Round Table. I 
                        shall perform my duty to my King. 
                        And when it is done, we shall live 
                        out our long lives. Here, together, 
                        and with need for naught. That, I 
                        promise you.

           She wants to believe him, but she doesn’t. Lynette sinks into 
           Galahad’s open arms, grasping at what will soon be gone.
           EXT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNING

           A THUNDERING THRONG OF HORSES gallops through the clearing on 
           their way toward Galahad’s estate.

           Galahad, now dressed in the red and gray heraldry of the 
           Great House Pendragon, awaits their coming with Lynette and 
           Lucan at his side.

                                 LUCAN
                        Do you think Sir Lancelot is among 
                        them, father? 

           Galahad gazes down at Lucan, who nearly bounces with 
           excitement. Without irony, Lucan looks up and says:

                                 LUCAN
                        They say he’s the finest swordsman 
                        to have ever lived.

           The riders approach -- In moments --

           SIR LANCELOT, SIR GAWAIN and a small detachment of the KING’S 
           MILITIA trot up on horseback. Galahad bows his head. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        My Lords Lancelot and Gawain.

           SIR LANCELOT (22) is striking to behold. He has flawless skin 
           and perfect bone structure. His piercing blue eyes look out 
           between golden locks of hair. Young Lancelot is beautiful, he 
           is arrogant, and he is deadly. He smiles down at Lynette:

                                 LANCELOT
                        I hope you will excuse me if I 
                        don’t look my best, my Lady 
                        Lynette. I fear the hard ride South 
                        into the White Valley has put a 
                        scowl on my face angrier than the 
                        blisters it put on my arse.

           Lynette looks at Galahad, despairing. Don’t leave us. Galahad 
           embraces her, whispering gently into her ear:

                                 GALAHAD
                        When has your husband not honored 
                        his word?

           Galahad pulls back to see Lynette force a smile.

           A STABLE HAND leads an impressive black charger to Galahad. 
           Galahad swings his leg over top, settling into the saddle.
                                 LANCELOT
                        Do not fret, my Lady. One day, His 
                        Grace the King will surely return 
                        both father and husband, handsome 
                        and unspoiled. Shall he not, Lord 
                        Gawain?

           SIR GAWAIN (35) HUFFS a laugh. For every quality Lancelot has 
           in aesthetic beauty, Gawain counters with grim forboding. 

           Gawain’s skin is like white leather stretched over bone. Pin-
           straight, jet black hair stands out against the paleness of 
           his skin. Arching eyebrows meet on the center of a high 
           forehead that is halved by a pronounced widow’s peak.

           Lancelot grins. You have no idea what is in store.

           EXT. THE OPEN PLAINS OF ALBION - NIGHT

           Lancelot’s party reigns to a halt on a high ridge. The horsed 
           riders look out over an expanse of land whose borders vanish 
           against the swallowing darkness of the night.

           THE CITY OF CAMELOT is a beacon in the dark. The city’s 
           torches blaze like wildfire against the surrounding darkness.

           Camelot is not some city of fairy-tales. The spires of the 
           city are sharp and severe. Its unscalable walls are 
           monstrously tall. The structure is at once a marvel of design 
           and a warning to its enemies: challenge us at your own peril.

                                 LANCELOT
                        The sight of home is always sweet, 
                        is it not, Galahad?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I could behold it a thousand times 
                        and never tire of its beauty.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Aye, but the next time you will do 
                        so not as some common thug of the 
                        city guard, but as one of the most 
                        feared swords in the realm. 

           Lancelot urges his charger forward. The horses and riders 
           soon vanish into the inky darkness -- DARKNESS -- THEN --

           TIME SLOWS -- A voice speaks calmly from the ether as IMAGES 
           burn in, then out just as quickly --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I am one of six.
                        I am a degree of the circle.
                        I have completed the six trials.
           ...Galahad bows to five BROAD-SHOULDERED SILHOUETTES --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the blade.

           ...Blindfolded, Galahad raises a sword in torchlight --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the fist.

           ...Galahad grapples with a man twice his size -- 

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the pain.

           ...His arms and legs tethered, five men beat Galahad bloody --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the will.

           ...Galahad is teased by a swarm of NAKED WOMEN --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the blood.

           ...Galahad drapes a cloak over the shoulders of a FAT MAN --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        And that of the oath itself.

           ...HORSES TRAMPLE high grass -- The blazing sun becomes --

           INT. CHAMBER OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT

           -- The torchlit Chamber of the Round Table. It is a room 
           suited for the knights of legend. The walls are decorated in 
           tapestries that tell the tales of King Arthur’s knights. 

           A ROUND TABLE SEAL, alive in scrollwork and gold inlay, is 
           embossed in the stone at the center of this chamber’s floor.

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I take this oath to forego all else 
                        in protection of the royal blood of 
                        King Arthur Pendragon.

           KING ARTHUR PENDRAGON (60s) steps into the torchlight. The 
           man is corpulent; soft and round. Exhausted eyes are sunken 
           deep into his jowly face. This cow of a man couldn’t lift a 
           sword to save his own life. This King, like the city of 
           Camelot and the knights that defend it, is no idealized 
           portrait of legend. 

           Galahad, shirtless, is knelt before both FIVE OTHER KNIGHTS 
           and King Arthur himself. Galahad completes the oath:
                                 GALAHAD
                        I am my king’s sword and I am his 
                        shield. I have given all in service 
                        of him. My possessions are forfeit. 
                        My family are strangers to my eyes. 
                        I shall know not love, or desire, 
                        or envy, or want. 

           King Arthur grasps the end of an IRON BRAND, its end cooking 
           red hot in a bed of straw and coals --

                                 GALAHAD
                        I shall know only this oath. 
                        Loyalty above all else. 
                        For I am one of The Six. 
                        I am a degree of the circle. 

           The King removes the smoking brand from the coals. The end, a 
           CIRCLE, glows a molten orange. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        My life, my last drop of blood, in 
                        service to the Crown of Albion.

           HISSSSSS! The circle brand SCORCHES Galahad’s chest. At once, 
           steam rises from the cauterized wound as a stream of blood 
           runs out onto the ROUND TABLE SEAL at Galahad’s knees.

           Galahad CRIES OUT -- Falls -- Then, slowly, he rises, 
           revealing a RED CIRCLE seared into his chest. 

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Rise now, Sir Galahad of Avalon, 
                        loyal Knight of The Round Table.

           Galahad climbs to his feet. Steadies. 

           THE LADY GUINEVERE (26) steps forward. The finest dress from 
           the kingdom’s finest seamstress hugs her perfect body. Her 
           skin is a flawless olive, her lips full and pink. Inside the 
           lady’s almond-shaped eyes swim pools of the deepest blue.

           The Lady Guinevere is the most beautiful woman alive. She 
           leans in and kisses both of Galahad’s cheeks. On the second 
           cheek, she lingers just a bit longer than custom...

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I shall sleep soundly knowing you 
                        are in our service, Sir Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I am honored beyond words, Lady 
                        Guinevere.

           Lady Guinevere smiles a disarming smile. BOOM! -- SMASH TO --
           EXT. THE KING’S WOODLANDS - DAY

           -- HORSE HOOVES -- Something THRASHES THROUGH THE WOODS as 
           HOUNDS BRAY nearby -- The horses follow -- Above them --

           A canopy of perfect green shades the lush foliage at the foot 
           of the woods from the strong summer sun blazing above.

           The WHOOPING HOUNDS race through the foliage ahead of them --

           INSERT TITLE: 5 Years Later

           Galahad races on horseback at the head of the party. 

           King Arthur, a whale on horseback, rides behind this phalanx 
           of Round Table knights, his eyes are wide with excitement:

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        They have a scent!

                                 GALAHAD
                        Hold!

           The other FIVE ROUND TABLE KNIGHTS rear up behind Galahad. In 
           addition to SIR LANCELOT and SIR GAWAIN, they are:

           PERCIVAL (18) is a baby-faced knight in search of glory. 

           CARADOC (27), known as “THE GREEN KNIGHT,” is a fair-skinned 
           Hybernian who would have a mane of red hair were his head not 
           shaved bald. He wears a fiery goatee on his stoic face.

           Finally, MALAGANT THE MAD (30). Malagant is a head taller 
           than his brethren. His huge frame must weigh 15 stone. As if 
           this 7-foot beast weren’t imposing enough, he is TATTOOED 
           from head to toe in black ink. The tattoos outline Malagant’s 
           skeleton. His fingers, his arms, his skull, HIS FACE -- every 
           last bone is outlined in black on his flesh.

           There, the knights wait in silence -- Chests heaving --

           SUDDENLY - the racing hounds flush a magnificent STAG from 
           the trees -- 

                                 MORDRED
                        Father!

           Riding with the knights is a group of YOUNG SQUIRES. One, 
           MORDRED PENDRAGON II (14), is King Arthur’s son. Though 
           slender, he looks to be of heartier stuff than his father.

           The huge, horned stag crosses in front of the riders --

           Lancelot KNOCKS HIS BOW to fire --
                                 KING ARTHUR (O.S.)
                        No!

           King Arthur’s pudgy fingers fumble with an arrow --

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        He is mine!

           With child-like excitement, The King tries to draw the bow, 
           but does not have the strength. The arrow slips, firing 
           harmlessly into the woods --

           Lancelot’s lip curls smugly at the sad spectacle.

           DEEPER IN THE WOODLANDS

           Horse-hooves POUND the ground as the riding party navigates 
           through the dense trees --

           The riders rear up their horses. Lancelot climbs off his 
           saddle. HOUNDS YAP from the woods, their calls fading --

                                 PERCIVAL
                        They may have lost the scent...

           Galahad hops off his mount, his eyes fixed on something -- 

           A PILE OF SHIT. Galahad walks over, kicks it with his boot.

                                 GALAHAD
                        The spoor is fresh. 

           SUDDENLY - A WOMAN SHRIEKS. Very scared. Very near. Hands go 
           to swords as footfalls CRUNCH on dead leaves, coming CLOSER 
           and CLOSER toward the King’s hunting party -- 

           A LONE PEASANT WOMAN races into their midst. Her eyes are 
           wild. She’s filthy, dressed in rags. The woman runs to 
           Malagant, groping at his saddle, SOBBING and HYSTERICAL --

                                 MALAGANT
                        Stop your braying, woman.

           Malagant, voice deep and BOOMING, kicks her away from him --

                                 LANCELOT
                        It seems the mighty stag has skin-
                        changed into a filthy peasant woman 
                        to escape your arrows, your Grace.

                                 MORDRED
                        Where did she come from?

                                 GALAHAD
                        There is a farming village nearby.
           Percival leaps off his horse. Goes to the woman --

                                 CARADOC
                             (thick brogue)
                        Aye. The Village Glatisant.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Who are you? What happened?

           The woman looks up at Percival, tears smearing the caked dirt 
           on her face. She points back where she came from and SHRIEKS:

                                 PEASANT WOMAN
                        SARACENS!

           And suddenly, the party is hyper-vigilant. Danger. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        Swords!

           Steel is RIPPED from leather scabbards. Galahad remounts his 
           horse. The Knights of the Round Table encircle King Arthur --

           AT THE EDGE OF THE WOODLANDS

           THE VILLAGE is sacked by a swarm of dark-skinned Saracens. 
           They wear blue cotton, sashed at the waist in gold. They 
           wield saber-like swords called scimitars --

           This is a party of THIRTY SARACEN RAIDERS. They burn, rape, 
           pillage, murder. One beheads a male villager on his knees.

           ANGLE ON - Percival spurs his mount forward, set to charge --

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Your orders, Sir Galahad?

           King Arthur shifts nervously in his saddle. He’s petrified.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                             (barely a whisper)
                        We must flee.

           The decision pains Galahad. He hesitates. Then:

                                 GALAHAD
                        Lancelot, scout the retreat.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        My lord?

                                 GALAHAD
                        We must escort the King to safety.

                                 MORDRED
                        Galahad, they are killing them!
                                 GALAHAD
                        The Round Table’s duty is to King, 
                        not kingdom. Come.

           Galahad wheels his horse around, prepared to go when --

           CRASH! Bodies tumble through a broken wall of the nearest 
           village hut. A Saracen Raider CURSES at a YOUNG GIRL who 
           struggles in futility. The Saracen tears off her skirt --

                                 LANCELOT
                        Bugger this.

           Lancelot knocks an arrow -- TWANG! -- He looses it --

           THE ARROW spears clean through the Saracen Raider’s head, 
           spattering the young girl in his gore. 

           ANOTHER SARACEN eyes track... he spots King Arthur’s party -- 
           He shouts an ALARM to his comrades in a GUTTURAL TONGUE --

           At once, all Saracen eyes are on King Arthur’s hunting party.

                                 GALAHAD
                        The Shadows take you, Lancelot.

           The SARACEN LEADER of the raid points at King Arthur with his 
           scimitar and ORDERS THE ATTACK --

                                 LANCELOT
                             (grinning at Galahad)
                        The day is about to get wet, boys!

           Galahad points with his sword, firing off battle commands --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Lancelot, Malagant, Gawain, ride 
                        out to meet them. Squires, follow 
                        on their charge. Percival, Caradoc, 
                        you are here with me and His Grace.

           The SARACEN CHARGE begins -- They charge toward the King --

           LANCELOT, MALAGANT and GAWAIN lead the squires to meet them --

           The mounted charge SAWS THROUGH the first wave of Saracens, 
           who come at them on foot --

           Gawain and the squires ride into the village after them --

           Malagant and Lancelot dismount to face their enemies on foot. 

           Even ground. Man to man.

           And the Saracen that Malagant faces does not stand a chance. 
           He is a full foot shorter than the huge, tattooed madman. 
           Malagant sidesteps the raider’s pathetic slash -- He raises 
           his two-handed sword -- And SPLITS the Saracen’s torso from 
           shoulder to waist.

           Lancelot, a living legend with his sword, is far more 
           graceful. He faces three Saracens, who try to encircle him.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Try to lay a blade to my flesh, sun 
                        worshippers. No man ever has. You 
                        could become a thing of legend.

           The first Saracen attacks -- Moving like liquid, he twirls, 
           coming about behind the raider and runs him through -- 

           One down. Two left. They come at Lancelot from his flanks -- 
           The Saracen behind him raises his sword -- But Lancelot 
           whirls and SEVERS the Saracen’s sword hand at the wrist --

           Lancelot catches the scimitar as it falls, the CLEAVED 
           SARACEN HAND still holding onto the scimitar’s hilt -- 

           He spins to face the final raider, now wielding a sword in 
           each hand and SCISSOR-CUTS the Saracen’s head clean off --

           -- The cut SPRAYS LANCELOT IN BLOOD. He is disgusted. 
           Repulsed. Lancelot searches the ground for a clean cloak to 
           wipe himself off, which he cannot do fast enough.

           ANGLE ON - Galahad watches the rout of the village’s raiding 
           party when, from behind:

                                 PERCIVAL (O.S.)
                        Sir Galahad!

           Galahad turns around. FIVE SARACENS have circled around 
           behind them -- Galahad goes to dismount his horse, but KING 
           ARTHUR paws at his shoulder with a fat, shaking hand --

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Do not leave me, Galahad! Please!

           The King’s eyes are wide and wet. His voice quavers in the 
           plea. King Arthur is terrified. Galahad nods at the raiders:

                                 GALAHAD
                        Percival, Caradoc.

           Percival and Caradoc ride out, swords drawn -- They cut down 
           two of the Saracens quickly, then give chase to another --

           This leaves one last Saracen. A brutish, burly raider. He 
           grins a smile of broken and rotting teeth, CACKLING --

           Galahad hops down off his horse, bringing his sword to bear. 
           The Saracen lunges forward with a slash -- 
           CLANG! Galahad deflects it, knocking the sword aside and 
           thrusting his broadsword into the Saracen’s throat -- Galahad 
           TWISTS the blade to open the wound and yanks it free --

           Violent. Skilled. But economical and without arrogance. 
           Galahad wipes the blood off his sword and remounts his horse.

           ANGLE ON - Gawain chases down a YOUNG SARACEN. Just a boy, he 
           is terrified. He throws away his sword. But Gawain advances -- 

           The boy falls to his knees, BABBLING FOR MERCY --

           But Gawain runs him through. He thrusts the boy’s corpse off 
           his sword with a boot. Hard. Brutal. Merciless.

           IN A VILLAGE LEAN-TO

           Malagant walks in on a rape -- The thrashing WOMAN looks over 
           her attacker’s shoulder and SCREAMS at the sight of Malagant.

           Malagant DRAGS the SARACEN off his victim and twists the 
           man’s head completely around -- SNAP -- 

           The woman goes to flee the lean-to -- 

           But Malagant pushes her back down onto the bed of hay. She 
           looks up as he reaches into his trousers --

                                 MALAGANT
                        Shame to waste what’s already been 
                        spoiled.

           LATER, IN THE VILLAGE

           The surviving villagers pick up what is left of their lives. 

           The Round Table Knights survey the corpses of their fallen 
           enemies. Malagant rolls one of the bodies over with a boot.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        No Saracen raid has struck this far 
                        North before. What should we make 
                        of this, Galahad?

                                 CARADOC
                        Might be outriders, your Grace. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        Could be these sand-eating bastards 
                        have finally set eyes upon Camelot.

           Crouched over a Saracen corpse, Galahad handles one of the 
           raider’s SCIMITARS. A RISING SUN is etched into the steel.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Palamedes.
           Galahad throws down the scimitar and rises to his feet.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        The Grand Vizier’s scouts? Here?

                                 MALAGANT
                        We should sword-fuck every last one 
                        of ‘em from asshole to eyes.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Mount up. I want us inside the city 
                        walls before dark.

           Galahad slings a leg over his horse, climbs into the saddle.

           EXT. ALBION COUNTRYSIDE - THE MOTHER’S ROAD - DAY

           King Arthur’s hunting party makes the long ride for home. 
           Caradoc rides beside Galahad --

                                 CARADOC
                        Sir Galahad, your estate is not far 
                        from here is it?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Two or three hours’ ride Southeast.

                                 CARADOC
                             (grinning)
                        And how often has my Lord slipped 
                        away from the cold stone of Camelot 
                        into the warm bed of his woman?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Never.

                                 CARADOC
                        Never, my Lord?

                                 GALAHAD
                        You and I have taken the same oath, 
                        Sir Caradoc. 

                                 CARADOC
                        I do not think the King’s life 
                        would be endangered by his First 
                        Knight going to see his woman.

                                 GALAHAD
                        It is not our place to decide which 
                        parts of our oaths to uphold. Our 
                        loved ones will await us on the 
                        other side of our duty to the King.

           Galahad rides ahead of Caradoc. 
           EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES OF CAMELOT - DUSK

           KING ARTHUR’S HUNTING PARTY rides for Camelot’s front gate.

           The wall before them is a hundred feet tall. Recessed within 
           the thick wall is a black iron portcullis. The gate’s feet 
           are suspended above them like a row of monstrous teeth. 

           As the King’s party passes underneath, the gate descends -- 
           And then LOCKS DOWN, sealing inside all that is within.

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the towering walls lies a buzzing medieval city. 

           Laborers and craftsmen -- butchers, tailors, smiths -- have 
           begun closing down their shop fronts for the coming of night. 
           Men light TORCHES to keep the city alight until daybreak.

           Thriving though Camelot is, this is a true medieval city. It 
           is dirty. Mangy, starved dogs run loose. Many people are ill 
           or crippled, walking with limps or not walking at all.

           And at the heart of the walled city lies THE CASTLE CAMELOT.

           The King’s party traverses the city’s main road. Common folk 
           stop to marvel at the celebrity of the King and his knights.

           The air is filled with FAINT SONG as a haunting woman’s voice 
           sings in an ancient tongue. 

           When a cluster of HOODED DRUIDS approaches the King’s party, 
           they stop and bow their heads in reverence to the holy men.

           Percival helps one of the squires pull a MORTALLY WOUNDED 
           SQUIRE (14) off the back of his horse. They pass him down to 
           the druids, who await him with a SMALL CART for transport.

           Mordred watches this, still ghost white from battle shock. 
           With tears in his eyes, he speaks to the druids:

                                 MORDRED
                        Please help him. T-T-Tristan is --
                             (trying to hold the sobs)
                        -- a good f-friend.

           Caradoc places a gentle hand on Mordred’s shoulder.

                                 CARADOC
                        The Wise Ones of the Oak bear the 
                        secrets of the Green Mother 
                        herself, my Prince. If a remedy 
                        exists, Tristan shall have it.
           The druids, who have taken oaths of silence, say nothing. 
           They wheel the wounded Tristan away toward --

           A DRUIDIC MONASTERY, a circular stone construct set apart 
           from the Castle Camelot, but inside the high city walls.

                                 CARADOC
                             (listening to the song)
                        Morgan la Fey mourns our fallen.

                                 GALAHAD
                        She could not know. We just 
                        returned.

                                 CARADOC
                        The “Mother’s Daughter” is a gifted 
                        seer.

           Galahad does not believe a word of this.

                                 LANCELOT
                             (re: Caradoc)
                        Our “Green Knight” is a man of 
                        zealous faith, is he not?

           Lancelot grins. He doesn’t believe a word of it, either.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - KING’S SOLAR - NIGHT

           Galahad escorts King Arthur into his solar, a private living 
           area abound in exquisite furnishings. King Arthur shuffles 
           when he walks, like he it pains him to move his big body.

                                 KING ARTHUR 
                        Help me change, Galahad?

           Confused at the strange request, Galahad nonetheless obeys. 
           King Arthur sheds his robe and turns around, revealing that --

           He’s pissed himself. And he does not seem to be ashamed.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        My loving father used to say that I 
                        did not have the stomach for war.
                             (re: his bulging gut)
                        But it does seem that I have it for 
                        nearly everything else, hmm?

           The huge man leans on Galahad as he struggles into a clean 
           set of trousers. When it is done:

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Why do you want this life, Galahad?
                                 GALAHAD
                        Your Grace?

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        War, combat, they are awful things. 
                        We glorify them as boys, but then 
                        we become men, don’t we? And we see 
                        them as they are, the most vile 
                        part of us. So I ask -- why? Is it 
                        for glory? For valor?

                                 GALAHAD
                        There is no greater honor to a man 
                        of Albion, Your Grace, than living 
                        and dying as a knight of the King’s 
                        Round Table. 

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Honor is worth little to a dead 
                        man, Galahad. Help me sit.

           Galahad helps his King up into a high sitting chair. He rubs 
           his hanging jowls before looking up.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        When I was a boy of fourteen, my 
                        father dragged me into battle 
                        against the coup at Wandesboro. 
                             (squeezing his eyes shut)
                        I watched Uther Pendragon’s army 
                        slice through his own people... I 
                        can still see the horrors, vivid as 
                        day, whenever I close my eyes.
                             (opening his eyes)
                        A great King, not a good King, but 
                        a great one -- would never visit 
                        such brutality on his people.

           SLAM! Suddenly, the entrance door to the solar BOOMS open -- 
           LADY GUINEVERE storms inside. She is stunning, even in rage.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Saracens? Here? In Britony? This is 
                        an act of war, Arthur.

           Galahad steps aside as Guinevere stomps toward them.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        I believe the Lady Guinevere wishes 
                        my private counsel, Sir Galahad. 
                        Who is my posted guard this eve?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Sir Percival, your Grace.

           King Arthur nods. Go then. Galahad bows to Lady Guinevere --
                                 GALAHAD
                        My Lady.

           Galahad takes the long walk from the solar. When he is gone:

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        I do not stand on ceremony, 
                        Guinevere, but do not forget 
                        yourself in my court.

           Guinevere is enraged. She SLAPS the King --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I think you forget that you are the 
                        king of a land under siege!

           The King rubs his rose-red cheek, stunned at her defiance.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        My father would have beaten a woman 
                        for such insolence.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Perhaps, but you are not Uther 
                        Pendragon, are you, my King? 

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Mother be blessed. My father was a 
                        tyrant.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        “The King hunts while his Kingdom 
                        falls prey.” Poetic, no? It is the 
                        whispered mantra of your own 
                        people. King Uther traveled this 
                        castle like a ghost. None dared 
                        defy him.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        The halls of my Camelot exist 
                        outside the walls. I will not skulk 
                        about in hidden passages so that I 
                        may rule through fear.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Your father would already have ten 
                        thousand foot marching on the 
                        Qu’Rad Empire. And he would leave a 
                        wake of skewered Saracen heads in 
                        his return to Camelot.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Those raiders paid the dearest 
                        price for their crimes, Guinevere

           Tears have welled in Lady Guinevere’s eyes. She is shaking.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        “Raiders?” Every year, hundreds of 
                        my people are raped and murdered by 
                        these “raiders.” Lyonesse has held 
                        the Saracens at bay for a century. 
                        And now their threat creeps North, 
                        but still you do nothing!

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        I shall send three garrisons South 
                        to fortify the borderlands.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        The Grand Vizier Palamedes defies 
                        you, Arthur. Challenges you to act. 

           King Arthur struggles to stand up. Already out of breath:

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        Then he will meet my three 
                        garrisons and know my response. I 
                        am retiring to my chambers. 
                             (moving to leave)
                        Good night, Guinevere.

           More wroth than when she arrived, Guinevere watches him go.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - GALAHAD’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Inside Galahad’s modest quarters, Galahad writes with a quill 
           by candlelight. He finishes the letter, goes to the chest at 
           the foot of his bed. 

           INSIDE: Wrapped in cloth is a latched wooden box. Galahad 
           opens it. Inside are dozens of PARCHMENT LETTERS.

           Galahad places the freshly written one on top. The heading of 
           the letter reads “MY DEAREST LYNETTE,” -- He CLOSES the box.

           GALAHAD GRABS HIS SHEATHED SWORD --

           LATER - Sharp steel glints in the firelight as Galahad works 
           on his sword blade with a wetstone, honing the edge --

           The heavy iron KNOCKER on Galahad’s chamber door THUDS. 

           Shirtless and sweating from his work, Galahad looks up:

                                 GALAHAD
                        Come.

           The door CREAKS open and a small figure steps inside. When 
           she steps into the light, LADY GUINEVERE drops her hood --
           Galahad stands so quickly that his sword falls off his lap 
           onto the floor. He lowers his eyes, reaching for his shirt --

                                 GALAHAD
                        My Lady, I -- I did not expect --

           With the confidence of a Queen, Lady Guinevere takes a seat 
           at the edge of the bed. She stares lustily at his muscled 
           torso, which bears the CIRCULAR BRAND of the Round Table. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Nor should you have. I did not 
                        announce my coming.
                             (as he pulls on his shirt)
                        Please, do not dress on my account.

           Galahad adjusts his shirt. Guinevere smiles a sultry grin.

                                 GALAHAD
                        What might I do for you, my Lady?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I ask that you speak reason with 
                        your King. The Saracen threat waits 
                        on our borders. Palamedes senses 
                        Arthur’s weakness. He will strike. 
                        It is only a matter of time. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        It is not my place, my Lady.

           Retrieving his sword, he slides it back into its scabbard.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE 
                        Any fool can kill for his King. His 
                        First Knight is meant to be his 
                        most trusted man; a counsellor as 
                        well as a soldier.

                                 GALAHAD
                        His Grace is better served trusting 
                        me with his life than with his 
                        politics, my Lady. 

           She studies him like a viper deciding where best to strike.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        When I was a girl, my mother would 
                        visit the poor villages in 
                        Lyonesse, providing alms and food. 
                        There was a terrible drought when I 
                        was eight. I spent the summer with 
                        my mother, going from village to 
                        village, providing what help we 
                        could. 
           As the memory comes back to her, Guinevere suddenly becomes 
           vulnerable. She is sharing the deepest part of herself.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        We did not see them until they were 
                        already upon us. Six of my father’s 
                        men were killed instantly. The rest 
                        scattered the Saracen raid, but it 
                        was too much...

           Tears well in Guinevere’s eyes, but her voice does not break.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I watched those savages tear my 
                        mother apart like a pack of wolves. 
                        She begged for mercy, but they 
                        offered none. It is only by the 
                        Green Mother’s will that I stand 
                        here before you...

           Guinevere pulls aside her dress, showing Galahad HER BREAST, 
           which is marred by a thick scar.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Camelot has not seen the horrors 
                        that Lyonesse has endured. But that 
                        day will come. Please, Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        My Lady --

           Galahad stands -- Guinevere steps in close and kisses him. At 
           first too shocked to react, Galahad does nothing. But when 
           his wits come around he gently pushes her away --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I will do anything you ask.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Then leave here and never speak of 
                        this!

           She advances on him -- Tucks her hands into his trousers --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I was married off to a corpse when 
                        I was no more than a child. My 
                        husband took his heir from my womb 
                        fourteen years ago and has not 
                        ventured there since... 
                             (whispering)
                        I can give you what every man in 
                        this realm desires... 

           Her hands wander -- Galahad can barely resist her -- But he 
           backs away. Quickly, he snatches his sword and walks out.
           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The sleeping city is awash in the pale light of a half moon. 
           Galahad walks on a path, guided by the moonlight from a clear 
           night sky above. He approaches a circular stone structure --

           THE STONEHENGE is a circle of titanic stones in an otherwise 
           empty grass field. This is a holy place of worship. Galahad 
           sticks his sword in the earth outside the circle.

           INSIDE THE STONEHENGE

           Galahad kneels. He prays silently for forgiveness.

                                 MORDRED (O.S.)
                        Tristan is dead.

           Thinking he was alone, Galahad is surprised to see Mordred.

                                 MORDRED
                        The Druids could not help him. Not 
                        even their Saracen, who is said to 
                        possess some dark magic.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Tristan died in his King’s service. 
                        There is no death more honorable.

           Mordred stands, walks over to Galahad.

                                 MORDRED
                        I killed a man today. I did not 
                        tell my father, but I wretched on 
                        that Saracen after I cut him down.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Bors, my old Captain, said that a 
                        new warrior will wretch the 
                        cowardice from himself on the 
                        battlefield. This is a good thing, 
                        Mordred. No man should be able to 
                        kill without conscience. 

                                 MORDRED
                        Do you think my father is a coward?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Why would you ask such a thing?

                                 MORDRED
                        My mother begs me to find the 
                        courage that my father lacks. She 
                        believes we should go to war with 
                        the Qu’Rad Empire.
                                 GALAHAD
                        Your mother is a woman of strong 
                        conviction. A virtuous trait.

                                 MORDRED
                        The histories say we were once at 
                        peace with the Saracens. Long ago.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (chuckles)
                        Aye. Even before Galahad the Gray.

                                 MORDRED
                        Their Grand Vizier sent his most 
                        skilled engineers to help Uther, my 
                        grandfather’s grandfather, build 
                        Camelot. But when they finished, 
                        the King had the Saracens slain to 
                        protect the castle’s secrets.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I have heard the same tale.

                                 MORDRED
                        Camelot has a maze of secret 
                        passages, rooms, doors. I have 
                        found a dozen of them.

                                 GALAHAD
                        And there are a hundred more. I 
                        tried to map them myself when I was 
                        Captain of the city guard. The 
                        Castle Camelot is a marvel of 
                        engineering, that much is true.

           Mordred pauses a moment. Then:

                                 MORDRED
                        Is my father a coward for refusing 
                        to go to war, Galahad?

                                 GALAHAD
                        To declare war is to sign the death 
                        warrant of thousands of your own 
                        people. Many men judge their King, 
                        but few will ever know his burden.

                                 MORDRED
                        I will. That is why I come here to 
                        pray each night and ask the Green 
                        Mother to guide me.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Until that day comes, you must 
                        learn from your father. 
                                 GALAHAD (CONT'D)
                        Arthur Pendragon is a man of wisdom 
                        and compassion. I would give my 
                        life in his service.

           Mordred weighs Galahad’s advice.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - OUTSIDE ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Percival dozes on his feet deep into his watch outside the 
           King’s chambers. Soft FOOTFALLS climb stone stairs. Percival 
           shudders awake, suddenly on alert --

           When LANCELOT emerges from the spiral stairwell.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Lancelot?

                                 LANCELOT
                        It is your lucky night, Percival. I 
                        am relieving your watch.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        You are not on watch tonight.

                                 LANCELOT
                        I believe that is what makes this 
                        “your lucky night.” The King sent 
                        for me. The Saracen raid has His 
                        Grace terrified of some assassin 
                        coming for him in the night.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        I was not notified.

                                 LANCELOT
                        I am notifying you. Go back to 
                        sleep. This time in your quarters.

           Embarrassed at having been caught asleep, Percival withdraws.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Good night, my Lord.

           Lancelot smirks and takes his post at the King’s door.

           INT. THE KING’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           With the blazing fireplace flickering behind him, King Arthur 
           writes with quill and ink on a piece of curling parchment. 
           The door to the chamber CREAKS open.

           King Arthur looks up to see the LADY GUINEVERE enter.

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        My Lady?
           Guinevere steps deeper inside, saying nothing. King Arthur 
           goes back to his parchment, dipping the quill in an inkwell --

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        I will not speak of war again, 
                        Guinevere. Not at this late hour.

           Still she says nothing. Arthur, finally looks up. There are 
           tears in Guinevere’s eyes. She offers out her hand:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Arthur...

           King Arthur takes her hand as a tear rolls down her cheek. 

                                 KING ARTHUR
                        What is it, my Lady?

           Lady Guinevere leans in, squeezing his face and kissing him 
           on the mouth. Then --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I came to Camelot to marry the 
                        strong son of Uther Pendragon --

           Arthur smiles at her. But his smile turns to stone when:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- But you are a coward, Arthur. 
                        You have failed your people.

           Lady Guinevere squeezes his cheeks, forcing his lips open -- 
           With her other hand, Guinevere raises a small GLASS PHIAL -- 

           She pops out the cork with her thumb -- Inside the phial is a 
           brown liquid -- Guinevere forces the poison between King 
           Arthur’s pursed lips, speaking through GRIT TEETH:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I will not sit idle as our 
                        sovereignty slips away. I will not 
                        watch as Camelot’s walls break and 
                        the Saracen nations pour inside. 

           King Arthur COLLAPSES -- He GASPS harder for air, GURGLING 
           and GAGGING as he turns a deep purple --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        And I will not have my son inherit 
                        a conquered kingdom.

           Guinevere releases him and backs away.

           King Arthur thrashes in his death throes, the poison wracking 
           his body as it breaks itself from within. Soon, the King’s 
           struggle ceases. A final RATTLE leaves King Arthur’s throat.
           ANGLE ON - Lancelot enters where Lady Guinevere stands over 
           King Arthur’s dead body. She is not alarmed to see him.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        The King is dead.

           Lancelot comes to her side, staring down, emotionless, at the 
           King body. Guinevere slips her hand into Lancelot’s.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I am free, my love.

           IN THE KING’S BED CHAMBER

           Guinevere strips off Lancelot’s tunic and trousers as he 
           lifts her dress up over her head --

           They tumble into the furs of the King’s expansive bed. Nude 
           bodies intertwine, hungry hands grope at warm flesh...

           AFTERWARDS

           Guinevere nests comfortably in Lancelot’s arms. Her eyes turn 
           like wheels as she thinks, plots things out.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Do you love me, Lancelot?

           Lancelot turns, squinting at the question.

                                 LANCELOT
                        I love you more than I do my own 
                        life, Guinevere.

           These words, unlike most from Lancelot, are truly sincere.

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - NIGHT

           The monastery is alive in hand-carved scrollwork and 
           religious artifacts: stone statues, painted walls, wooden 
           archways. A humbling, cavernous place. The corridors echo 
           with the CHANTS and HYMNS of druids.

           IN A CORRIDOR

           A silhouette slips out of a niche, following a DRUID --

                                 LANCELOT
                        Brother Culwych?

           The Druid halts at the sound of his name. This pause gives 
           the silhouette (LANCELOT) all he needs to know -- 

           In a blur, a SWORD appears -- Lancelot grasps Culwych’s 
           shoulder and DRIVES THE SWORD through the base of his skull. 
           INT. GALAHAD’S QUARTERS - FIRST LIGHT

           Dawn pierces through the openings of the Castle Camelot’s 
           outer walls. The blue-gray light of morning seeps into 
           Galahad’s personal quarters, where the Knight sleeps soundly.

           Until there is a HEAVY IRON KNOCK at his door. Galahad is 
           instantly on his feet and reaching for his sword --

           THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL -- Mordred standing in the doorway, 
           quiet and meek. Galahad recognizes that something is wrong --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Mordred? What’s happened?

                                 MORDRED
                        I... 
                             (changing his mind)
                        My father is dead, Galahad.

           This news strikes Galahad like a warhammer.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - EARLY MORNING

           A BELL TOLLS LOUDLY in mourning -- BONG, BONG, BONG --

           Galahad strides through the castle’s corridor, dressed in 
           Pendragon heraldry and the leather jerkin of the Round Table; 
           he is a military officer intent on performing his duty.

           The bell TOLLS continuously, never stopping.

           INT. THE KING’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Galahad parts a mob of CASTLE WORKERS and city militia to 
           emerge into the King’s private chambers. Inside --

           LADY GUINEVERE weeps quietly over King Arthur’s body.

           THE ROUND TABLE KNIGHTS stand in a line, bare swords tip-down 
           against the stone floor at their feet. Their hands rest on 
           the crossguards. Their heads are bowed in mourning.

           HOODED DRUIDS surround the chamber, praying in silence.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Our mighty King has fallen, Sir 
                        Galahad; his health failed him 
                        during the night.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (to the Round Table)
                        Why was I not summoned earlier?
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        The Steward found him just before 
                        daybreak. He was coming to break 
                        our Grace’s fast. At his alert, I 
                        sent Lancelot to summon The Six, 
                        but Mordred insisted on delivering 
                        you this dark news himself.

           Lady Guinevere places a hand on Mordred’s head, bringing him 
           close to her body. The young boy just stares ahead vacantly.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Our future King so admires you, Sir 
                        Galahad.

           The wheels turn in Galahad’s mind as he scans the room, 
           collecting information, sorting it, creating hypotheses. 

           Galahad goes to Lady Guinevere.

                                 GALAHAD
                        This is the blackest day of my 
                        knighthood, Your Grace. Know that I 
                        am in your service.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        As his First Knight, you were his 
                        Grace’s most trusted man, Sir 
                        Galahad. So, too, are you mine.

           Galahad rises, turning back to the task at hand. 

           A LARGE DRUID crouches over the King’s body, going to work. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Knights of the Round Table and 
                        servants of my gentle house, know 
                        that the King was ever deeply 
                        grateful for the quality of man 
                        that surrounded him. 

           GALAHAD WATCHES - the big druid working over the King’s 
           corpse, arranging him in preparation for the body’s removal --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Today you have lost a King. Today I 
                        have lost a husband and my son a 
                        father. My heart breaks with a 
                        melancholy which will not soon 
                        mend.

           ...the druid removes a swatch of parchment from inside his 
           robe. With a tiny METAL TOOL, he scrapes residue from the 
           King’s mouth that he wipes onto the parchment. He folds the 
           parchment and stuffs it back into his robe.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Your reluctant Queen asks for your 
                        compassion and guidance through 
                        this darkness so that we, as a 
                        united kingdom, may rise again, 
                        strong, in the dawn of a new era.

           ...the druid nods to his companions. Take the King away. They 
           lift the King’s body onto A LITTER and take it away.

           He draws back his hood to address Lady Guinevere.

           BROTHER MER’LIN (40s) is a dark-skinned Saracen with a gray 
           eye and a brown one. His head, as is custom, is shorn bald. 
           He wears a long goatee that is a shock of silver and black. 

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        The brothers will now prepare the 
                        King for the interment, my Lady. 

           At the sight of the Saracen Druid, Lady Guinevere darkens.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        What is the meaning of this?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I am Mer’Lin, a Druid brother to 
                        the Wise Ones of the Oak. I --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (enraged)
                        -- Who has allowed Saracen filth 
                        into my royal chambers? Is this 
                        some type of cruel jest at the 
                        expense of our fallen King?

           Galahad reaches out for Lady Guinevere, trying to calm her --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Your Grace --

           -- She rips her arm away --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- This savage has touched the 
                        King’s body! Corrupted his mortal 
                        form before he has made the journey 
                        into the afterlife! 
                             (to her guards)
                        GUARDS! Arrest this Saracen devil --

           The guards hesitate -- Mer’Lin dons his hood, backing away --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        -- No need. I have angered my Lady. 
                        I will retire.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Retire? I should have you hanged!

           Mer’Lin speeds for the exit -- On his way, he spots: THE CORK 
           from Lady Guinevere’s phial. Quickly, Mer’Lin snatches it up. 
           He sniffs at the cork on his way from the King’s chamber --

           Galahad has watched this. He wants to follow, but --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE (O.S.)
                        Sir Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Yes, Your Grace?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        See that the druids -- Albonese 
                        druids -- clean the King’s body and 
                        have him prepared for burial. I 
                        want no holy rite passed over. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        Of course, Your Grace.

           Lady Guinevere leaves them, storming away into one of her 
           private chambers behind the solar.

           The Round Table encircles Galahad, awaiting their orders.

                                 CARADOC
                        What do you make of it, m’Lord?

                                 GALAHAD
                        To be a King is to be surrounded by 
                        enemies. We must be vigilant.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Arthur’s enemy was time, Galahad. 
                        He was an old man.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Percival, did your watch yield 
                        anything of note last night?

           Percival glances at Lancelot quickly before answering:

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Nothing, my Lord.

                                 MALAGANT
                        Our Lord Captain smells conspiracy. 

           Whether Malagant’s quip is ironic or not, it cannot be said.
                                 GALAHAD
                        One of us shall sleep while five 
                        rotate castle patrols and personal 
                        guard to the Queen and the Prince. 
                        Percival, it was your guard last 
                        night, so you are first to rest.

           Percival shifts uncomfortably, looking again at Lancelot.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Gawain, Lancelot, you are to escort 
                        the Lady and Prince wherever they 
                        go. Caradoc, Malagant, you are with 
                        me for patrol. We will divide the 
                        castle in thirds and seek what 
                        witnesses we can find.

                                 MALAGANT
                             (growling; annoyed)
                        Witnesses to what?

                                 GALAHAD
                        The walls of Camelot whisper. We 
                        must listen to what they say. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        They will whisper boring tales of 
                        an aged King with a weak heart. 
                        This is a waste of time, Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Our sole duty was to guard the life 
                        of a King who is now dead. Time is 
                        something we suddenly have in 
                        abundance.

           Lancelot’s smugness shows no sign of remorse or concern.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - LATER THAT DAY

           Galahad pours over a seemingly bare wall. 

           He sweeps his hand over its surface until he finds a brick --
           That he pushes into the wall -- A counterweight CLICK-CLICK-
           CLICKS as a recess in the wall opens up, REVEALING A PASSAGE 
           between the castle walls.

           INSIDE THE HIDDEN PASSAGE

           Galahad holds up a torch, casting firelight into --

           A NARROW HIDDEN CORRIDOR

           Light pours inside from an adjacent room. Galahad wedges 
           himself into the tight corridor. The light’s source is --
           THE KING’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS

           Which are visible on the other side of the wall through tiny 
           slats that were carved into the brickwork.

           ON THE FLOOR, there are a set of FOOTPRINTS in the grime. 
           They appear fresh, like his. However, the other footprints 
           are half the size of Galahad’s.

           INT. LADY GUINEVERE’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - DAY

           The newly made Queen Guinevere searches a pile of parchment 
           scrolls when the door to her chambers CREAKS open. She 
           brightens when Lancelot slips inside. He stops. Smiles.

                                 LANCELOT
                        It seems I am to guard my Lady. 
                             (going to the Queen)
                        Galahad fears that assassins may be 
                        within our walls. 

           Lancelot sweeps a lock of hair from Guinevere’s face.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Though there is none more deadly 
                        than my gentle lady, hmm?

           Grinning, he goes in for a kiss, but she catches his face. 
           Livid and lethally serious:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Mention that again and I will cut 
                        out your wagging tongue.

                                 LANCELOT
                        But how would I pleasure my lady?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        A knight’s talent lives in his 
                        sword -- 

           Lady Guinevere GRABS Lancelot beneath his belt, dragging him 
           close to her. He GRUNTS, half in pain, half in pleasure --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Leave the tongue wagging to your 
                        Queen.

           Guinevere holds eye-contact with Lancelot before dropping her 
           gaze down to Lancelot’s belt and her clenched grip...

           LATER, IN THE QUEEN’S BED

           Lancelot and Guinevere lie amongst furs in post-coital bliss. 
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        What does Galahad suspect?

                                 LANCELOT
                        The man’s sense of duty will keep 
                        Galahad awake for a month searching 
                        for an assassin that doesn’t exist. 
                        But time will pass and the people 
                        of Camelot will come to accept that 
                        their beloved King has died of old 
                        age. Then, his generous Queen will 
                        grant him his retirement and send 
                        him home to his estate.

           Lady Guinevere fusses with a corner of her fur blanket.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        There is a dream, one I have had 
                        since I was a girl, but it comes 
                        more often now. 
                             (recalling the dream)
                        A lone Saracen stands in the 
                        shadows. I am unable to move. Then, 
                        just as it steps into the light 
                        where I can see its face, I am 
                        overwhelmed by this... feeling. And 
                        then I realize that I am dead.

           Lancelot rolls onto his side. Runs his hand beneath the furs.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        They are coming for us, Lancelot. I 
                        know this.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Mordred will not come of age for 
                        nearly two years. Plenty of time to 
                        start our war with Palamedes and 
                        the Qu’Rad, is it not?

           Lady Guinevere turns to her lover and smiles.

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - NIGHT

           A cloaked Galahad walks toward the towering Druid Monastery.

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Galahad comes inside to the HAUNTING BALLADS sung in the old 
           tongue by the devotees of the Green Mother. He approaches a 
           druid and sinks to his knees, bowing his head:
                                 GALAHAD
                        I am Sir Galahad of Avalon, First 
                        Knight of the Round Table.

           Galahad sheds his hood, looking up at the druid.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I seek Brother Mer’Lin.

           The druid says nothing, but does offer a hand. Come this way.

           INT. MER’LIN’S LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

           Galahad’s druid escort leads him into a basement room inside 
           the monastery. The brother gestures inside, then leaves him.

           INSIDE THE LABORATORY, there are a half dozen experiments in 
           progress. Glass beakers hold liquids with white film caked on 
           top. Tables are cluttered in tools and other things. CAGED 
           ANIMALS, cats, dogs, birds, even monkeys, pace in captivity. 

           BROTHER MER’LIN sits stooped over one such worktable, 
           immersed in some task. His back is to Galahad. 

           Cautiously, Galahad walks toward Mer’Lin. The druid examines 
           something while wearing a strange contraption on his head -- 
           They are LOOKING GLASSES that magnify his work --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                             (without looking up)
                        Welcome Sir Galahad, of the Round 
                        Table: the common man that became 
                        the King of Albion’s first sword. 
                        Your story is the stuff of legend. 

           Mer’Lin turns to Galahad, seeing him with HUGE, MAGNIFIED 
           EYES through the looking glasses. The druid smiles a lot when 
           he talks, like he has some kind of omniscience. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        I think the druid who breaks his 
                        silence is of rarer legend.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        We should all express our devotion 
                        to the Green Mother in our own 
                        ways. The man who does not speak 
                        cannot question. And without 
                        question... 
                             (returning to his work)
                        Man cannot achieve understanding of 
                        the great mysteries that face him --

           MER’LIN’S LIPS are pursed against the end of a long needle -- 
           It is aimed at an ELDERLY MAN’S eye, which is glazed over by 
           a soft white film. The needle’s tip punctures the man’s 
           cataract and Mer’Lin SUCKS IT OUT through the hollow syringe.

           Turning, Mer’Lin SPITS the extracted residue onto the floor. 

                                 GALAHAD
                             (sotto)
                        Saracen savage.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        The aging eye can sometimes grow a 
                        second lid that impairs vision. 
                             (showing the needle)
                        I have found many practical uses 
                        for my “syringe.” Sometimes these 
                        patients awake with twenty years 
                        removed from their aging sight. It 
                        is a hollow needle, created by one 
                        of my predecessors while I was 
                        learning medicine at the Central 
                        Praxeum of Mosul at the heart of 
                        the Qu’Rad Empire. The very beating 
                        heart of innovation in the world.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Then why did you come North?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I witnessed things there that 
                        convinced me that my god did not 
                        exist. So, I sought out a new one.

           Brother Mer’Lin smiles away painful memories.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Science is the greatest mystery 
                        that lies before man. I came North 
                        seeking answers to questions.

                                 GALAHAD
                        What did you find?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        More questions. And I believe it is 
                        questions that brings you here.
                             (off Galahad’s silence)
                        The King’s death unsettles you.

                                 GALAHAD
                        It unsettles the whole of Albion.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        But it is the circumstance of his 
                        death that has you cloaked and 
                        skulking around the city by night. 
                                 GALAHAD
                        Aye.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        It should unsettle you, Sir Galahad 
                        of the Round Table. For your King 
                        was slain.

           Though Galahad already knows, the truth knocks him back.

                                 GALAHAD
                        By whom? What have you seen?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I have seen no more than you. Most 
                        often, a King’s murder leaves only 
                        one witness.
                             (stands; follow me)
                        Of assassins, I possess no 
                        knowledge. Of science, I do.

           A SQUARE OF PARCHMENT sits on another worktable. It has a 
           smear of residue at its center. 

           Next to it, there is a phial containing a brackish brown 
           liquid. Mer’Lin shows Galahad the PHIAL.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Concentrated needlespore. Made from 
                        the seeds of a needlestalk, a 
                        waterless plant that grows in the 
                        desert sands. The seeds will burn 
                        and numb the mouths of creatures 
                        that try to feed on them. However, 
                        when made into concentrate...

           Brother Mer’Lin leads Galahad to a monkey’s cage. The monkey 
           leaps about, SCREECHING and SHAKING the iron bars.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                             (to the monkey)
                        Easy, my friend. Easy. 

           Brother Mer’Lin uncorks the phial and holds it over the cage. 
           The monkey, expecting food, climbs up toward it -- 

           A SINGLE DROPLET falls into the monkey’s mouth. In seconds, 
           the monkey drops down to the floor of the cage. It THRASHES 
           about, HISSING and SCREAMING. The monkey slows, staggers and 
           finally collapses in a lifeless heap.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Mother have mercy.
                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Needlespore is instantly deadly in 
                        any beast, including man. Easy to 
                        transport, nearly traceless.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Nearly?

           Brother Mer’Lin smiles. He opens the cage and removes the 
           monkey, laying it down on the worktable. With a small metal 
           tool, Mer’Lin takes a scraping from the monkey’s mouth. He 
           wipes the sample onto a square of parchment.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Simple spirits.

           Brother Mer’Lin opens another phial. He drops alcohol onto 
           the parchment with the needlespore sample. It foams on 
           contact. He then lays out a second square of parchment --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        This is a scraping I took from the 
                        King’s mouth this morning.

           Another drop of alcohol produces the same foaming result.

                                 GALAHAD
                        This is your evidence?

           Brother Mer’Lin picks up the phial of needlespore again. He 
           holds it under Galahad’s nose --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Inhale this. Not too close.

           Carefully, Galahad sniffs at the phial. Even inches from his 
           nose, the mere stench sends him reeling and COUGHING --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I discovered this cork near the 
                        King’s body.

           Brother Mer’Lin produces the small cork he found. Galahad 
           takes it. Sniffs it and recoils again --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I had six phials of needlespore 
                        last night. This morning, I woke to 
                        five. It is rare and difficult to 
                        make. I use it to destroy my 
                        specimens for study because it 
                        corrupts the internal mechanisms 
                        the least of the known poisons.
                                 GALAHAD
                        Who would have access to your 
                        chambers?

           Brother Mer’Lin leads Galahad to a stone slab large. A sheet 
           covers whatever lies on top. He pulls back the sheet --

           BROTHER CULWYCH lies dead on the slab. A nasty SWORD WOUND 
           has erupted from his face between his nose and upper lip 
           where Lancelot ran him through.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        This is Brother Culwych, one of my 
                        initiates. Found in the monastery 
                        corridor early this morning.
                             (looking up at Galahad)
                        I discovered a purse of fifty gold 
                        pieces beneath a loose stone in his 
                        quarters. Fifty gold. I suppose 
                        every man has his price.

           Galahad looks at Mer’Lin, the dead monkey, the body. He 
           calculates, sorts information, considers his options...

           EXT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - COURTYARD - DAY

           A RIDER races down the hill toward Galahad’s estate.

           IN THE COURTYARD

           Lynette, Galahad’s wife, fusses in an expansive garden. The 
           sound of HOOVES gets her attention. Then --

                                 SERVANT (O.S.)
                        Rider!

           Dusting herself off, Lynette rushes out to meet the rider.

           THE RIDER

           Is from Camelot, wearing the Pendragon crest and colors.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Is there news from Camelot?

                                 MESSENGER RIDER
                        Aye. Dark news, my Lady.

           Lynette is suddenly alarmed: No, not Galahad, no --

                                 LYNETTE
                        What? What is it?
                                 MESSENGER RIDER
                        The King, my Lady. His Grace has... 
                        passed.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Arthur is dead?

           The rider dips his head. Aye.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Do you carry any word from Sir 
                        Galahad? A letter, perhaps?

                                 MESSENGER RIDER
                        None, my Lady. But Sir Galahad 
                        maintains his command of The Six 
                        with great honor.

           Lynette is heartbroken. She fakes a smile to thank him.

           INT. ROYAL CRYPT - DUSK

           MORGAN LA FEY, tiny and hooded, SINGS A DIRGE that fills the 
           royal crypt with her otherworldly voice. She is the “Mother’s 
           Daughter,” head of the Druid order. Firelight whips and 
           flickers off the mausoleum’s old stone walls.

           KING ARTHUR PENDRAGON stands erect in his crypt. 

           Wearing full armor and heraldry, he has a DRAGON-CRESTED 
           SHIELD between his arms and a sword gripped in his hands, 
           pointed down at his feet. 

           Were this not a funeral, the King might look alive.

           THE MOURNERS face the front of the crypt, all swathed in 
           black. Queen Guinevere and Prince Mordred are at the head of 
           the attending with The Round Table just behind them.

           LATER, A STONE SLAB

           Slides past the King’s body, stone GRINDING on stone as the 
           moving shadow consumes the last of the dancing firelight.

           Then, the King’s crypt is sealed.

           EXT. THE STONEHENGE - NIGHT

           Galahad approaches Sir Gawain, who appears even more gaunt in 
           the moonlight where he is posted outside The Stonehenge.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Mordred is within?
           Gawain nods. His voice is a DRY GARGLE from disuse:

                                 GAWAIN
                        Came to pray.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Go ahead back. I will escort him 
                        from here. Thank you, Sir Gawain.

           Gawain offers a shallow bow before leaving Galahad.

           INSIDE THE STONEHENGE

           Galahad approaches Mordred, who still wears black mourning 
           from his father’s funeral. The boy recites a scripted prayer 
           in the OLD TONGUE. Galahad startles him:

                                 GALAHAD
                        You pray for forgiveness.

                                 MORDRED
                        Galahad -- I -- I did not --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Forgiveness for what, my Prince?

           Galahad kneels beside Mordred, non-confrontational.

                                 MORDRED
                        How do you define honor, Galahad? 
                        Honor as you have taught me?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Honor is being just, acting above 
                        self, no matter the consequence.

           Mordred releases a short SOB --

                                 GALAHAD
                        What did you see, Mordred? 

           The boy CRIES softly beside Galahad. Gently, Galahad pursues:

                                 GALAHAD
                        You were watching your father from 
                        the siege passage that night. You 
                        must tell me what you saw.

                                 MORDRED
                             (crying)
                        She told him she would not have me 
                        inherit a conquered throne...

           Galahad lowers his gaze, the burden of this knowledge just 
           beginning to weigh on him. The Queen has murdered the King.
           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - OUTSIDE ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Percival stands post again outside the royal chambers. There 
           are FOOTFALLS ascending the stairwell. Percival straightens --

           GALAHAD emerges.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        My Lord?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Is anyone with you?

           Percival is alert, sensing that something is afoot.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        I’m alone, my Lord.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I need you to meet me at twilight, 
                        at the Stonehenge. 

                                 PERCIVAL
                        What is wrong, my Lord?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Dress for travel. Come alone and 
                        armed. Tell no one.

           Galahad leaves Percival, heading back down the stairs.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Percival walks the corridors. He has direction and purpose. 
           He stops at a door and KNOCKS. A moment passes --

           THE DOOR OPENS with Lancelot standing on the other side.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Percival? What bloody, Motherless 
                        hour --

                                 PERCIVAL
                        -- Galahad suspects something.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Oh? And what might that be?

                                 PERCIVAL
                        Why did you take my post the night 
                        Arthur died?

                                 LANCELOT
                        Arthur sent for me. 
                                 PERCIVAL
                        No page left his solar that night.

           Lancelot smiles reassuringly. He walks out of his quarters, 
           putting an arm around Percival and hugging him close.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Come. I think we are all a little 
                        mad with grief, aren’t we? 

           The gesture disarms Percival. Lancelot walks with him --

                                 PERCIVAL
                        I think he suspects me, Lancelot.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Our King has died and we, his 
                        knights of the Round Table, are 
                        blaming ourselves, thinking we 
                        could have done something to 
                        protect him.

           Still walking, they approach a spiral stairwell --

                                 LANCELOT
                        But no one could protect Arthur 
                        from what killed him. You and I 
                        shall go speak to Galahad together.

                                 PERCIVAL
                        He asked me to come alone.

           The steep stairwell is just a few feet away from them --

                                 LANCELOT
                        Did he? And what did you tell him?

           Lancelot stops Percival at the top of the steps. Percival 
           turns around to face him. What do you mean?

                                 PERCIVAL
                        There was nothing to tell, my Lord.

                                 LANCELOT
                             (relieved)
                        Aye. Nothing to tell.

           SUDDENLY - Lancelot raises his boot and KICKS Percival hard 
           in the chest, sending him flailing backwards down the steep 
           stone steps of the stairwell -- 

           PERCIVAL’S HEAD is first to strike the steps and does so with 
           a SOFT CRUNCH like a crushed melon.

           Lancelot peers down after Percival. There is no movement.
           EXT. THE STONEHENGE - NIGHT

           Galahad, unarmed, waits inside the Stonehenge. He is dressed 
           for travel a heavy cloak draped over his shoulders. He looks 
           up. Someone is coming. He squints in the darkness -- 

           A SILHOUETTE walks between a pair of the giant stones --

           Galahad rises to his feet --

           ANOTHER SILHOUETTE appears from behind another stone. Across 
           from that one, a THIRD. It is LANCELOT, CARADOC and GAWAIN --

           Galahad whirls, running for the other side of the stones.

           OUTSIDE THE STONEHENGE

           A saddled horse waits for Galahad, a sheathed sword slung 
           across the black charger’s back. Galahad runs for his horse --

           BUT MALAGANT steps in front of him, knocking him down. 
           Malagant draws his sword and points it at Galahad’s throat --

                                 MALAGANT
                        Never thought Galahad the Gallant 
                        would turn traitor on us.

           Malagant smiles down at him with his horrible, tattooed grin.

           Lancelot, Gawain and Caradoc appear. They surround Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Where is Percival?

                                 LANCELOT
                        Percival tried to cut my throat, so 
                        I broke his bloody neck. Why did he 
                        come to my quarters accusing me of 
                        treason, Galahad?
                             (re: the horse)
                        And where were you and he spiriting 
                        off to this fine eve?

           Galahad knows that he has been defeated. This FADES TO --

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - DUNGEON CELL - TIME UNKNOWN

           Natural light is alien to this dismal stone cell. Rusted iron 
           bars enclose Galahad within a six foot square cage. The lone 
           furnishing is a CHAMBER POT that is full to flooding. 

           Galahad is dressed in a peasant’s rags. Judging by his beard 
           and hygiene, it’s clear that he has been here for some time.
           FOOTFALLS ECHO in the corridor outside Galahad’s cell. He 
           squints, torchlight coming closer to him in the darkness --

           THE LADY GUINEVERE arrives at the head of a group assembled 
           of Lancelot, Gawain, Caradoc and Malagant. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Oh, Galahad. My heart aches to see 
                        my noble First Knight in such a 
                        state. But the news I bear cuts me 
                        even deeper.

           Galahad looks up at her, but says nothing.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        The city guard completed their 
                        search of your quarters. Inside, 
                        they found this --

           Lady Guinevere shows Galahad the GLASS PHIAL, still caked in 
           the brown residue of the poison that killed the King.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- Poison. A coward’s weapon. Do 
                        you wish to confess to your crimes 
                        this day, Galahad?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Six times you have come here to ask 
                        that and six times I have turned 
                        you away, Your Grace.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Perhaps it was Percival who 
                        committed the act and you were 
                        simply trying to help him escape?

                                 GALAHAD
                        My answer has not changed. Will I 
                        see you again tomorrow, Your Grace?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        No. This cell will be empty 
                        tomorrow. You see, outside these 
                        castle gates, five thousand Britons 
                        have gathered to call for your 
                        traitorous head. And when it 
                        tumbles to them from the headsman’s 
                        stone, you will have given them 
                        your confession, spoken or not.

           EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

           Five thousand BRITONS, from the noble to the ragged poor, 
           flood inside the Castle Camelot’s outer walls. 
           A HEADSMAN patrols a raised wooden platform.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

           Lady Guinevere walks at the head of the four Round Table 
           Knights. The knights surround Galahad, who is flanked on 
           either side by a half dozen CITY GUARDSMEN. 

           THE YAWNING FRONT GATE awaits them where the sounds of the 
           GATHERING MOB outside begin to waft inside --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Use your wits, brothers. You know 
                        that I did not do this.

           The Round Table Knights stare straight ahead as they march.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You waste your words, Galahad. You 
                        cannot turn our most loyal knights 
                        upon the crown as you did Percival.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Ask yourselves why. Why would I 
                        have slain the King?

           Caradoc glances sidelong at Galahad. Does he speak the truth?

           Lady Guinevere turns, halting the march to the castle gate.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        How great a fool do you take me 
                        for, Galahad? Do you think I do not 
                        speak to my son? 

           Galahad squints. Mordred?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You have been counseling him for 
                        years now as your squire. He has 
                        told me of the seeds you planted 
                        with him. Seeds that you hoped 
                        would bear fruit once he is made 
                        King. Land. Wealth. Titles. Power. 
                        The gifts a King can provide are 
                        nearly limitless, are they not?

           Galahad stares back, horrified at her vicious lies.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (addressing the group)
                        Have no illusions, Knights of the 
                        Round Table: Sir Galahad’s vile 
                        crimes were meticulously planned. 
                             (looking right at Galahad)
                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT'D)
                        Galahad designed every facet of our 
                        good King’s fate. And now, he will 
                        pay for his unspeakable treason.

           Lady Guinevere spins on a heel, starting the march again --

           As Galahad walks, he eyes a particular HANGING TAPESTRY on 
           the corridor wall to his right. He looks ahead. Only a 
           hundred feet now stand between him and his doom --

           The group’s march comes even with the tapestry --

           Galahad grasps the dirk (a shortsword) of the CITY GUARDSMAN 
           marching on his left -- As he pulls it free from its sheathe, 
           Galahad thrusts his boot into the guard marching at his 
           right, sending him CRASHING into the corridor wall --

           Galahad tears down the tapestry, revealing an IRON LEVER 
           hidden behind it -- He pulls the lever -- COUNTERWEIGHTS 
           CRANK behind the wall as a hidden passage SLIDES OPEN --

           Lancelot is first to draw his sword in the chaos --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Stop him!

           Malagant reaches out an arm to stop him from escaping -- 
           Galahad BASHES it with the dirk’s hilt -- Malagant SNARLS --

           Galahad spins and PARRIES Lancelot’s descending sword slash -- 
           CLANG! -- Galahad races toward the HIDDEN PASSAGE -- 

           Lancelot is right at his heels -- He lunges, SLASHING at 
           Galahad’s back, opening a DIAGONAL WOUND from Galahad’s 
           shoulder to his hip just as he vanishes into the PASSAGE --

           The COUNTERWEIGHT CLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACKS as Galahad throws 
           the lever inside the passage to close the stone door -- 

           Malagant ROARS and shoves the pursuing Lancelot aside as he 
           dives into the opening after Galahad -- But not fast enough.

           The heavy stone door CLOSES against Malagant, pinning him 
           between the moving door and the stone wall -- His steel 
           breastplate CRUMPLES against his chest -- Malagant HOWLS --

                                 LANCELOT
                        Get him out of there!

           Two guardsmen go to Malagant -- But Malagant the Mad is 
           frothing from the lips, wild-eyed with pain, wrath and 
           unbridled insanity --

                                 LANCELOT
                        No! The lever, you idiots!
           -- Too late. Malagant grabs a guard’s head with his free arm 
           and BASHES his face into the stone wall, CRUSHING his skull. 

           As the second guard tries to escape from Malagant’s range, 
           Malagant palms his face and twists it, SNAPPING his neck --

           Caradoc runs to the lever and PULLS it, opening the passage 
           door again -- CLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACK --

           Malagant PUSHES the heavy stone door off his chest and 
           collapses to his knees. His steel breastplate is CAVED IN.

           Lancelot steps around Malagant and the two dead guards into --

           THE HIDDEN PASSAGE

           Where TUNNELS disappear into infinity. And Galahad is gone.

           IN THE CORRIDOR

           Lancelot returns to the aftermath of Galahad’s escape -- Two 
           dead guards. Two more injured. Malagant’s injury. His crushed 
           breastplate. The Lady Guinevere’s quiet rage.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (calm fury)
                        Sir Lancelot, I am promoting you to 
                        First Knight. You may command the 
                        search from my chambers. Start by 
                        sending every city guardsman in the 
                        castle into that passage.
                             (to Gawain)
                        Sir Gawain, seal off the castle and 
                        close the city gates. No one enters 
                        or leaves Camelot until Galahad is 
                        found. 

           A CHANT rises from the gathered mob in the courtyard --

           EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - SAME TIME

           The crowd CLAPS their hands and STOMPS feet and staves in 
           rhythm with the loud CHANT they direct at the HEADSMAN --

           EXT. CASTLE ROOF - SAME TIME

           Galahad skulks along the Castle Camelot’s rooftop. 

           He slows to a stop, wincing in pain. Peers over the edge --

           THE CROWD BELOW chants: “Blood! Blood! Blood!” --

           Galahad crouches down. Gingerly, he peels his bloody tunic 
           away from the NASTY SWORD WOUND running across his back. 
           Galahad ties the ruined shirt around his waist, creating a 
           makeshift sword belt where he holsters his STOLEN DIRK. 

           EXT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - DAY

           The castle portcullis, a snarling jaw of heavy black iron, 
           makes its slow descent until the gate’s teeth bite into a 
           recessed stone channel below. The castle gate is sealed.

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - DUSK

           The city of Camelot is aglow in the final orange embers of 
           daylight as the sun dips behind the mountains to the west.

           ONE BY ONE, the city’s FOUR POSTERN GATES are closed and 
           sealed. Fortified as if against an invading army’s siege.

           Galahad is now trapped inside the City of Camelot.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - CASTLE PASSAGES - NIGHT

           Galahad moves from tunnel to passage to tunnel, through the 
           interior walls of the castle. A torch lights his way as --

           He SLOSHES through a puddle of ground water that has 
           collected in a passage. Galahad stops, turns his back to the 
           puddle and holds out the torch, lighting HIS REFLECTION --

           Galahad grimaces. This wound will kill him if not treated.

           The SOUND OF SOLDIERS nearby -- He gathers himself, moves --

           LATER, IN ANOTHER TUNNEL

           Galahad feels his way along, trying to recall the direction 
           of these tunnels from memory. 

           LATER, IN A NARROW PASSAGE

           Galahad watches through tiny slats carved into the wall of 
           the Lady Guinevere’s bedchamber --

           INSIDE: Galahad sees Guinevere nude and mounted atop someone. 
           She CRIES OUT in ecstasy. The man spins her onto her back --

           IT IS LANCELOT.

           Galahad turns away, how could I have not seen this before?

           INT. KING’S SOLAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Gawain, Caradoc and Malagant enter the royal solar where 
           Lancelot stands guard beside Lady Guinevere.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You have not found Galahad.

                                 MALAGANT
                        The castle is a bloody spider’s 
                        nest of tunnels. He could be 
                        anywhere.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Thank you, Malagant. Your utility 
                        to the crown continues to be the 
                        stuff of legend.

           Malagant spits.

                                 CARADOC
                        Your Grace, surely someone must 
                        possess knowledge of Camelot’s 
                        interior. Some castle knight, or --

                                 LANCELOT
                        -- Arthur refused to employ the 
                        passages during his reign. His 
                        Grace did not... care for the 
                        confined spaces. The soldiers from 
                        Uther’s rule are long gone.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Who else? A mesnie of the city 
                        guard? One of Galahad’s former men?

           Gawain CACKLES a hard laugh.

                                 LANCELOT
                        What are you laughing about?

                                 GAWAIN
                        One of them was Uther’s man.

                                 LANCELOT
                        And?

                                 GAWAIN
                        Malagant brained the man inside his 
                        own helmet while Galahad escaped.

           Lancelot and Guinevere look to Malagant. Why him of all -- ?

                                 MALAGANT
                        Fuck. Him.

                                 LANCELOT
                        It is all moot. I laid blade to 
                        flesh. An inch closer and it would 
                        have bled Galahad already. 
                                 LANCELOT (CONT'D)
                        With luck, the wound will fester 
                        and he will die within the castle 
                        walls like a starved rat.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I want that traitor’s head. And if 
                        I cannot have his, I will have 
                        another. Find him.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           CITY MILITIA march through the castle, looking behind 
           tapestries, searching for hidden switches or levers --

           INT. HIDDEN PASSAGE - NIGHT

           Galahad struggles to stay on his feet. Wracked with pain and 
           exhaustion, every movement is a struggle. 

           But there are FOOTSTEPS near. Close. Very close. Galahad 
           smothers his torch. The fire HISSES on cold stone. 

           He feels around for something -- Then, he puts his hand on --

           A DEEP NICHE dug into the wall, almost like the slab for a 
           coffin in a crypt. Galahad ducks into the niche. 

           The FOOTFALLS are close. TORCHLIGHT rounds the corner --

           Inside the niche, Galahad has to lie flat on his back to 
           shimmy deeper within so he won’t be seen -- He bites his lip 
           in agony as he grates his wounded back against the stone --

           Moments later, GAWAIN passes by the niche with a group of 
           city guardsmen. Torchlight illuminates Galahad’s arm...

           ... But no one sees him. They are gone. Shivering from 
           sickness, Galahad slowly drifts into fevered sleep... 

           EXT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - TRAINING YARD - DAY (DREAM)

           The white-washed images of Galahad’s fevered memory...

           Lucan’s face is drenched in sweat. He SLASHES forward with a 
           training sword, one that has been blunted for practice. His 
           opponent is Galahad, who easily DEFLECTS the slash -- 

                                 GALAHAD
                        Move your feet, Lucan. Your power, 
                        your speed, your balance -- they 
                        are all born from good footwork.

           Lucan takes the instruction, sets his feet.
                                 LUCAN
                        Let us play at roles now; make this 
                        interesting.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Sir Galahad of Avalon is not 
                        compelling enough an opponent for 
                        his own son? 

           ANGLE ON - Lynette watches, laughing at Galahad.

                                 LUCAN
                        I favor the Uther Pendragon II’s 
                        Battle of Wager, accused of treason 
                        by his son Lord Mordred I. Trial by 
                        combat; father against son.

                                 GALAHAD
                        You do recall who was judged guilty 
                        before the eyes of the Goddess?

           Lucan prepares a slash -- he comes at Galahad, grinning --

                                 LUCAN
                        Aye -- Mordred slew his father in 
                        three moves!

           CLANG! -- Galahad deflects the blow with a quick parry --

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - SIEGE TUNNELS - DAY

           -- CLANG! Galahad, pale and sickly, runs stiffly through a 
           passage. Every few yards, he looks over his shoulder --

           The METAL SOUNDS OF SOLDIERS pursue -- Galahad turns into 
           another tunnel --

           Moments later, THREE CITY GUARDSMEN run past. Galahad feels 
           around in the dark, pawing his way forward --

           INT. CIRCULAR CHAMBER - DAY

           The morning sun lances into the halls of the Castle Camelot. 
           At the castle’s center stands a spiral tower to which all 
           corridors connect. In the tower, there are square portholes 
           cut into the tall stone structure.

           MALAGANT walks out of a corridor, stops at one of these holes 
           and pisses into it --

           INT. LATRINE - CONTINUOUS

           Malagant’s urine trickles down the waste-slicked latrine -- 
           GALAHAD crouches at the edge of this filthy channel. Covered 
           in grime from his journey, he looks ill from the stench. But 
           he looks back to where he came from. This is the only way.

           As Galahad squeezes himself inside the center channel, his 
           head spins with pain, dehydration, exhaustion... the awful 
           stench... Galahad GAGS, vomiting into the latrine -- 

           He presses forward, arms and legs splayed to support him in 
           the channel -- But he slips, SLAMMING his wounded back -- 
           Galahad SCREAMS, now SLIDING on his bare back against the 
           stone as he slides down the channel coated in piss and shit --

           Galahad finally catches himself, stopping his slide. 

           AT THE SHAFT’S OUTLET

           Galahad sees daylight filtering inside the channel. He picks 
           up his pace, heading for the outside light. At the end sits --

           AN IRON GRATE, blocking the latrine channel’s exit. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        My kingdom for some bloody luck.

           Galahad KICKS the grate in a rage -- and the iron gives a 
           little. Encouraged, he reaches for his holstered dirk --

           And he goes to work, SAWING the corroding iron where years of 
           exposure to human waste has eaten at the metal. 

           LATER, NIGHT HAS FALLEN

           And still Galahad works. The dirk’s blade is worn, chipped 
           and broken from sawing at the corroded iron for hours. 
           Galahad is but steps away from death, pushed to the limits.

           His hand is wrapped tight in the ruined shirt that he had 
           used as a belt. He takes off the wrapping to look at his 
           hand, which is BLISTERED AND RAW.

           Galahad tucks the hand under his armpit and cocks his leg to 
           kick the grate  --

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE CAMELOT - NIGHT

           The circular grate BLASTS out of the latrine -- It SPLASHES 
           into a putrid, shallow CESSPOOL sitting below. 

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - NIGHT

           Galahad runs away from the castle, up a steep hill and into 
           the heart of the city where scattered fires light the dark --
           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - NIGHT

           Galahad stumbles into the front hall of the monastery.

           A DRUID, seeing Galahad’s trouble, comes over to him.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I would like to see Brother 
                        Mer’Lin.

           And Galahad collapses. This FADES TO --

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE CAMELOT - DAY

           -- The afternoon sun beats down on the cess pool sitting 
           beneath the drain dumping sewage from the castle.

           A SQUADRON OF CITY GUARDS stands by the pooled human waste. 

           LANCELOT crests the rise, coming down the hill to join them.

                                 LANCELOT
                        What have you found, Sergeant?

           The Sergeant of the City Guard points at the open drain, 
           which is missing its grate. Lancelot shrugs like, so what?

                                 SERGEANT
                        There ain’t no grate on the drain, 
                        my Lord. All the drains have 
                        grates. They was put in at the 
                        Master of Grounds’ orders. In case 
                        of seige. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        Did you find the grate?

                                 SERGEANT
                        No, my Lord. ‘Tis probably 
                        somewhere in the... [cesspool]

           Lancelot is repulsed. He takes a big step away from the bog.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Do tell me, Sergeant, when you are 
                        ready to search for evidence that 
                        Galahad has escaped the castle. I 
                        would like to have some proof to 
                        share with the Queen before sending 
                        200 swords into the homes of our 
                        city’s peaceful denizens.

           The Sergeant stares stupidly back at Lancelot.
                                 LANCELOT
                        Get thine self into the shit pool, 
                        Sergeant.

           The less-than-thrilled Sergeant wades into the cesspool.

                                 LANCELOT
                        The rest of you as well.

           More reluctant men trudge one-by-one into the fetid bog --

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - KING’S SOLAR - DAY

           Lady Guinevere peers down at the filthy, kneeling SERGEANT, 
           who holds up Galahad’s stained, RUINED DIRK as proof of 
           Galahad’s escape. She wrinkles her nose at the stench of him.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        It appears Sir Galahad has slipped 
                        through your net, Sir Lancelot.

           Lancelot keeps his distance like the Sergeant is contagious.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Take The Green Knight off his post 
                        with Mordred. Each of you take a 
                        squadron of foot into the city. 
                        Galahad may have escaped my castle, 
                        but he cannot escape my city.
                             (to the Sergeant)
                        Sergeant, have my servants give you 
                        a hot bath. Instruct them to burn 
                        your clothes. 

                                 SERGEANT
                        Yes, Your Grace. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        And if that should fail to remedy 
                        this stench, you might ask them to 
                        burn you, as well.

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           This dank room is the hospital, but it may be better suited 
           as the workshop of a madman. Sick beds occupy half the room. 
           The other half is a work area cluttered with medical tools 
           and a dozen dead creatures that are pickled in glass jars.

           ANGLE ON - Galahad rests in a medicated sleep.

           SUDDENLY - COMMOTION -- Boots STOMPING on stone, chainmail 
           shirts RUSTLING and drawn swords RATTLING in mailed grips --
           MER’LIN appears, rushing into the room -- He drags Galahad 
           out of his drugged slumber onto unsteady feet --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Soldiers! Onto the bier! Quickly!

           Galahad rolls onto a STONE SLAB. 

           Mer’Lin throws a heavy woolen blanket over him.

           MOMENTS LATER - Lancelot strides into the room at the lead of 
           a half dozen CITY MILITIA. 

           Brother Mer’Lin looks up from a slop bucket where he washes 
           his hands. He grabs a cloth towel and draws back his hood --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Ah, what aid can I provide to the 
                        Queen’s Round Table?

                                 LANCELOT
                             (to his men)
                        Search it.
                             (back to Mer’Lin)
                        I hunt the fugitive Galahad.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                             (hanging his head)
                        An ignoble deed. To slay his own 
                        King. The Shadows surely await him.

           Suspicious, Lancelot scans the room. He watches as his men 
           open closet and cabinet doors and look under beds --

                                 LANCELOT
                        He was injured in his escape. 
                        Perhaps mortally. You have not 
                        treated him?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        My beds have been overwhelmed with 
                        tradesmen injuries, toothaches and 
                        old age of late, but no healthy 
                        soldiers have entered here. You 
                        have visited the castle infirmary?

           Ignoring him, Lancelot begins to search the room himself. He 
           soon lays eyes on the STONE BIER where Galahad is hidden. 

           Brother Mer’Lin watches as Lancelot reaches for the blanket --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN (O.S.)
                        I would not, my Lord!

           -- Lancelot freezes where he stands --
                                 BROTHER MER’LIN 
                        Plague has surfaced again in the 
                        marshlands of Wandesboro. 

           Lancelot quickly backs away from Galahad’s “corpse,” shaken, 
           not knowing what to do or where to go --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        “The creeper” is a virulent enemy. 
                        Transmission is swift. I of course 
                        have taken every precaution...

           Mer’Lin towels wet blood off his hands. The sight of the gore 
           is too much for Lancelot. He cannot wait to leave the room --

                                 LANCELOT
                        We shall, ah, continue the search 
                        in the upper halls.

           Lancelot pushes through his men -- He is the first one out of 
           the room. His soldiers follow close behind.

           ANGLE ON - Galahad is on his feet, visible again. All of this 
           takes quite a bit of effort. He wavers, unsteady. Mer’Lin 
           rushes over to offer himself as human crutch --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        We among the living welcome you 
                        back, Sir Galahad.

           Mer’Lin helps Galahad back to his sickbed. 

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I almost lost you. I had to keep 
                        you unconscious with an opium 
                        sponge so that your body’s every 
                        resource could battle the wound’s 
                        corruption. 
                             (signals “turn around”)
                        Please, sit.

           Brother Mer’Lin examines Galahad’s wound, which has been 
           covered in matted wool that looks like a green mud. He peels 
           a tiny corner away to expose ANGRY RED FLESH beneath --

           Galahad recoils, COUGHING at a sudden smell --

                                 GALAHAD
                        What is that stench?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        The sulfur salts counteract the 
                        adulteration of the flesh. 

           Mer’Lin covers the wound and pats Galahad on the shoulder.
                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        It seems to be on the mend. Another  
                        week or so and you will be nearly 
                        recovered --

           Galahad is not staying a week. He’s already on his feet -- 
           Looking for clothes, boots --

                                 GALAHAD
                        -- Your kindness will not soon be 
                        forgotten. But I am not safe here 
                        and you are not safe having me.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        And what do you mean to do? Storm 
                        the gates yourself? Demand a 
                        confession from the Queen?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I will leave the city and make for 
                        Avalon. Lord Pellinore will hear my 
                        case and I will return with his 
                        support and sufficient force to 
                        depose Guinevere and install 
                        Mordred as the rightful King.

           Brother Mer’Lin, though unaggressive, blocks Galahad’s exit -- 
           Galahad tries to muscle around him, but is overcome by the 
           effort and stumbles, crashing to the ground --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Stay. Rest. Regain your strength.
                        You will find as much safety here 
                        as you will anywhere within the 
                        city walls. And with those barred 
                        and sealed by Lady Guinevere to 
                        both ingress and egress until you 
                        are found, the monastery is your 
                        best option for shelter.

                                 GALAHAD
                        It is not shelter I seek.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Of course not. Like any soldier 
                        with cock and steel, you seek 
                        revenge.

           Galahad forces himself back to his feet. Unsteady --

                                 GALAHAD
                        No. Only justice.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        The distinction matters little. 
                        Each is won in blood.
           EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE CAMELOT - NIGHT

           Lancelot shepherds his empty-handed search party up the stone 
           bridge leading to the castle gates.

           HORSE HOOVES beat the earth behind him -- Louder and LOUDER -- 
           They are heading right for them --

           Hands move to swords. Lancelot remains calm.

           A SINGLE RIDER, an Albonese Scout, rides up to meet them. The 
           young lad (20) is travel worn, tired and haggard.

                                 LANCELOT
                        What invisible fiend might my Lord 
                        pursue so fiercely into Camelot?

                                 SCOUT
                        Piss off, grunt. ‘Tis the Queen’s 
                        business.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Aye, which oft lands in the lap of 
                        her First Knight. What news, scout?

                                 SCOUT
                             (squinting in the dark)
                        My Lord Galahad?

                                 LANCELOT
                        Twice the sword and half the 
                        nuisance to our Lady Queen, I’m 
                        afraid. It is “your Lord” Lancelot 
                        to whom you speak.

                                 SCOUT
                        M-my apologies, my Lord, I did not 
                        recognize my mighty Lord in the --

                                 LANCELOT
                        -- Save your back-tracking and 
                        flattery for someone who cares. 
                        What news do you bring?

           The scout offers a baleful look. 

                                 SCOUT
                        Saracens, my Lord. Raiding the 
                        White Valley, burning as they go.

           Lancelot’s eyes go ablaze with anger. He signals to the 
           scout, follow me. Together, they file into the castle --

           The gate descends behind them -- KA-CHUNK --
           EXT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - TRAINING YARD - DAY

           -- CLANG! On the grounds of Galahad’s expansive estate --

           A MUSCULAR BOY spars, SWORD-ON-SWORD, against the house’s 
           MASTER-AT-ARMS, (45) a grizzled old codger with once brown 
           hair that is now chased in white.

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        Move your bloody feet!

           The boy does so -- He evades -- The boy spins behind Master-
           at-Arms, SLAPPING his ass with the flat of his sword --

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        You’re an insufferable little shit, 
                        Lucan. But you have the makings of 
                        a gifted swordsman. Your father 
                        would be proud.

           Lucan (now 12), Galahad’s growing son, bows.

                                 LUCAN
                        Perhaps I will be as good as him.

                                 SERVANT (O.S.)
                        Master Lucan! Riders!

           The boy cannot run fast enough to find out whom --

           ON A HIGH HILL

           Lucan scampers up the hill to see into the valley below. Hope 
           wilts away into horror as he sees the riders clearly --

           SARACENS -- Twenty, maybe more -- Heading straight for them.

           Lucan whirls, running back down into the yard --

           ANGLE ON - Breathless, Lucan finds the Master-at-Arms 
           collecting their training equipment. Weapons, armor. 

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        Lucan, come and help me --

                                 LUCAN
                        -- SARACENS!

           The Master-at-Arms looks dismissive at first, but then sees 
           the boy is not stopping --

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        Bows. Arrows. Quickly!
           AT THE FRONT OF THE ESTATE

           The Saracen raiding party storms down the hill in a tempest 
           of THUNDER and rising dust. These raiders are dressed in 
           azure and gold. They are uniformed. These men are the 
           soldiers of an organized army. THE LEADER holds up the pack 
           with a hand. They survey the quiet estate. Nothing moves. 

                                 LEAD SARACEN
                             (subtitled)
                        These men worship the earth at our 
                        feet. Help them find their gods.

           As the Leader turns his horse -- ZIIIIIIP! -- An arrow slices 
           through the air, spearing a Saracen through the chest --

           The Leader bellows a BATTLE ULULATION -- “ATTACK!” -- And so 
           begins the charge right for the estate --

           INT. GALAHAD’S ESTATE - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME

           Lucan is crouched at a window down the hall from the Master-
           at-Arms. Both wield longbows --

           ANGLE ON - Lynette appears from an adjoining room --

                                 LYNETTE
                        Lucan, we must flee!

                                 LUCAN
                        Hide, mother!

                                 LYNETTE
                        Lucan!

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        Do what the boy says, my Lady! The 
                        savages are a-comin’ for us --
                             (to Lucan)
                        -- Make each arrow count, Lucan. 
                        Look through your target and --

           ZIP! Lucan’s arrow finds a charging Saracen --

                                 MASTER-AT-ARMS
                        -- Fletch the bastards!

           Lucan and the Master-at-Arms rip off ARROW after ARROW, some 
           finding their home, some not --

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR 

           CRASH! A Saracen rider crashes through the splintered front 
           door on horseback -- 
           A SERVANT appears from the kitchen, wielding a WOOD-AXE -- 
           The man, clearly not a fighter, takes a swing at the Saracen, 
           who CHOPS OFF the top of the servant’s head -- 

           Grinning, the Saracen dismounts and goes looking for trouble 
           when -- THE MASTER-AT-ARMS appears wielding a hand-axe and a 
           longsword -- He buries the hatchet in the Saracen’s skull and 
           then cuts him down -- CRASH! --

           -- The Master-at-Arms turns to find Saracens pouring in 
           through a ruptured wall in the house -- He’s all alone --

           Flashing scimitars meet the Master-at-Arms’ hand-axe and 
           sword -- He fights valiantly, but they are too much --

           His axe-hand is cut off at the shoulder -- A scimitar bursts 
           through his belly, cutting him from navel to shoulder -- 

           The Saracens toss his corpse aside and head for the stairs --

           INT. MASTER BEDCHAMBER - SAME TIME

           Lucan stands in front of his mother wielding a longsword. 
           Protective. Fearless. Just as his father would want. WHAM!

           The barred door shivers, dust falling away from it like snow.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Lucan!

                                 LUCAN
                        I will not let them harm you.

           WHAM! The door shakes again. This time, it gives a little. 

           Lucan licks his lips. His eyes widen. The boy is terrified.

           WHAM! The door splinters open -- Three Saracens rush into the 
           room, the first turning his sword to attack -- But he sees 
           the very young Lucan, and he hesitates -- 

           So Lucan runs his sword through the Saracen’s gut -- THEN --

           A ULULATING CALL rises from the yard outside -- In a moment, 
           the Saracens are gone, answering the call --

           Lucan and Lynette gape at one another. Are we saved? Lucan 
           goes over to examine his KILL. He looks at the WOUND, then at 
           his BLOODY SWORD... and drops to his knees and WRETCHES.

           EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME

           The Saracen raiding party scatters as a WEDGE OF MOUNTED 
           RIDERS FROM CAMELOT RUMBLES down the hill toward them --
           ANGLE ON - LANCELOT and MALAGANT ride at the head of the 
           charge -- The cavalry strikes the Saracens fleeing on foot -- 
           TEARING BODIES APART and TRAMPLING THEM beneath hooves --

           Malagant charges off to give chase to the horsed Saracens --

           While Lancelot dismounts to deal with the raiders on foot.

           Two Saracens approach the smiling Lancelot, who is already 
           buzzing with a battle high -- He meets a SLASH -- Parries, 
           twisting -- And pulls away causing the other Saracen 
           accidently to cut open his comrade --

                                 LANCELOT
                        My deepest thanks.

           Stunned, the Saracens stares stupidly at the untouched 
           Lancelot, who grins -- STEEL FLASHES -- Swish-swish -- Two 
           blinding fast cuts slice into the Saracen’s skull -- The top 
           two thirds of his skull slough away in opposite directions.

           ANGLE ON - Malagant rides hard after a Saracen fleeing on 
           horseback -- He gains ground on the slower horse -- Raises 
           his gigantic sword -- And severs the horse’s rear leg --

           The crippled horse immediately folds beneath its rider -- It 
           CRASHES to the ground beneath Malagant’s still-charging 
           warhorse, which stomps a MONSTROUS HOOF right through the 
           fallen rider’s skull --

           WHAM! Malagant is hit with a flail, sending him tumbling off 
           his own mount -- The giant man rolls to a stop on the ground 
           and is immediately on his feet, much to the surprise of the 
           SARACEN who unhorsed him -- The Saracen charges -- 

           Behind Malagant -- ANOTHER SARACEN SCREAMS, charging wildly 
           at him -- Malagant side-steps the charge, cutting through the 
           Saracen’s mid-section, severing his torso from the waist-up --

           The Saracen’s top half sails toward his flail-wielding 
           comrade -- The severed torso, still clutching a scimitar and 
           SCREAMING, buries its sword into the other charging Saracen. 
           This leaves both of them dead.

           ANGLE ON - Lucan and Lynette race from Galahad’s estate, 
           which is now BEING CONSUMED IN FLAMES --

           The rout is on. The Saracens the soldiers of Camelot have not 
           killed are fleeing into the surrounding woodlands.

           ANGLE ON - Lancelot, mounted again, charges toward Lynette -- 
           Then right past her to cut down another Saracen -- Lancelot 
           brings his horse about and offers out a hand to Lynette --

                                 LANCELOT
                        With me, my Lady!
           Lynette takes Lancelot’s hand. He pulls her into his saddle.

           ANGLE ON - Lucan, sword held at his side, stands frozen in 
           place as he watches the raging blaze devour his home. 

           Malagant rides up behind him, reaches down and pulls the boy 
           into his saddle with a single hand.

           LANCELOT’S MEN form up and charge North toward Camelot --

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Inside the monastery hospital, Mer’Lin changes Galahad’s 
           wound’s dressing. The flesh is raw but appears to be healing. 

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        The will of the flesh is a wondrous 
                        thing, Sir Galahad.

           A DRUID appears behind Mer’Lin. The Saracen turns around and 
           receives a rolled piece of parchment from the druid -- 

           Mer’Lin reads it, looks up at Galahad. Mother have mercy.

                                 GALAHAD
                        What is it?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Your wife and son are now in the 
                        custody of the Lady Guinevere.

           Galahad is already on his feet, looking around for supplies --

                                 GALAHAD
                        I need clothes, boots and a sword.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Yes, and a wizard to turn you 
                        invisible. I do not doubt your 
                        skill, Galahad, but what you aim to 
                        do is folly.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (stopping; intense)
                        The woman has my family, Mer’Lin.

           THE MESSENGER quietly withdraws. Mer’Lin watches him go --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Perhaps it is not a wizard you 
                        require.

           Galahad boils where he stands, eager for blood.
           INT. LADY GUINEVERE’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - DAY

           Lancelot strides across Lady Guinevere’s private chambers. He 
           finds her writing with quill and ink at her desk.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Lady Lynette and her son are 
                        settled in the guest quarters.
                             (a pause)
                        Those were Palamedes’ men who 
                        raided Galahad’s estate.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        That Saracen viper smells weakness 
                        in Camelot. He is testing us to see 
                        how we will react... Tell me, what 
                        has your search for Galahad 
                        yielded?

                                 LANCELOT
                        The man is a bloody phantom.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Is it possible he is already dead? 

                                 LANCELOT
                        Even Galahad’s corpse would not 
                        rest until it saw his duty carried 
                        out.

           Lady Guinevere is not amused.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I must have the traitor’s corpse, 
                        animated or rotting, before I can 
                        assemble the war council and bring 
                        the battle to Palamedes. I cannot 
                        call the Lords of Albion to Camelot 
                        with Galahad skulking around inside 
                        my castle walls.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Camelot’s walls are unscalable and 
                        the gates are double-sealed. We 
                        will find him, alive or dead. 

           She rises from her seat to meet Lancelot’s eyes.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        When I was a girl in Lyonesse, 
                        there was a cougar preying on my 
                        father’s livestock. He had his 
                        huntsmen searching day and night 
                        for the beast, but they could not 
                        find it. 
                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT'D)
                        Do you know how my father at last 
                        seized the creature?
                             (off Lancelot)
                        He found the cougar’s den. She was 
                        carrying back the sheep and goats 
                        to feed her cubs. My father bled 
                        four of them to put their scent in 
                        the air. The final cub he carried 
                        out into the woods and strangled. 
                        The cries of her dying offspring 
                        brought the mother immediately back 
                        to the den where my father and his 
                        men were waiting.

           Lancelot is aghast from this revelation.  

                                 LANCELOT
                        That is why you had me bring 
                        Galahad’s family here? To bait him? 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I wish only to restore order to the 
                        high seat of Albion, my love.

           Lancelot is shaken by the extent of the Queen’s evil.

           EXT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

           DOUBLE PARALLEL LINES OF DRUIDS hike up a steep incline 
           toward Camelot’s forboding black iron gate. 

           TWO PIKEMAN wielding huge halberds block their way.

                                 PIKEMAN
                        Sorry, Brothers. No one comes in or 
                        out. Queen’s orders.

           While the pikemen are distracted...

           ANGLE ON - A lone druid runs amidst the shadows of this 
           moonless night, beneath the castle bridge, up the steep slope 
           on the other side and on his way to the castle itself --

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - GUEST QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Lynette, Galahad’s wife, paces the well-adorned and lavishly 
           furnished guest quarters where she and Lucan are held.

           Lucan watches her as she paces.

                                 LUCAN
                        Why haven’t we seen father yet?

                                 LYNETTE
                        I don’t know, Lucan.
                                 LUCAN
                        Why is there a guard posted outside 
                        the door?

                                 LYNETTE
                        I don’t know, Lucan.

                                 LUCAN
                        Why are we here?

                                 LYNETTE
                        I don’t know, Lucan!

           Boots MARCH up outside the door. They SLIDE SOFTLY to a stop. 

           CREEEAAAAAK -- The door eases open to reveal --

           MALAGANT. All 7 feet of the tattooed madman glowers down at 
           Lynette. He does not take his eyes off her.

           And she knows why he’s here.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Lucan, go out into the hall.

                                 LUCAN
                        Mother?

                                 LYNETTE
                        Go. Now.

           Malagant closes the door behind him and SLAMS DOWN the iron 
           bar to LOCK it from the inside. 

                                 MALAGANT
                        The boy stays.

           Tears form in Lynette’s eyes, but she fights them back. She 
           cocks back her hand -- Swings wildly to slap Malagant -- 

           But Malagant palms her hand -- He spins her around and pushes 
           her face down into the bed furs --

           His tattooed skull grinning, Malagant advances on Lynette.

           INT. TUNNELS BENEATH CAMELOT - SAME TIME

           Hunched, Galahad slinks inside a narrow tunnel. His boots 
           SLOSH in the water that has collected in the tunnel’s trough.

           IN ANOTHER TUNNEL

           Galahad looks up to see BOOTS MARCHING across a grate in one 
           of the castle’s central arteries. When they are gone, he 
           positions himself to peer --
           THROUGH THE GRATE: Galahad sees nothing and no one, but the 
           view has a number of blind-spots. 

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - MAIN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           THE GRATE lifts up as Galahad strains under the weight of the 
           iron and the agony of it pressing against his sword wound --

           The grate tips over, RINGING loudly on the corridor’s floor.

           Galahad hoists himself out of the hole and into the castle. 
           Still in a crouch, Galahad hears --

                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN (O.S.)
                        Halt!

           Galahad (still disguised as a druid) freezes in his crouch. 

           A YOUNG CITY GUARDSMAN is alone on his patrol.

                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                        Rise. Slow now, brother.

           Galahad does as told. He rises and turns, his face hidden. 
           The guardsman approaches him cautiously, sword drawn.

                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                        Show yourself, druid.

           His hooded head shakes back and forth. No. 

                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                        Show your face to me or I shall be 
                        forced to cut you down.

           Galahad makes no move. 

                                 GALAHAD
                             (whispering)
                        Damn you, boy. Do not do this.

                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                        Did you just speak? What did you --

           The young guardsman reaches for Galahad’s hood, but Galahad 
           moves in a blur, shoving the boy into the corridor wall --

           The guardsman ROARS, coming at Galahad full bore -- Slashes 
           his sword in hopes of dealing a lethal blow -- 

           Galahad dips and dodges, avoiding the blade -- Galahad is 
           better, but the young guardsman does possess some skill -- 

           Galahad drops into a stance, a CURVED SCIMITAR flashing from 
           beneath his druid’s robes -- The boy frowns, that sword...
                                 YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                        A Saracen?

           The boy attacks -- The swords MEET! -- Again Galahad shoves 
           him away, but again the guardsman attacks -- And Galahad runs 
           the scimitar straight through the boy’s gut.

           Galahad kneels beside the dead guardsman and draws back the 
           hood of his robe. Underneath, Galahad wears the tiny goatee 
           of a druid initiate. The rest of his face and head have been 
           SHAVED BALD to complete his disguise as a druid.

           Galahad rolls the guardsman’s corpse through the hole into 
           the tunnels below and replaces the grate over the opening.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

           In another corridor, Galahad passes a group of CITY GUARDSMEN 
           who do not even acknowledge his presence.

           Disguised as a druid, Galahad is able to roam the castle with 
           total impunity.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - SAME TIME

           Lancelot and Lady Guinevere approach a large oaken door 
           posted by a CITY GUARDSMAN. The Queen carries the WOODEN BOX 
           where Galahad hid his letters. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Where is Malagant? I ordered him to 
                        hold this post.

           The nervous guardsman stammers out an explanation --

                                 NERVOUS GUARDSMAN
                        Ah, Sir Malagant... my Lady, Your 
                        Grace, I mean, he, ah, is within --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Inside?

           Lady Guinevere steps around the guardsman to open the door --

           INT. GUEST QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           -- Lady Guinevere walks inside the guest quarters. 

           Lynette stands, arms crossed, near the window. She’s weeping.

           Lucan sits in the corner at the far end of the room, staring 
           miles away. He cradles his arm. His face is bruised, scraped 
           and bloodied from trying to stop Malagant’s assault.
           Malagant steps out to face the Queen when she enters. He is 
           buckling on his sword-belt.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Sir Malagant -- I believe I posted 
                        you outside the guest quarters.

           Lancelot is shaken by what he sees, by Malagant’s cruelty.

                                 MALAGANT
                        You wanted them watched, Your 
                        Grace. They were watched.

           Malagant strides for the door, stepping around Lady 
           Guinevere. He reaches Lancelot, who stands in his way.

                                 MALAGANT
                        Piss off, Lancelot. Or might be 
                        I’ll use your arse for my scabbard.

           Malagant rests his palm on his sword hilt. Lancelot does not 
           budge. So Malagant moves him bodily out of the way.

           Lady Guinevere goes to Lynette and sits down beside her on 
           the windowsill. A bruise wells under Lynette’s eye and blood 
           runs from her nose. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Are you hurt, my Lady Lynette?

           Lady Guinevere takes out a handkerchief and dabs the blood.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        If Malagant has hurt you in any 
                        way, I will have his ugly head.

           Lynette says nothing. The Queen shows her the wooden box.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I wanted to show you this...

           She opens the box, revealing a STACK OF PARCHMENT LETTERS --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Letters that you sent your beloved 
                        husband. And letters, I think, that 
                        he wrote to you but never sent.

           Lynette takes the letters, her hands shaking --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        It appears to be one letter for 
                        each week that Galahad has served 
                        the crown. He seems to love you 
                        very much.
                                 LYNETTE
                             (through tears)
                        Where is Galahad?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        The letters were found when I was 
                        forced to have my men search Sir 
                        Galahad’s personal quarters.

           Lynette awaits the reason --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        It wounds me deeply to say that we 
                        also found a phial of poison. The 
                        same that was used to murder my 
                        husband, King Arthur Pendragon. 
                             (crocodile tears)
                        I’m afraid, my Lady, that Sir 
                        Galahad has slain our beloved King.

           Lynette LAUGHS aloud at the absurdity of Guinevere’s claim.

                                 LYNETTE
                        You must not know my husband, Lady 
                        Guinevere. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (pandering)
                        I apologize that you have not been 
                        acquainted with the principles of 
                        courtesy, Lady Lynette. Coming from 
                        such common stations as you and the 
                        assassin Galahad have, it is most 
                        understandable. With my husband 
                        gone, I am now the sitting Queen. 
                        Until the time when my son Mordred 
                        comes of age, you may address me as 
                        “Your Grace.”

           In a blur, Lynette is on her feet, the letters SPILLING OFF 
           HER LAP -- She winds up and SLAPS Guinevere across the face.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Fuck you, “Your Grace.”

           Lancelot grits his teeth, but makes no move for Lynette.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Mind your courtesies, my Lady.

           Lady Guinevere sets her jaw, standing to face Lynette with 
           her cheek red and stinging:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Galahad has committed the highest 
                        treason. 
                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT'D)
                        And if he fails to produce himself 
                        by first light, your son will be 
                        hanged in his father’s stead.

           Lucan’s heart begins to race, his mouth drying up --

                                 LYNETTE
                        You cannot. You would not.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You cannot, “Your Grace.” And I 
                        certainly can, my gentle Lady. I am 
                        the Queen of Albion.
                             (to Lancelot)
                        Come, Lancelot. Let us take our 
                        guests to the great hall.

                                 LYNETTE
                        NO!

           Lynette SHRIEKS -- Lancelot takes hold of her half-heartedly 
           She squirms as he drags her bodily from the room --

           EXT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

           Out in the corridor, Lynette writhes in Lancelot’s grip --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (to Lancelot)
                        Have the Round Table summoned. This 
                        madness ends today.

           Lynette THRASHES madly -- She’s BELLOWING bloody murder --

                                 LANCELOT
                        Shut up, woman!

           Lady Guinevere looks at Lancelot with a wry smile.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Let her scream if she must.

           Off the Queen’s smile, Lancelot recalls her tale about the 
           cougar and her dying cubs. This was the plan all along.

           INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

           This cavernous chamber has been host to hundreds of royal 
           banquets for a dozen Kings and Queens during its time. 

           Intricate tapestries cover each wall. The mounted heads of 
           beasts hang over a titanic open fireplace. 

           Suits of armor commemorating fallen warriors and kings line 
           the far wall.
           A dining table over 200 feet in length sits at the center of 
           the room, 50 high-backed oaken chairs on each side.

           Lady Guinevere leads the group into the room, Lancelot with 
           Lynette and the Nervous Guardsman with Lucan. Another group 
           of a half-dozen CITY GUARDSMEN enter behind the main group 
           for added fortification, led by the Sergeant.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (to a guardsman)
                        Fetch the cookstaff. I am sure Lady 
                        Lynette and Master Lucan are 
                        famished following their travels.
                             (to Sergeant)
                        Mind the passage. I am sure Sir 
                        Galahad will be eager to join us.

           THE SERGEANT tears down a tapestry. Behind it, there is a 
           HIDDEN DOOR barely visible outlined on the wall.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Please, sit. Refreshments will be 
                        along shortly. And so, too, I hope 
                        will Sir Galahad.

           Lady Guinevere smiles. She takes a seat at the table’s head.

           INT. HIDDEN PASSAGE - SAME TIME

           Galahad winds his way through a cramped passage hidden in 
           between the corridors of the Castle Camelot. 

           He knows the path he is on. Aimed, determined, unstoppable.

           INT. GREAT HALL - LATER

           The COOKSTAFF bring out plates of fowl, fruits, vegetables to 
           place before Lynette, Lucan, Lady Guinevere and Sir Lancelot. 
           As the servants set down the food...

           ANGLE ON - The doors suddenly swing open -- REVEALING: 
           Malagant, Gawain, and Caradoc. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Sirs. Welcome.

           LATER, IN THE GREAT HALL

           Lynette sits before untouched food. Lucan picks at his. 
           Malagant tears chunks from a huge turkey leg with his teeth.

           Lancelot drinks a cup of wine, leaning against the mantle 
           over THE FIREPLACE --
           The guardsmen intently watch the passage door that was hidden 
           behind the tapestry, ready to spring on Galahad --

                                 LANCELOT (O.S.)
                        Your Grace?

           LADY GUINEVERE startles -- HANDS REACH FOR SWORDS -- Chairs 
           GRIND on stone as everyone rises to their feet --

           ANGLE ON - Galahad has just emerged from a hidden passage 
           inside the FIREPLACE. He stands behind Lancelot with his 
           scimitar laid across Lancelot’s neck.

                                 LUCAN
                        Father!

           Gawain grabs Lynette’s jaw, pulling her into him. His 
           squinting eyes peer at Galahad from over her shoulder.

           Malagant draws his huge sword, putting it on a diagonal 
           across Lucan’s body. The sword is taller than he is.

           The Sergeant and his group of guardsmen advance on Galahad --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Sir Galahad. You are clearly 
                        outmanned. Throw down your sword 
                        and give your surrender. 

           Galahad draws Lancelot’s sword from his scabbard with his 
           free hand and THROWS IT AWAY --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Release them, Your Grace. Your 
                        quarrel is with me, not them.

           The guardsmen inch toward Galahad’s flanks -- He circles away 
           from them, holding Lancelot, protecting his position --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I’m afraid the Queen quarrel is 
                        with all who oppose her.

           Galahad circles away from the fireplace with Lancelot, 
           putting himself in a better position to move for his family --

           Lady Guinevere’s eyes move to THE FIREPLACE. His only chance 
           at escape. She calls to a COOK who is gaping at the scene --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You there, cook. Prepare a fire. 
                        This hall has taken a chill.

                                 YOUNG COOK
                        A fire, Your Grace?
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Yes, you fool. A fire. Are you a 
                        cook or is that a disguise as well?

           All eyes watch the young cook nervously approach the hearth. 
           He stacks logs of chopped wood inside the fireplace. When it 
           is done, he turns to Lady Guinevere --

                                 YOUNG COOK
                        I need to fetch some flint, Your --

           Lancelot, in Galahad’s grip, loses his patience and snaps:

                                 LANCELOT
                        -- Use a bloody torch, you jackass!

           The cook takes a burning torch from its sconce and throws it 
           atop the wood pile. The fire takes. In moments, the wood is 
           SPLITTING and CRACKING as the blaze rages. 

           Galahad’s exit passage is now blocked by the flames.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Your path to succor is blocked, Sir 
                        Galahad. Perhaps you will now 
                        rethink your desire to confess?

                                 GALAHAD
                        You are right. I have failed in my 
                        duty, Your Grace.

           The Lady Guinevere stifles a smile. I have him now. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Make your confession, Sir Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I chose not to share my knowledge 
                        of your murder of King Arthur with 
                        my brothers of the Round Table. Nor 
                        did I expose your breaking of your 
                        marital oath with Sir Lancelot. And 
                        in those matters, I have failed to 
                        uphold my oath.

           Malagant BOOMS LAUGHTER at Lancelot. Gawain’s eyes track back 
           and forth between Lancelot and Lady Guinevere.

           The Lady Guinevere is purple with rage. She turns to Gawain:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Sir Gawain, show Galahad the cost 
                        of defying his Queen.

           Galahad tightens his grip around Lancelot --
                                 GALAHAD
                        NO!

           Gawain does not hesitate. He slides the dirk from his baldric 
           and slits Lynette’s throat from ear to ear.

                                 LUCAN
                        Mother!

           Lucan writhes, SCREAMING in Malagant’s vise-like grip as he 
           watches his mother’s life pass from her -- 

           Lynette’s mouth makes soundless movements as blood runs in a 
           river down her gown. Soon, the light is gone from her eyes.

           Lancelot watches, helpless, as Gawain drops Lynette’s body.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Do not again underestimate my 
                        resolve, Sir Galahad.

           Staring down at Lynette’s lifeless body, Galahad slackens his 
           grip on Lancelot, just for a moment --

           And Lancelot elbows Galahad HARD in the gut -- OOF! --

           Lancelot breaks away, diving and rolling for his sword --

           GALAHAD IS EXPOSED. The guards descend on him --

           The dark, pattern-welded steel of Galahad’s scimitar FLASHES, 
           coming up to BEHEAD the first guardsman --

           CHAOS. 

           Galahad has been possessed. He cuts through the guards one at 
           a time, a man fighting against boys --

           ANGLE ON - Lucan, still held captive by Malagant, looks for 
           escape -- He peers down at the oiled boots that Malagant 
           wears and sees a SHEATHED DAGGER -- 

           Swiftly, Lucan bends, rips the dagger free and plunges it 
           into Malagant’s belly --

           Malagant’s sword CLATTERS to the ground as he ROARS in pain, 
           clutching the bloody dagger now protruding from his side --

           Lucan, freed, runs to join Galahad -- 

           Lady Guinevere watches the Great Hall devolve into chaos. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Stop them! Kill them both!

           Caradoc, Gawain and Lancelot draw steel --
           Lucan, stoops mid-stride to pick up a sword from a fallen 
           guardsman -- And in the same motion, Lucan CUTS DOWN one of 
           Galahad’s guardsman opponents from behind --

           Galahad beats back the final guardsman -- He shoves him away 
           to go for the killing strike, but Lucan steps between them, 
           DRIVES his sword into the guard’s gut and TWISTS -- 

           The guardsman gurgles blood at his mouth before collapsing.

           Galahad watches in surprise as his son coolly pulls the sword 
           blade out of the man he just killed.

           Lancelot and Gawain close on them -- Galahad grabs Lucan --

                                 GALAHAD
                        With me.

                                 LUCAN
                        I want Gawain!

           Lucan steps toward Gawain --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Now, damn it, Lucan!

           Galahad takes Lucan’s arm, leading him to the dining table -- 

           Galahad vaults himself on top, dragging Lucan behind him --

           ANGLE ON - Malagant, hand clutched at his bleeding side, 
           forces himself back to his feet with the aid of his sword --

           Atop the table, Lucan slips on a serving platter, CRASHING to 
           the table -- When Lucan looks to his side, he sees MALAGANT 
           nearly on top of him, sword raised like a chopping axe --

           WHAM! Malagant’s greatsword BITES deep into the dinning 
           table, missing Lucan -- Galahad has dragged him to safety --

           Together, Galahad and Lucan race for the wall lined in the 
           standing suits of armor --

           Behind, Galahad’s pursuers scramble to catch him --

           Galahad pushes a statue of an ARMORED KNIGHT -- It SLIDES 
           away, revealing a small OPENING -- Another escape route!

                                 GALAHAD
                             (to Lucan)
                        Inside. Quickly.

           INSIDE THE HATCH

           Lucan CRASHES to the ground, his leg SNAPPING when he hits 
           the ground -- He HOWLS in pain, clutching his broken leg --
           Galahad lowers himself inside after Lucan. He gets distracted 
           at the sight of Lucan SCREAMING, holding his leg --

                                 GALAHAD
                        What’s wrong? On your feet!

                                 LUCAN
                        I think my leg is broken!

           ANGLE ON - A shadow is cast into the hatch -- Hands stop the 
           sliding door in place as THE SERGEANT reaches down inside --

                                 LUCAN (O.S.)
                        Father!

           The Sergeant’s chainmailed hand swipes at Galahad --

           But Galahad rolls aside, picks up Lucan’s sword and drives it 
           upward through The Sergeant’s chest -- His body sags into the 
           hole and plugs the opening --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Come on.

           Galahad grabs Lucan’s shirt, dragging him deeper into the 
           passage as the Sergeant’s body is pulled from the opening --

           ANGLE ON - Malagant’s greatsword spears through the hole, 
           striking the stone below -- A SPARK lights the darkness --

           He will come for them next.

           Galahad continues to drag Lucan away. The boy CRIES OUT:

                                 LUCAN
                        I can’t!

           Galahad looks right into Lucan’s eyes, panicked in his calm. 
           If you do not follow me, we are both dead.

                                 GALAHAD
                        You must put the pain aside, Lucan. 

           I will do my best. Lucan pushes himself up onto the good leg 
           and hobbles after his father into the darkness --

           ABOVE, IN THE GREAT HALL

           Malagant hauls the Sergeant’s body out of the hole and tosses 
           it unceremoniously aside. A HAND falls to his shoulder --

                                 LANCELOT
                        You’re too bloody big, Malagant. 
                        Let me.

           Malagant grabs Lancelot at the collar, twisting him around --
           ANGLE ON - Blood weeps from Malagant’s knife wound --

                                 MALAGANT
                        I’m gonna cleave that little shit 
                        in two!

           Malagant shoves Lancelot away and tries to climb into the 
           opening -- But he really is too big --

           INT. HIDDEN PASSAGES - SAME TIME

           Galahad drags Lucan through winding tunnels too squat for 
           them to run upright -- A left, a right, another left, Galahad 
           makes changes in direction to shake those who pursue them -- 

           Lucan SOBS in agony behind Galahad as their enemies’ SHOUTS 
           ECHO through the tunnels behind them --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Faster!

           Lucan finally stops, holds fast.

                                 LUCAN
                        I can’t!

           Galahad moves Lucan into a position where some torchlight is 
           filtering into the passage from the outside corridors --

           LUCAN’S LEG is badly broken. It is purple and pulsing blood 
           from where the bone has punctured the skin.

                                 GALAHAD
                        All right. Easy now.

           Galahad lifts Lucan and carries him deeper into the tunnels.

           LATER, IN ANOTHER PASSAGE

           Moonlight seeps into a drainage canal from above. Laid in a 
           stone niche, Lucan dozes in a tortured sleep while his father 
           watches him from his seat on the floor below.

           There, streams of tears glisten on Galahad’s cheeks in pale 
           light as he mourns Lynette’s loss in silence.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES OF CAMELOT - NIGHT

           TWO MOUNTED RIDERS race across the dark, expansive sea of 
           plains outside Camelot. They are approaching the city gates.

           AT THE POSTERN GATE

           THE GATEHOUSE GUARD holds a torch up to the portcullis.
           THE OUTRIDERS are ragged, dirty. Like they have fled a war.

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        Identify yourselves!

                                 OUTRIDER
                        Outriders for Her Grace. We return 
                        with news of Lyonesse.

           INT. LADY GUINEVERE’S PRIVATE CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Lancelot enters the Queen’s private chambers at the lead of 
           the two Outriders that recently arrived at the gate. 

           Lady Guinevere paces restlessly amongst doting SERVANTS.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Guinevere...

           Lancelot forgets his courtesy before both the servants and 
           soldiers. He is shaken. Nearly speechless.

           Lady Guinevere, knowing this is terrible news, SHRIEKS:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Leave us. Get out! NOW!

           The servants flee her chambers.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        What is it?

                                 LANCELOT
                        My Lady -- Your Grace -- Lyonesse 
                        has... fallen.

           Lady Guinevere’s breath catches in her throat. My home. She 
           tries to remain composed.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You dare come here to jest with me 
                        about my father’s lands?

           One of the Outriders steps forward, keeping his eyes low.

                                 OUTRIDER
                        ‘Tis no jest, Your Grace. 
                        Palamedes’ Saracens have sacked the 
                        city, taken it. They’ve scrambled 
                        scouts North, killing any outriders 
                        that might have carried the news.

           Lady Guinevere lips quiver. Her eyes glisten with moisture.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        How long ago?

                                 OUTRIDER
                        We were forced to take a long path 
                        through the mountains to avoid --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- How long?

                                 LANCELOT
                        A month, Your Grace.

                                 OUTRIDER
                        The, ah -- Palamedes’ army is 
                        massing at Lyonesse. Preparing for 
                        invasion, Your Grace.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        My father? Lord Bedivere?

           The Outrider shakes his head. I do not know. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (to Lancelot)
                        Find Galahad. Kill him. Every 
                        soldier of every house of Albion 
                        shall be marching South within a 
                        fortnight to meet Palamedes.

                                 LANCELOT
                             (gently)
                        Why not let him go, Your Grace? He 
                        is but one man --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- Allow our King’s murderer to 
                        escape? Have you gone mad, Sir 
                        Lancelot?

           Lancelot stares back at her. Have I gone mad?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        No, perhaps you have not gone mad. 
                        Perhaps my First Knight has simply 
                        gone as soft as Arthur. I do not 
                        know which disgusts me more. 

           Insulted, Lancelot defers to her with false courtesy:

                                 LANCELOT
                        Then what might Your Grace suggest?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Set fires. Use smoke, oil, ash to 
                        drive him out. 
                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT'D)
                        Send my armies into the walls. Take 
                        this godforsaken Saracen maze apart 
                        brick-by-godless-brick if you must. 
                        But find him.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Fires? Guinevere, you cannot --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        -- I will. I shall command a new 
                        castle rebuilt atop Galahad’s 
                        shallow grave. One built by the 
                        children of the goddess, not the 
                        savages of the desert. And then, 
                        Palamedes’ Empire will burn with a 
                        fury even he could not conjure.

           Lancelot stares back at Guinevere. She has gone totally mad.

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - NIGHT

           Night has fallen over Camelot. 

           AT THE CASTLE - Smoke rises. Orange flames lick the night air 
           as one of the castle spires burns, CONSUMED IN FLAME -- 

           INT. HIDDEN PASSAGE - NIGHT

           Led by a single torch, Galahad inches forward in a half-
           crouch inside a particularly small tunnel. 

           Behind him, Lucan shuffles backward on his rear-end, his back 
           to Galahad. Lucan is still in a great amount of pain.

                                 LUCAN
                        How much further?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I believe we are getting close.

           Just then, Lucan sees something MOVE in the inky darkness 
           that hangs behind them. A quick motion, then nothing.

                                 LUCAN
                        Father?

                                 GALAHAD
                        We are almost there, Lucan.

                                 LUCAN
                        Can I hold the torch?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I need to see where we are going.
           SOMETHING moves again -- just for a moment -- in the dark.

                                 LUCAN
                        Father, please give me the torch.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Why -- ?

                                 LUCAN
                        Give me the torch!

           Galahad turns around to hand the torch to Lucan -- This 
           LIGHTS the tunnel behind them, REVEALING --

           A MOUNTAIN LION not four feet away from Lucan -- The beast 
           recoils at the light shone in its eyes, SNARLING --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Use the torch!

           Galahad drops the torch into Lucan’s lap -- 

           The lion lunges for Lucan, but eats a snout-full of torch. A 
           shower of orange sparks falls from its singed whiskers -- 

           The cougar recoils again, reloading for another strike --

           This time, the lion is met by the point of Galahad’s sword -- 
           It sags with a last RUSH of breath, dead in the passage.

           Both both stare at it. Where the hell did that come from?

           INT. GALAHAD’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           A panel in the wall of Galahad’s prior quarters in the Round 
           Table’s barracks slides away. 

           Galahad appears first, sword at ready. When he signals behind 
           him that it is safe, Lucan slides out on his rear.

                                 LUCAN
                        They won’t look for us here?

           Galahad slides the stone panel closed.

                                 GALAHAD
                        My quarters are no more dangerous 
                        now than the siege tunnels. At 
                        least here there is a bed for you 
                        to rest in before we set out again.

           Galahad helps Lucan into the bed. 

           Father and son look at one another in a long silence before 
           Lucan speaks:
                                 LUCAN
                        I couldn’t save her...

                                 GALAHAD
                        Your mother’s passing is on the 
                        souls of the wicked people who 
                        orchestrated this, not yours.

                                 LUCAN
                        You said that honor is what makes a 
                        knight different than a warrior. 
                        But it isn’t true. These knights 
                        are worse than any soldiers.

           Galahad points at Lucan’s heart.

                                 GALAHAD
                        You must hold the belief in the 
                        order of chivalry stronger now than 
                        you ever have. These men of the 
                        Round Table are not knights. They 
                        are the most abominable form of 
                        evil: that which abuses power to 
                        exploit the trust of the innocent.

           Lucan chews on this a moment. Then, tears come:

                                 LUCAN
                        Malagant... he... came to us, 
                        mother and I, where we were held...

           Galahad’s face turns to stone as he begins to understand. 

           INT. MALAGANT’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           A chamber swallowed in darkness. Anemic moonlight offers only 
           hints of what may lie within. Time does not move until --

           THE DOOR SLAMS open, oak shivering against the castle wall. 

           A YOUNG GIRL is first to enter, staggering as if she was 
           thrown inside. She GIGGLES as she regains her footing --

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Oh, my Lord’s chivalry is too kind.

           Malagant enters behind her, his hugeness towering inside the 
           small door frame. He is not amused by the girl’s humor.

                                 MALAGANT
                        Get on your back and spread your 
                        legs. I didn’t pay to have you 
                        squawk at me.

           Malagant shuts the door behind him, barring it closed.
           The whore’s mouth snaps shut as she comes to realize where 
           she is and who she is with. She is frozen in place.

                                 MALAGANT
                        No clever quip, wench? Take it off 
                        before I bloody cut it off.

           Malagant strips off his own shirt. When he lights a sconce --

           It exposes the extent of his full-body tattooing. The black 
           skeleton is no less intricate under his shirt. It extends 
           from his torso up to his throat. There is a fresh suture at 
           his ribs where his knife wound was recently stitched up.

           Malgant’s quarters are squalid. A feather mattress sits on a 
           thin bed of hay. The far wall is bare, but for the aged 
           BLOODSTAINS that have painted it nearly a solid crimson. 

           The whore’s breath catches in her throat at its sight.

           ANGLE ON - Galahad stands in the corner, his sheathed 
           longsword perched against his shoulder. Malagant’s enormous 
           greatsword is sheathed, leaned up in the corner behind him.

           The whore SHRIEKS. Malagant RIPS his dirk from his belt. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        Don’t bother.

           Galahad grabs Malagant’s sheathed sword and throws it to him.

           Malagant catches the scabbard, sheathes his dirk, and draws 
           the enormous greatsword --

           Galahad and Malagant come together, sword on sword --

           -- CRASH - CLATTER - CLANG -- Steel rings on steel as the two 
           battle in close quarters. Malagant has a longer range and is 
           much stronger, but Galahad is quicker and more athletic. 

           Galahad weaves well inside Malagant’s range, using the 
           confined room to his advantage -- He comes about behind 
           Malagant and slashes the back of his thigh open --

           Malagant ROARS, spinning and punching Galahad in the face, 
           sending him CRASHING into the corner where he spills the 
           chamber pot with another CLATTER --

           The whore SCREAMS, running for the door -- Fumbles with the 
           bar -- And then she’s gone, leaving the door WIDE OPEN --

           Malagant picks Galahad up and THROWS HIM across the room -- 
           Galahad and sword both fly astray --

           ANGLE ON - Caradoc, the Green Knight, appears in the doorway. 
           He unsheathes his sword and puts the tip to the ground.
           Malagant turns back to Galahad and boots him in the gut -- 
           Galahad GASPS for air, rolling away -- 

           Malagant raises his two-handed sword -- SLASHES! -- A 
           terrible SCREECH as steel strikes stone with a BRIGHT SPARK -- 

           Malagant the Mad loses all remaining sanity -- 

           He CHOPS again and again, wildly HACKING at Galahad as he 
           crawls, dives, and dodges his way back to his own sword --

           Finally Galahad gets a handle on his sword -- He rolls -- 
           Malagant’s sword arcs like a falling battle-axe -- 

           Galahad thrusts up his sword, spearing Malagant in the gut -- 

           Galahad releases his sword, rolls aside -- Malagant CRASHES 
           forward into the wall, driving Galahad’s sword deeper into 
           his gut. Malagant GAGS, spattering blood from his mouth --

           ANGLE ON - Caradoc makes no move for Galahad.

           Suddenly, Malagant pushes himself away from the wall. 

           He’s still alive. He faces Galahad, blood running in a river 
           over his teeth and down his tattooed throat and torso.

                                 MALAGANT
                             (mouth full of blood)
                        I’m gonna take a piss on your 
                        bloody corpse, Galahad.

           Malagant slowly draws Galahad’s sword out of his own gut -- 

           He turns the blade, slick with blood, and SWINGS at Galahad --

           But Malagant falls forward -- Galahad dives out of the way --

           Malagant pushes himself up on his hands and knees, blood 
           leaking from his mouth, back and belly --

           Coming to his feet, Galahad picks up Malagant’s greatsword. 
           He circles to stand over Malagant’s neck. Raises the sword --

           -- And beheads Malagant in a single stroke.

           ANGLE ON - Caradoc finally speaks in his thick brogue:

                                 CARADOC
                        Well fought, my Lord.

           Galahad turns, the heavy greatsword ready for Caradoc --

                                 CARADOC
                             (holding up his hand)
                        I come to you as ally, not as foe. 
                                 GALAHAD
                             (spitting rage)
                        Now? After I have been hunted, my 
                        family taken from their home and my 
                        wife raped and murdered before her 
                        son’s eyes! Tell me why I should 
                        not cut you down, as well, “SIR!”

                                 CARADOC
                        I beg your forgiveness, Galahad. I 
                        was a man blind to Guinevere’s 
                        treachery, but I have been given 
                        sight. Sight from the Green Mother 
                        in the fires of the sacrificed oak 
                        and sight from the wickedness of 
                        the men we have so foolishly called 
                        our brothers.

           Spitting, Galahad THROWS DOWN Malagant’s greatsword.

           Caradoc steps inside the room, sheathing his sword. He walks 
           to Galahad and kneels.

                                 CARADOC
                        You must believe that I, like you, 
                        am a man of loyalty. Loyalty to 
                        Arthur, to Camelot, to the ways of 
                        the Mother goddess and to the oath 
                        we have sworn to uphold as knights 
                        of the Round Table. 

           Galahad looks down at Malagant’s body, sadness in his voice:

                                 GALAHAD
                        The Round Table does not exist. The 
                        men thought to be the finest 
                        knights in the realm are no more 
                        than a pack of loyal wolves looking 
                        for scraps from their master.

                                 CARADOC
                             (from his knees)
                        I pledge myself again to the 
                        rightful King of Albion. To the 
                        oath we both spoke. To the scar we 
                        both wear. Guinevere and her vile 
                        knights must be stopped.

           Galahad bends -- Caradoc’s eyes go wide -- Is he going to 
           kill me? -- And Galahad picks up his blood-drenched sword.

           INT. CARADOC’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Galahad carries Lucan into Caradoc’s personal quarters. 
           Caradoc follows them inside and bars the door.
           The room is a shrine to the Green Mother. Religious artifacts 
           are the only decor in the otherwise barren quarters.

                                 CARADOC
                        I must go to my post, but you will 
                        be safe here through the night. 

           Galahad gently lays Lucan in the bed. The boy is sunken and 
           pale, sick with fever from his broken leg.

                                 CARADOC
                        Tomorrow, I am escorting a 
                        transport of prisoner labor from 
                        Camelot. It seems my Lords are due 
                        for some hard masonwork far beyond 
                        the city walls.

           Caradoc offers a comforting smile, but it turns to a frown as 
           he watches Galahad examine Lucan’s nasty leg wound.

                                 CARADOC
                        How does the boy fare?

                                 GALAHAD
                        The wound has corrupted. He will 
                        not make it as far as Avalon 
                        without intervention. We must leave 
                        him with Brother Mer’Lin at the 
                        monastery before we set out.

                                 CARADOC
                        The Saracen?

                                 GALAHAD
                        The only man left within this city 
                        that I trust.

           Caradoc bows. As you will.

                                 CARADOC
                        I will return before first light. 
                        May the Mother watch over you.

           Caradoc leaves them.

           INT. KING’S SOLAR - NIGHT

           Caradoc reports to the Lady Guinevere for his evening duty. 

           Gawain is already with her, looming like grim death. She 
           rises to meet Caradoc, her skirts flowing beneath her.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Where is Malagant? He was to return 
                        here with Mordred an hour ago.
           Caradoc bows an apology.

                                 CARADOC
                        I have not seen him, Your Grace.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Probably out whoring, no matter 
                        that half his order is dead with 
                        one of them loose in the castle and 
                        seeking to murder his Queen. I 
                        should have his head!

                                 LANCELOT (O.S.)
                        Someone already has.

           Lancelot emerges at the entrance of the solar, a half dozen 
           CITY GUARDSMEN with him.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        What?

                                 LANCELOT
                        I sent the city guard to find him. 
                        They did. In two pieces.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (through grit teeth)
                        Galahad.
                             (even)
                        And what has your search for the 
                        traitor knight yielded, Sir 
                        Lancelot?

           Matter-of-factly, Lancelot doles out the bad news:

                                 LANCELOT
                        The fires Your Grace ordered set 
                        tore through most of the castle 
                        library before they were smothered. 
                        One of the cougars we released into 
                        the tunnels from the menagerie was 
                        found dead in a siege passage. 
                        Another got loose and attacked the 
                        kitchen workers, killing three of 
                        Your Grace’s staff before it was 
                        put down. The third is still 
                        unaccounted for. Scores of vipers, 
                        also released into the tunnels, 
                        have been finding their way into 
                        castle chambers. Four have been 
                        attacked by the serpents so far and 
                        the warden is unsure how many have 
                        been trapped, killed or lost.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        But Galahad remains at large.
                                 LANCELOT
                             (caustic)
                        Aye, Your Grace. A most worthy 
                        adversary. Perhaps you might try 
                        larger, more ferocious beasts?

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Neither Queen nor King of Albion 
                        has ever hanged their First Knight. 
                        Mock me again, Lancelot, and I 
                        promise to make history.

           Lancelot bows. As you wish.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Go fetch Mordred and bring him 
                        here. He is not safe about on his 
                        own without a knight of The Six.

                                 CARADOC
                             (alarmed)
                        Your Grace, I, ah, was to escort 
                        the young Prince to the stonehenge 
                        for his evening prayer.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        That will wait. You and Gawain are 
                        here with me.
                             (to Lancelot)
                        Sir Lancelot, kindly find my son if 
                        that search is not beyond your 
                        capability.

           Lancelot withdraws from the chamber.

           INT. CARADOC’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Lucan shivers and sweats, delirious with fever. 

           Galahad bends over him. The boy’s lips are chapped and dry. 
           Galahad picks up a wooden bowl. In the bottom is a wet cloth, 
           but the bowl itself has been emptied of water.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS

           Galahad buckles on his sword belt as he exits Caradoc’s 
           quarters. He carries the wooden bowl close to his body, hyper-
           vigilant of his surroundings. 

           He listens for every sound, watches for every sight.

           ANGLE ON - Recessed in a corridor wall is a brass tap. When 
           Galahad opens the tap, water flows out. He fills the bowl, 
           looking from side to side for whomever may approach.
           Galahad heads back to Caradoc’s quarters with the full water 
           bowl. But when he reaches the door, IT IS ALREADY OPEN --

           INT. CARADOC’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Galahad enters Caradoc’s quarters, one hand holding the bowl 
           of water, the other already on the pommel of his sword.

           MORDRED is standing at Lucan’s bedside. Without turning:

                                 MORDRED
                        Caradoc was to meet me for an 
                        evening prayer to the Green Mother, 
                        but he never came.
                             (turns around)
                        Do you know what I pray for? For a 
                        return to the time I suddenly have 
                        trouble remembering. When my father 
                        was King and we would hunt. When 
                        you were First Knight and I was 
                        your squire and you would teach me 
                        arms in the fields. When The Six 
                        stood strong and the throne of 
                        Camelot was unshakable. 

           Mordred looks back at Lucan’s body.

                                 MORDRED
                        Your son has much of you in him.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Lucan has made me very proud.

                                 MORDRED
                        I used to believe that my father 
                        was the most honorable, strongest 
                        man in the realm. I wanted to be 
                        him. But as I grew older, I came to 
                        see him for what he truly was. A 
                        coward. Now, I wish to be like 
                        neither my father or my mother.
                             (turning back to Galahad)
                        Do you mean to kill her?

                                 GALAHAD
                        I mean to uphold the oath I have 
                        sworn.

                                 MORDRED
                        And that means my mother’s death.

                                 GALAHAD
                        It means that you will be crowned 
                        King and the Lady Guinevere will be 
                        forced to answer for her crimes.
           Mordred nods. As I thought. He walks past Galahad on his way 
           out of Caradoc’s quarters. When he has passed:

                                 GALAHAD
                        What will you do?

                                 MORDRED
                        I will try to be the King you have 
                        taught me to be.

           Galahad turns around to see Mordred closing the door --

                                 MORDRED
                        Keep the door barred. The search 
                        for you is still afoot.

           Mordred seals the door shut.

           INT. KING’S SOLAR - NIGHT

           Lady Guinevere sleeps soundly amongst the pillows and furs of 
           the enormous royal bed.

           Lancelot is wide awake. He sits before Guinevere’s vanity 
           mirror, looking at the REFLECTION of his bare torso. The skin 
           on his body is flawless, unmarked by battle.

           Lancelot stares at the ROUND TABLE BRAND on his chest, the 
           only imperfection on him. 

           Standing up, Lancelot lifts a torch from the sconce sitting 
           over the vanity mirror. He takes one last look at his brand --

           Before driving the burning torch into his own chest -- The 
           fire HISSES on Lancelot’s skin as he gnaws on his lip, 
           desperately trying to keep the scream from coming out.

           When removes the torch, Lancelot sees the blistered, 
           translucent skin on his heaving chest. The damage is all that 
           remains where the mark of his Round Table oath once lay.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Two druids wheel a cart meant to transport the dead. 

           Caradoc meets them carrying a body wrapped in a blanket. The 
           druids bow their heads and step away, pitying the dead.

           Carefully, Caradoc places Lucan into the cart.

                                 CARADOC
                        The lad was caught stealing bread. 
                        Broke his leg when he tried to 
                        escape the City Guard. 
                                 CARADOC (CONT'D)
                        But her Grace the Queen has taken 
                        pity on the little wretch and asked 
                        that he receive the personal care 
                        of Brother Mer’Lin. 

           The druids bow acknowledgement.

                                 CARADOC
                             (deliberate)
                        See to her wishes quietly and 
                        secretly. Am I understood?

           The druids nod. They lift the cart and wend through the 
           castle corridors on their way out...

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Brother Mer’Lin attends to a number of sick and injured 
           PATIENTS abed in the hospital. There is a NOISE behind him --

           TWO DRUIDS wheel the cart holding Lucan inside the monastery. 
           They pass Mer’Lin and lift Lucan into one of the open beds. 

           The druids return to Mer’Lin, coaxing him to see to Lucan --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Brothers, I am with a patient --

           They drag Mer’Lin over to Lucan. One pulls away the blanket, 
           exposing the boy’s INFECTED, BROKEN LEG --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Mother preserve -- how long has 
                        this gone untreated? Bring water, 
                        herbs, cotton wraps, and a plaster 
                        trench. Quickly.

           As the druids go to work on Mer’Lin’s commands, he pulls the 
           blanket off the rest of the boy.

           ANGLE ON - A rolled piece of parchment is stuffed in Lucan’s 
           hand and clutched to his chest.  

           Mer’Lin removes the parchment from Lucan’s grip. He unrolls 
           it and reads the message. Suddenly alarmed, he shouts:

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Make haste, Brothers!

           Brother Mer’Lin hurries to a nearby worktable. He picks up a 
           LONG SYRINGE with a leather bolus attached to the blunt end. 

           He drives the needle into Lucan’s infected leg and squeezes 
           the bolus, injecting him with some antibacterial solution.
           INT. MAIN CASTLE GATE - FIRST LIGHT

           The whispers of dawn set the horizon outside Camelot afire.

           A large wheelhouse is backed up inside the main castle gate. 
           The prisoner transport sits twenty men inside and is drawn by 
           six horses tethered in two lines of three each.

           A CHAIN GANG is marched out of the belly of the castle. 
           Prisoners dressed in rough woolen robes, chained to one 
           another at the wrists and ankles.

           ANGLE ON - Caradoc patrols about on foot, sword drawn.

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - CONTINUOUS

           The wheelhouse trundles down the stone bridge connecting the 
           Castle Camelot to the city. Caradoc rides escort beside it.

           THE WEST POSTERN GATE sits a mile in the distance.

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - HOSPITAL - SAME TIME

           Brother Mer’Lin is bent over Lucan’s broken leg, now wrapped 
           in thick linen strips that have hardened with plaster. He 
           puts his nose near the cast’s opening and sniffs. His nose 
           wrinkles at the smell, but he is content with the progress.

           When he looks up, he finds the eyes of a conscious Lucan.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Hello. I am Brother Mer’Lin.

                                 LUCAN
                        My leg hurts.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        As it should. But you are fortunate 
                        to have youth and the miracle of 
                        druidic medicine marching at your 
                        side. How do you feel otherwise?

                                 LUCAN
                        Tired. Thirsty.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Two things I can help remedy. But 
                        the fever is on the retreat and the 
                        bone is on the mend, so we should 
                        both be relieved.

           Mer’Lin crushes herbs into powder with a mortar and pestle, 
           then adds water to the mortar and stirs it.
                                 LUCAN
                        Where is my father?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                             (giving Lucan the mortar)
                        Drink this. Slowly.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Once you are well enough, my order 
                        will quietly spirit you beyond the 
                        city walls to the seat of Avalon 
                        where you will meet your father.

                                 LUCAN
                        My father has gone back to Avalon?

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        You must try to rest, Lucan.

           Mer’Lin leaves Lucan to rest. He quickly fades into sleep...

           EXT. THE CITY OF CAMELOT - NEAR POSTERN GATE - SAME TIME

           The horse-drawn prisoner transport THUNDERS noisily as it 
           rolls down the cobblestone road leading to the postern gate. 

           THE POSTERN GATE is 100 yards away. The gate is an access 
           point set into the hundred-foot high city walls and rises 
           another fifteen feet beyond the surrounding structure. 
           LOOKOUTS and ARCHERS roam the parapet atop the gate.

           It is double-gated, an iron portcullis sealing either end. 
           GUARDS patrol both outside and inside the gatehouse.

           Caradoc’s mount gallops ahead to the postern gate. 

           INT. WHEELHOUSE - SAME TIME

           Dusty sunlight seeps between the cracks of the confined 
           wheelhouse. Two rows of ten prisoners sit facing one another, 
           feet and hands chained to iron hooks sunk into the floor.

           One prisoner slips the chains off his hands and then reaches 
           down and easily removes the manacles from his feet.

                                 OLD PRISONER
                        The bloody hell is this?

                                 FAT PRISONER
                        Let me out, m’Lord! The wench were 
                        a liar! I’m innocent!

           Other PLEAS for help come as Galahad prepares to escape --
           EXT. POSTERN GATE - SAME TIME

           The wheelhouse comes to a halt outside the gate.

           A GATEHOUSE GUARD steps out to meet Caradoc, who reels his 
           mount. The horse SNORTS. The gatehouse guard bows when he 
           sees that Caradoc is a knight of the Round Table.

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        Hail, m’Lord.

                                 CARADOC
                        I escort a labor transport bound 
                        for the quarries at Stonegate.

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        Aye, m’Lord. 
                             (shouts to gate operators)
                        Open ‘em up!

           The inner portcullis GRINDS and CLICK-CLACKS as the operators 
           crank the mechanism to raise the heavy iron gate --

           THE PORTCULLIS slowly ascends until it LOCKS open.

           The horses tow the wheelhouse inside the postern gate, but 
           the second portcullis remains closed.

           Caradoc watches the prisoner transport move through.

                                 CARADOC
                        Open the second gate.

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        After the first is closed, m’Lord. 
                        Apologies, Queen’s word. Don’t want 
                        no one gettin’ out the city walls.

           The wheelhouse is fully inside the postern gate.

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        Go ahead inside, m’Lord.

           Reluctant, Caradoc urges his mount inside the postern gate 
           beside the wheelhouse -- As soon as he is inside --

           THE CRANKS ARE LOOSED -- The first portcullis comes CRASHING 
           DOWN where it SPEARS into the dirt --

           Caradoc REARS his horse, turning to face the closed gate --

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere appears ahorse on the city side of 
           the gate. With her rides Mordred and a BATTALION OF SOLDIERS.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Your betrayal wounds me worst of 
                        all, Caradoc. I did not think a man 
                        devoted to the Goddess would so 
                        easily surrender his virtues to 
                        enter league with a traitor.

           Caradoc does not respond. He turns his mount, riding for the 
           still-closed front portcullis where --

           LANCELOT waits on horseback at the head of another BATALLION 
           OF SOLDIERS outside Camelot’s city walls. 

           Caradoc sees what surrounds him. Gates on either side. 
           Lancelot and Guinevere. I am trapped within these walls.

           ANGLE ON - The rear doors of the wheelhouse SLAM open. 
           Galahad steps out, shedding his prisoner’s garb.

           A melancholy in his voice, Lancelot recites a battle poem:

                                 LANCELOT
                        “I love to see amid the meadows the 
                        field knights and horses in battle 
                        array; it delights me when the 
                        scouts scatter people and herds in 
                        their path. Maces, swords, helms of 
                        different colors, shields that will 
                        be riven and shattered --

           Lancelot’s horse stirs beneath him, sensing what is to come.

                                 LANCELOT (CONT’D)
                        “-- In seeing men great and small 
                        go down on the grass beyond the 
                        castle moat. And in seeing at last 
                        the dead, the pennoned stumps of 
                        lances still in their sides.”

           Lady Guinevere looks down at Galahad from her horse.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        This is the second time you have 
                        tried to turn my son against me, 
                        Galahad. There will not be a third.

           Galahad looks from Lady Guinevere over to Mordred, his 
           emotions unreadable. Mordred’s eyes shy away from Galahad’s.

                                 MORDRED
                             (meekly)
                        She is my mother.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Guardsmen, do what you must.
           Inside the sealed postern gate, guards draw steel and descend 
           to the ground level.

           Caradoc reaches into his saddle scabbard and throws Galahad a 
           sword. He climbs off his mount and draws his own sword.

           THE ENTRY DOOR inside the gatehouse swings open. Six armed 
           guardsmen appear, unsure of the orders they’ve received.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (to the gatehouse guards)
                        Soldiers of Camelot, I speak to you 
                        not as a knight of the Round Table, 
                        but as one of you. Camelot is a 
                        city that has forgotten itself. 
                        What once was a place of legendary 
                        kings and chivalrous knights has 
                        been poisoned by corruption and 
                        avarice. 

           ANGLE ON - Mordred watches intently as Galahad speaks --

                                 GALAHAD (CONT’D)
                        Stand with me now, here, and we can 
                        put an end to this treachery and 
                        restore the light to Camelot.

           The guardsmen eye one another, none making any move.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Guards, do as your Queen has 
                        ordered and you will be rewarded in 
                        gold, land and titles beyond dream. 
                        Defy me and your heads will be sent 
                        home to those you hold most dear.

           One dour, hard-cut guardsmen moves to the front of the group, 
           brandishing his sword.

                                 BRUTAL GUARDSMAN
                        There’s only two of ‘em.
                             (spits)
                        Let’s cut ‘er Grace out ‘er prize, 
                        boys.

           The brutal guardsman moves on Caradoc -- STEEL RINGS ON STEEL 
           and chaos erupts within the postern gate --

           Galahad goes in to defend him -- CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

           Caradoc beats aside the brutal guardsman’s blade and lunges 
           forward, putting his sword through the guardsman’s chest -- 

           He twists and pulls out the blood-drenched steel --
           The prisoners inside the wheelhouse erupt in CHAIN-RATTLING 
           HECKLES, CHEERS and PLEAS for release as the battle rages --

           Galahad parries another guardsman’s high cut -- He continues 
           the motion, striking low and hamstringing him -- The guard 
           falls on the useless leg and Galahad runs him through --

           LANCELOT watches as another guardsman falls. Galahad and 
           Caradoc are winning. Lancelot paces on horseback like a caged 
           tiger. Fed up, he calls up to the gate operator:

                                 LANCELOT
                        Open the front gate.

                                 GATE OPERATOR
                             (I can’t)
                        Queen’s command, m’Lord.

                                 LANCELOT
                        I am aware of the Queen’s command. 
                        Her First Knight is giving you a 
                        new one. Open the gate.

           LADY GUINEVERE calls to him from the other side of the gate:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (to Lancelot)
                        Do not open that gate.

                                 LANCELOT
                             (to the gate operator)
                        Open the bloody gate.

                                 GATE OPERATOR
                        M’Lord, the Queen --

                                 LANCELOT
                        -- Whose wrath do you fear most? 

           Lancelot brings his sword across his body in threat.

           BETWEEN THE GATES, Galahad and Caradoc face the last guard. 
           Seeing what he is up against, he throws down his sword.

                                 WEAK GUARDSMAN
                        I yield -- please don’t kill me.

           LANCELOT bellows up to the gate operator:

                                 LANCELOT
                        Open the fucking gate!

           Caradoc and Galahad turn to face the front gate where 
           Lancelot awaits them, their chests heaving from the effort 
           and their swords painted with the blood of their victory.
           Moments pass and nothing happens. Then --

           CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- The front gate begins to rise --

           Lancelot hops down off his horse and draws steel.

           As do the horse-mounted soldiers behind him.

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere is not pleased.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                             (to her guards)
                        Get in there!

           The iron portcullis is just two feet off the ground --

                                 LANCELOT
                        You are a platter of shit served at 
                        my glorious feast, Galahad.

           Caradoc goes to the rear doors of the prisoner transport, 
           which is still ALIVE WITH THE PLEAS of the prisoners. He 
           looks down at the CHAIN tethering them all to the wheelhouse.

           Caradoc picks up a BATTLE AXE from one of the dead guards --

                                 GALAHAD
                        Caradoc, do not --

           Caradoc swings the axe -- CHUNK! -- It splits the chain --

           THE PRISONERS inside RIOT, flooding out of the wheelhouse --

           Lady Guinevere’s guards rush inside through the postern 
           gate’s INNER DOOR in time to meet the fleeing prisoners --

           And the prisoners attack everyone in sight -- Galahad, 
           Caradoc, the Camelot guardsmen -- It’s utter chaos --

           ANGLE ON - Lancelot ducks beneath the rising portcullis, 
           entering the fray -- 

           He cuts through the mad prisoners that run to meet him, eyes 
           narrow and focused on Galahad --

           ANGLE ON - Galahad turns to face a guardsman, but a prisoner 
           throws his manacled hands over Galahad’s head, CHOKING him -- 

           Galahad KICKS the advancing guardsman before he can attack -- 
           The guardsman comes again and Galahad spins, using the 
           prisoner on his back as a shield to absorb the sword strike --

           ANGLE ON - The portcullis has fully risen -- 

           And now the PRISONERS run out from the gate, CLASHING with 
           the soldiers who enter from the outside --
           ABOVE, IN THE GATEHOUSE

           The gate operators look below to see the prisoners fleeing --

                                 GATE OPERATOR
                        The prisoners are escaping!

                                 GATEHOUSE GUARD
                        Close the bloody portcullis!

           BELOW, BETWEEN THE GATES

           WHIRRRRRR! -- The portcullis CRASHES DOWN, heavy black iron 
           GORING both soldiers and prisoners caught in between --

           All survivors are now trapped between the two sealed gates.

           Caradoc dodges the coming guards’ attacks, parries a strike -- 
           He spins, slashing open two throats in one stroke --

           Lancelot closes on Caradoc when -- THE OLD PRISONER comes 
           hissing at him, chained hands raised and lunging for 
           Lancelot’s throat -- Lancelot steps back, sword FLASHING -- 

           He severs the man’s chained hands at the wrists -- Lancelot 
           side steps the old man’s BLOODY STUMPS and keeps moving --

           Caradoc steps forward to meet Lancelot -- Keeping the sword 
           close, he makes a quick slash for Lancelot’s throat --

           But Lancelot parries, BLADE ON BLADE -- And, in the same 
           motion, drawing his sword back towards himself --

           -- Opening the side of Caradoc’s throat. Blood SPRAYS all 
           over Lancelot from the arterial laceration. 

           Caradoc staggers a bit in shock, then collapses and bleeds 
           out at Lancelot’s feet. In a single stroke, Caradoc is dead. 

           ANGLE ON - Galahad is drenched in blood as he continues to 
           SAW THROUGH guards and prisoners alike -- Opening throats, 
           hamstringing legs -- Spinning, ducking, slashing, stabbing --

           Lancelot calmly wipes off his bloodied face, body and blade 
           on the surcoat of one of the soldiers beside him. 

           Lancelot and all the surviving soldiers surround Galahad.

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere rides right up to the closed gate.

                                 LANCELOT
                        You’re a dead man, Galahad. Whether 
                        it is here or on the headsman’s 
                        stone is your choice.

           Galahad, hopelessly surrounded, throws down his sword.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Kill him, Lancelot.

                                 MORDRED (O.S.)
                             (shouting over the Queen)
                        DO NOT!

           ANGLE ON - Mordred rides closer to the gate.

                                 MORDRED
                        A Knight of the Round Table is due 
                        better than summary execution.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Your Queen has given an order, Sir 
                        Lancelot. Kill him.

           Galahad turns to face Lancelot, unarmed.

           Lady Guinevere grips the portcullis bars. She SHRIEKS:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Kill him! NOW!

           Lancelot parts the soldiers, sword ready for Galahad... And 
           punches him in the temple with his sword hilt --

           Galahad’s world goes BLACK.

           INT. DRUID’S MONASTERY - HOSPITAL - DAY

           FROM THE DARKNESS -- Lucan blinks awake to see BROTHER 
           MER’LIN rushing into the hospital room, alarmed --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        Rise, boy! Awake!

                                 LUCAN
                        What is wrong?

           There is SHOUTING from upstairs, COMMOTION, CHAOS --

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I thought we had more time.

           Mer’Lin stops at a worktable. He grabs a loaf of extremely 
           MOULDY BREAD and rolls it into a cloth. 

           Mer’Lin stuffs the wrapped loaf into Lucan’s arms.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        One slice, morning and night until 
                        it is gone.

           Confused, Lucan opens the napkin to see the mouldy bread --
                                 LUCAN
                        This is rank with mould!

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                             (close; quiet; kind)
                        One slice, morning and night and 
                        perhaps those dreams of knighthood 
                        will not be so out of reach.

           ANGLE ON - Sir Gawain emerges in the hospital room at the 
           head of a number of the CITY MILITIA.

           Mer’Lin makes himself as big as possible to shield Lucan --

                                 GAWAIN
                        The Queen wanted this returned to 
                        you.

           Gawain produces the SCIMITAR that Mer’Lin gave to Galahad. 

           He throws it at Mer’Lin’s feet in a LOUD CLATTER.

                                 BROTHER MER’LIN
                        I will not fight you.

                                 GAWAIN
                        I don’t give a shit.

           Gawain nods to the militia, take them into custody. 

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - KING’S SOLAR - NIGHT

           Lancelot and Lady Guinevere are alone in the royal solar.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Galahad is no longer a threat to 
                        you. Let him rot in the dark 
                        depths. You must assemble the war 
                        council and march on Lyonesse!

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        I have not come this far to let 
                        Arthur’s murderer slip away into 
                        forgotten history.

           EYES ARE WATCHING THIS EXCHANGE

           Set back in the wall, hidden, unknown --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT’D)
                        First, I will make a spectacle of 
                        Galahad’s execution. And then, with 
                        the strength of my throne asserted 
                        before the eyes of Camelot, every 
                        soldier of Albion will march South. 
                                 LADY GUINEVERE (CONT’D)
                        We will reclaim Lyonesse and strike 
                        at the heart of the Qu’Rad Empire.

           IT IS MORDRED watching Lady Guinevere and Lancelot from 
           behind the walls. He sees his mother go close to Lancelot.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        And then, the great Warrior-King 
                        Lancelot and his Queen Guinevere 
                        will be forever remembered as those 
                        who saved Albion.

           Lady Guinevere moves inside and kisses Lancelot on the neck.

           INSIDE THE SIEGE TUNNEL

           Mordred lowers his eyes and backs away. He closes the panel.

           BLACK

           A distant RATTLING. Metal on metal. Harsh. Repetitive.

           It comes closer. Closer...

           INT. DUNGEON CELL - TIME UNKNOWN

           The RATTLING is immediate. 

           Galahad blinks awake, naked and lying in a thatch of filthy 
           hay on the floor of some dungeon cell far away from the light 
           of day. The RATTLING persists.

           Galahad looks up. A bent, grizzled GAOLER (40s) glowers down 
           at him through the bars of his cell. The man’s face is 
           nodulated and purple with puss weeping from open sores. 

           The Gaoler drags his dagger across the bars of his cell, 
           RATTLING them loudly. His cruel smile reveals most of his 
           teeth to be missing. His voice is a wreck of rasps and slurs:

                                 GAOLER
                        So nice to see yous again, “Sir.” 
                        Her Grace paid me extras to make 
                        sure yous are nice and comfortable.

           Galahad props himself up on his elbows. He is in considerable 
           discomfort. He squints at the Gaoler.

           The Gaoler LAUGHS, a wheezing cackle. He picks up a pail 
           sitting on the floor next to him.

                                 GAOLER
                        Yous look thirsty. Have some water, 
                        “Sir.”
           The Gaoler douses Galahad with the pail -- From Galahad’s 
           horrified reaction, it is clear that it wasn’t water.

                                 GAOLER
                        Don’t yous worry, theys more where 
                        that’s come from. Miggs fills up 
                        his pail every day.
                             (yells into the next cell)
                        Dontcha, Miggs?

           The Gaoler CACKLES again, dragging the pail along the bars as 
           he walks off towards Miggs’ cell -- CLANK-CLANK-CLANK-CLANK --

           BLACK -- TIME PASSES -- Then --

           Galahad’s hair and beard are growing back. He’s been here for 
           some time. He awakens to SOLDIERS crowding into his cell -- 

           Galahad is on his feet, but he is weak and they are too much 
           for him. Once he’s restrained, the soldiers part to reveal --

           LADY GUINEVERE looking right at him, Lancelot at her side.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        It is a happy day, Galahad. Today, 
                        justice shall be served for King 
                        Arthur Pendragon’s murder.

           Galahad looks right back at her. He laughs weakly.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Happy news, indeed, Your Grace. I 
                        never imagined that you would come 
                        around to a confession.

           Lady Guinevere sours. She looks at a soldier and nods, do it. 

           A hood blankets Galahad’s head. 

           GALAHAD’S POV - DARKNESS.

           Boots SCUFF on stone. Doors OPEN. Stairs are CLIMBED. The 
           dark brightens a little. The sound of a CROWD rises, RISES --

           EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

           A CROWD OF THOUSANDS has gathered once again in the courtyard 
           of the Castle Camelot. 

           At the center of the yard, a raised dais bears a hangman’s 
           platform on one side and a headsman’s stone on the other.

           The CROWD RAISES A CHEER when Galahad, hooded, is marched out 
           onto the platform by Guinevere’s soldiers. Galahad is forced 
           to his knees and his head is pushed down onto the stone.
           A HUSH falls over the crowd when their Queen takes the dais. 
           Lady Guinevere is absolutely radiant. She takes a moment. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        It is a dark time for Camelot. Our 
                        King has been slain, betrayed by 
                        those he trusted the most. The 
                        Round Table lies in ruin. Knights 
                        have put their brothers to the 
                        sword to hide their secrets. They 
                        have turned on their own crown in a 
                        mad pursuit of power and wealth. 
                        All while an army of Saracen 
                        Savages masses at our borders. Your 
                        Queen shall restore order to 
                        Camleot and conquer the enemies of 
                        our realm. But first, justice must 
                        be carried out.

           GALAHAD’S POV - ROARS RISE from the crowd -- Galahad sees 
           nothing but shadows and darkness. 

                                 LADY GUINEVERE (O.S.)
                        My father, Lord Bedivere of 
                        Lyonesse, taught me to always be 
                        swift in justice. Murdering one’s 
                        king is the most vile act any can 
                        commit. And aiding that act is no 
                        different than wielding the blade 
                        that saw it done. Guards, prepare 
                        the prisoner.

           A ROAR from the crowd. Nothing happens to Galahad, but there 
           is commotion around him. Suddenly, his hood is ripped off --

           GALAHAD’S VISION CLEARS to reveal --

           Brother Mer’Lin being marched onto the hangman’s platform. 

           He has been stripped of his robes and is dressed barely in 
           rags. The HANGMAN fits a noose around Mer’Lin’s neck.

           The crowd BOOS -- Individual shouts emerge, insulting Mer’Lin 
           and demanding that he be hanged --

           Galahad watches helplessly as Lady Guinevere nods to the 
           hangman. He tightens the noose around Mer’Lin’s neck and 
           steps off the platform. There, he KICKS away the lever --

           The platform below Mer’Lin’s feet opens, dropping him -- 

           The rope goes taught with a brittle SNAP.

           ANGLE ON - Brother Mer’Lin’s lifeless body swings from the 
           hangman’s rope.
           GALAHAD’S POV - A flowing dress steps before his vision. 

           The Lady Guinevere kneels to face Galahad. She bows deeply, 
           pantomiming a prayer. There, she whispers to Galahad:

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        A Queen does not need the 
                        confession of a traitor when she 
                        has the love of her people.

           Lady Guinevere smiles triumphantly -- But a sudden BLAST OF A 
           HORN -- AHWOOOOOOO -- Turns her grin to stone. 

           She is immediately on her feet, alarmed -- 

           The crowd ERUPTS in an excited DIN -- There are horses 
           STOMPING, soldiers MARCHING, another HORN BLAST: AHWOOOOO --

           Try as he might, Galahad cannot see what’s happening --

                                 HANGMAN (O.S.)
                        What in the name of the mother -- ?

           THWIP! -- TWANG! -- The HANGMAN and HEADSMAN are both hit in 
           the chest with arrows -- The horn BLOWS AGAIN --

           AN ARMY OF A THOUSAND pours inside the main postern gate. 
           Mounted cavalry, archers, foot soldiers -- 

           ANGLE ON - Lancelot looks out at the approaching army, smirks 
           to himself and walks off the dais, vanishing from sight --

           THE MOUNTED CAVALRY CHARGES toward the dais -- Lady Guinevere 
           looks around madly -- She cannot find Lancelot --

           GAWAIN stands just off the platform. Lady Guinevere catches 
           his eye and points to Galahad --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Hood him and take him back to his 
                        cell! NOW!

           GALAHAD’S POV - He still cannot see --

           Hands -- A HOOD -- Then DARKNESS AGAIN. 

           INT. DUNGEON CELL - TIME UNKNOWN

           Galahad sits, dour and mute, in the corner of his cell, with 
           his elbows propped on his knees. There’s no telling how much 
           time has passed.

           Down the corridor, a gate CLANKS and GROANS as it opens. 
           FOOTSTEPS approach Galahad’s cell. 
           Galahad barely looks up when A VISITOR in a thick fur cloak 
           steps in front of his cell. Two PRISON GUARDS are with him.

                                 VISITOR (O.S.)
                        Leave us.

           The guards’ legs depart. Galahad finally looks up to see --

           LORD PELLINORE (65), a warrior king if there ever was one. 
           Tall and broad, he looks his years in his face but not in his 
           physique. A fur cloak is draped over the deep blues and white 
           of Avalon and a sword hangs at his side.

                                 GALAHAD
                             (disbelief)
                        My Lord Pellinore?

           Galahad falls over himself to kneel at Lord Pellinore’s feet.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Rise, Galahad.

           Galahad stands up, meeting his Lord eye-to-eye.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Where is my son?

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Lucan’s leg is broken, but healing. 
                        I have placed him in the care of my 
                        most trusted Captain.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Why have you come to Camelot?

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Lyonesse smolders in ashes at the 
                        hand of the Saracens. And then the 
                        King-in-Waiting sends word to me 
                        that half the Round Table is dead 
                        and the First Knight is accused of 
                        the King’s murder. The Lord of 
                        Avalon had little choice, hmm?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Mordred sent for you?

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Two very motivated riders. Their 
                        mounts were nearly dead of 
                        exhaustion when they arrived.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Her Grace lies. She killed Arthur. 
                        Poisoned him while their son 
                        watched through the walls.
           Lord Pellinore chuckles.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        “Her Grace” had your head on the 
                        stone and still you find your 
                        courtesies. You are of admirable 
                        character, Galahad. That I have 
                        never doubted.

                                 GALAHAD
                        Then you know this to be farce.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Of course I do. But we hard men of 
                        Avalon drag oaths and duty behind 
                        us like a dead carcass, do we not?
                             (darker)
                        What am I to do? Palamedes’ army is 
                        set for invasion. Camelot is in 
                        disarray. Something must be done.

                                 GALAHAD
                        An honorless crown cannot rule.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        I have come here in an attempt to 
                        restore the rule of law, Galahad. I 
                        cannot do so by spiriting the 
                        King’s accused assassin out of the 
                        city without trial or acquittal.

                                 GALAHAD
                        That is not what I ask.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Then what would you have me do?

                                 GALAHAD
                        Allow me to prove my innocence 
                        before the eyes of the Goddess.

           Lord Pellinore knows what Galahad is asking of him.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        Galahad, that is an antiquated 
                        ceremonial rite reserved for 
                        quarrels amongst the noble class --

                                 GALAHAD
                        -- I have lands. An estate. I am 
                        First Knight of the Round Table. 
                        Does that not qualify me to have my 
                        guilt judged by the Goddess? 

           The bearded Lord makes a face, grumbling as he thinks.
                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        A battle of wager. 

                                 GALAHAD
                             (nods)
                        Trial by combat.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        You know it is within her right to 
                        choose a second to fight for her. 
                        And you know who she will choose.

                                 GALAHAD
                        If I am innocent, then the will of 
                        the Mother shall guide my hand.

           Lord Pellinore chews on Galahad’s proposal.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDORS (NEAR ROYAL CHAMBERS) - NIGHT

           Lancelot stands at a relaxed attention outside the royal 
           apartments, hand resting on the pommel of his sword. 

           THE DOUBLE DOORS swing open as Lord Pellinore leaves the 
           solar. He regards Lancelot gruffly.

                                 LANCELOT
                        My Lord.

           Lord Pellinore departs, boots SCUFFING on stone as he goes.

           When he is gone, the double doors open again. This time, an 
           almost cheery Lady Guinevere emerges.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Sir Lancelot, will you be kind and 
                        search my quarters? 

           Lancelot dutifully obliges her.

           INT. KING’S SOLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Lady Guinevere SHUTS the doors behind them. Lancelot takes a 
           half-hearted sweep of the solar. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        There appear to be no assassins, 
                        beasts or beggars lurking in the 
                        dark, Your Grace.

           When Lancelot turns around to face her, he sees that she is 
           positively beaming. 

           She is also untying her gown.
                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        That arrogant fool Galahad wishes 
                        to invoke the battle of wager to 
                        prove his innocence.

           The news is the twist of a knife in Lancelot’s gut. I will 
           have to kill Galahad. A long beat passes in silence.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Don’t you see? This madness has 
                        finally to come to an end.

           Lancelot tries to recover, forcing a smile:

                                 LANCELOT
                        I had no idea my Lady was so 
                        skilled with a sword.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        You will be my sword. It is my 
                        right as Queen choose a second.
                             (continuing to undress)
                        You will end Galahad before the 
                        eyes of Camelot, before Morgan la 
                        Fey and her druids, and before the 
                        Green Mother herself. Galahad will 
                        be guilty and dead and you and I 
                        will at last be free.

           She pulls her dress up over her head and discards it. There 
           Guinevere stands before Lancelot, naked and beautiful.

           Lancelot studies Guinevere where she stands. 

           He loves her, but he despises the creature she has become.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Come and take me, my knight. My 
                        lover. My King.

           No longer able to resist, Lancelot strides toward her and 
           lifts her up off the ground, making her SQUEAL with delight --

           INT. DUNGEON CELL - TIME UNKNOWN

           Galahad does pull ups using the bar at the top of his cell. 
           He completes dozens of them before --

           -- The gate at the end of the hall GROANS open. 

           MORDRED appears before Galahad’s cell. He carries a 
           beautiful, SHEATHED SWORD that is almost taller than he is. 

                                 GALAHAD
                        My Prince.
                                 MORDRED
                        I -- I came to wish you good 
                        fortune tomorrow.

                                 GALAHAD
                        The Queen has decided, then.

                                 MORDRED
                        The duel will be at dusk as the sun 
                        sets over the Stonehenge.

           A silence hangs between them. A hundred things unsaid.

                                 MORDRED
                        I... betrayed your trust,  
                        dishonored myself for selfish 
                        reasons.

                                 GALAHAD
                        You were protecting your family. 
                        There is much honor in that...

           He trails off... Galahad suddenly looks sad, broken.

                                 GALAHAD
                        I put my honor before my family and 
                        it has cost me both.

                                 MORDRED
                        You are a good knight, Galahad.

                                 GALAHAD
                        There are no good knights left.

           Mordred approaches the cell, holding out the ornate sword.

                                 MORDRED
                        The Grand Vizier of the Qu’Rad 
                        Empire gave this to my 
                        grandfather’s grandfather, Uther 
                        Pendragon the First, nearly 200 
                        years ago after their combined 
                        armies crushed the barbarians and 
                        drove them from the lands of 
                        Albion. The Grand Vizier said that 
                        it was a gift of peace, but also a 
                        reminder that war was never more 
                        than a sword’s length away. Uther 
                        named the blade in the old tongue --

           Galahad UNSHEATHES THE SWORD -- 

                                 MORDRED
                        -- He called it Excalibur. 

           The blade is black, pattern-welded, a lethally simple design.
                                 MORDRED
                        This blade passes from King to King 
                        in my family. My father showed me 
                        it once, but never used it himself. 
                        I would like you to wield it 
                        against Lancelot.

           Mordred walks closer, gripping the bars and staring at 
           Galahad with an intense gaze.

                                 MORDRED
                        Kill him, Galahad.

           Galahad’s eyes return to Excalibur, looking it up and down...

           INT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR - TIME UNKNOWN

           A detachment of CITY MILITIA march Galahad down the corridor. 

           Galahad is garbed in black from head to toe and wears 
           Excalibur on the baldric across his waist.

           INT. THE CASTLE CAMELOT - BATHS - AFTERNOON

           Lancelot sits expressionless in a large tub of scalding 
           water. SERVANTS scrub him clean as he stares far away. 

           He speaks to them, entranced, as though he has left his body.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Today, I am to kill the only 
                        honorable man left in Camelot. I 
                        will do this out love for a woman 
                        who repulses me. And all this in 
                        betrayal of a noble oath for the 
                        defense of one most vile.

           The servants, trained to listen but say nothing, finish 
           scrubbing Lancelot. They hold a TOWEL OPEN --

                                 LANCELOT
                        But perhaps the Green Mother is 
                        truly just.

           Lancelot emerges from the bath, revealing THE SCARRED SKIN on 
           his chest where he burned off his Round Table brand.

           EXT. THE STONEHENGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           An orb of deep orange reaches out from the horizon with 
           tendrils of crimson as the sun sets over Camelot, shafts of 
           the ruddy light piercing the gaps in the Stonehenge. 
           A constant breeze blows, sweeping the dried and brittle 
           leaves of autumn over the landscape.

           A CROWD of knights, nobles, and druids surrounds the outer 
           perimeter of the Stonehenge circle. 

           MORDRED stands beside Lady Guinevere and Gawain. 

           LUCAN, his leg still splinted, stands on a crutch beside Lord 
           Pellinore on the opposite side of the Stonehenge. 

                                 LUCAN
                        Do you think the Green Mother will 
                        be just today?

           Lord Pellinore grumbles. Superstitions.

                                 LORD PELLINORE
                        I find it fascinating that the man 
                        judged innocent by the goddess in a 
                        wager of battle is most often the 
                        better fighter.

           MORGAN LA FEY, the Mother’s Daughter, walks out from the 
           setting sun, a liquid shadow against the fiery light. 

           LANCELOT AND GALAHAD stand ten yards apart at the center of 
           the Stonehenge, facing Morgan La Fey. 

           Lancelot wears the rich heraldry of house Pendragon while 
           Galahad is in stark black.

           Morgan La Fey steps forward, walking out to Lancelot. She 
           stops in front of him and he kneels. Even on his knees, he 
           almost looks eye-to-eye with the tiny woman. 

           Galahad watches as the Mother’s Daughter speaks to Lancelot 
           for some time, but he cannot hear what she says. 

           When she is finished, Morgan La Fey comes to stand before 
           Galahad. He kneels, immediately shocked at what he sees --

           Morgan La Fey cannot be a day over 16 years old. Her voice is 
           musical and soft, but wise far beyond her years:

                                 MORGAN LA FEY
                        I have seen this in the fires of 
                        the sacrificed oak. Sadness gave 
                        way to hope with the fire of the 
                        true and the just burning bright 
                        after all else faded to embers.

           Galahad looks back at her, unsure what to make of her vision.

           Morgan La Fey backs away from him, returning to the top of 
           the Stonehenge, the sunset blazing around her silhouette.
                                 MORGAN LA FEY
                        Here we gather in the holiest of 
                        places under the holiest of eyes. 
                        The wager of battle is not a duel 
                        fought amongst mortal men, but a 
                        struggle of the eternal as the 
                        Goddess Danu weighs guilt against 
                        innocence. Truth against falsehood.
                             (to Galahad and Lancelot)
                        Litigants, this is your last 
                        opportunity for confession. Speak 
                        now or put forward your lives for 
                        the choosing of the just.

           Galahad stares down Lancelot, who is the first to turn away. 
           A moment after, Galahad also turns to face Morgan La Fey.

                                 MORGAN LA FEY
                        So judged shall be your souls.

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere steps forward from the crowd and 
           walks to Lancelot. There, she removes his cloak and takes his 
           baldric and scabbard once he has unsheathed his sword.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        Defeat him for the love you bear 
                        me, my Knight of Camelot.

           Lancelot, eyes narrow and focused, does not answer.

           Galahad unsheathes Excalibur. Two druids arrive to take 
           Galahad’s cloak and baldric. No words are exchanged.

           GALAHAD AND LANCELOT face one another, swords drawn.

           Lancelot takes the first stride forward, raising his blade --

           Excalibur comes up to meet it -- STEEL RINGS ON STEEL and the 
           wager of battle has begun --

           Lancelot moves like he is made of water, striking hard like a 
           breaking wave before turning back into a liquid current --

           Galahad defends, defends, defends the onslaught of attacks, 
           waiting for Lancelot to show some weakness --

           But there is none. Lancelot is a prodigy with the sword. 
           Unstoppable. A juggernaut. And he knows it.

           Lancelot slashes high at Galahad’s head -- Galahad parries --

           But in a blur, Lancelot spins around, coming low and slashing 
           Galahad across the thigh --

           Galahad stumbles forward on his lame leg. Blood leaks through 
           his black trousers and pools in the green grass at his feet.
           Lancelot backs away. He does not strike the killing blow.

           ANGLE ON - Lucan reaches out and grabs Lord Pellinore’s 
           cloak. Pellinore looks sidelong at the boy.

           Galahad sinks down on the wounded leg, resting on his sword.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Yield to me.

           Galahad tries to stand, but falters -- Lancelot edges closer. 
           Through grit teeth:

                                 LANCELOT
                        Yield.

           Suddenly, Galahad springs back to his feet, sword rising -- 

           Lancelot stumbles backward, caught off guard -- He parries, 
           parries again, backpedaling --

           Galahad slashes at Lancelot’s face -- Lancelot blocks the 
           blow, but Galahad’s sword deflects awkwardly -- 

           Excalibur cuts a diagonal slash across Lancelot’s face from 
           his forehead to his opposite cheek --

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere whips her head to Gawain, who shows 
           no reaction. She tries to keep her composure --

           Lancelot staggers backwards in shock, blinded by his own 
           blood. He paws at the injury -- There is a lot of blood, but 
           the wound is superficial --

           Enraged, Lancelot slashes at Galahad hard, backing him up -- 

           Galahad stumbles on his crippled leg -- 

           Lancelot lunges, driving the point of his sword through 
           Galahad’s shoulder --

           Excalibur drops from Galahad’s useless fingers and he sinks 
           back to his knee, blood now gushing from two wounds.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Yield to me now.

           But Galahad pats the grass with his left hand, feeling around 
           for Excalibur’s grip. 

           Lancelot watches, but cannot believe it. He wants to fight 
           with his off hand.

                                 LANCELOT
                        Yield, Galahad. End this. Please.
           Galahad crawls on hand and leg, inching toward Excalibur --

           ANGLE ON - Lucan makes a move to go for his father, but Lord 
           Pellinore’s hand flies down to hold the boy where he stands.

           Galahad closes his left hand around Excalibur. He looks up at 
           to see tears welling in Lancelot’s blue eyes --

                                 LANCELOT
                             (voice breaking)
                        YIELD, DAMN YOU!

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere looks incredulous. The crowd BUZZES 
           with surprise. She shouts at Gawain in frustration --

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        What is the fool doing?
                             (shouting over the din)
                        End him!

           Galahad drives Excalibur limply up at Lancelot’s chest -- 

           GROWLING in frustration, Lancelot BASHES the blade aside -- 

           And Lancelot thrusts his sword through Galahad’s chest until 
           it explodes BLOODY RED from the other side --

           ANGLE ON - Lucan leaves Lord Pellinore, dropping his crutch 
           and suddenly holding a SHORTSWORD --

           Galahad’s eyes go wide, then narrow. He collapses, a RUSH of 
           air escaping his punctured lungs.

           Lancelot backs away from Galahad’s body, weeping tears and 
           blood from his wounded face. 

           Lady Guinevere, smiling broadly, pushes through the crowd to 
           emerge in the open area in the Stonehenge.

           Lucan approaches Sir Gawain -- Raises his sword --

                                 LUCAN
                        GAWAIN!

           Gawain turns, caught off guard -- But he quickly slides his 
           own longsword from his scabbard, turning to face Lucan --

           Lucan SLASHES -- 

           But Gawain easily knocks the sword out of Lucan’s grip -- 
           Coldly detached, aims his sword to spear Lucan --

           CLANG! -- In a blur, Lancelot is between Gawain and Lucan -- 

           Lancelot’s sword RAINS down on Gawain’s as he ROARS WILDLY, 
           backing Gawain up --
           Gawain thrusts at Lancelot, missing -- Lancelot comes back 
           and SLASHES Gawain across the eyes, blinding him -- 

           Dropping his sword, Gawain staggers backwards, pawing at the 
           blood pouring over his useless eyes -- 

           Lancelot kicks Gawain in the chest, knocking him over -- 

           Turning over his sword, Lancelot thrusts the point downward 
           through Gawain’s chest, spearing him into the earth.

           Lucan stares down at Gawain’s corpse, wide-eyed with shock.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE (O.S.)
                        Lancelot!

           Lancelot turns around. Though still bleeding and heaving with 
           exhaustion, there is ice in the gaze he gives his Queen.

           Lady Guinevere suddenly knows that something is wrong. 

           Very wrong. Lancelot looks to Morgan La Fey:

                                 LANCELOT
                        Galahad is innocent, Your Holiness. 

           Lancelot throws down his sword. 

                                 LANCELOT
                        It was the Lady Guinevere who 
                        murdered the King. I watched her 
                        force the poison on him, but I did 
                        nothing. And when Arthur was gone, 
                        I took his Queen into his own bed.

           ANGLE ON - Lady Guinevere’s face drains of color as her world 
           comes abruptly to an end.

                                 LADY GUINEVERE
                        NO!!

           Her SHRIEK sounds far away, muted and echoing...

           FROM GALAHAD’S POV -- 

           Through the grass against his face, Galahad watches as Lord 
           Pellinore steps out, SHOUTING and pointing --

           Soldiers descend on the Queen and Lancelot --

           Lady Guinevere fights them as they restrain her -- 

           But Lancelot readily surrenders himself into custody.

           The SOUND FADES from Galahad’s world, as if he is sinking 
           deeper and deeper into water. 
           The color of the scene before him soon BLEEDS AWAY as the 
           images fade... Then --

           PURE WHITE. 

           And a voice speaks calmly from the ether:

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I am one of six.
                        I am a degree of the circle.
                        I have completed the six trials.

           COLOR bleeds in -- IMAGES burn bright, then fade into memory:

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the blade.

           EXCALIBUR - The beautiful sword is SLAMMED into its sheathe.

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the fist.

           LANCELOT - A sutured wound runs the length of his once-
           perfect face. Dressed all in black, he stands stoic, looking 
           out into nothing. Someone drapes a NOOSE over his head.

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the pain.

           LADY GUINEVERE - Eyes read from sobs and rage, is restrained 
           by SOLDIERS as a noose is fitted over her neck as well.

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the will.

           MORDRED - Now the KING OF ALBION, looks at his mother and 
           Lancelot, standing in their nooses. He NODS to someone O.S. --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        That of the blood.

           WOODEN TRAPDOORS - Open up -- ROPES go TAUGHT -- CRACK! SNAP! 

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        And that of the oath itself.

           THE CASTLE GATE - Closed. Then, it begins to rise. It rises -- 
           RISES -- The ARMY OF CAMELOT races out on horseback --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I take this oath to forego all else 
                        in protection of the royal blood of 
                        King Arthur Pendragon.

           THE POSTERN GATE - The double portcullis rises in unison -- 
           Camelot’s heavy cavalry rides hard through the opening --
                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I am my king’s sword and I am his 
                        shield. 

           LORD PELLINORE - Rides at the head of the ARMY OF AVALON --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I have given all in service of him. 
                        My possessions are forfeit. 

           LUCAN - Rides at Lord Pellinore’s side, swathed in the 
           heraldry of Avalon --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        My family are strangers to my eyes.

           ARMIES - March, battalions assembled, banners flying -- 
           Yellow and purple and green, all the heraldries of Albion --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I shall know not love, or desire, 
                        or envy, or want. 

           THE NEW ROUND TABLE - Six young knights ride in formation 
           beside their KING, paragons of chivalry and honor --

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        I shall know only this oath. 
                        Loyalty above all else. 
                        For I am one of The Six. 
                        I am a degree of the circle. 

           KING MORDRED - Rears his horse to a halt, all the ARMIES OF 
           ALBION at his back and flanks. He RAISES EXCALIBUR -- 

                                 GALAHAD (V.O.)
                        My life, my last drop of blood, in 
                        service to the Crown of Albion.

           REVERSE TO: LYONESSE - The Southern-most city of Albion burns 
           at the Saracen torch, lying in ruin across an open plain.

           And so begins THE CHARGE for war with the Qu’Rad Empire.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
