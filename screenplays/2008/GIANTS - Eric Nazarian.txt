           An MRI of a human heart PUMPING very RAPIDLY, almost to the 
           music. At the top of the aorta, a massive BUBBLE shrinks and 
           expands like a soap bubble about to BURST.

                        Antoine Bernard-Jean Marfan was born in 
                        1858. His dad was a medical 
                        ‘practitioner’ who discouraged Antoine 
                        from becoming a doctor. Like all good 
                        kids he rebelled, grew a French mustache 
                        and became the head pediatrician at the 
                        Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.

                        In 1896, Dr. Marfan treated a five-year 
                        old girl named Gabrielle P. Gabrielle had 
                        disproportionately long limbs that Dr. 
                        Marfan referred to as ‘spider’s legs.’

                        He defined her condition as 
                        dolicostenomely which is Greek for ‘long 
                        limbs.’ His research with Gabrielle led 
                        to what became known as Marfan’s 
                        Syndrome, a genetic disorder of the 
                        connective tissue that starts with 
                        Chromosome 15.

                        One out of four thousand fetuses develop 
                        a defective Chromosome 15, the ‘glue’ 
                        gene that’s supposed to keep your organs 
                        together.

                        As you get older, your organs can’t keep 
                        it together so they expand and drift 
                        apart, kind of like the earth before the

           INT. TOYOTA - CONTINUOUS

           MONTY, 20, sits in the passenger seat, pale and sweat-
           drenched. His six-foot seven frame SHAKES from severe chest 
           pains, right eye bloodshot from a detached retina. 

           ANNABETH, his mom, 40s going on late 50s, claws the steering 
           wheel, waiting for the traffic light to turn green.

                        We’re almost there baby.

           Her voice dips in and out. Monty swallows, teeth rattling. 
           Thin, bony arms folded in his lap. Turning pink fast.

           He looks out of the rain-stained passenger window, 
           spotting...

           MONTY’S P.O.V: A driveway. A Ford Taurus. Dozens of birthday 
           balloons dance in the wind. An ELDERLY WOMAN grips a 
           disposable camera, lying in wait for her Grandchild. KIDS run 
           around, excited. 

           The light turns GREEN.  Annabeth FLOORS it.

           Annabeth talks to the RECEPTIONIST. Monty sits on a chair 
           near a vending machine, hugging himself, shaking. He looks 
           up, meeting the eyes of an OLD MAN in a wheelchair and a USMC 
           mesh cap. He stares at Monty, sympathetic. 

           INT. ST. JOSEPH’S - ER - TEMPORARY CHAMBER - DAY

           Monty lies on a cot, rattling, face red, eyes bloodshot. His 
           six-foot, seven-inch frame is too big for the cot. Annabeth 
           strokes his hair, eyes hollow from years of driving him to 
           and from hospitals. A NURSE, early 20s, fills out the 
           admitting chart.

                                 MONTY
                        Does the word ‘leak’ mean anything to 
                        you?

                                 NURSE
                        ‘Leak’? 

                                 MONTY
                        Not like taking a piss. Like a ‘leak’ in 
                        your gas tank. If you don’t plug the 
                        leak, your engine will run out of gas and 
                        die.

                        Now. What does the term ‘precious 
                        moments’ mean to you?

                        Sure. 

                                 MONTY
                        ‘Precious moments’ for a Marfan’s patient 
                        are the seconds he or she has to get to 
                        the hospital so that hopefully there will 
                        be at least one competent nurse or doctor 
                        to immediately assess the situation and 
                        have a fraction of a brain to realize 
                        that there is a leak in my heart and that 
                        every second is a countdown to either 
                        plugging the leak so I don’t die or 
                        scribbling in your notebook, asking these 
                        stupid fucking questions to justify your 
                        paycheck while I bleed to death without 
                        one red fucking drop on your cheapass 
                        linoleum floor!! That...
                     (reads her name tag)
                        Lisa is what we call ‘precious moments.’ 
                        My heart is on the verge of exploding. 
                        Next Valentine’s Day, when you and your 
                        honey are cuddled up on the couch sipping 
                        Pinot Grigio, I might be six feet under. 
                        Entiendes? Now, you either get me the 
                        doctor or get me a very strong dose of 
                        Dilodid, or are you unfamiliar with the 
                        brand name? 

           The nurse looks confused. 

                                 MONTY
                        I don’t believe this shit. Dillies?

                        bell or did you have a crush on your

                        Don’t apologize! This is bullshit.
                     (to the nurse)
                        Look up my record in your system. I’m a 
                        regular here. You have a history of all 
                        the meds you’ve given me.

                        This morning around 8. I didn’t pay 
                        attention to it at first but then it got 
                        worse. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Its all that grass you’re smoking.

                        you?!

                        See how my son talks to me? Do you have

                        Those meds are the only reason I can

                        of bed. It might be shit to you but its

           He turns away from her, rattling. She looks at his giant feet 
           and arms. He starts to cry. She strokes his hair.

                        I hate Toyotas. My legs don’t fit in the 
                        driver’s seat.

                        I’ll get a Towncar next time. Plenty of 
                        leg room. 

           She holds him tight, feeling his body quiver from the pain in 
           his mid-section.

           Respirators and heart monitors BEEP. Sterile. The chuckle of 
           happy NURSES in the admitting area. 

           INT. ICU - MONTY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two big X-rays of Monty’s heart are on the wall with a 
           massive ANEURYSM in his upper aorta. 

           Monty lies in a bed, hooked up to a heart monitor. Annabeth 
           sits next to him. They stare at the X-rays, distraught. An 
           ICU NURSE finishes checking his blood pressure.

                                 ICU NURSE  
                        I’ll be right outside if you need

           She grabs her sweater and leaves.

           INT. ICU - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Annabeth sits by herself, eyes red from crying. The elevator 
           doors open. ELLEN, 50s, Monty’s aunt on his father’s side, 
           enters.

                        Did you call Caleb?

                                 ANNABETH
                     (tosses her a disapproving 
                     look)
                        Why would I?

                                 ELLEN
                        He needs to know. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t want him around.

                                 ELLEN
                        He’s not who he used to be. Give him a 
                        chance. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m done giving chances Ellen. I got way 
                        too much on my plate.

ST. JOSEPH’S - ER - LOADING AREA - NIGHT

           Monty sits in a wheelchair. The Nurse and Ellen stand next to 
           him. Annabeth pulls up in her Toyota and gets out. The nurse 
           opens the door. Monty squeezes his bulky frame into the 
           little car. Annabeth jumps back into the driver’s seat and 
           drives.

           INT. 24-HOUR PHARMACY - NIGHT

           The PHARMACIST walks up with Monty’s prescription. 

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Take one every six hours with meals.

           Monty signs for his painkillers, popping three at once. The 
           Pharmacist darts a disapproving look.

                                 MONTY
                        I’m eighteen hours behind. Ta da. 

           He exits. The Pharmacist shakes his head. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S TOYOTA - NIGHT

           Annabeth drives. Monty looks out the window, prescription in 
           hand. Silence. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Monty slowly takes off his shirt, revealing a massive SCAR 
           down the middle of his rib cage from a previous operation. He 
           peels off the surgical tape from his hand, wincing. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - LATER 

           A giant blow-up of a Ballena Franca surfacing for air hangs 
           on the wall facing Monty’s bed. Stacks of Rock n’ Roll LPs, 
           used books and a laptop rest in the corner. The walls are 
           covered with postcards of Jack Kerouac, Ernest Hemingway, Mt. 
           Everest, the Sphinx, North and South Poles and Bora Bora. 

           Freshly showered, Monty sits up in bed, headphones on. Bruce 
           Springsteen’s “Nebraska” LP spins on an old record player 
           salvaged from a garage sale. He hums along, rummaging through 
           a shoebox full of prescription drugs for his heart. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 

           Monty is knocked out in bed, headphones on. The NEEDLE of the 
           record player SCRATCHES Side “A” of the “Nebraska” LP. 

           Annabeth turns off the record player and gingerly takes off 
           the headphones. He turns over, clueless. She covers him with 
           a blanket, noticing the prescription drugs. She stares at him 
           for a few seconds, then switches off the antique shop lamp by 
           his bed.

MONTY’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Monty SNEEZES, wincing from the pain in his chest. He 
           switches on the lamp, flinching at the sight of Annabeth 
           dozing on a chair outside his door. 

                                 MONTY
                        What the fu--

           Her eyes crack open, bloodshot from insomnia. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        You okay baby?

                                 MONTY
                        You scared the shit out of me! 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I must have dozed off. 

                                 MONTY
                        Go doze off in your own room. Christ mom.  
                        A little privacy for fuck’s sake! 

           He switches off the lamp and turns over very slowly. She 
           moves the chair back to the living room.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Good night. 

                                 MONTY
                        Close the door. 

           His gargantuan legs curl up under the covers. Annabeth goes 
           to her room. 

           O.S. A stray dog’s HOWL ECHOES in the distant. 

           Monty turns over and pinches the blinds, looking for the 
           stray. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Spare. A giant photo shrine of her daughter KIMBERLY, an ash 
           blonde younger version of Annabeth clad in Marine fatigues, 
           hangs below a ceramic crucifix embellished with a ribbon: 
           Beloved Daughter and Sister 1983-2004. 

           Annabeth climbs into her small single bed surrounded with an 
           armada of 99 cent store ceramic angels and rosaries swirling 
           around Kodak moments of Monty’s various birthdays.  

           She picks up Monty’s well-thumbed drugstore copy of Conde 
           Nast Traveler and flips through the pretty pictures more out 
           of habit than curiosity. MAXI, her Siamese cat, digs her head 
           into the comforter, letting out a lazy MEOW. 

           Annabeth tosses the magazine aside and tiptoes into the hall, 
           watching Monty sleep.

           Working-class. House proud. Not a speck of dust anywhere. A 
           large window overlooks the spray paint frescoes of a nearby 
           railyard. 

           A Southern Pacific train rattles by, causing light RIPPLES in 
           Annabeth’s coffee mug. She gazes at the swirling steam from 
           her Folger’s instant, lost in uneasy thoughts but doing her 
           best to hide it. 

           The radio is tuned to KLOS. Several more Rock n’ Roll LPs 
           from yard sales line the bookshelves next to fold-up 
           supermarket posters of WHALES exploding out of stormy waters. 

           Monty jams the last bit of his toast with fresh boysenberry 
           spread. Annabeth sips coffee, weary from insomnia. 

                                 MONTY
                        You should go to work. How am I
                        gonna pick up chicks with you holding my 
                        hand everywhere I go? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Will you please use the elevator today? 

                                 MONTY
                        They’re for the handicapped and lazy 
                        people. Besides, it’s crowded most of the 
                        time with a bunch of people I don’t know. 

           He puts his plate in the sink and slurps up his juice. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Is that tutor still checking you out?

                                 MONTY
                        She’s harmless, unfortunately. No tits.
                        Flat-chested tutors are no fun. I can’t 
                        concentrate. 

           Monty passes his USC backpack stuffed with L.A. City College 
           used textbooks. 

                                 MONTY
                        I should try and sell back my books. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Will they take ‘em?

                                 MONTY
                     (thinks for a second)
                        Probably not.

           He pecks her forehead. She stuffs a $20 in his shirt pocket. 

                                 MONTY
                        Thanks. 

           Monty opens the door, minding his head as he exits.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Bye.

           O.S. His FOOTSTEPS THUMP down the stairs. 

           Annabeth downs her coffee and heads into Monty’s bedroom, 
           passing a Living With Marfan’s Syndrome booklet. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annabeth searches under Monty’s mattress for pills. She looks 
           around, gingerly takes out his neatly folded undershirts and 
           socks from the drawers, rummaging around for any hint of 
           painkillers.  

           INT. RTD - MORNING

           Neil Young’s crunching guitar blasts through Monty’s 
           earphones. He sits in the front seat, mindful of his legs 
           blocking the aisle. The bus pulls to a stop. A CHUBBY LADY 
           with laundry bags boards. Monty curls up his size 16 Chuck 
           Taylor’s. The chubby lady quickly passes. 

                                 CHUBBY LADY
                        Excuse me. 

                                 MONTY
                        It’s much worse in airplanes. 

           He uncurls, smile etched on his face, his most reliable 
           shield. 

           INT. DR. KENNETH WRIGHT’S OFFICE - MORNING

           An MRI of Monty’s heart. Massive fusiform aortic aneurysm. 
           Bypass required. DR. KENNETH, 40s, Irish stock, is on the 
           phone, squeezing a hand muscle relaxant. 

                                 DR. KENNETH
                     (into the phone)
                        ...you didn’t contact me or his pain 
                        management. It’s very frustrating and 
                        unacceptable and totally against all 
                        protocol. 
                     (listens)
                        I understand that Sheron but with all due 
                        respect it’s a click of a button to get 
                        you all the information you need about my 
                        patient. Sharing information is what

           CARMELIA, 30s, his secretary looks up, upset.

           thumb in the tide of FRESHMEN and SOPHOMORES. He walks

                        rip out the arch in your aorta and 
                        replace it with Teflon one. Can I retake

                        We’re waiting on the insurance company to 
                        give us the go ahead. Next week, the

                        My mom’s pretty much freaking out, per 
                        usual. Drives me fuckin’ nuts. 

           INT. THOMAS EDISON ELEMENTARY - FRONT OFFICE - DAY 

           Annabeth is on the phone with Dr. Kenneth, sweaty and dog 
           tired.

                                 ANNABETH 
                        I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

                                 DR. KENNETH
                        You are not doing anything wrong, honey. 
                        Unfortunately even my hands are tied. We 
                        sent over the paperwork to the insurance 
                        company. They know this is urgent. 

                                 ANNABETH 
                        What should I do? 

                                 DR. KENNETH
                        Sit tight. 

           A pause. Annabeth notices several PARENTS lining up outside 
           the school, waiting for their CHILDREN. A look of yearning 
           overwhelms her.

                                 DR. KENNETH
                        Annabeth?

           She snaps out of it.

                                 DR. KENNETH
                        You okay?

           A pause. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know. 

           EXT. CLEMENTINE CAFE - DAY

           Buddha Bar plays softly on the stereo. Vintage bohemian 
           posters decorate the walls. A half-sipped latte rests in 
           front of Monty next to a Clove cigarette blazing in the 
           ashtray, unsmoked. Monty enjoys the second hand smoke, 
           listening to his beat up CD Walkman and people watching. 

           INT. FOOD 4 LESS - DAY

           Annabeth squints at freshly wrapped chicken breasts, unable 
           to read the price. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        ‘Scuse me...

           The BUTCHER looks up.

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        I left my glasses at home. Can you tell 
                        me the price please?

                                 BUTCHER
                     (looks)
                        $2.29 a pound.

                                 ANNABETH
                        How many pounds?

                                 BUTCHER
                        Little over four. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Thank you.

           The butcher goes away. She quickly counts on her fingers and 
           puts the chicken back on the rack.

           EXT. CLEMENTINE CAFE - SAME TIME

           The Clove burns out. Monty keeps clearing his throat. The sun 
           starts to scratch. He moves inside.

           INT. CLEMENTINE CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           Monty sits by the window, sweat dotting his brow. He looks 
           around, slightly nervous. A sharp pang shoots down his back. 
           He goes to the CASHIER.

                        Is the call local?

                                 MONTY
                        Yeah. 

           Cashier extends him the cordless, watching Monty’s nail-
           bitten fingers wrap around it, punching the number pad. He 
           waits for the line, swallowing repeatedly. The Cashier goes 
           back to her magazine. 

           EXT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - STAIRS - SAME TIME

           CALEB, late 40s, Monty’s dad and Annabeth’s ex-husband, sits 
           on the stairs, pulling on a Winston. Weathered from decades 
           of hard living. He peeks at his watch, brows slightly arched 
           into a semi-permanent frown. 

           The phone RINGS inside. He cranes his neck, meeting the 
           curtains. 

           INT. CLEMENTINE CAFE - SAME TIME

           Monty dries sweat, ear glued to the phone. Nervous. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck.

           He drops the phone, clenching the pastry counter. The cashier 
           looks up. 

                                 CASHIER
                        You okay?

           An uneasy pause.

                                 MONTY
                        No...
                     (eyes burning; throat 
                     tightening)
                        Can...you please...call...911?

           The cashier runs around the counter, alarmed.

                                 CASHIER
                        What’s wrong?

           He bumps into a little table and squeezes into the chair, 
           knocking over the salt shakers. The cashier dials 9-1-1.

           EXT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - STAIRS - SAME TIME

           Annabeth emerges with two plastic bags, jammed with canned 
           food and whole chickens. Caleb gets up. She spots him, 
           freezing out of caution.

           He picks up the Winston, smothers it. 

                                 CALEB
                        Is there a trash can?

           Annabeth unlocks the door and enters. Caleb stands by the

           An AMBULANCE and FIRE TRUCK arrive. Monty heaves, sweating 
           and blinking rapidly. The contact slides out of his bloodshot 
           eye. PARAMEDICS rush in.

                        dissecting. 

           The FIREMEN follow the Paramedics, radios BLARING. 

           EXT./INT. MONTY’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Annabeth finishes putting away the groceries, avoiding Caleb 
           still standing outside. He looks around the living room, 
           noticing a poster of a WHALE. Annabeth notices.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Do me a favor. If you’re planning on 
                        coming around, call next time. 

                                 CALEB
                        I did. There was no answering. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Well then don’t come around until I say  
                        its okay for you to come around. 

                                 CALEB
                     (pulls out another Winston)
                        Does Monty have a cell phone?

                                 ANNABETH
                        No.  

           At the sound of his lighter, Annabeth turns.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Go downstairs if you’re gonna smoke. I 
                        don’t want that shit floating into my 
                        house. 

                                 CALEB
                        When is he back from school?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know.

                        If he wants to talk to you he’ll call 
                        you. I’m not the goddamn messenger. 

           The telephone RINGS. Caleb turns and heads down the stairs, 
           blazing another cigarette, stung.

           The Medics roll Monty in. His face is BEET RED and dry. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDSMOBILE (MOVING) - DAY

           Caleb is speeding and smoking nervously. Annabeth is in the 
           passenger seat, frantic. 

                                 CALEB
                     (turns onto Vermont)
                        They shoulda kept him at the hospital. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why did you turn here?? It bottle necks 
                        on Hollywood Boulevard. Make a left right 
                        here...right here!!

                        route!!

           He tries to make a left. The street is blocked.

                                 CALEB
                        Shit.   

           He continues on Vermont, straight into a bottle neck. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        GOD DAMMIT!!  

           He comes to a stop behind a pick-up. She opens the door and 
           flies out into the traffic.

           She runs across the street, dashing towards Queen of Angels.

                        I’ve been in hospitals longer than I’ve 
                        been in school. After a while, there’s 
                        not much difference between the two. You 
                        come in waiting to get out. Once I’m out, 
                        it’s time to go back in again...with 
                        hospitals there’s no permanent exit and 
                        no graduation date.

           The CACOPHONY of multi-ethnic TONGUES and BABY SCREAMS in the

                        around, day in, day out...one hospital 
                        after the next...one bad cafeteria after 
                        the next. When I’m bored, I fly away...

           turns away, pretending not to notice him. The line moves 
           forward.

                        Your EKG and blood tests came back fine. 
                        Since you discontinued your anxiety meds,

                        You’re not supposed to discontinue 
                        anything without checking with Dr. Ken.

                        Look, I’m not feeling well and you being 
                        here is not making me feel any better. 
                        Take a hint.  

           INT. QUEEN OF ANGELS - ER WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb sits among the faces, nervously waiting. Annabeth 
           brushes past him, exiting. He follows her. 

           EXT. QUEEN OF ANGELS - ER - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb runs up to her.

                                 CALEB
                        What’s going on? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Twenty fuckin’ years my whole life is one 
                        hospital after the next and he treats me 
                        like SHIT in front of everybody! 

                                 CALEB
                        What did they say?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t think this is a good time for you 
                        to be here, Caleb. Just leave. 

           She turns away. 

                                 CALEB
                        How are you gonna get home?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Don’t worry about it. Just go. 

                                 CALEB
                        If that’s what you want.

                                 ANNABETH
                        It’s not me. It’s Monty.

                        Okay.

           Caleb looks down, stoic. She walks around in circles. They 
           avoid each other. A long pause. He glances at her and walks 
           away. She avoids him. 

           INT. QUEEN OF ANGELS - ER - LATER 

           Dr. Woo draws the curtains and goes to the next chamber. Dr. 
           Kenneth listens carefully to Monty’s aorta through a 
           stethoscope. Monty looks at the peeling paint on the wall, 
           numb.

                        internship down there. I’ll cover your 
                        travel expenses and put in a little elbow 
                        grease.

           A sexy NURSE passes by, grinning a “Hello.” Dr. Kenneth winks 
           at her as she disappears. Monty notices this. 

                                 MONTY
                        Nice tits.

           INT. QUEEN OF ANGELS - ER - EVENING

           Caleb and Annabeth sit a few chairs apart, avoiding each 
           other. Annabeth looks pale, upset and in no mood to talk. 
           Caleb stares at the TV flashing a Spanish telenovela. The 
           predominantly Latino Visitors are glued to the tube. 

           The doors bolt open. Monty is escorted out by a Nurse. He 
           spots Caleb, unpleasantly surprised. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Annabeth unlocks the door. Monty enters. Caleb hesitates, 
           then walks in, McDonald’s bags in hand. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Come on honey. Wash up and sit. 

           Monty heads straight into his room. 

                                 MONTY
                        Not hungry. 

                                 CALEB
                        I got the combo for you.

           He slams the door. Caleb looks to Annabeth, taking a hint. 
           Annabeth goes to Monty’s door. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Honey? 

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        I don’t want any! 

           Annabeth goes to the kitchen table. 

                                 CALEB
                     (to Annabeth)
                        You were right. I shoulda left. 

           He heads to the door.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Sit down.

           He stops by the door, befuddled. She puts Monty’s portion in 
           the fridge and pulls up a chair, setting a plastic fork and 
           napkin for herself and Caleb. Caleb stands, sullen. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Something wrong?

                                 CALEB
                     (reaches for his Winstons; 
                     uneasy)
                        Maybe later. Let him rest. 

           He heads to the door. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        He’s resting fine. Sit down and eat.

                                 CALEB
                     (hesitates)
                        Did he say when the operating doctor’s 
                        gonna call? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        No. They’re on their own schedule. 

                                 CALEB
                        I’ll call you tomorrow...
                     (opens the door)

           He exits. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Whatever.

           Annabeth looks at her greasy cheeseburger, disgusted. She 
           junks it. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monty’s bedroom window overlooks an abandoned RAILYARD. Monty 
           leans against the window, staring at the weed-covered train 
           tracks stretching into the horizon.  

           In the distant, he spots a STRAY DOG resembling an oversized 
           German Shepard trotting along the tracks. His eyes follow the 
           stray as it moves toward a graffiti-covered wall, becoming a 
           wolfish silhouette as it disappears. 

           He lies down on his bed and peels off the surgical tape over 
           his IV pinprick. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - DUSK

           A HOWL jolts Monty out of sleep. He sits up, hearing another 
           wolfish howl. Monty goes to the window, looking for the stray 
           in the railyard.

MONTY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annabeth is curled on the couch with Maxi, watching Judge 
           Mathis yell at a woeful plaintiff. She is tired but unable to 
           sleep. Monty walks out.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where are you going? 

                                 MONTY
                        For a walk. 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (gets up)
                        I’ll come with you.

                                 MONTY
                        I said “I’m” going for a walk, not “Wanna 
                        go for a walk?” 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (back to Mathis)
                        Don’t go too far.

           He heads out, ignoring her. 

           EXT. SHADY SPRING STREET - DUSK

           Monty idles toward the railyard, hearing another howl. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - DUSK

           TWILIGHT seeps in. Streetlights cast a burnt orange glow over 
           the graffiti-covered railyard. 

           Monty reaches a barbed wire fence. He scopes the yard and 
           squeezes his big frame through a hole in the fence. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - BY THE TRACKS

           The remains of homeless encampments litter the yard. Monty 
           heads toward a bizarre mishmash of charred palm trees growing 
           out of a cul-de-sac of abandoned industrial buildings. 
           Welcome to the PALM JUNGLE. Monty spots something. 

           MONTY’S P.O.V: The STRAY DOG’s muzzle is deep inside a 
           Doritos bag, fetching out chip crumbs for her PUP. 

           Monty hides by the tracks, quietly watching. The Stray 
           abandons the weather-beaten Doritos bag, walking away. The 
           Pup trails his mom, disappearing behind the building.  

           Monty pulls out his CD Walkman, puts on the headphones and 
           hits PLAY, sitting on the tracks. The opening STRUMS of 
           Donovan’s “Catch The Wind” kicks in. He rests his elbows on 
           his knees, eyes glued to the train tracks disappearing into 
           the horizon.

           Onions grill in a frying pan. Annabeth is circling the room, 
           about to detonate.

           O.S. Monty’s FOOTSTEPS THUMP slowly up the stairs.

                        Fine. There’s two new strays in the 
                        neighborhood.

                        No. They were too far. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Makes my skin crawl. They bit your dad 
                        once when we were in high school. Nearly 
                        tore off his ankle. He had to get a 
                        rabies shot.

                        Why didn’t you tell me he was at the

                                 ANNABETH
                        I told him to leave but he stayed. 
                        Ellen told him about the operation. 

                                 MONTY
                        I don’t want him near me. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Me either.

                                 MONTY
                        Only cuz Kim died, that’s why he’s coming 
                        around. 

           Annabeth stares at the frying onions, remembering Kim.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Death wakes you up. Maybe some day when 
                        I’m old and gray I’ll forgive him. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck forgiveness. I want revenge.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Don’t say that. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck his mea culpa bullshit. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        STOP!!

           Monty looks away.

                                 ANNABETH
                        At least he’s trying. I’ll give him that. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’ll sock him right in the face next time 
                        he comes around. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        You will not!

                        I’d rather burn in hell than take his

                     (devilish smile)
                        Nostalgia for your long lost youth 
                        creeping in a little? 

           Annabeth rolls her eyes at him. 

                                 MONTY
                        C’mon mom. I know you look through your 
                        old glory day Polaroids in the wee hours. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        That’s not funny Monty. Not in a million 
                        year--

                                 MONTY
                        Still got the hots for him, don’t you? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        After the hell he put us through...no 
                        thanks. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’m gonna move out after this whole thing 
                        is over...where does that leave you? I 
                        know you don’t want to grow old alone 
                        sitting in some old folks home off 
                        Colorado Boulevard wondering about how 
                        things could’ve been. 

           Annabeth looks away, hurt.

                                 ANNABETH
                        You really know how to hurt people with 
                        what you say, Montgomery. 

                                 MONTY
                        Words are my weapons. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Nothing to be proud of. 

                                 MONTY
                        Sometimes I wonder...now that Kim’s gone 
                        and after I’m gone, where’s that gonna 
                        leave you two?

           She drops the frying pan and storms into her room, SLAMMING 
           the door. Monty looks away, regretting what he just said. He 
           inches toward her door, KNOCKS. No answer.

                        Shit. 

           He lifts the pan off of the stove top. The door opens. 
           Annabeth heads back to the kitchen, eyes RED. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Move.

           She drops a fat cube of butter into the frying pan. It 
           SIZZLES, liquefying. 

                                 MONTY
                        What are you cooking?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Imitation crab and fries. 

           Monty gives her a hug, kissing her on the cheek.

                                 MONTY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Go wash up. 

           Monty notices the unmarked pack of frozen French fries. 

                                 MONTY
                        Did you get this from the school caf?

           She nods reluctantly. 

                                 MONTY
                        You really gotta cut the carbs, ma. I 
                        thought you wanted to live to be 90.

                                 ANNABETH
                        When I was young, I wanted lots of 
                        things. Now? Sixty’s plenty.

                                 MONTY
                        Let’s see. You’re 46. Got another 
                        fourteen years to go. I’ll be thirty 
                        three. 
                     (thinks)
                        That’s very selfish, ma. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Can’t expect too much from life. No more 
                        than the Lord’s willing to give. Take it 
                        and be grateful. 

                                 MONTY
                        The Lord’s got nothing to do with your 
                        diet. I’m sure he would be doing 
                        somersaults if he knew you cut the carbs 
                        and were exercising a little more.

                        I’m not making fun of you. All I want out 
                        of this conversation is for you to stop 
                        using butter and start cooking with olive 
                        oil. Is that too much to ask?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’ll get some olive oil from the market. 

                                 MONTY
                        And another thing. I know you love 
                        imitation crab but can we try salmon for 
                        a change?

                                 ANNABETH
                        We try what we can afford. 

           Monty lies down on the couch. 

                                 MONTY
                        That’s why they invented the credit 
                        card...to get what you can’t pay for. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t take what I can’t pay for. That’s 
                        the problem with your generation. You 
                        have more credit than brains and no 
                        collateral. 

                                 MONTY
                        This country is built on credit. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        What I have is mine, paid in full. I 
                        don’t owe anybody. 

                                 MONTY
                        That’s why you’ve been breaking your back 
                        for twenty years and we still can’t get 
                        out of the neighborhood. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’ve been breaking my back so you can go 
                        to college. When you’re out you’ll get a 
                        good job and we’ll move out someplace 
                        nice.

                        Yeah...someplace nice...

           She sets the table. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           After dinner. The greasy after scent of grilled onions, fries 
           and bad crab meat hangs in the air. Monty lies on the couch, 
           reading an old copy of National Geographic. “Giants of the 
           Deep: Migrations of the Patagonian Right Whale.” 

           Annabeth turns on the living room lamp, noticing his SWOLLEN 
           LEFT FOOT. She goes back to the kitchen.

                        How much do you think the brain of a 
                        whale weighs?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Dunno. Fifty pounds?

                                 MONTY
                        Twenty. How about an elephant?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Ten.

                        Close. Three. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Are whales smarter than elephants?

                                 MONTY
                        You can’t really compare. Whales hear 
                        better than land animals. They have a way 
                        of sending sound waves underwater to 
                        track each other, kinda like the way 
                        wolves howl. Cool huh?

           She smiles proudly.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Do I get to go on all those whale 
                        watching trips after you become a marine 
                        biologist?

                                 MONTY
                        If you make it past sixty, I’ll think 
                        about it. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 

           Annabeth dozes on the couch. Monty covers her with a blanket 
           and tiptoes to his room. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monty closes the door and pulls out a stethoscope from the 
           closet. He slides it over his heart and listens.

           LUB-DUB. LUB...DUB.

           Several vicious BARKS suddenly erupt from the railyard. Monty 
           looks out the window, spotting only the train tracks faintly 
           lit by the moon.

           O.S. The barks get louder as a few strays come to blows, 
           fangs tangling with flesh. 

                                 MONTY
                        Shit. 

           The dogfight continues in the pitch black railyard, getting 
           more violent. Monty stares into the dark, unnerved as one of 
           the barks becomes a desperate squeal. 

           Monty listens, disturbed. He quickly puts on his tennis 
           shoes. The squeal dies down. Monty goes back to the window. 
           The railyard suddenly falls silent. He kicks off his shoes, 
           drags the stethoscope over his aorta and resumes counting his 
           heartbeats.  

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - DAWN 

           Monty hasn’t slept a wink. Annabeth gets ready to leave for 
           work. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’ll call Dr. Kenneth after recess.

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t bother him at work. If there’s an 
                        update Carmelia will call. 

                                 ANNABETH

                     velcros)
                        I wrote the new number of the school caf 
                        on the fridge. 

                                 MONTY
                        Is your new boss nice? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        As a matter of fact...she is. 
                     (grabs her keys)
                        She knows my boy’s a giant.  

           She kisses his forehead and heads out. 

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t work too hard. They’re not paying 
                        you enough. 

           Monty waits until she is gone, then puts on his shoes. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - MORNING

           Monty stands near the epicenter of last night’s dogfight, 
           holding a Ziplock baggy filled with fries and imitation crab 
           leftovers. He studies the bitten-off fur patches and blood 
           smears, unnerved. The smell of railyard garbage is atrocious. 

                                 MONTY
                        Shit. 

           He holds his nose and walks a few feet away, meeting...

           The greenish-gray EYES of a big STRAY DOG, frozen on Monty. 
           Her paws are smeared with dry BLOOD, pearly white fur soiled 
           by soot and railyard dust. Up close, she could be a she-wolf. 

           Monty’s mouth dries up, giant toes curling inside his  
           sneakers. His eyes dart around her wolfish features, gray 
           gaze, and bloody paws. 

                                 MONTY
                     (softly)
                        Hey...

           WOOF!!

           The stray inches closer to Monty, each step pounding a 
           million cells of adrenaline through his heart. 

                                 MONTY
                        Easy...

           CLUNK.

           He drops the Ziplock full of soggy fries and crab leftovers. 
           The stray spots it. Monty inches back. The stray keeps 
           staring at him, in full attack mode. Sweat dots Monty’s 
           forehead. He notices the stray’s PUP nonchalantly dive for 
           the leftovers, nibbling holes in it with his little paws. The 
           stray suddenly leaps forward, BARKING. 

                                 MONTY
                        Easy! Easy!!

           Monty retreats fast, hitting the graffitied wall of a 
           warehouse. The stray prepares to attack. The pup keeps 
           devouring the crab bits, barking between bites. 

           Monty keeps retreating toward a parked freight car, stumbling 
           over spray cans and garbage. The stray fronts him at close 
           range, BARKING. Monty nearly trips on a can, heart in his 
           throat. The stray turns and trots back to her pup. 

           Monty gets to the freight car, watching mother and son devour 
           last night’s leftovers.

           Recess is over. Annabeth is mopping the messy, sneaker-
           streaked floor. IMELDA, 50s, a kitchen helper, leans in.

           Caleb is standing in the back near the boxes of plastic cups 
           and trays. Annabeth emerges, wiping sweat and unpleasantly 
           surprised to see him.

                                 ANNABETH
                        He won’t take anything from you.

                        It doesn’t have to be from me...you can 
                        give it to him. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Don’t worry about it. It’s the thought 
                        that counts.

                        Nothing. I feel like a complete idiot 
                        coming here. 

           He turns and walks away. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        He likes whales. 

           Caleb stops, turns around, surprised. 

                                 CALEB
                        You mean like Shamu?

                                 ANNABETH
                        He hates Orcas.

                        I wouldn’t know what an Orca is if it was 
                        standing right in front of me.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Its a killer whale. He’s hates ‘em. 
                        Anything else he pretty much likes.

                        I take it that’s a “yes?” 

           The look on Annabeth’s face borders between bewilderment and  
           fear. She says nothing.

                        Don’t be late. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Monty gets out of the shower, slides on his jeans, Social 
           Distortion t-shirt and well-worn Vans tennis shoes. He feels 
           something in his jeans pocket. He pulls it out, revealing two 
           crinkled $20s Annabeth stuffed.

                                 MONTY
                        Sweet. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Monty listens to Nazareth’s “Telegram,” ironing his pants and 
           singing at the top of his lungs.

                                 MONTY
                        ...hotel lobby looks the same...with all 
                        the same old girls in town!!...need your 
                        picture, smile this way...and will you 
                        tell me what you play!!

           He goes into air guitar mode, miming the CRUNCHING solo and 
           working off steam. He stops as the music soars, staring at 
           the ironing board, feeling something in his chest. He sits 
           down, pumping up the volume.  

           INT. CIGAR SHOP - DAY

           Empty. Monty unwraps a fresh Cohiba, sniffing it. YERVANT, 
           50s, puffs on a stogie, reading an Armenian newspaper. He 
           pulls out a butane lighter and blazes it. Monty lights up, 
           looking around. Half the store is empty. Several cigar boxes 
           in the back, ready to be moved out. 

                                 MONTY

                        Maybe go into the bird business.

                                 MONTY
                        Bird?

                        My brother wants to import birds from 
                        Caribbean. People like birds. Rich 
                        people. Pay very good money. 

                                 MONTY
                        I never would have thought you would go 
                        into the ‘bird business.’ 

                                 YERVANT
                        If you want to survive in this country 
                        now you need to find what rich people 
                        like and get it for them fast before 
                        somebody else does. Everything 
                        competition. Everything difficult now. 
                        Not like when I came to this country 
                        thirty one year ago, nobody in this city. 
                        I tell my brother to partner with me and 
                        open restaurant on Brand. He say no. Some 
                        one else from Beirut open, now making 
                        millions and look where I am now. 
                     (upset)
                        I was first original cigar store on this 
                        street. Now there is eight of them in two 
                        mile radius. Every pezevang from old 
                        country come, they think they 
                        connoisseurs.

                        We say you have to put your hand on your 
                        knee and get up yourself. Don’t rely on 
                        anybody.

                        You ask a lot of questions young man. Are 
                        you a reporter or some-teeng like dat?

                                 MONTY
                        I’m sorry. I was just curious. Anyway...

           Monty sits under the shade of a charred palm tree, sharing 
           the cigar with his Goth friend ISABELLA (IZZY), 20. She 
           sports worn-out Doc Martens, buzzed head and a few tattoos. 
           Monty looks up at the big palms swaying above them, eyes 
           dilated, calm in his voice. 

                                 MONTY
                        It’s funny. When you look up, you could 
                        be in Tahiti or Gilligan’s Island. You 
                        look down, you’re back in L.A. Try it.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re stoned. 

                                 MONTY
                        C’mon. It’s called exercising your 
                        imagination. 

                                 IZZY
                     (looks up)
                        I’m in L.A.
                     (looks down)
                        I’m still in L.A. 

                                 MONTY
                        You have no eyes. 

                                 IZZY
                        You got too much time on your hands. 

                                 MONTY
                        Thanks for carrying the load.

           He shakes a little pillbox of very potent painkillers. 

                                 MONTY
                        This stuff works pure magic for my back. 

                                 IZZY
                        It’s legal heroin.

                                 MONTY
                        Opium.

                                 IZZY
                        Whatever. No wonder your mom hates me. 
                        I’m like your mule.  

                                 MONTY
                        Transporter. Mule’s a derogatory term. 

                                 IZZY
                        Whatever. 

           Monty wraps the painkillers in a Ziplock and buries it.

                        My grandpa used to take me for walks when 
                        I was a kid. This used to be a short cut 
                        back home before the railroad fenced it. 

                                 IZZY
                        I never knew my grandparents.

           She shakes her head.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

           Industrial back roads. Sawmills and demolition yards. Monty 
           tries to balance himself on a rusty train track. His big feet 
           keep slipping. 

           A saw mill GRINDS from around the corner. Monty heads toward 
           it, passing several shopping cart tents pitched by the local 
           HOMELESS. A motley crew of vagrants, young, old, middle-aged. 
           Wounded hearts and hitchhikers without social security 
           numbers. They watch Monty pass without a word. 

           EXT. SAW MILL - MINUTES LATER

           Monty walks up, spotting a big wooden recycling bin. A 
           Central American CARPENTER walks out, taking off his goggles. 

                                 MONTY
                        Hi. 

           The Carpenter nods. 

                                 MONTY
                        Are these for sale?

                                 CARPENTER
                        No.(cid:13)

                                 MONTY
                        Where can I buy two pieces of plywood?

                                 CARPENTER
                        Plywood? Store.

                        You guys don’t sell ‘em?

                                 CARPENTER
                        No...no sell. 

                                 MONTY
                        I like the smell.

                                 CARPENTER

                        The hell was I doing taking French? 
                     (mutters)
                        No habla Espanol. 

           The carpenter goes about his work, ignoring Monty with a 
           smile. Monty scrutinizes the recycling bin, spotting a thin 
           sheet of plywood. The carpenter looks around, then comes 
           back. 

                                 CARPENTER
                        Mi...boss...cah-ming...you go.

           He points to the bin. Monty pulls out a few crinkled bucks. 

                                 CARPENTER
                        No...no...es basura. (garbage.)

                                 MONTY
                        Muchas gracias.

           The carpenter goes back to the warehouse, keeping an eye out. 
           Monty carefully rummages through the splintered wood heaps, 
           pulling out three pieces of plywood. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Annabeth hurries home, beaming.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Monty!

           No answer. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        MONTY!!
                     (looks around)
                        Shit. 

           She quickly peels off her cafeteria clothes and jumps into 
           the shower. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - LATER 

           Monty drags three pieces of plywood past the train tracks, 
           heaving. He stops, catching his breath as he looks around 
           cautiously.  

           INT. ANNABETH’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Dozens of old dresses litter Annabeth’s bed. She frantically 
           empties her closet, stressing for an appropriate dress. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Dammit! 

           She looks at the clock: 5:45.

                                 ANNABETH 
                        Where the hell is that boy?

THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - AFTERNOON

           Monty leans the plywood against the charred palm tree. 

                                 MONTY
                        Shit.

           He sidesteps several piles of dog shit. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LATER 

           Annabeth is dressed in a slightly kitschy floral dress, 
           pacing around nervously. Monty walks in. 

                                 MONTY
                        Hey.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where were you?! 

                                 MONTY
                        When somebody says hello, you say hello 
                        back, not “where were you?!” 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (turns pale)
                        Have you been smoking? 

           Monty walks to his room. She blocks him, scenting the cigar 
           smell on his shirt. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh my God. I don’t believe this!! 

                                 MONTY
                        Get over it. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        It’s that little tart isn’t it?!  

                                 MONTY
                        What are you talking about?! We don’t 
                        even hang out anymore. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Sure you don’t.

                                 MONTY
                        And even if I did. So what?

                                 ANNABETH
                        She looks like she shot out of a God damn 
                        canon! 

                                 MONTY
                        Leave her out of this! She’s got nothing 
                        to do with it! 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I told you NOT to hang out with her.

                        I’ll hang out with whoever I want! 

           She grabs the phone, hands trembling as she dials.

                                 MONTY
                        WHO ARE YOU CALLING?! 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Doctor Kenneth.  

                                 MONTY

                        I’ve spent my God damn life taking care 
                        of you only to watch you destroy 
                        yourself?!!

                        Maybe you should fuckin’ STOP! It’s my 
                        life and I’ll do whatever the fuck I 
                        want!!!

           He goes to his room, SLAMS the door. She SLAMS down the 
           phone.

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monty walks to the window, palms against temples, livid. 

           O.S. A KNOCK on the door. 

                                 MONTY
                        What?

           She cracks the door.

                        CLOSE-MY-FUCKING-DOOR.

           She stands in the doorway.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        This is not your door. You are living in

                        Cigar. I know what cigarettes smell like.

                                 MONTY
                     (simmering)
                        What did you say?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Seven o’clock.

                                 MONTY
                     (finishes tying her laces)
                        You’re fuckin’ stupid.

           Annabeth suddenly SLAPS him.

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t you EVER put your FUCKIN’ hand on 
                        me!!

           He flies into his room, SLAMMING the door. She turns away, 
           spotting...

           Caleb standing in the doorway. He is clean shaven, hair 
           gelled, dressed in a new short-sleeve shirt. 

                                 CALEB
                        You shouldn’t have hit him.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Go to hell, Caleb. 

           She goes to her room, closing the door. Caleb looks toward 
           Monty’s room, hurt in his eyes. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Dusk. Caleb sits on the couch. Distant Mexican MUSIC booms 
           from the street. Monty’s bedroom door slowly opens. 

                                 CALEB
                        Hi.

           Monty crosses to the fridge, pulls out more leftovers from 
           last night and heads out, ignoring him. After a beat, 
           Annabeth walks out of her bedroom, hearing Monty’s FOOTSTEPS 
           on the stairs. She puts on her shoes. 

                                 CALEB
                        Leave him be Annabeth. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        You don’t tell me what to do in my house, 
                        got that?

                                 CALEB
                        You’re only gonna piss him off more.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Get out.  

                                 CALEB
                        I’m not arguing with you.

                                 ANNABETH
                        GET OUT I SAID!!

           Caleb gets up and heads to the door. He stops, turns and 
           looks at her, hoping she reconsiders. She glares at him. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why did you come back? 

           Caleb heads down the stairs without another word. 
                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - EVENING 

           The full moon casts a bright glow on the palm jungle. Monty 
           walks to the charred palm, spotting the silhouette of the 
           STRAY. He cautiously arranges the pieces of plywood. Scenting 
           something, he suddenly turns, startled at the sight of Caleb, 
           cigarette in hand. 

                                 CALEB
                        Hey.

           Monty drags the plywood away. 

                                 MONTY
                        What do you want?

           Caleb extends his pack of Winstons to Monty. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’m not into the peace pipe thing.

                                 CALEB
                        Your mom’s real sorry.

                                 MONTY
                        What are you, her spokesman? 

           Caleb notices the piles of dog shit. A beat. 

                                 CALEB
                        Don’t get too close to ‘em.

                                 MONTY
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                        The strays. I grew up around here. Used 
                        to call this place Dog Town way back in 
                        the day. All the strays used to gather 
                        here. My dad was a dog catcher. He used 
                        to catch ‘em and poison ‘em. There were 
                        so many. I got bit by one when I was in 
                        the eleventh grade. Just about two-miles 
                        south near the Toluca Yards. 
                     (looks at the plywood)
                        Building a dog house? 

                                 MONTY
                        Why are you following me?

                                 CALEB
                        I was hoping we could go get something to 
                        eat. The three of us. If that’s okay with 
                        you?

                                 MONTY
                        No, it’s not okay with me. 

                                 CALEB
                        How about tomorrow?

                                 MONTY
                        No, not tomorrow either. You mean nothing 
                        to me. Why are you here dressed up, 
                        trying to play nice with your bullshit 
                        stories? 

                                 CALEB
                        C’mon Monty.

                                 MONTY
                        You not being around was never a problem 
                        until you showed up. I don’t know you. 
                        The only reason you’re here is cuz Kim 
                        died. Your conscience is fuckin’ with 
                        you. You don’t give a damn about us.

                                 CALEB
                        You’re right about everything else but I 
                        swear you’re wrong on that one son. What 
                        you just said. 

                                 MONTY
                        Didn’t you look into my face and tell me 
                        I wasn’t your son?! 

           His words riddle Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        That wasn’t me.

                                 MONTY
                        Of course it wasn’t. It was the bottle 
                        talking right?! 

           Caleb is unable to look at him.

                                 MONTY
                        Your fucking around, blame it on the 
                        bottle. You disappearing for weeks, blame 
                        it on the bottle. You abandoning us, 
                        blame it on the bottle. Do you have any 
                        idea how much damage you’ve done?!! 

           An uneasy pause. Caleb looks away, ashamed.

                                 MONTY
                        What the fuck are you doing back here?!!

                                 CALEB
                        I didn’t mean---

                                 MONTY
                        Then why DID YOU SAY IT?!!!

           His voice echoes into the railyard. Caleb stands devastated.  
           A pause.

                                 CALEB
                        I needed help. I went wrong for a long 
                        time.

                                 MONTY
                        I’m not your son. Just an unexpected by-
                        product. For all I know, your drinkin’ 
                        and fuckin’ around is to blame for the 
                        shit I am. I got your genes don’t I? Look 
                        at me!! I’m a fuckin’ disaster! Can’t 
                        keep shit together! That’s all I have in 
                        common with you, you fuckin’ asshole! 

           He suddenly leaps toward Caleb and starts hitting him. Caleb 
           doesn’t move. Monty punches him. Caleb closes his eyes, 
           taking his son’s punishment quietly. Monty steps back, in 
           shock, heaving. Caleb looks away, slowly turns away without 
           another word. He walks a few steps and stops, devastated. 

                                 MONTY
                        It’s too late...too fuckin’ late to come 
                        home. 

           A long pause.

                                 CALEB
                        I know. 

           He keeps walking. Monty looks at him, wiping tears from his 
           eyes, oddly relieved. He goes back to the plywood, noticing 
           Caleb’s cigarettes on the ground. He takes one out.

                                 MONTY
                        Hey.

           Caleb slowly turns. Monty tosses him the pack. Caleb grabs 
           it, seeing the cigarette in Monty’s hand. He pulls out a 
           lighter and tosses it to Monty. Monty lights up and flings it 
           back. Caleb lights up. An uncomfortable silence. Monty and 
           Caleb stand several feet apart, smoking silently and looking 
           away from each other.

           Finally...

                                 CALEB
                        You ever been to Poncho’s Mariscos?

           A pause. 

                                 MONTY
                        Poncho’s Mariscos?? Are you fuckin’ 
                        kidding me?

           INT. PONCHO’S MARISCOS - NIGHT

           A chubby trio of MARIACHIS feverishly play “La Golondrina.” 
           Caleb, Annabeth, and Monty sit at a table, eating huge 
           portions of fried fish tacos, Tostadas and Mexican finger 
           foods. 

                                 ANNABETH

                        The soup’s fine.

           Caleb heartily eats his fish tacos.

                                 CALEB
                        I thought you liked fish?

                                 MONTY
                        I do. Just not fried.

                                 CALEB
                        Want me to ask ‘em if they can grill it?

                                 MONTY
                        No. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        This is a nice place.

                                 CALEB
                     (points at a waiter)
                        Look at that.

           A WAITER serves a giant ice cream scoop fashioned into a 
           skeleton.

                                 ANNABETH
                        That’s creepy.

                        Mexicans communicate with their dead. 
                        Every year for Halloween they go to the 
                        cemetery and eat on the graves of their 
                        ancestors. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Good Lord.

                     (intently)
                        Wanna make peace with the dead? Party 
                        with them. 

           Annabeth digs her fork in her tostada and looks down. The 
           mariachi trio finishes up. Everybody CLAPS. 

           EXT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Caleb’s Olds PUTTERS to a stop. Monty rides shotgun. Annabeth 
           is in the back.

                                 MONTY
                        Thanks for dinner.

                                 CALEB
                        You’re welcome.

                        I’m stuffed. 

                                 CALEB
                        If you need a ride tomorrow, give me a 
                        call. 

           Monty drags his large body out of the Olds, bumping his 
           shoulder against the door frame. He walks up the stairs 
           without saying “Good night.” 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Thanks Caleb. 

           They exchange a glance. An awkward pause. 

                                 CALEB
                        Thank you.

           She gets out. He waits until they are inside, then drives 
           away.

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - A LITTLE LATER

           Caleb drives slowly, passing under the glow of streetlights. 
           His eyes glisten. He smokes hungrily and turns the corner, 
           parking in front of THE ELVIS, a rundown watering hole. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Monty changes for bed. He takes off his shirt and looks at 
           himself in the mirror, noticing his gangly body. He attempts 
           a muscle but nothing rises. He looks at himself long and 
           hard, used to not liking what he sees. 

                                 ANNABETH (O.S.)
                        Honey?

                                 MONTY
                        What?

                        Can I come in?

           He throws on a USC T-shirt. 

                                 MONTY
                        Yeah.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Let me see your face.
                     (inspects his cheek)
                        I’m sorry about earlier.

                                 MONTY
                        Sorry I called you stupid. 

                                 ANNABETH

                        I’m not nervous either.

                        Then what are you?

                        Nothing. I’m whatever. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Whatever?

                        Whatever happens, happens. Aren’t you

                        to decide? 

           She nods, reluctant.

                                 MONTY
                        Then let it go, mom. You knew since I was 
                        a kid this was the life I had to come to 
                        grips with. I’ve done my part. Now let

                        say.

           Monty smiles. She returns it.

           INT. THE ELVIS - NIGHT

           Sun-bleached posters of The King grace the walls. The 
           Chantays play on the juke. Caleb sits in a booth by himself 
           smoking and nursing a club soda. Another still night. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Another sleepless night. Monty sits on the edge of his bed, 
           staring at his SWOLLEN LEG. The first rays of dawn crawl into 
           the room. 

           INT. CALEB’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           On the other side of town. Caleb stands by the window in his 
           slippers, smoking and staring into the big empty of his 
           living room. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Monty crunches down on his toast. Annabeth sips her Folger’s. 
           Same as before.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Toast’s not too burned?

                        Perfect.

                        Now that you mention it, just a little.

           Annabeth grabs the phone.

                        I thought bad news sleeps till noon. 

           INT. MILLBROOK MACHINE SHOP - MORNING

           Caleb finishes off his coffee, greasy fingerprints all over 
           the styrofoam Yum-Yum Donuts cup. He looks pensive. Hoagy 
           joins him for a smoke. 

                                 HOAGY
                        No news?

                                 CALEB
                        Hurry up and wait. 

                                 HOAGY
                     (blazes a cigarette)
                        Listen, if you need to take a couple days 
                        I’ll get my kid brother to cover for you.

                                 CALEB
                        I might take you up on that.

           Caleb puts out his cigarette and heads back to work. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Monty finishes up his breakfast. Annabeth makes a call.

                                 ANNABETH
                        He’s not answering. He wanted to know as 
                        soon as we heard. 
                     (hangs up the phone)
                        Will you call him at work? I’m running 
                        late.

           She grabs her purse and kisses him on the forehead. 

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t work too hard.

           She hurries to the door and stops.

                        Love you. Bye.

           She hurries down the stairs. He pulls out an Opana pill, 
           washing it down with orange juice. 

           INT. SHOWER - MORNING

           Monty stands under the hot water, eyes closed. 

                                 MONTY
                     (singing)
                        ...Once I thought I saw you...in a 
                        crowded hazy bar...

           He rubs his swollen leg, poking it curiously. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Monty dresses, freshly showered.

                                 MONTY
                        ...you are...like a hurricane...

           He glimpses himself in the mirror, noticing his right eyeball 
           rolled to the far right corner of his eye. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck. 

           He rolls his eyeballs around, hoping to realign them. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - MORNING

           Monty idles along the tracks, CD Walkman blasting, right eye 
           still bloodshot. 

                                 MONTY
                        ...there’s calm in your eyes...

           Monty walks past a graffiti-covered brick building, singing.

                                 MONTY
                        ...I am just a dreamer...and you are just 
                        a dream...

           EXT. USC - MAIN CAMPUS - MORNING

           Monty walks among the tide of STUDENTS zigzagging to and from 
           class. He stops near a bench, taking in the campus 
           atmosphere.

USC - BOOK STORE - MORNING

           Monty leafs through next semester’s catalogue, walking up to 
           the CASHIER.  

           EXT. USC - DOHENY LIBRARY - ROSE GARDEN - MORNING

           Monty sits on a bench near the fountain, leafing through the 
           catalogue and glancing at a PROFESSOR sitting with his 
           students on a patch of grass. He talks. They take notes.     
           A student walks past, smoking.

                                 MONTY
                        Excuse me, mind if I bum a smoke?

           The Student pulls out a pack of American Spirits.

                                 MONTY
                        And a light too please.

           The student blazes a lighter. Monty lights up. 

                                 MONTY
                        Thank you so much.

                                 STUDENT
                        No problem.

           The student takes off. Monty looks at his watch and rises.

           INT. USC - LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Monty sits among several UNDERGRADUATES, mostly freshmen and 
           sophomores taking notes, some bored, others engaged. The 
           PROFESSOR speaks to the students, doing a Power point 
           presentation. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        ...the submarine chain is close to about 
                        80,000 kilometers. The Atlantic, Indian, 
                        and Pacific Oceans are separated by 
                        ridges, some of which are seismically 
                        active. 

           The professor clicks on his laptop. The screen shifts to a 
           map of the World Oceans. Monty takes out a notebook and 
           copies the professor’s notes, noting the southernmost tip of 
           South America.  

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

           Monty strolls with Izzy, sharing a cigarette.

                                 MONTY
                        ...he was saying how satellites in outer 
                        space track the climate changes around 
                        the world. Isn’t that fuckin’ sick?!

                        interesting. I’m sorry. I’m being honest.

                        I’m talking about something very very 
                        important and you’re down in the fuckin’ 
                        sink having an orgy with the dishwasher. 
                        I appreciate the honesty, though. 

                                 IZZY
                        Are you jealous?

                                 MONTY
                        Of a dishwasher? Please! 
                     (beat)
                        Maybe just a little. Is he buff?

                                 IZZY
                        Yeah.

                                 MONTY
                        Think I can kick his ass?

                                 IZZY
                        He’ll drop you with a yawn. He’s all 
                        tatted up. 

                                 MONTY
                        Big deal. I can fight.

           He punches her shoulder, a little hard.

                                 IZZY
                        Ow dick! That hurt!

           She socks him back. 

                                 MONTY
                        Want to go to the beach? 

                                 IZZY
                        I hate the beach. I wanna get high. 

           She passes him the smoke. 

                                 MONTY
                        We can get high at the beach.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s not the same. Too many pigs and 
                        health nuts. Let’s go to the jungle. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER

           Monty and Izzy walk along the train tracks. 

           O.S. A loud BANGING NOISE echoes throughout the railyard.

                                 MONTY

           They head toward the palm jungle, spotting Caleb hammering  
           the PLYWOOD.

                                 MONTY
                        Nobody.

           Caleb hammers feverishly, sweating. 

                                 IZZY
                        Want me to go tell him to fuck off? 

           Monty turns away, pissed. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck him. 

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - LATER 

           Izzy is stoned. Monty is still pissed over seeing Caleb.

                                 IZZY
                        That was good shit. You missed out.

                        up, draw, serve burgers, get high and 
                        talk shit.

                        It’s true.

                        I guess it doesn’t require an imagination 
                        to sign for your pills that are delivered 
                        to my house because you’re a pillbox 
                        junkie not to mention a compulsive 
                        liar...and you’re judging me?

           He flips her off. She punches his hand away.

                                 IZZY
                        Right back at you. 

           She gets up and storms off. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’m not judging you! 

           Izzy keeps walking.

                        If I get any more packages addressed to

                        Fuck!

           He hurries after her.

                                 IZZY
                        Stay the fuck away from me!! 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - LATER 

           Monty walks back toward the Palm Jungle. All is quiet. He 
           leans over the fence. The banging has stopped. Caleb is not 
           there. 

           A giant plastic rain cover cloaks Monty’s plywood hammered 
           into a simple shed. He lifts the rain cover. The scent of 
           sawdust stings his nose. 

                                 MONTY
                        The fuck is he doing?

           EXT. SHADY SPRING STREET - MORNING

           Monty walks home, wiping tiny splinters and sawdust off his 
           hands. Caleb sits in his Olds, listening to Johnny Cash on an 
           AM country station. Monty spots him, uneasy.

                                 CALEB

                        Build my own fucking dog house.

           He heads up the stairs. His words riddle Caleb.

                     (flustered)

                        Don’t do me any favors. 

           Monty unlocks the door and enters. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Monty heads in, slamming the door.

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck. 

           He hears Caleb’s Olds rev up and roll away.

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb’s knuckles drill the dashboard. 

                                 CALEB
                        FUCK! 

           He flings his tool belt onto the passenger seat, trembling 
           with rage as he pulls over. 

                                 CALEB
                     (shuts his eyes and breathes)
                        Calm down...just calm the fuck down. 

           He opens his eyes, busts a U-turn.

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Monty pulls out his secret stash of Opana, popping two pills.

                        I wasn’t trying to step on your toes. 
                        Just figured you needed some extra stuff. 

                                 MONTY
                        Thanks...you finished?

                        I don’t need my car today. It’s yours if 
                        you want it. 

           A thunderbolt hits Monty.

                        What about my mom?

                        when I’m not around. And when she’s not 
                        around, here you are going behind her 
                        back offering me your car keys. Why would 
                        you do that knowing damn well she’ll 
                        freak if she finds out I’m driving?

                                 CALEB
                        Because you’re not a kid anymore. Because 
                        being 19 is about going out. Pure and 
                        simple. 

           Monty soaks this in. 

                                 MONTY
                        You mean if I crash your car, she won’t 
                        find out? 

                                 CALEB
                        As long as nothing happens to you, I 
                        could care less about the car.

                        update. Dr. Kenneth is away at the 
                        hospital today. They’ll be needing 6 
                        units of blood and 4 units of platelets 
                        for Monty’s operation. They wanted to 
                        know if family members could come in to 
                        donate. They’re really low on blood 
                        everywhere so the more maybe you or 
                        Monty’s dad could donate, the better.

           He extends the cordless to Caleb and heads back to the

                        Can’t say I blame you. 

           Monty looks at him, unblinking.

                        Keep your distance.

           Hair-netted LADIES serve noisy KIDS making fun of each other. 
           Annabeth multi-tasks, thoughts elsewhere in the thick steamy 
           CLACK and CLATTER of kitchenware. Her eyes are red. She 
           suddenly drops a pot on the stove and runs out. 

           EXT. THOMAS EDISON ELEMENTARY - CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER 

           Annabeth cries, trying to recompose. KIDS frolic in the 
           playground. One of them spots her, pointing to the others. 
           She turns away, going back inside. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - DAY

           Monty is cruising to Cream’s “I’m So Glad.” The Santa Monica 
           sunshine is warming his face and he is in much better spirits 
           far away from the house in Caleb’s jalopy. 

           EXT. SEAFOOD STAND - DAY

           The surf is up. Monty is parked along the cliffs of Leo 
           Carrillo, snacking on fish and chips. He looks calm, happy.

                        platelets. Some of the girls at work 
                        offered to chip in.

                     (hesitant)
                        Yeah I did. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Did he tell you where he was going? 

                                 CALEB
                        Hold on.

                        What’s up? 

           Caleb walks away from the phone, seething, face red. 

                                 CALEB
                        Some fuckin’ people just don’t change. 

           He lights a smoke and picks up the line again, putting on a 
           calm face. 

                                 CALEB

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - INTERCUT 

           Monty puts Caleb’s keys on the coffee table.

           Monty cups his mouth, yelling loud enough so Caleb can hear.

                        Is this how you’re “just trying to help”?

                        Can you please put him on the phone? 

           She extends the phone to Monty. He takes it, simmering.

           7:00. Caleb scrubs the coal-black grease off his hands with 
           engine de-greaser. His Olds rolls up. Monty is driving. 
           Annabeth sits in the backseat. HONK! Caleb grins, motioning

           Caleb drags a comb through his hair and mustache. He grabs a

           exits. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - EVENING

           Monty drives. Caleb rides shotgun. Annabeth fidgets uneasily

                        I’m fine.

                                 CALEB
                        Well, I’m hungry. Want me to drop you two 
                        off and go eat by myself or do you care 
                        to join me?

           Monty and Annabeth exchange glances through the rearview. A 
           pause.

           INT. TINHORN DINER - EVENING

           Greasy spoon. Alice’s Restaurant types. Caleb heartily eats 
           his patty melt. Annabeth sips water. Monty snacks on fries. 
           The WAITRESS walks by with coffee.

                                 MONTY
                        On second thought...can I have the 
                        Tinhorn Bacon combo?

                                 WAITRESS 
                        Sure.

           Monty finishes the fries. Caleb slobbers, relishing every 
           bite. 

                                 MONTY
                     (to Caleb)
                        You really liking that?

                     (wolfs down the patty melt)
                        Tastes like shit.

           Monty cracks up. 

           INT. TINHORN DINER - LATER

           Monty gobbles up his combo. Caleb fidgets with his 
           cigarettes. Annabeth eyes a golden brown fry. 

                                 MONTY
                        Mmmm. This is good. I’ve passed by here a 
                        hundred times. Surprised I never saw it. 

                                 CALEB
                        Best kept secret in the neighborhood.

           Annabeth finally takes the fry out of Monty’s plate. 

                                 MONTY
                        I thought you weren’t hungry. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m not.

TINHORN DINER - TIME CUT 

           Annabeth eats a basket of fries. Monty and Caleb smile like 
           Cheshire cats. 

                                 MONTY
                        You owe me one.

           He takes a fry out of her basket.

                                 CALEB
                        Can I borrow one?

           Annabeth pushes the basket into the center of the table. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Help yourselves. 

           Caleb takes one. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS - NIGHT

           Caleb rolls up Annabeth’s driveway. Monty and Annabeth are 
           stuffed.

                                 MONTY
                     (hiccups)
                        That was good.

           Annabeth silently agrees. Monty opens the door and gets out. 

                                 CALEB
                     (to Annabeth)
                        Can I talk to you for a sec?

                                 ANNABETH
                     (uneasy)
                        Me?

                                 MONTY
                        Ooooh. You’re in trouble mother.

           She stays in the backseat. 

                                 CALEB
                        In the front please.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m fine here.

                                 CALEB
                        Suit yourself.
                     (to Monty)
                        G’night buddy. 

                                 MONTY
                        G’night.

           He heads up the stairs. Caleb waits until he is in the house.

                        I don’t think it’s good for him cooped up 
                        in the house all day. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Really? You think I don’t want him going 
                        out having a good time?

                                 CALEB
                        What’s he do on the weekends? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I take him to the movies once in a while.

                                 CALEB
                        What about his friends?

                                 ANNABETH
                        He doesn’t have any. Just a little tramp 
                        he used to smoke dope with till I put the 
                        kabosh on her. 

                                 CALEB
                        What about on weekdays?

                                 ANNABETH
                        He used to volunteer at the animal 
                        shelter. They closed down. 

                                 CALEB
                        The other day I followed him to the 
                        railyard. He’s trying to build a shed for 
                        the strays. 

           This hits Annabeth like a ton of bricks. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh my God...

                                 CALEB
                        I know he’s not supposed to do any 
                        physical work. 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (exasperated)
                        Doctor Kenneth told him a hundred goddamn 
                        times. 

                                 CALEB
                        I want to finish it for him before the 
                        operation. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why?

                                 CALEB
                        Because that’s what he wants. I already 
                        got all the materials. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        A doghouse?

                        Shed. Kind of like a rain shed. It’s real 
                        easy to build.

           She looks at him, disapproving. 

                                 CALEB
                        Please don’t tell him I told you. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why did you? 

                                 CALEB
                        I thought you should know. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        You’re just gonna go down there, hammer a 
                        couple of pieces of wood and that’s it?

                                 CALEB
                        Pretty much.

                                 ANNABETH
                        And he’s not supposed to know about it? 

                                 CALEB
                        I’m hoping it’ll be a surprise. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Can’t say I blame you for trying.

                                 CALEB
                        That’s all I can do. It’s too late for 
                        anything else. 

           She opens the door. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah. 

           She gets out of the car. 

                                 CALEB
                        Good night. 

           She waves “Good night” and climbs up the stairs. Caleb waits 
           until she is inside. He waves good night again. She returns 
           it. He rolls away, content.

           He looks around.

                        Izzy?! C’mon. I said I was sorry...Fuck.
                     (steps back)
                        I’m going in tomorrow. Been nice knowing 
                        you.

           He walks away.

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - LATER

           Monty lies solo under his favorite palm tree, glancing at 
           Caleb’s rain shed for the strays.  

           O.S. FEET crunch gravel.  

           Monty pays no mind. Izzy walks up and sits next to him. They 
           don’t make eye contact. 

                                 MONTY
                        Hey.

           A beat.

                                 IZZY
                        Hey. 

                                 MONTY
                        Did you hear what I said?

           She nods. 

                                 IZZY
                        Nice knowing you too.

           He finally makes eye contact with her. 

                                 MONTY
                        Good.

                        You’re still an asshole. 

                                 MONTY
                        Thanks. I’m craving fish n’ chips. Want 
                        to go to the beach?

                                 IZZY
                        I told you. I hate the fuckin’ beach.

                     (irate)
                        Then stay in this shithole. 

           He gets up and leaves without another word. Izzy waits a 
           moment, gets up and follows him.

USC BLOOD ROOM - DAY

           Blood bags. Annabeth and Caleb sit side-by-side in La-Z-boy 
           recliners, burgundy blood droplets filling plastic. Caleb’s 
           both arms are tied down, orange platelets filling the tubes.

                        Is that the pulp?

                     (laughs)
                        Those are your platelets. They help stop 
                        the blood when you get a cut.

           “Hello” as she walks up to the RECEPTIONIST. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - DAY

           Monty speeds on the 10 FWY West, Neil Young’s guitar 
           CRUNCHING the old speakers out of their sockets.  Izzy looks 
           out the window, hair blowing in her face. She turns and looks 
           at Monty. He doesn’t notice. 

           EXT. MALIBU SHORE - LATER

           Monty scopes the choppy waters. Izzy stands back, freezing, 
           holes in her jeans and Doc Martens.

                        Take a deep breath. The ocean air is

           He heads back to the car.

           EXT. LEO CARRILLO - LATER 

           Monty stands on the rocks, eyes glued to the horizon. Izzy 
           roams around, inspecting rocks.

                                 MONTY
                        First time I ever saw a whale was about 
                        sixty miles off the shoreline. I was in 
                        fifth grade. That’s when I knew I wanted 
                        to be a marine biologist.

                        You knew what a marine biologist was in

                        Oh! 

           Izzy flinches. He points. Izzy looks at the horizon. Nothing.

                                 MONTY
                        She was huge.

                        How do you know it’s a ‘she’?

                        Wild guess.

                     (busts out the Rolaids)
                        Lets get you some more calcium. 

           Caleb opens his mouth. The nurse places a Rolaids tab on his 
           tongue. He spots Annabeth next to him, looking upset.

                                 CALEB
                        You okay?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why did you insist on him taking the car 
                        again? 

                                 CALEB
                        You heard him say he wanted to be alone. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where was he going? 

                                 CALEB
                        As long as he doesn’t cross the border or 
                        get into an accident, I could care less. 
                        It’s his business. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Do you have any clue why I don’t let him 
                        drive? 

                                 CALEB
                        He could dissect any minute. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Besides that.

           Caleb says nothing. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        His retina is detached. Do you know what 
                        a retina is?

                                 CALEB
                        It’s in your eye.

                        Bravo. It comes with the Marfan’s

                        Thanks for enlightening me. 

           Annabeth looks over to the nurse’s station, uneasy.

           Waves crash. Monty and Izzy sit on the sand smoking, wind in 
           their faces. 

                                 IZZY
                        You’re smiling.

                        You’re hopeless. 

           She blows smoke in his face. He returns it. They laugh. 

                                 MONTY
                        Did you talk to your friend about the

                        Maybe. 

           Monty takes a drag from her cigarette, looking at her 
           affectionately.

                        Why didn’t you come around before? We 
                        could have taken our time.

           Monty looks at his crinkled magazine cut-out of the Salgado 
           photo of the Ballena Franca.

           Cesar salad litter the table. Caleb notices the dark bags 
           under her eyes. She pulls out a box of aspirin, popping two.

                        I’m going outside. It’s stuffy in here. 

           She pulls out her purse, fishing for cash.

                                 CALEB
                        I got it. 

           She pulls out a $20.

                                 CALEB
                        I got it. 

           She drops it on the table and slides out of the booth.

                        That’s one fat tip you’re leaving. 

           She takes back the $20 and leaves. Caleb finishes his 
           spaghetti, watching her exit. He drops the fork, wipes his 
           mouth and slides out of the booth, check in hand. 

           INT. CALEB’S OLDS (MOVING) - DAY

           Monty speeds down Ocean Avenue, freshly inked and on cloud 
           nine, screaming at the top of his lungs in sync with Social 
           Distortion’s “Reach for the Sky.” Izzy sprinkles tobacco on a 
           ZigZag, indifferent to Monty’s off-key singing. 

                                 MONTY
                        ...it’s just about you and me...you can 
                        run, you can hide...just like Bonnie and 
                        Clyde...reach for the sky...
                     (turns to Izzy)
                        Thanks.

                                 IZZY

                     the cigarette)
                        For what?

                                 MONTY
                        Hooking it up with Amy. 

                                 IZZY
                        She’s right. It’s gonna look like shit 
                        after they put back your ribs. 

                                 MONTY
                        Fuck it. I got it. It’s done. It’s my 
                        good luck charm. I’m fucking happy. 

           INT. RTD BUS - DAY

           Annabeth and Caleb sit side by side. Annabeth leans her elbow 
           against the graffiti etched window, covering her face from 
           the sun. A TEAR ROLLS DOWN. Caleb watches it trail down her 
           cheek, hanging off her chin. A beat. She wipes it.  

                                 CALEB
                        It’s gonna be okay. 

           She says nothing. 

                                 CALEB
                     (trying to cheer her up)
                        This time tomorrow we’ll be feeding him 
                        Jello pudding and watch him flirt with 
                        the nurses. 

           A pause. She shakes her head.

                        He’s gonna have a respirator shoved down 
                        his throat for two days and about forty 
                        staples running down the middle of his 
                        chest. I don’t think flirting’s on his 
                        immediate agenda. 

                                 CALEB
                        I wouldn’t rule it out entirely.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Last week, he said something I’ll never 
                        forget...real matter of fact...he said, 
                        ”You know mom, I’ve been thinking...I 
                        don’t think I’m gonna make it to 
                        thirty...just FYI.”...and you know 
                        what... 
                     (forcing the words out)
                        ...something inside of me knew he wasn’t 
                        lying.

                                 CALEB
                        C’mon. That’s just Monty being dramatic. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        There was no emotion in his voice. He 
                        spoke real calm, like it was something on 
                        his mind for a long time. 

           He looks away, the reality of the situation sinking in. 

                                 CALEB
                        A full transplant is out of the question? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        It’s not a twin-engine you can rip out 
                        and put back in.

                                 CALEB
                        Don’t pay any attention to what he says. 
                        With all the medical advances, who knows 
                        what can happen in ten years?

                                 ANNABETH
                        This time around, he’s got a six percent 
                        chance of getting paralyzed. After this 
                        one, they have to keep track of another 
                        aneurysm in his descending aorta. And 
                        after that one, there will be another and 
                        another until his system breaks down 
                        completely or he decides to not go 
                        through it anymore. 

                                 CALEB
                     (uneasy)
                        Then what?

           A long pause. She looks out of the window again, temples 
           getting numb from an encroaching migraine.

                        I really wish you’d stop saying things 
                        are gonna be okay. 

           He glances at her hand, tempted to hold it. 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - AFTERNOON

           Monty inspects the small plywood rain shed built by Caleb for 
           the strays. Izzy sits cross-legged under the palm, rolling a 
           joint. Several HOMELESS idle by the train tracks, paying no 
           mind.

                                 IZZY
                     (looks at the shed)
                        He did a nice job.

                        It’ll be gone soon. 
                     (motions to the homeless)
                        They’ll take over it, probably burn it 
                        down. That’s why I didn’t want him to get 
                        involved. 

                                 IZZY
                        At least he’s trying.

           Monty thinks about it, silently agreeing. He walks toward a 
           secluded spot covered with overgrown brush. 

                                 MONTY
                        Smells like caca in here.

                                 IZZY
                        No shit, Sherlock. It’s not exactly 
                        Central Park. 

           Monty disappears behind the green brush and charred palm 
           trees. Izzy finishes rolling the joint.

                                 IZZY
                        Want some?

                                 MONTY
                        Yeah. 

           She sparks it, inhaling as she follows him into the brush.

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Monty inhales, sucking it in eyes closed.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re turning pink.

                        Let me see. 

           He lifts his shirt, revealing the finely detailed Ballena 
           Franca’s TAIL dipping back into the ocean. “IN MEMORY OF KIM 
           R.I.P.” is emblazoned in fine print next to it. Izzy inspects 
           the tattoo, gently touching it with her fingertip. She 
           notices the SCAR down the middle of his chest.

                                 IZZY
                        They’re reopening that up?

                        Like a fuckin’ tunnel. 

           She reaches for his scar, then pulls back.

                        You can touch.

                        It looks like the San Andreas Fault.

                        earthquake waiting to happen...some day.

           He trails off.

                                 IZZY
                        Some day what? 

                                 MONTY
                        Finito. 

           She takes another long drag, passing the joint.

                                 MONTY
                        I’m good. 

           They sit quietly, looking away. An awkward moment. Izzy 
           finally looks at him. His eyes are faraway, sweat beads 
           dotting his face. He looks at his leg, still swollen. 

                                 IZZY
                        You’re sweating.

                                 MONTY
                        Oh.

           He wipes his brow. She reaches for his hand, touching it. 

                                 MONTY
                        Feels nice. 

           She licks her fingers and puts out the joint, coughing.

                                 IZZY
                        Lie down. 

                                 MONTY
                        There’s shit here.

                                 IZZY
                        Over there.

           She points to a dirt patch. He scoots over, lying down. She 
           lifts his shirt, kisses his scar and drags her tongue down to 
           his waist. Monty reaches for the joint and re-sparks it. She 
           unbuckles his belt with her teeth, undoes his top button and 
           pulls down his zipper, reaching in.

                                 MONTY
                     (exhaling)
                        Easy.

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PANORAMIC VIEW - TIME CUT

           Next to the 5 Northbound freeway, the abandoned jungle of 
           burned palm trees. In the distant, Monty and Izzy are veiled 
           behind the brush.

                                 MONTY (O.S.)
                        ...The first memory I think I ever had 
                        was of this place... 

           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - BLUE HOUR 

           Behind the green brush. Monty lies in the same position, high 
           as a kite. Izzy sits up next to him, flustered. 

                                 MONTY

           A smile lights up his face.

                                 IZZY
                        What’s that?

                                 MONTY
                        I thought you weren’t interested in my 
                        ‘oceanic’ bullshit. 

                                 IZZY
                        Anything that lights your face up like 
                        that, I wanna know what it is.

                                 MONTY
                        They’re whales...a certain kind...they 
                        were called “right whales” of Patagonia 
                        in the old whaling days because they were 
                        friendly to humans. They’d get close to 
                        the ships, making them easier to kill. 
                        That’s why the whalers used to call them 
                        the ‘right whales’ cuz they were the 
                        right ones to kill...Are you listening?!

                                 IZZY
                        Yes! I’m listening. I heard every word. 
                        That’s sick that they just killed ‘em 
                        like that. 

                                 MONTY
                        No matter how many of ‘em got killed, the 
                        ballenas just kept swimming up to the 
                        ships, not knowing how fucked up peoples 
                        intentions are. That’s why you gotta not 
                        trust anybody and always keep your 
                        distance.

                        I feel sick. 

           She gets up, walks into the brush and tries to vomit. Nothing 
           comes out. She returns, ejecting another mouthful of saliva.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m going home. 

           She walks back toward the train tracks.

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Annabeth unlocks the door and enters. Caleb walks up the last 
           steps. 

                                 ANNABETH

                        He’s not back yet.

                        Why doesn’t he get a cell phone?

                        So I can’t reach him. 

                                 CALEB
                        Maybe he went for a walk by the railyard. 
                        I’ll go look.

           A pause. A look of worry suddenly overwhelms her.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m getting a bad feeling.

                        C’mon, don’t put that out there. He’ll be 
                        back any minute.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I knew he shouldn’t have gone off by 
                        himself. Why did you insist?

                        some point you need to let go.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Let go, huh...
                     (looks away)
                        Doesn’t take much does it...just letting 
                        whatever you were holding onto for so 
                        long slip away...It takes a hell of a lot 
                        more to hold on...of course, you wouldn’t 
                        know anything about that, would you...see 
                        these...
                     (lifts her OPEN PALMS)
                        ...Twenty years they’ve been holding 
                        on...twenty years...carrying, cleaning, 
                        feeding...fighting...bleeding...with 
                        these...
                     (open palms curl into fists)
                        Let go?? I don’t know how. 
                     (looks into his eyes)
                        All this you’re doing, think I don’t 
                        appreciate it? I do. But don’t ever think 
                        for a second that all the shit you pulled 
                        on us will disappear into thin air just 
                        cuz you finally learned how to love your 
                        own flesh and blood after all these 
                        years...

           Monty’s tall figure emerges. He’s been listening. Caleb and 
           Annabeth nearly jump out of their skins.

                        We’re just talking. 

                                 MONTY
                        That’s a step in the right direction.

                        Where d’you go, honey?

                                 MONTY
                        For a drive. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where?

                                 MONTY
                        You really want to know mother? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        If you want to tell me.

                                 MONTY
                        I went to the beach with Izzy, we had 
                        fish n’ chips, then I went and got a 
                        tattoo over in Venice and did a couple of 
                        other things I’d prefer not to get into. 

           Annabeth notices his bloodshot eyes, struggling to keep her 
           cool. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Is that right? 

                                 MONTY
                        Yes. I probably had one of the greatest 
                        days of my life. 
                     (smiles)

                                 ANNABETH
                        You’re stoned out of your goddamn mind. 

                                 MONTY
                        Yes Mother. That’s right. I paid for it 
                        myself, rolled it myself and smoked it 
                        myself. A nice big fat joint. I’m three 
                        inches off the ground and could give a 
                        fuck less what you think about that. 

           His words riddle her like bullets. It takes a moment to 
           register. 

                                 ANNABETH

                        Thanks. 

           She goes into her room, numbly shutting the door. Caleb looks 
           at Monty, upset. 

                                 CALEB
                        That was unnecessary.

                        out of my business. 

                                 CALEB
                        Please don’t talk about her like that. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’ll say whatever the FUCK I please. 

           Monty goes to his room and SLAMS the door, leaving Caleb in 
           the middle of the living room. He slowly walks to Annabeth’s 
           door and gingerly knocks. 

                                 CALEB
                        You okay?

           She doesn’t answer him. He slowly walks out, passing a 
           supermarket calendar with a photo of a whale. 

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monty sleeps. The stethoscope is next to him. 

           O.S. The phone RINGS. Annabeth’s FEET patter close, answering 
           it. 

           Monty’s eyes crack. He turns over, WINCING from the pain in 
           his leg. It’s more SWOLLEN than before. Annabeth knocks on 
           the door.

                                 ANNABETH

                        The needle was clean. I personally saw 
                        her take it out of a sealed container. 
                        She’s a top celebrity tattoo artist not 
                        ghetto.

                                 DR. KENNETH
                        Get off the phone and get in bed. Enough 
                        of this tattoo bullshit. 

           They hang up. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annabeth cleans the kitchen, still reeling from Monty’s 
           words. Monty heads to the door. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where to? 

                                 MONTY
                        I feel like a latte. 

           He finishes tying his laces and steps to the door.

                                 MONTY
                        Want me to bring you back anything?

                                 ANNABETH
                        No. 

           She jams another $20 in his hand.

                                 ANNABETH
                        When will you be back?

                                 MONTY
                        Tomorrow, mom. See you at the hospital.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Doctor said seven sharp. 

                                 MONTY
                        I heard.

           He exits. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Monty?

           He turns, annoyed.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Wear a condom. 

                                 MONTY
                     (grins)
                        I already did. But thanks for the 
                        sentiment. 

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - EVENING

           The last rays of the sun sink below the smoggy horizon.

           Monty walks along the abandoned tracks, reflective.

                                 MONTY (V.O.) 
                        I once asked Grandpa what old age was 
                        like. He said old men are like babies.  
                        They need a tit to suck on and someone to 
                        feed ‘em and pamper ‘em. 

           INT. MARKET - EVENING

           Monty buys incense, Gummy Bears and cigarettes.

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        Like his favorite singer, Old Blue Eyes, 
                        he subscribed to the notion that a manly 
                        man should live a full life, die young 
                        and leave behind a beautiful corpse. 

           EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - FENCE - EVENING

           Monty clears leaves from Kim’s headstone and sticks the 
           incense in the manicured lawn.

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        ...I guess Kim took his advice. Her heart 
                        beat for 21 years...

           He blazes a Djarum cigarette, puts it atop Kim’s headstone 
           and rips open a fresh pack of Gummy Bears.  

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        That’s roughly 883,575,600 beats before a 
                        stray piece of shrapnel flying through a 
                        backwater Iraqi village put a stop to it.  

           Monty pulls out a handwritten letter and BLAZES it. The flame 
           singes his chicken scrawl.

           EXT. CLEMENTINE CAFE - EVENING

           Aimee Mann plays on the stereo. Monty sits at the corner 
           table, watching the smoke rise from a clove cigarette. In his 
           hand is an old family photo of his Grandfather, Kim and 
           himself.  

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        Kim died at the legal drinking age and 
                        Grandpa’s heart kept beating for eighty-
                        six years... 

           Monty sips the last dollop of foam in his cup and rises, 
           slowly inching past the CUSTOMERS, careful not to bump them. 
           His palms are clammy, eyes jumpy, smile fixed. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        ...It stopped on a Wednesday afternoon on 
                        a park bench in Glendale.

           (cid:13)           EXT. STREET BY THE RAILYARD - TWILIGHT 

           Balmy. Monty strolls past open windows of World War 2-era 
           duplexes. KIDS hang from laundry lines and frolic. A Nerf 
           football lands in front of Monty. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        He didn’t die young or leave behind a 
                        particularly good looking corpse but he 
                        made it to the last round before “Game 
                        Over.” 

           The Kids run into view, giggling. Monty grabs the football 
           and flings it back, grinning like a little boy wanting to 
           play. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        Average life expectancy for Marfan’s is 
                        forty to sixty. If you make it to sixty 
                        consider yourself a century old. My first 
                        open heart was at sixteen. Now I’m twenty 
                        and going on round two. There won’t be a 
                        third. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Annabeth lights the candles around Kim’s smiling portrait, 
           kneels and crosses herself.

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        The game ends for everybody. 

           INT. CALEB’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Smoke slowly spreads across the living room. Caleb stumps out 
           a cigarette in a soup can ashtray, gazing at a yellowed 
           family picture on the BEACH. Monty, Kim, Annabeth and Caleb 
           eating fish n’ chips. Happier times. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        What matters is having fun while you 
                        play.  

           EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - NIGHT

           Kim’s grave. The incense has burned out. The ASHES of Monty’s 
           letter to Kim scatter across her headstone. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        After all, it’s not how you fall. It’s 
                        how good you fight. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door opens. Monty enters. Annabeth is in her candlelit 
           bedroom.

                                 ANNABETH (O.S.)
                        I got you sushi from Trader Joe’s.

                                 MONTY
                        Cool.  

           Monty goes into his room, spotting something.

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On his bed is a large GIFT. Monty puts the sushi down and 
           cranes his neck toward Annabeth’s room.

                                 MONTY
                        What’s this?

           He grabs the gift. It’s heavy.

                                 ANNABETH (O.S.)
                        A little good luck charm.

                                 MONTY
                        Can I open it?

           She walks in. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        From your dad and me. 

           Monty tears it open like a little kid high at a pinata party, 
           eyes widening.

                                 MONTY
                        Where did you get this?

           It is a coffee table book. THE WHALES OF PATAGONIA. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        I had to snoop through your college books 
                        a little to get the name right...Pat-ago-
                        niya. (cid:13)

                                 MONTY
                        Patagonia.  
                     (gingerly opens the first page)
                        Wow. The paper’s so smooth. How much was 
                        it?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Half the price of the ticket you’re gonna 
                        buy me when you get your degree and take 
                        me sailing around the world. 

           Monty suddenly drops the book, overwhelmed. 

                                 MONTY
                        It’s beautiful. Why did you pay all this 
                        money for this?! 

                                 ANNABETH

                        Listen...No matter how big n’ old you get 
                        you’re still my baby! I’ll buy you 
                        whatever I want. 

           A pause. Monty recomposes.

                                 MONTY
                        Shit.
                     (wipes a teardrop from the 
                     book)
                        I ruined it.

           Annabeth grabs a tissue and extends it. 

                                 MONTY
                        Wow.

           He sits down at the edge of his bed and gingerly flips the 
           pages, grinning at the brilliantly composed photos. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Eat your sushi. Doc said nothing after 
                        ten. 

           Monty starts peeling the saran wrap. 

                                 MONTY
                        Want one?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Two things that make my skin crawl. Raw 
                        fish and Menudo.  

                                 MONTY
                        You don’t know what you’re missing. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh yes I do. Bon appetit. 

           Annabeth turns off the living room light and retires to bed. 
           She closes her door. Monty quickly puts his huge tennis shoes 
           by the front door and samples a California roll. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - WEE HOURS

           Monty’s door inches open, revealing his silhouette. Shoes in 
           hand, he cracks the front door gently, feeling the chill from 
           the street. 

           EXT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - WEE HOURS

           Freezing. Monty puts on his sneakers and heads toward the 
           railyard, huffing steam.

           (cid:13)           EXT. THE RAILYARD - PALM JUNGLE - JUST BEFORE DAWN 

           The rain shed for the strays is complete. Monty puts a fresh 
           bag of leftovers and raw meat in a little plastic container 
           and looks around, pissed.

                                 MONTY
                        Where the hell are you? 

           He shivers, hearing distant BARKS as the first blue light of 
           dawn cracks the night. He cranes his neck once more, letting 
           out a quick high-pitched WHISTLE that echoes throughout the 
           railyard. Nothing. 

                                 MONTY
                        Dammit! 

           He hurries back home, teeth rattling from the cold. 

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Monty enters, shoes off, flinching at the sight of Annabeth 
           calmly sitting in the armchair. She is bundled up and ready 
           for the hospital.

                                 MONTY
                        How long have you been ready? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        All night. Did you go for a stroll? 

                                 MONTY
                        A quick one. It’s Siberia outside. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Did you see the strays?

                                 MONTY
                        How did you know?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I wasn’t born yesterday. 

                                 MONTY
                        Did a little birdie tell you? 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (calmly)
                        You made quite a doghouse for ‘em.

                                 MONTY
                        It’s all your ex-husband. My idea. His 
                        execution.  

           He crosses to his room, blowing hot air into his freezing 
           palms.

           INT. MONTY’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Monty packs his greatest hits into a CD wallet.

           He spots a burned CD of Neil Young’s “Live” album, smiling. 
           He grabs two new “AA” batteries for his beat-up CD Walkman 
           and heads out.

           INT. ANNABETH’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Monty tucks the CDs, Walkman, THE WHALES OF PATAGONIA and 
           favorite National Geographic back issues into his USC 
           backpack. Annabeth puts on her coat. 

                                 MONTY
                        I’m set. Is he downstairs?

                        Sucking on his cancer sticks.

                        Can’t he wait till we’re in the hospital? 

           He slings his backpack over his shoulder and takes a good 
           look at the living room. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        What?

                        Nothing. 

           He quickly walks out, butterflies starting to fly in his gut.

                        Nah. Went for a walk. The strays aren’t 
                        there. 

                                 CALEB
                        They’ll come around. 

                                 MONTY
                        All that work for nothing.

                                 CALEB
                        Some other stray will nest in it or the 
                        bums will use it for firewood.

           Caleb revs up the engine, chewing several sticks of Juicy 
           Fruit to kill the smoke after scent. Annabeth climbs into the

                                 NURSE ARMINE
                        The anesthesiologists will be joining us 
                        in a few minutes. I have to get him 
                        ready. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        So we won’t see him till after?

           Nurse Armine nods, sympathetic. Annabeth’s eyes well up.

                                 MONTY
                        Mom...please. 

                                 ANNABETH
                     (tears gush out as she hugs him 
                     tight)
                        God and Kim are with you...’kay?

                                 MONTY
                        Okay mother...you’re ruining my shirt and 
                        my tat--
                     (stops himself)

                                 ANNABETH
                        Your what?

                                 MONTY
                        Nothing. 

           Caleb clears his throat compulsively, nervousness finally 
           seeping through.

                                 CALEB
                        Everything’s gonna--

                                 MONTY
                        ...be all right. You two sure are a pair 
                        of broken record players. 

           He lets go of Annabeth. Caleb comes close. 

                                 MONTY
                        Don’t hug me too tight. Dr. Ken will 
                        think I smoked. Then I’ll be in real deep 
                        shit.

           Caleb holds him extra tight. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        We’ll be right here till they finish... 
                        okay?

                                 MONTY
                        Why? Go home and get some sleep.

                     duffel bag)
                        And don’t leave your earthly belongings  
                        unattended. 

           Nurse Armine hits the password on the keypad. The doors open. 

                                 CALEB
                        See ya son.

           Monty locks eyes with him.

                                 MONTY
                        Bye...dad.

           A tear rolls down Caleb’s cheek.  

                                 MONTY
                        Hasta la vista. 

           The doors close. Annabeth and Caleb stand still for several 
           seconds, looking at the doors. A pause. 

                                 CALEB
                        Coffee? 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Okay.

           They walk down the hall. Intercoms BLARE.

           Monty undresses, goose pimples blossoming all over his body. 
           He looks at his warped reflection in the dulled metal doors. 
           He pulls out his beaten up Walkman, Neil Young on standby.

           Monty chuckles, opening the door.

           stares at a little plastic sunflower plant by a salt shaker,

                        much?

                                 ANNABETH
                        He never sleeps. He’s either reading or 
                        sneaking out after I doze off and 
                        wandering ‘round that damn railyard. 

                                 CALEB
                        He’s a night owl. No wonder my mother 
                        used to call him Little Frankenstein with 
                        that big refrigerator head of his, up all 
                        hours of the night.

                        That’s cuz I wanted to name him after 
                        Montgomery Clift.

                        She liked Kim’s name.

                        Cuz you named her.

                        7-pounder...next minute...it’s twenty 
                        years later and you’re back in the same 
                        place. 

           The sharp morning sun blasts through the windows. He looks at 
           her. 

                                 CALEB
                        I’m sorry.
                     (looks back down at the brim of 
                     his coffee cup)
                        For everything. That’s as good as I’ll 
                        ever be able to say. It doesn’t mean 
                        much. Nothing I say ever does cuz it 
                        comes out different than what’s in here.

           He points to his head. She looks out the window. The sunlight 
           warms her face. A strange calm settles in her eyes.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why did you leave us behind? 

           Caleb keeps to the steam circling his coffee cup, torment in 
           his eyes.

                        I was weak...so I ran. It took me a long 
                        time to realize that I never had the kind 
                        of courage that mattered. The kind you 
                        have. The holding-on kind...until Kim 
                        died. I didn’t know her, what she liked, 
                        who she was...I got to know her after we 
                        buried her but it was too late. I let 
                        time slip away. All these years...I have 
                        nothing from them. No Sunday afternoons, 
                        no birthdays, no graduations...nothing. 
                        All I had to do was pick up the phone. 

           Silence.

                        I hated you for a long time Caleb. A part 
                        of me still does every time I look at you 
                        and remember what you put us through... 
                        but you’re my boy’s father...and I’ve 
                        learned to respect that. 

                                 CALEB
                        Thank you.

                        I never thought I’d catch myself saying 
                        this after all these years but...you 
                        sound like the guy I knew in the ninth 
                        grade.

           She looks into her coffee cup, faraway. Caleb slowly puts his 
           grease and sandpapered palm over her hand. It feels nice. She 
           keeps to the brim of the coffee cup, sensing his look. 
           Several moments pass. Slowly, she pulls her hand away.

           Surgical instruments tear flesh. Monty’s STERNUM is broken. 
           His toes are curled, nail-bitten fingers open to the sky. 
           Blood and cotton everywhere.

                                 MONTY  (V.O.)
                        ...before the break of those early years. 
                        Mom alone in her room. Dad gone a long

           Dr. Kenneth notices the blood-spattered tail of the Ballena 
           Franca tattoo over Monty’s heart.

           BOOM! BOOM! 

           Monty’s body suddenly CONVULSES.

           Annabeth’s eyes are shut, falling asleep. Caleb covers her

           An Armenian FAMILY suddenly rushes toward the hostess.

           The heart monitor FLAT LINES intermittently. Surgical 
           utensils pass through blood-spattered gloved hands. The

           slurping water. They return to Monty’s shed. The last rays of

           Caleb slowly opens his eyes, feeling his hand CLENCHED inside 
           Annabeth’s palm. She holds his hand and looks away, exhausted 
           from the noise in the waiting room. From the cacophony, a 
           voice rings out.

           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           Monty lies unconscious, breathing through a respirator. His 
           eyes slowly crack. The first sounds of his strained breaths 
           fill the room...gasping...coughing...ALIVE.

                        When I woke up it felt like a bomb had 
                        gone off in my chest. Every rib was 
                        broken. A burning sensation unlike 
                        anything I ever felt. I couldn’t breathe 
                        or scream. Just take the pain quietly. 
                        The war was over for now. 

           Monty strains to look at the fresh two-foot staple zipper 
           running down the middle of his chest. He notices the Ballena 
           Franca tattoo, still in tact.

                        hear the ocean. 

           EXT. PENINSULA VALDEZ - DAY

           Off the Atlantic coast in Argentina. A magnificent wilderness 
           of lakes and gulfs, home to marine mammals. The WHISH of the 
           ocean is cut by the PURR of the AVA GONZALO, a boat on the 
           horizon.

           EXT. AVA GONZALO - CONTINUOUS 

           The Patagonian coastline stretches as far as the eye can see. 
           Monty stands on the deck, face sprinkled by the ocean MIST. 
           His eyes are fixed on the peninsula like a sailor returning 
           home from a long voyage. A survivor’s strange calm glows in 
           his eyes. He has been dreaming of this moment his whole life. 

                                 MONTY (V.O.)
                        Dreams distract me from all that I can’t 
                        change. Every day I wake up not knowing 
                        what’s to come. What I am capable of 
                        today is not guaranteed tomorrow. All the 
                        more reason to take the day for all its 
                        worth and don’t look back. The past made 
                        us but the past is gone. All that’s left 
                        is the time that remains to find our 
                        dreams. 

           Caleb and Annabeth walk up to Monty, bundled in warm clothes.

           The ship slows to a halt, engine turning off.

                        My sister would have been proud.

           A massive BALLENA FRANCA surfaces against the backdrop of the 
           Peninsula. A boyish grin stencils Monty’s face.

                        In 1914, on the cusp of The Great War,

                        Infantile Hygiene in the paediatric 
                        clinic of the University of Paris. Little 
                        is known about his life. You won’t find 
                        him in the Encyclopedia Britannica or the

                        giants in the world, he’s relatively 
                        unknown.
