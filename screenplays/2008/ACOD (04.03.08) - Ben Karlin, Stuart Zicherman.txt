           FADE IN:

           On super grainy 8mm footage. You’ve seen it a million times.  
           This particular home movie would be called “Perfect Day at 
           the Lake House.”  It features kids fishing, a barbecue on a 
           lawn, tetherball, swimming with water wings, and finally -- 

           A 7TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.  A kid right about to blow out candles 
           on his cake.  But we miss it.  Because our camera has picked 
           up some other action in the background.  It’s a little fuzzy, 
           but it appears two adults are SCREAMING at each other, 
           gesticulating wildly.  The camera gingerly pans back to the 
           birthday boy.  His name is CARTER.

                                 WOMAN (V.O)
                        Children of divorce experience 
                        certain moments they never forget...

           Our scene comes to life-- full technicolor, full sound-- as 
           MOM and DAD go at it, setting be damned.

                                 MOM
                        You motherfucking prick.  

                                 DAD
                        That’s a nice fat fucking filthy 
                        mouth you’ve got--  

                                 MOM
                        FUCK YOU!

           Mom storms into the house.  Dad looks back to the stunned 
           table of children.  

                                 DAD
                        Blow out the Goddamn candles.

           CLOSE ON CARTER.  He just changed his wish.  

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Like the moment you figure out your 
                        parents might not be right for each 
                        other.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY - 1986

           Court is in session. A 9-YEAR-OLD Carter is on the stand. 

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Like the first time you have to 
                        make an adult decision.
                                 LAWYER
                        Carter. It’s up to you, son. Who do 
                        you want to live with?

           On Carter’s eyes darting back and forth.  This sucks.

           INT. MOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1988

           Mom is helping a 12-YEAR-OLD CARTER pack his weekend bag.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Like being a foot soldier-- a spy-- 
                        a  weapon-- in an all-out war.

                                 CARTER
                        Do I have to?

                                 MOM
                        I’m not asking you to steal his 
                        checkbook. A bank statement is 
                        fine.
                             (off his look)
                        Do you want to go to camp this 
                        summer or not?!?

           INT. CARTER’S ROOM - DAD’S HOUSE - 1989 

           Carter in an impressive bedroom.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Like watching your parents use 
                        everything at their disposal to win 
                        your affection.

           Dad walks in with an enormous, wrapped present.

                                 DAD
                        Six months ‘til Christmas!
                             (hands it over)
                        Open it.  It’s the greatest.

           INT. CARTER’S ROOM - MOM’S HOUSE - 1989 

           In a less impressive bedroom, Carter assembles a Lego 
           skyscraper.  Mom sits on the bed, eyeing it.

                                 MOM
                        I hate to be the one to tell you... 
                        but your father is a homosexual.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Carter’s dad making out with a STRANGE WOMAN. We are...
           EXT. DAD’S BACKYARD - DAY

           A barbecue.  Carter and Trey barely know anyone there. Dad 
           approaches with a shy 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL, all braces.

                                 DAD
                        Boys, this is Chloe. She’s going to 
                        be your sister from now on.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Having a parent marry for the 
                        second time...

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY - 1990 

           Rings are being exchanged. Carter can’t watch. He looks away, 
           locks eyes with Chloe. She looks just as miserable.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        And in some instances...

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY - 1997

           Rings are being exchanged.  Again.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        ... a third.

           Carter, a college student, looks on disinterested as his dad 
           marries a woman that doesn’t look that much older than he is.

           INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT - 1997

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)    
                        Like the eternal struggle over 
                        traditional family events...

           Christmas lights twinkle in the background. A CUTE GIRL in a 
           college sweatshirt is curled up on the bed highlighting 
           lecture notes. Carter is bent over his desk on the phone.  

                                 CARTER
                        I’m going to Alisa’s for Thanksgiving.   

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        It’s my year.

                                 CARTER
                        Right, I know, but--

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        But what? It’s MY year. Why didn’t 
                        you go to Alisa’s last year?
                                 CARTER
                        Um. I didn’t know her.

                                 MOM
                        Is this your father’s way of 
                        ruining my holiday? 

           Carter lowers his head. It’s just not worth it. 

                                 CARTER
                        Can I bring Alisa?

                                 MOM
                             (like nothing happened)
                        Love to have her!

           He hangs up and heads for the bed. But we stay on the desk.  
           On his cork board is the usual assemblage of college student 
           ephemera. PUSH IN on a mess of pictures that are clearly 
           separated into two sides: MOM’S and DAD’S.   

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        All of this has a profound effect 
                        on the child of divorce as they 
                        move into adulthood.  

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE IN:

           EXT. ALLEY WAY - NIGHT

           Two figures, silhouetted in the darkness, move close to each 
           other.  A stolen moment.  

                                 CARTER
                        Will you marry me?

           Carter, now 33, looks down at his intended... 

                                 MIGUEL
                        Como?

           MIGUEL, 46, is a five-foot-two Mexican dude in a doo-rag and 
           dishwasher’s uniform.  

                                 CARTER
                        Marry me.  I will meet you at city 
                        hall first thing in the morning. 
                        Make this thing legal. 
                             (off Miguel’s terror)
                        Then fill out the paperwork.  
                                 MIGUEL
                        Pero, mi tio Jorge--

                                 CARTER
                        Tio Jorge had a shitty lawyer.  You 
                        want a green card?  Your options 
                        are marry me or go through this 
                        process.  I promise you-- the 
                        paperwork is more pleasant.  I’m a 
                        selfish lover.

           A metal door BLASTS OPEN, light and noise spill into the 
           alley.  MARGO, 29, pokes her head out.

                                 MARGO
                        Carter?  Striped jacket.

           He follows her back into--

           INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Middle of the dinner rush.  Bustling.  Noisy.  The food can’t 
           go out fast enough.  A PASTRY CHEF intercepts Carter on his 
           way through:

                                 PASTRY CHEF 
                        Comp for 46.

           She hands him two plates.  Carter barely breaks stride and he 
           busts through the double doors into--

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           An absurdly crowded dining room.  Carter spins to a nearby 
           table and expertly lays the plates.

                                 CARTER
                        These are on the house.  

           They thank him and he’s on the move again, reaching the 
           front.  It’s mobbed, people trying to get their names on the 
           list.  The place is total chaos, but Carter is immune to it, 
           possibly even thriving in it.  

           He spots Mr. STRIPED JACKET.  He looks mad.  His WIFE is a 
           full-step behind him, already embarrassed.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Can I help you?  
                                 STRIPED JACKET
                        That table has finished their 
                        dessert, they’ve paid their bill, 
                        and they’ve been SITTING THERE for 
                        a half-hour!

                                 CARTER
                        That’s not your table.  That is.

           He points to a table just getting their menus.  The man is 
           about to erupt.  Then Carter smiles.  He’s kidding.

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        I get what you’re trying to do 
                        here.  You got a hot spot, make 
                        people wait.  Let me tell you-- 
                        it’s not working.  You’ve got forty 
                        people crammed in here like veal-- 

                                 CARTER
                        I am sorry for the wait, Sir.  This 
                        is a neighborhood restaurant, and I 
                        don’t want my neighbors to have to 
                        call two weeks in advance to get a 
                        table...  

           Carter catches a glimpse of a smiling BRUNETTE by the door.  
           She flashes a half-wave.  He looks back to the man...

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’d be happy to call down the 
                        street and get you a table at 
                        Biscardi’s.  And I say this with no 
                        disrespect whatsoever-- their veal 
                        is fantastic.

           The wife cracks a tiny smile.  Then Carter slips past them to 
           the brunette, SOPHIE.  Sometimes it’s just obvious there’s a 
           history. 

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Hey, Sophie.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I heard this was your place.  I 
                        never knew you wanted a restaurant. 

                                 CARTER
                        I never mentioned it?

           Awkward beat.  She is with a STRAPPING OUTDOORS TYPE.

                                 SOPHIE
                        This is Jerry.  
           Carter shakes his hand.  Still awkward.  

                                 SOPHIE (cont'd)
                             (to Jerry)
                        Three years, he never said he 
                        wanted a restaurant.  

                                 MARGO
                        Carter?  Phone.

           Carter excuses himself, heads for the hostess stand where 
           Margo hands him the cordless phone.

                                 CARTER
                        Thanks for the save.

                                 MARGO
                        No.  It’s really the phone.  Your 
                        brother.

                                 CARTER
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Trey.  
                             (beat)
                        No I’m not sitting down.
                        Because there is no place to sit 
                        down.  You’re just going to have to  
                        tell me while I stand.

           His eyes go wide.  He stops.  Sits.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        No way.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOORWAY - TREY’S APARTMENT (SORT OF) - NIGHT

           The door opens on a beaming young Japanese-American girl-- 
           KIEKO, 22.  She flashes a smile and her HAND. Five slender 
           fingers and one SPARKLING ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 CARTER
                        NO WAY.

           He hugs her, pushes into the apartment.  It’s actually a garage-- 
           Carter’s garage-- that his brother TREY (25) lives in.

                                  TREY
                        You mean “congratulations?”

           Trey is a looser, cooler version of Carter. He got the soft 
           edges in the family.  Her cell phone RINGS. 
                                 KIEKO
                        It hasn’t stopped!

           She runs outside to talk on the phone. Throughout the rest of 
           the scene we periodically hear SQUEALS and SCREAMS. Trey 
           smiles, looks to his brother.

                                 TREY
                        Wanna get high?

                                 CARTER
                        Married?? 

                                 TREY
                        I know.

                                 CARTER
                        What’s it been? Four months?

                                 TREY
                        Something like that.

                                 CARTER
                        That’s a huge decision.

                                 TREY
                        I guess.  

                                 CARTER
                        What about that whole thing... that 
                        she doesn’t like to...

                                 TREY
                        She’s over it.

                                 CARTER
                        And you really think you’re ready 
                        for this?  You kind of live in my 
                        garage.  And don’t have a check 
                        book.

                                 TREY
                             (a beat, simply)
                        It just feels right. 

           Carter has an opinion about everything.  But this isn’t the 
           time.  Instead, he softens, gives his brother a hug. 

                                 CARTER
                        Congratulations.

                                 TREY 
                        Thanks.  Will you talk to mom and 
                        dad?
                                 CARTER
                        About what?

                                 TREY
                        Coming to our wedding.

                                 CARTER
                        You’re not having a wedding.

           Kieko SHRIEKS excitedly from the outside.    

                                 TREY
                        She really wants the whole she-
                        bang. You know, a lot of women are 
                        into that stuff.

                                 CARTER
                        Talk her out of it. Isn’t there 
                        some kind of traditional Japanese 
                        thing you can do? 

                                 TREY
                        She’s from Palo Alto.

                                 CARTER
                        I know. But in the old country?

                                 TREY
                        She’s third generation.  

                                 CARTER
                        Trey.  

                                 TREY
                        C’mon.  Mom and Dad listen to you. 

                                 CARTER 
                        Because I patronize them. 

                                 TREY
                        I know! You’re so good at it.

           Carter sighs. 

                                 CARTER
                        Look, things are good. They’re 
                        calm. You don’t want to... poke a 
                        rattlesnake when it’s sleeping or 
                        hibernating... or whatever they do.

                                 TREY 
                        It’s my wedding. It doesn’t get 
                        bigger than this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TREY  (cont'd)
                        They can put their differences 
                        aside for a few hours.  Can’t they?

           There’s a reason these people haven’t spoken in 20 years. But 
           what is Carter going to say?

                                 TREY (cont’d)
                        Thank you.  Best man?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Golden Gate Park glows in the late afternoon light. We hear 
           the nonsensical blabber of a 4-year-old.

           INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM - GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

           Actually, it’s two four-year-olds. Twins. Fraternal. TYLER 
           and EMILY. Just potty-trained. Both in stalls.  

                                 CARTER
                        How we doing?

           Emily comes out of the stall, fiddling with her pants.

                                 CARTER (CONT’D) (cont'd)
                        Flush?

           She turns and goes back in.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I peed on the floor.

                                 CARTER
                        That’s okay. So did I.  

           Another FLUSH. Emily hurries to the sink. She can’t reach.  
           Carter helps her up. A FLUSH and Tyler joins them.  

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

           Carter and the kids walk hand and hand, past the jungle gym 
           toward the parking lot, where a LEXUS pulls up.  The kids let 
           go of Carter and break for the car.

                                 TYLER
                        Daddy!

           HUGH, Carter’s dad, climbs out of the driver’s side and 
           scoops up his kids. It takes some effort. He’s 63.  
                                 CARTER
                        How was Rancho Wherever-the-Hell 
                        You-Were?

                                 HUGH
                        Great.
                             (unsure)
                        I got a manicure.

           The passenger’s side door opens and SONDRA, 41, climbs out.  
           Hugh’s third wife. A model of conspicuous consumption.  
           Coiffed and taut and entitled. She’s fighting back the very 
           concept of aging itself. She flashes a perfunctory smile at 
           Carter as she straps the kids into their car seats.

                                 SONDRA
                        How were they?

                                 CARTER
                        Good. They spent some time in an 
                        ethnically diverse sandbox.  

           Sondra immediately looks to brush sand off the kids.  

                                 HUGH
                        Carter! Got you something.

           He reaches into the car, tosses him a baseball hat. It says 
           “Rancho La Puerta Spa” and it is profoundly ugly.  

                                 HUGH (cont'd)
                        They’re the greatest hats.  

                                 CARTER
                        Okay.

                                 HUGH
                        Put it on.

                                 CARTER
                        I will.

                                 HUGH
                        Put it on now.

           Carter begrudgingly puts it on.

                                 CARTER
                        Hey Dad, you talk to Trey?

                                 HUGH
                        Yes! Great news! How about that 
                        kid? Nice girl, too. Wish I could 
                        pronounce her fucking last name.
                                 CARTER
                        What do you think about them having 
                        a wedding?

                                 HUGH
                        You kidding? I can’t wait. 

                                 CARTER
                        Really?

                                 HUGH
                        Yeah!  I told him whatever he 
                        wants. Forget about the bride’s 
                        family pays for this or that -- I 
                        might only do this once.

           That’s a dig at Carter.  He absorbs it.  Moves on.

                                 CARTER
                        What about Mom?

                                 HUGH
                        She can have her own wedding. 

                                 CARTER
                        Right. But we’re probably not going 
                        to have two weddings--

                                 HUGH
                        Why not? I’ll throw a first-class 
                        party. And your mother and Captain 
                        Fuckface can rent out an Arby’s in 
                        Fresno. They can charge admission 
                        to cover the cost. 

           Pretty much what Carter expected.  He looks away, 
           contemplating his next move.

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        I’m thrilled!!

           INT. MOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT  

           Carter sits at the kitchen table opposite his mom, MELISSA, 
           late 50s.  She skipped the “letting go” portion of anger 
           management.  GARY, 64, is Carter’s pitch-perfect step-dad; 
           mellow, supportive, manages Melissa with expertise. He has 
           his toolbox out.

                                 MELISSA
                        It’s just one of those things a 
                        parent dreams of. Their child’s 
                        wedding. Thank God one of my kids 
                        has some balls. 
           Carter absorbs it.  Again.  Tries a different tack with her.

                                 CARTER
                        It’s too bad we won’t be able to go 
                        to Trey’s wedding. They’re eloping.

                                 MELISSA
                        Absolutely NOT. They are not eloping.

                                 CARTER
                        You and dad aren’t going to show up 
                        to the same party.  Trey doesn’t 
                        have a choice. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Then I’ll go with them.

                                 CARTER
                        Mom...

                                 MELISSA
                        They’ll want some family there. 
                        Especially if it’s someplace  beautiful, 
                        but impersonal. Like an island.   

                                 CARTER
                        If you go, it’s not an elopement.

                                 GARY
                        It’s a destination wedding.  

                                 CARTER
                        Thank you, Gary. Not to mention, 
                        then dad has to go, and Sondra--

                                 MELISSA
                        The Cuntessa is not coming to 
                        Barbados!

                                 GARY
                        Carter?? Help me out a second?

           Gary is tightening a hinge on a cabinet.  Carter kneels down.

                                 GARY (cont'd)
                             (a whisper)
                        Just hold this. She usually loses 
                        her train of thought in fifteen 
                        seconds.

           Carter grins. Appreciates the save. Loves Gary.
                                 GARY (cont'd)
                        The 14th.  New moon.  Halibut 
                        fishing is tremendous the day of 
                        the new moon.  You in?

                                 CARTER
                        Sure.

                                 MELISSA
                        Fine. I’ll go. I’ll go to a wedding 
                        with your father.

                                 CARTER
                        You will?

                                 MELISSA
                        Yes. If he pays me the $783,000 he 
                        owes me for my share of the lake 
                        house.
                             (here she goes...)
                        Larry Ellis was waterskiing last 
                        weekend. He said he saw a light on 
                        in the house. Is your father using 
                        it? He’s not allowed to use it--

                                 CARTER
                        He hasn’t been there in 20 years--  

                                 MELISSA
                        Then he’s renting it. Anything he 
                        earns on that house, I get half. 
                        Paragraph 4A, page 19 of the 
                        settlement agreement. 
                             (for the millionth time)
                        You know he refuses to sell that 
                        house purely out of spite? Your 
                        father is stealing from me. Doesn’t 
                        that bother you? Please tell me 
                        that bothers you and you are not 
                        your father’s son. I stayed home 
                        and raised you kids while he was 
                        out there earning his “fuck you” 
                        money.  Carter? Are you listening?

           He is not.  He’s already kicking himself for doing this. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           WHAM!!  A round-house KICK hits a dummy!  We are--

           INT. DOJO - NIGHT 

           Welcome to Hop-Ki-Do, a Korean martial art.  Twelve students 
           are in a ring, kicking ass.  
           This is their black-belt presentation.  CARTER and his step-
           sister CHLOE, now 32, are in the audience, but not watching.  

                                 CARTER
                        We dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan.

                                 CHLOE
                        Two.

                                 CARTER
                        Right. And now we, like, trade with 
                        them. But my parents can’t fake 
                        smile their way through one night?
                             (appalled)
                        I mean, please.  Look at them.

           Carter eyes a 50-ish COUPLE seated in the first row, holding 
           hands, dreamily.

                                 CARTER (cont’d)
                        Who holds hands at a martial arts 
                        presentation?

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s an act.

           Beat.

                                 CARTER 
                        Oh.  You know who came into the 
                        restaurant?  Sophie Knight.

                                 CHLOE
                        No way.  I thought she was one of 
                        the “ones” for a while.

                                 CARTER
                        Too smart.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Did you cheat on her?

                                 CARTER 
                        I don’t cheat.  I’ve never cheated 
                        on a single girlfriend--

                                 CHLOE
                        Sorry.  I forgot.  You emotionally 
                        cheat.  You check out and start 
                        looking around.  You’re an 
                        emotional cheater.
           An AUDIBLE GRUNT comes from the ring as someone goes down.  
           The audience erupts in applause.  Carter and Chloe clap 
           along.  Then sit.  That’s when Carter notices...

                                 CARTER 
                        Are you okay?

           A bit of blood has soaked through Chloe’s shirt near her 
           shoulder.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh.  Yeah.  I’m having the tattoo 
                        removed.

                                 CARTER
                        That was fast.

                                 CHLOE
                        I really like Marcus.  I get that 
                        he’s not into a tattoo that says--

                                 CARTER
                        Todd?  

                                 CHLOE
                        They use a laser. 

                                 CARTER
                        There’s other ways to show you 
                        care, you know.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Like sitting through this?

           He looks back to the ring-- WHACK!-- where LAUREN, 29, is 
           swinging a bo-stick with precision. She is petite, severely 
           attractive and very good at whatever the hell she’s doing in 
           there. She sneaks a look at Carter. He gives her a thumbs up, 
           though he has watched none of her performance. 

           EXT. DOJO - LATER   

           Lauren emerges from the locker room.  Carter is there to give 
           her a big hug and kiss. Chloe as well.

                                 CARTER
                        You were great.  That last move 
                        with the broom handle and the 
                        tackling dummy.  That’s going to 
                        come in handy.

                                 LAUREN
                        Could kick your ass.
                                 MR. STRINGER (O.S.)
                        There’s my peaches and cream!

           MR. AND MRS. STRINGER approach.  Lauren’s parents.  They are 
           the “perfect” couple we saw sitting in the audience.  They 
           hug Lauren, proud of her.  They’re proud of everything she 
           does.  Carter and Chloe exchange a glance.

                                 CARTER
                        Hey Mr. and Mrs. Stringer!  How’s 
                        Fantasyland? 

                                 MR. STRINGER
                        Terrific.  We just had her painted.  
                        She’ll be in the water next week.  
                        Hey, Carter.  That’s some news 
                        about your brother.

                                 MRS. STRINGER
                        Oh, yes.  It’s wonderful news.  

           Beat.  Lauren looks to Carter. 

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah... it is.  It’s great.

                                 LAUREN
                        What’s great?

                                 CARTER
                        I didn’t tell you?  Trey got 
                        engaged.  

           Another beat.  Awkward.  Volumes about their relationship 
           have just been spoken.  Lauren looks to Chloe.

                                 CHLOE
                        He just told me.

                                 MRS. STRINGER
                        I only heard because Kieko and I 
                        are Facebook friends.

           ON CARTER.  Everyone looking at him.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DOJO - MINUTES LATER

           Carter and Lauren are walking toward the car...
                                 LAUREN
                        They’ve been together, what, four 
                        months?

                                 CARTER
                        Something like that.  

                                 LAUREN
                        How long have we been together?

                                 CARTER
                        Apples and oranges. 

                                 LAUREN
                        FOUR YEARS, Carter. And I don’t 
                        even have a key to your apartment.  
                        I’ve been very patient, but 
                        seriously -- this is the last 
                        straw. How long do you expect me to 
                        wait around?!? 

           Crickets.  Carter searches for something to say... her stare 
           boring a hole in him. Until she starts to LAUGH.  Her face un-
           twists, and she laughs even harder.  

                                 CARTER
                        Jesus...

                                 LAUREN 
                        C’mon.  If I cared about getting 
                        married, would I be with you?

           Now Carter laughs, though that was another dig.  Lauren is 
           incredibly cool, however.  He hugs her, kisses her.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - DRIVING

           Carter driving, Lauren in the passenger seat.  She’s playing 
           with the radio, trying to find the right song.  

                                 CARTER
                        You know how sometimes you go to a 
                        banquet hall, or a hotel, and 
                        there’s like, multiple weddings 
                        going on.  I wonder if there’s a 
                        way to split Trey’s wedding into 
                        two.  The Lincoln Room and the 
                        Washington Room.  But maybe... 
                        don’t tell anybody.  Could that 
                        work?

           She gives him an “Umm, no” look.
                                 LAUREN
                        It’s Trey’s wedding. Maybe Trey 
                        should plan it.

                                 CARTER
                        Are you kidding?  My mom and dad 
                        will DESTROY him. He doesn’t know 
                        how to handle them. By the time he 
                        gets to the aisle there’ll be 
                        people crying...but it won’t be 
                        from joy, I guarantee you that.
                             (wracking his brain)
                        I can figure something out.

                                 LAUREN
                        I just don’t know why it has to be 
                        you.

                                 CARTER
                        Because.  That's the way it is.  
                        The way it worked out.  Somebody 
                        had to take the reins, make the 
                        most out of a bad situation.  For 
                        20 years, I have taken everyone's 
                        shitty lemons and made lemonade.  
                        That's my lot.  Lemonade maker.  
                        Not some roadside stand and a 
                        handpainted sign. I am a lemonade 
                        conglomerate. I am Countrytime. 

           Lauren studies him.  

                                 LAUREN 
                        Have you ever talked to anyone?

                                 CARTER
                        Like who?

                                 LAUREN
                        Like a professional. A therapist... 
                        like in college, when you were 
                        doing too many drugs?  Or stalking 
                        an ex?
                             (beat)
                        Just me?

                                 CARTER
                        I went a few times as a kid.

                                 LAUREN
                        It wasn’t enough. No offense.  I 
                        love you.  But you deal with your 
                        parents and step-parents and half-
                        siblings and...

                                 LAUREN (cont'd)
                        quarter-cousins more than any 
                        reasonable person should have to.

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah, and I’ve got them all under 
                        control.

           He said that with a hint of doubt. She looks at him.

                                 LAUREN 
                        You’re the boss.
                             (a smile)
                        “Countrytime.”

           He can’t help but smile too.  They start to laugh.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - THE NEXT DAY

           Miguel and Carter are at a table filling out paperwork.

                                 CARTER
                        Don’t forget that part about your 
                        two sisters who are already 
                        naturalized--

           The door opens and Sondra enters. Carter quickly looks to 
           Miguel.

                             (whisper)
                        Gimme your hat.

                                 MIGUEL
                        What?

           We see Miguel is wearing the hat Hugh gave Carter earlier.

                                 MIGUEL (cont'd)
                        You said it was the greatest hat.

                                 CARTER
                        Just take it off.

           He hands him the hat back. Carter drops it under the table, 
           then heads to the front.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Hey, Sondra. What brings you...

                                 SONDRA 
                        Did you hear Rite Aid is moving 
                        into the neighborhood?
                                 CARTER
                        No.  Where?

                                 SONDRA
                        Maybe here.

           Carter’s eyes widen. She sits. So he does.

                                 CARTER
                        But we have a deal.  A good one.

                                 SONDRA
                        You have a good deal.

                                 CARTER
                        Right. But... you don’t need the 
                        money.

                                 SONDRA
                        I’m a businesswoman. I own the 
                        building. I have to at least listen 
                        to offers.

           Carter is at her mercy.   

                                 CARTER
                        Sondra, this place is everything to 
                        me. These people...they’re my 
                        family. You can’t just...

                                 SONDRA
                        I want you to hang my work.

                                 CARTER 
                        Your what?

                                 SONDRA
                        My paintings.  

                                 CARTER
                        You paint?

                                 SONDRA
                        I’ve been taking classes at the 
                        Institute. My instructor says I’m 
                        very good. 

                                 CARTER 
                        We don’t really have art on the 
                        walls. 

                                 SONDRA
                        I’ve noticed.
                                 CARTER
                        Yeah, I’m not going to do that. 
                        Sorry, Sondra.

                                 SONDRA
                        Rite Aid is offering $25,000 a 
                        month. Remind me what you pay me?

                                 CARTER
                             (meek)

                             (he has no choice)
                        One painting.

           And we SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - DAY

           Carter sits, staring up at a piece of Sondra’s “art.” It’s 
           either a nude or a bowl of fruit.  There’s no way to tell. 

           Carter is irritated.  And feeling very much not in control.  
           He’d never admit it, but maybe Lauren was right. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           Carter approaches a doorbell.  Thinks to ring it, then thinks 
           better of it, leaves.  In seconds, he’s back.  Fuck it.  He 
           RINGS.  Adjusts his collar, matts his hair as--

           The door opens on DR. LORRAINE JUDITH, late-50’s, California 
           casual.  Long skirt, big jewelry, weary eyes. This is a woman 
           who had her time and place and it probably isn’t right now.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Omigod.  Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        Hi.  Hey. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Amazing!  It’s been so long.  Come 
                        in, come in...
           INT. DR. JUDITH’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Sprawling but cluttered.  Carter is anxious, not sure what 
           he’s doing there.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I was so happy to get your phone 
                        call.  I’ve always wondered what 
                        became of you.  You look fantastic!

                                 CARTER
                        I am.  I’m good.  

           She moves a pile of paperwork to make room for Carter to sit. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Sorry about the mess.  I’ve been 
                        busy.  Lecturing.  Here and there. 
                        “The modern family dynamic.”  Just 
                        got back from Northwestern.

                                 CARTER
                        Um... I have a restaurant.  
                        “Whitegrass.”  In--

                        there!

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Didn’t love it.  But I would try it 
                        again.  
                             (beat)
                        How is your mom?  I always liked 
                        her. Very assertive woman.  Is she 
                        still married to..?

                                 CARTER
                        Gary.  Yup.  Good man.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        And your dad had a new wife.  
                        Something Nordic?

                                 CARTER

                                 CARTER 
                        She’s a goner.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        What happened to Elka?

                                 CARTER
                        She aged.  My dad’s on wife #3.  
                        Sondra.  Not my cup of... anything. 
                        No beverage that I would consume. 

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        So what brings you here, Carter?

           Carter shuffles, his hands deep in his jacket pockets.

                                 CARTER
                        Well... I thought I should check in.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Check in?  

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        The last time I saw you, you were 
                        ten.

                                 CARTER
                        Right.  But nothing’s changed.  
                        With my parents, I mean.  My 
                        brother’s getting married and 
                        somehow I’m right back in the

                             (catching his drift)
                        I can absolutely recommend a top-
                        notch therapist--

                                 CARTER
                        Oh.  No.  I thought... you.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Me? 

                                 CARTER
                        You know all the sordid details.  
                        To have to explain it all to 
                        someone new... 
                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Right.  But, I’m not a therapist. 
                        I haven’t practiced in 35 years.

           A blank stare.  

                                 CARTER
                        But you were... my... therapist.

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        No.  Of course not.
                             (a LAUGH... then realizes)
                        You didn’t know that?

                                 CARTER
                        No.

                        You were part of a study. State-
                        funded.  On the effects of divorce 
                        on children.  The court referred me 
                        to your mother because of the

                        I wrote a book about it.

                                 CARTER
                        A book?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Yes!  It was on The New York Times 
                        Best Seller list.  For 38 weeks.

           “Children of Divorce.” He grabs a book off the shelf. On its 
           cover, “The New York Times Best Seller... for 38 weeks!!”

           Carter pulls up in front of his apartment.  Looks for a 
           parking spot.  Nothing.  He looks longingly toward his 
           garage.  The lights are on.  Trey is home.  He opens his 
           glove compartment and a bunch of AUDIO BOOKS fall out. He’s 
           prepared for this.  Like it happens a lot. Carter grabs “Moby 
           Dick” as read by Burt Reynolds.  

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of Carter trying to find a spot.  
           Around the corner, he studies the parking sign.  The hours 
           aren’t right.  Another spot?  Hydrant.  A third?  He has to 
           get out to check-- the whole back is blocking a driveway.  
           As he gets back in... “But oh, Shipmates! On the starboard 
           hand of every woe, there is a sure delight.”  And we CUT TO:

           EXT. TREY’S APARTMENT/CARTER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           KNOCK KNOCK.  Trey opens the door.

                                 CARTER
                             (gritting his teeth)
                        Twenty-six minutes.

                                 TREY
                        Sweet.

           He opens the door all the way.  Lauren and Kieko are there, 
           drinking champagne.  Carter looks to Lauren.

                                 CARTER
                        Sorry I kept you waiting...

                                 LAUREN
                        It’s fine.  We’re celebrating.  
                        Kieko asked me to be a bridesmaid. 
                        Isn’t that great? 

                                 CARTER
                        Maybe.

                                 TREY
                        And we picked a date.  The 15th.

                                 CARTER
                        Of?

                                 TREY
                        Next month!

           A total non-reaction.  Somehow the room feels less buoyant.

           In the bathroom, Carter is brushing his teeth.

                        I didn’t mean to “suck the joy out 
                        of the room.”
                             (he gargles and spits)

                        Did you know that Trey got rejected 
                        by the Discover Card--?

           Lauren is in bed, reading a book.  DR. JUDITH’S BOOK.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 CARTER
                        It’s... for Trey.

                                 LAUREN
                        This guy “Rick..?”  

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah?  

                                 LAUREN
                        You got off easy.

                                 CARTER
                        Who wants a massage?!?

           He darts into the bathroom and returns with some moisturizer. 

                                 LAUREN
                        That’s face cream.

                                 CARTER
                        Not tonight.

           She kind of laughs as he slips behind her, starts working on 
           her shoulders.  She relaxes, tosses the book to the side.

                                 LAUREN
                        Mmmm.  Carter.

           Her eyes close, as she falls back against him, engrossed in 
           the moment.  But Carter is eyeing the book... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S OFFICE - WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - DAY

           Carter is reading carefully reading Dr. Judith’s book.

                                 CARTER
                        That is a gross over-simplification!

           KNOCK KNOCK and Margo pokes her head in.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I asked you not to disturb--
                                 MARGO
                        A Dr...
                             (notices the book cover)
                        That doctor is here.  

           Carter jumps to his feet and walks out--

           INT. RESTURANT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There she is.  Dr. Judith stands by the hostess stand. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        “Whitegrass.”  That some kind of an 
                        Indian name?

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t know.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Why’d you pick it?

                                 CARTER
                        Outside.  Please.

           He politely ushers her...

           EXT. WHITEGRASS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           ... to the sidewalk, away from the storefront, out of sight.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I felt bad about yesterday.  I sent 
                        you off without even trying to help--

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t need help.  I had one 
                        moment of weakness, but I’m fine.  
                        I’m better than fine.  I am 
                        certainly not the kid from that 
                        book.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Of course not!  Carter, you are 
                        clearly a successful, well-adjusted 
                        young man. 

                                 CARTER
                        Right.  Exactly.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Doesn’t mean there aren’t things we 
                        all want to improve in our lives.

                        I gave it some thought, and I would 
                        be glad to sit down with you.  
                        Actually, I’d like it very much.  

           Carter stares her down unsure about her turnaround.

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        We can start casual.  Grab a cup of 
                        coffee.  No offices, no 
                        appointments.  Just see how it 
                        goes? Since I’m out of practice, I 
                        won’t even charge you.

           Carter mulls it.  And we--

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - THE NEXT DAY 

           Carter and Dr. Judith sit across from one another.  She sips 
           a hot tea, SCALDS the top of her mouth.  Tries to hide it.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Tell me, now that you are a mature 
                        adult, what do you think of your 
                        parents?

                                 CARTER
                        They’re super fucked-up. And lame.

           He sips his hot coffee.  SCALDS the top of his mouth.  She’s 
           clearly looking for more.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        My mom is a good cook. And she’s 
                        manipulative. Equal parts 
                        manipulative and cripplingly 
                        dependant. And my dad? I guess 
                        you’d say he’s a classic narcissist-
                        - with A.D.D. 
                             (considers)
                        It’s a miracle I am not on a 19-

                        “Survivor mentality.”  It’s an 
                        entire chapter of my book.

           He rolls his eyes.  She checks out his ring finger. 

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        You’re not married. What about a

                                 CARTER
                        Lauren.  She works with my step-
                        sister... ex-step-sister-- Chloe.  
                        Elka’s daughter.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Poor Elka.

                                 CARTER
                        But my dad and Sondra think I met 
                        Lauren in a bar.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Not through Chloe?

                                 CARTER
                        They don’t know we’re still 
                        friends.  It’s just easier than the 
                        headache if they knew.  You should 
                        understand this.  It’s basic stuff.  

           Dr. Judith studies him momentarily.  She seems... excited.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Do you mind if I make some notes?

           She pulls a napkin from the dispenser, jots notes down. 

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        How long have you been together?

                                 CARTER
                        Four years.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Are you going to marry her?

                                 CARTER
                        Why is that the first question 
                        anyone asks?  You don’t want to 
                        know where she’s from?  Or what she 
                        does for a living?  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        What does she do for a living?

                                 CARTER
                        She manages a clothing store.

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        Fascinating. Why don’t you want to 
                        marry her?
                                 CARTER 
                        I didn’t say that. 
                             (mildly annoyed)
                        Lauren is great.  Smart, pretty.  
                        She’s into kung fu, and eastern 
                        philosophy, which can be a little 
                        annoying, but... it’s good.  We 
                        don’t fight.  No chaos.  I just... 
                        I’m waiting to feel that thing, 
                        y’know?  That thing.  Wake up one 
                        morning and feel like, yes, she’s 
                        the one.  Not to say that couldn’t 
                        also happen with someone else, 
                        randomly, walking down the street, 
                        or in an elevator. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Romantic.

                                 CARTER
                        Reality.  I’m not going to force 
                        it.  My parents have spent their 
                        entire lives being hasty and 
                        irrational.  

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        So you worry about repeating your 
                        parents’ mistakes?  

                                 CARTER
                        No.  I worry about having to manage 
                        them until the day I die.

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        I can understand why you’re sick of 
                        that.  You’ve been doing it since 
                        you’re 8. It’s a situation I call 
                        “Parentification”... in my book.
                             (he glares at her)
                        Parents turn to their children for 
                        emotional support at an early age.  
                        They become the children, and you 
                        the parent. 

                                 CARTER
                        Exactly.  That’s exactly right!

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        But... you’re not a kid anymore.  

           A beat. She’s making total sense to him. Carter soaks it in, 
           his mind racing.  Dr. Judith is excited.
                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        We should do this again, yes?

           Carter stopped listening.  An idea is taking shape in his 
           mind.  A big one.

           A determined Carter enters, searching for-- 

                                 CARTER 
                        Margo.  What’s the guy’s name, the 
                        maitre’d you were sleeping with at 
                        Boulevard?

                                 MARGO
                        David?  Or Tommy?  
                             (off his look)
                        It’s a good-looking staff.

                                 CARTER 
                        So you can get me a good table?

                                 MARGO
                        Only with Tommy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOULEVARD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Dressed in jacket and tie, Carter paces on the sidewalk.  He 
           checks his watch... then checks his reflection in the glass.  
           Steels himself.  Then--

                                 MELISSA
                        You look very handsome.  That’s not 
                        my favorite jacket, but...

                                 CARTER
                        Hey, Mom!

           He gives her a warm hug and kiss hello.  

                                 MELISSA 
                        Giving up a Friday night for your 
                        mother. Did you and Lauren break up?

           Carter smiles.  Nothing rattles him tonight.  He just opens 
           the door for her... 
           INT. BOULEVARD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Carter and his mother are seated at a prime table. The 
           MAITRE’D hands them each a menu.   

                                 MAITRE’D
                        Here’s a wine list. The sommelier’s 
                        name is Renee. He’s the humorless 
                        gentleman over there with the fancy 
                        corkscrew.

                                 CARTER
                        Thanks, Tommy.

           He winks at Carter and leaves them.

                                 MELISSA
                             (so excited)
                        Carter, you’re such a big shot 
                        sometimes. I can’t remember the 
                        last time we had dinner like this 
                        together.

           INT. COAT CHECK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A man hands over his coat.

                                 MAN
                        Put that on a good hanger.

                                 COAT CHECK GIRL
                        All of our hangers are quite good, 
                        sir.

           He slips her $10 and turns-- it’s HUGH.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Melissa is digging into her water glass with a spoon, 
           removing all the ice.  

                                 MELISSA
                        It’s better for you at room 
                        temperature.

           INT. MAITRE’D STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Hugh shows off his own bottle of wine to Tommy.

                                 HUGH
                        ‘74 was a mediocre year. ‘75 was 
                        the year.

                        You can’t even get this stuff in 
                        the States. I know a guy in 
                        Languedoc.

                                 TOMMY
                        Let me show you to your table, sir.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Carter walks his mom through the menu.  INTERCUT with Hugh, 
           walking through a maze of tables, flashing a smile at an 
           attractive woman.  Back at the table, Melissa has made up her 
           mind: 

                                 MELISSA
                        I’ll have the branzino if you de-
                        bone it.

           She shuts her menu, looks up and GASPS!  Hugh is standing 
           there.  He sees her and FREEZES.  

           Mom and Dad are FACE TO FACE.  Carter doesn’t flinch.

                                 CARTER
                        Hi, Dad.

                                 HUGH
                        This must be a mistake.

           A waiter darts in and expertly sets a third place.   

                                 TOMMY
                        Shall I open the wine?

                                 MELISSA/HUGH
                        No!

           Carter removes the wine from his dad’s clenched fingers.

                                 CARTER
                        It needs to breathe.  Sit down.  

           Hugh looks around, plans his escape.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        SIT.  

           Hugh eyes the chair, but Melissa jumps to her feet.

                                 MELISSA
                        Forget it.  I’ll go.

                                 HUGH
                        Fine.
           Hugh sits.  But Melissa doesn’t move.  She knows if she 
           leaves, he wins.  Through clenched teeth...

                                 MELISSA
                        No.  You go.  
                             (she sits back down)
                        I’m having dinner with my son.

           By now, most of the restaurant is watching their game of 
           musical chairs. 

                                 MELISSA (cont'd)
                             (to Carter)
                        You’ve ruined what I thought was 
                        going to be very pleasant evening.

                                 HUGH
                             (to Carter)
                        For Chrissakes-- this is 
                        ridiculous!?!

                                 CARTER
                        Agreed.  Look around you.  The 
                        universe isn’t folding in on 
                        itself.  The building is still 
                        standing.  You are both in the same 
                        room, yet life is continuing.   

           Carter lectures them like children.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I brought you here tonight because 
                        you’ve turned a nine-year marriage 
                        into a hundred-year war.  You’ve 
                        made a mess of every holiday, every 
                        graduation, the Gimelson funeral-

                                 HUGH
                        I got there first.

                                 MELISSA
                        They were my friends.

                                 CARTER
                        It doesn’t matter.  You’re done.  
                        You will not be allowed to take 
                        another memory hostage.  

                                 MELISSA
                        Oh, the drama...

                                 HUGH
                        He’s a fucking pain in the ass, 
                        that’s what he is.
                                 CARTER
                        There.  You agree on something!
                             (lays down the law)
                        Trey is getting married and we are 
                        going to have a wedding.  You don’t 
                        have to pay for it... or organize it-
                        - but you are going to be there-- 
                        both of you.  And for one night-- 
                        not even-- for a few hours-- you’re 
                        going to be civil.  You are going to 
                        walk your son down the aisle, smile 
                        for a few pictures, and give Trey 
                        the wedding he deserves.  

           Carter rises, puts on his jacket.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Talk it out.  Right here, right 
                        now.  I ordered the tasting menu 
                        and paid for it so no need to call 
                        an arbitrator.  

           And he walks away without even look back.  When he catches 
           his breath, a tiny smile crosses his face.  That felt great!

           ON HUGH AND MELISSA. Shamed. Guilty. She picks up the wine 
           and takes a swig.  Then takes a good look at Hugh.

                                 MELISSA
                        Did you have your face done?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WARFIELD THEATER - DAY

           Once a vaudeville house, now one of the city’s last great 
           music halls. Carter and Trey stand in the back, talking.  The 
           theater is empty.

                                 CARTER
                        They were speechless. Stunned into 
                        silence.  It was awesome. 
                        Seriously, I felt a little like 
                        God. All due respect.

                                 TREY
                        Unreal.  So it’s full speed ahead? 

                                 CARTER
                        Go for it.  Anything you want.  

           Trey embraces his brother.  Kieko runs in.
                                 KEIKO
                        Alice Cooper bit off the head of a 
                        snake here in 1977. 

                                 TREY
                        Ceremony in the theater. Party in 
                        the lobby. What do you think? 

           Trey grabs her hand and they run off to further explore, 
           ecstatic. Carter watches them and smiles. He feels a 
           lightness he hasn’t felt in a long time. Maybe ever.

                                                              CUT TO:  

           INT. “STRAPLESS” - A CLOTHING STORE - DAY 

           Chloe and Lauren are in the front window, working on a 
           display.  Chloe eyes one of the female mannequins.

                                 CHLOE
                        Why does this mannequin have a 
                        package?

           Lauren peeks in her panties.

                                 LAUREN
                        You’ve got the ass on backwards.

           Oh.  They begin to dismantle the mannequin when there’s a 
           KNOCK on the window.  It’s Carter.  They wave him in.  He 
           shakes his head, waves Lauren outside.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Is he losing his hair?

                                 LAUREN 
                        A little bit. It’s cute.  

           Lauren slips out of the window and exits on to--

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Carter gives her a kiss hello.

                                 LAUREN
                        This is a nice surprise.  

                                 CARTER
                        I brought you something.  

           He pulls out a TINY, CAREFULLY WRAPPED BOX with a bow on it.  
           Lauren’s eyes nearly EXPLODE OUT OF HER HEAD.  
                                 LAUREN
                        OH MY GOD, CARTER!

           It looks like a RING BOX.  In the window, Chloe is equally 
           shocked.

                                 CARTER
                        What?
                             (realizing)
                        NO!  No, look--  

           He frantically tears open the box.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        It’s a key. You wanted a key to my 
                        apartment!  

           A key dangles from a chain.  Lauren’s heart sinks just a 
           little.  But she LAUGHS it off.  She looks to Chloe in the 
           window, who is scowling at Carter.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        That’s an antique chain.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DR. JUDITH’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Carter bounds up the stairs.  About to ring the buzzer, he 
           sees a sign.  A new sign: “Please come in and take a seat.”  

           INT. DR. JUDITH’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           The foyer has been rearranged: magazines spread on a table, 
           like a waiting area.  And woman is waiting: MICHELLE, 31, 
           striking, a little damaged. Her hair has undoubtedly been a 
           number of colors.  She looks at Carter with vague disinterest.

                                 CARTER 
                        I’m looking for Dr. Judith.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Get in line.

                                 CARTER
                        Are you... a... friend or something?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes.  Old friend.  Camp friend.

           She’s fucking with him.  Just then, the door to Dr. Judith’s 
           office opens and she sees them both. 
                                 DR. JUDITH  
                        Carter?  What are you doing here?

                                 CARTER
                        I stopped by to thank you--

           She walks him outside...

           EXT. DR. JUDITH’S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ... to the front stoop where they can talk in private.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Thank me?

                                 CARTER
                        Your advice. It was great. I sat my 
                        parents down and--

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Terrific.  I want to hear all about 
                        it, but I have a patient waiting. 

                                 CARTER 
                        Patient?  I thought you weren’t a 
                        therapist.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I’m not.  But... 
                             (excited)
                        After we talked, it struck me.  
                        There’s never been a definitive 
                        study of ACODs.  

                                 CARTER
                        ACODs?

                                 DR. JUDITH

                        That’s mine. 
                             (beat)
                        So I got in touch with the other 
                        subjects from my book.  And I am 
                        doing a follow-up.  A 20-year-
                        study.  About a generation unique 
                        to the American landscape--

                                 CARTER
                        Hang on.  I’m going to be in 
                        another book?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Yes!
                                 CARTER
                        NO!

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Oooh.  While I have you here... 

           She rushes back into the office.  The door is open for a 
           moment.  Carter and Michelle make EYE CONTACT.  Oh, she looks 
           like damaged goods.  Sexy damaged goods. Dr. Judith returns 
           with a packet of paperwork.

                                 CARTER
                             (re: Michelle)
                        Is she one of the book people? 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                             (re: paperwork )
                        Take this home with you, fill it 
                        out for Tuesday.  Answer the 
                        questions honestly.  My research 
                        depends on it.   

           And she shuts the door on him.

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - DAY    

           A man in a SUIT is reviewing files.  Carter sits opposite, 
           studying Dr. Judith’s questionnaire.  

                                 CARTER
                        Can you sue someone for writing a 
                        book about you without your 
                        permission?  

                                 SUIT
                        I’m an accountant.

           We see he is going over the restaurant’s books.  Carter puts 
           the questionnaire aside.

                                 SUIT (cont'd)
                        Everything looks good.  This place 
                        is a gold mine.  Especially with 
                        your overhead so low.  Remind me.  
                        Your stepmom owns the building?  

                                 CARTER 
                        She took it from her first husband 
                        in the divorce.  Hank Greene?

                        Tough woman.  And the name?  
                        “Whitegrass?”  That’s hers? 

                                 CARTER 
                        No, mine.  Just a name I like.

           His cell phone rings.  He looks at the caller ID.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)

                        Hi, Sondra.

                        How is the father-son retreat?

                                 CARTER
                        The what?

                                 SONDRA (O.S.)
                        The retreat? When is your tee time?

           A beat. Carter looks around, like someone is playing a joke.

                                 CARTER
                        Um. Sondra.  Where...are...you?

                                 SONDRA (O.S.)
                        An artist’s colony in Sedona. Put 
                        your father on. 

           A long beat.  He looks at the accountant.  

                                 SONDRA (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Hello?!?

                                 CARTER
                        Hi.

                                 SONDRA (O.S.)
                        I told him to leave his phone on.  
                        What if it was an emergency?

                                 CARTER
                        You know what? He’s in the pro 
                        shop?  

           The accountant raises an eyebrow.

                                 SONDRA (O.S.)
                        Get him.
                                 CARTER
                        I’m... I can’t. I’m... getting the 
                        cart. I’m at the... cart shack.  
                        It’s far from the pro... shop.  
                        Can he just call you back...?

                                 SONDRA (O.S.)
                        Fine.

           CLICK. Carter hangs up.  The accountant smiles.

                                 SUIT
                        I’ll go.

           He gathers his things.  Carter looks to his phone, then dials 
           another number. It goes straight to voicemail.

                                 CARTER
                        Dad, call me. 

           Carter considers.  Then dials another number.

           INT. TREY’S APARTMENT - DAY - INTERCUT

           Trey is blow-drying his computer keyboard.  Shuts it off to 
           answer the phone.

                                 TREY  
                        Dude, I know, email you the wedding 
                        list.  But I spilled iced tea on my 
                        keyboard.  

                                 CARTER
                        Have you heard from dad?

                                 TREY  
                        I think he’s home sick.

                                 CARTER
                        You talk to him?  

                                 TREY 
                        We were supposed to go tux shopping 
                        today for the “greatest tux ever.” 
                        But he called, said he was 
                        “shitting fire.”

           Carter looks away.  Something is going on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Carter pulls into the driveway and heads for the front door.  
           He KNOCKS. No answer. MUSIC comes through the door. He tries 
           the handle.  It’s open.  

           INT. HUGH AND SONDRA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He steps into the foyer. “Frampton Comes Alive” is echoing 
           through the house.  “Do... you... DO?”

                                 CARTER
                        Hello?!? 

           “Feeeeel, like I do.” He walks into the LIVING ROOM. 

           “Doooo... you, do.”

                        Pops?

           “Feeeeel, like I do.” He pushes through the door into THE

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh, yeah. That’s the stuff!

           Hugh’s bare ass is in mid-thrust on the kitchen counter.  

                                 CARTER  
                        JESUS!!!

           Hugh is startled. He rolls off the WOMAN and we can see 
           exactly who he’s fucking.

           Carter is pacing a hole in the driveway.  Hugh comes out,

                        Settle down...

           Carter stops pacing, glares at his father.

           Carter points a finger at him, like he’s about to scold him.  
           But he doesn’t even know what to say.  

           He storms to his car and speeds away. Hugh notices the 
           newspaper in the driveway. He picks it up and heads inside.

                        just stop by there.  She’s never 
                        been there. Never seen that house. 
                        He had to give her directions, do 
                        you understand?  This was planned.

                        than you thought.

           Carter rubs his temples.  This was NOT the plan.

                        to know.  

           He looks to the doctor.  The doctor puts his hands up.

                                 CARTER
                        What was I thinking...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S OFFICE - WHITEGRASS - NIGHT

           Carter in his office, trying to concentrate.  He spots Dr. 
           Judith’s QUESTIONNAIRE.  He pulls it out of the envelope.  
           Studies it for a beat.  Then--
           He TEARS it into million pieces, dumps the pieces back in the 
           envelope, seals it.

           INT. WHITEGRASS - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Carter sits at the bar, looking out at the dining room. But 
           he’s not watching the dinner rush. He’s studying...

           A FAMILY OF FOUR.  A mom, a dad, two kids.  Telling stories.  
           Laughing.  Sharing food.  The way it ought to be.  Someone 
           steps in his view.  It’s his friend PAUL and his wife SARAH.  
           They hate each other.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, Carter.  Great meal.  

                                 SARAH
                        We’re having a barbecue for Linus’s 
                        birthday and want to invite you.

           She hands him an invitation.  It’s in the shape of a giant 
           “2.”  Linus is turning two. 

                                 PAUL
                        He doesn’t want to come.  Single 
                        people aren’t into this shit.  

                                 SARAH
                        He can make up his own mind!  

           As they walk off, Paul looks back to Carter, mano-a-mano, and 
           mouths “don’t worry about it.”  Carter looks back to-- 

           THE FAMILY FOUR.  They come into clearer focus now.  The dad 
           turns and looks directly at him.  Now the dad is walking 
           toward him.  It’s his dad.  Carter looks back to the table.  
           Sondra and the twins.  She is pointing out her artwork.  Hugh 
           sits down next to Carter, speaks in hushed tones.  

                                 HUGH 
                        Just nod.  I told her I needed to 
                        talk to you about the flank steak. 
                             (a beat)
                        What you saw at the house... not 
                        that it’s any of your business...

                                 CARTER
                        You made it my business when you 
                        pretended to spend the day with me.  
                        Pretend to fake spend the day with 
                        someone else.
                                 HUGH
                        Sometimes you have such an 
                        unpleasant tone.
                             (beat)
                        Your mother and I saw each other at 
                        dinner, thank you very much.  Had a 
                        few bottles of wine-- a Chateau 
                        Yquem-- and certain feelings were 
                        stirred. We never had a physical 
                        problem.  Sex was always fantastic--

                                 CARTER
                        Dad!

                                 HUGH
                        You’re not nodding.  Just nod.  
                             (eyes Sondra)
                        We don’t need to make a big deal 
                        out of this Carter.  It was a one 
                        time thing. An accident.  

                                 CARTER
                        An accident is slicing off a finger 
                        while speed-chopping carrots.

                                 HUGH 
                        Just forget it happened.  For the 
                        sake of everyone involved.  Okay?  

           Carter nods.  Hugh rises. 

                                 HUGH (cont'd)
                        And by the way, the flank steak 
                        sucks. 

           He winks, and then waltzes back to his table, tussles his 
           son’s hair.  Hugh sits down with his family like nothing is 
           wrong.  It makes Carter sick.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Carter opens his eyes after a bad night’s sleep.  The first 
           thing he sees is--

           LAUREN, sitting on the floor, facing the window, in lose 
           fitting yoga-ish clothes. She in some kind of lotus position,  
           clearly at peace. A book about meditation lies next to her.  
           Carter finds this very annoying.

                                 CARTER 
                        Hey.
           Her eyes pop open.

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re up.  How’d you sleep?

                                 CARTER
                        Like shit.  I took one of your 
                        ambien in the middle of the night.

                                 LAUREN
                        Those are birth control pills.  

           A beat.  She LAUGHS.   

                                 LAUREN (cont'd)
                        Just kidding. I stopped taking my 
                        birth control pills a while ago.

           She’s joking again.  He’s not in a laughing mood.

                                 LAUREN (cont’d)
                        You want to sit over here and do 
                        some breathing exercises?  It might 
                        start your day in a better mood.  

                                 CARTER
                        I doubt it.

                                 LAUREN
                        Someday we will go to The Pelangi’s 
                        Transformational Self-Healing 
                        Workshop in Bali. And then you will 
                        sleep.

           That’s never going to happen. Lauren smiles, rises, starts 
           undressing for a shower.

                                 LAUREN (cont’d)
                        You need to wear a jacket today.

                                 CARTER
                        To what?

                                 LAUREN
                        The picture.

           Carter stares at her blankly.

                                 LAUREN (cont'd)
                        For my parents?  The present?
                                 CARTER

                        Oh.  I’m not taking a picture.  I 
                        don’t want to be on the credenza.  

                                 LAUREN
                        It’s all they want for their 
                        anniversary.  A picture of us.

                                 CARTER
                        Well... let’s get them some shit to 
                        put on their boat--  

                                 LAUREN
                        Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        I’ll do it later in the week.  I’m 
                        totally jammed today.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - TWO HOURS LATER

           Carter is slumped on the couch, still in sleep clothes, 
           watching WOMEN’S BEACH VOLLEYBALL.  In a stupor.  The phone 
           RINGS.  He ignores it.  It RINGS again.  

                                 CARTER
                             (answering)
                        What?

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY - INTERCUT

           Dr. Judith passes through a revolving door, looking more put 
           together than ever, cell phone to her ear.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Carter, it’s Dr. Judith.  Your 
                        questionnaire was returned to me 
                        accidentally ripped into a thousand 
                        pieces--

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           CLICK.  He tosses the phone back on the couch.  Continues 
           watching volleyball.  But in a matter of seconds, the phone 
           is RINGING again.  Carter grabs it.

                                 CARTER
                        Leave me alone.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Carter.  It’s Gary.
                                 CARTER
                        Oops.  Hey.  Gary.  

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I’m double-parked.  There’s nowhere 
                        to park on your street.  Ready to go?

           Carter looks out the window. THERE’S GARY in fishing gear.  

                                 CARTER
                        Shit.  The new moon. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - DAY

           Carter and Gary sit in a simple boat, fishing.  

                                 GARY
                        Your mom.  She’s funny.  We were 
                        supposed to have lunch yesterday, 
                        but she cancelled...

           Carter blanches.  If it weren’t for the deadly currents, 
           Carter might swim for shore.  

                                 CARTER 
                        Really.  Why?  

                                 GARY
                        Get this... to do pilates.  

                                 CARTER
                        Is that what they’re calling it?

                                 GARY
                        I don’t think it’s the best idea, 
                        with her hip.  But she says it’s 
                        the only way to get in shape for 
                        the wedding.  

                                 CARTER
                        OH!  I had a bite...

           His fishing rod didn’t move.  Carter hates lying to Gary.  
           And hates his parents more for putting him in this position.  

                                 GARY
                        Listen.  About the wedding.  Your 
                        mom said you’ve taken on a lot the 
                        planning.  I think she used the 
                        word “commandeered.”   But I want 
                        to help in some way...
           He hands him an envelope.  It’s a check for $20,000. 

                                 CARTER
                        Oh no.

                                 GARY
                        No?

                                 CARTER
                        No, I mean “oh” that’s so nice of 
                        you.  But it’s not right. Not now.

                                 GARY
                        Don’t be ridiculous. You and Trey 
                        are my family. I would do anything 
                        in the world for you kids.  

           Gary is a good man.  Carter has no choice but to take it.

                                 GARY (cont'd)
                        Did you hear?  Trey asked Glenn to 
                        officiate the wedding?

                                 CARTER
                        He did?

                                 GARY
                        Like I said.  Family.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Gary drops him off.  As Carter heads for his apartment, he 
           passes his car... and notices a parking ticket on the 
           windshield.  

                                 CARTER
                        Goddamnit.  

           He looks up at the parking sign, exasperated.  

           INT./EXT. TREY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Carter KNOCKS.  Trey opens and Carter hands him the ticket.

                                 CARTER 
                        Pay this.

                                 TREY
                        Okay.
                             (noticing)
                        What’cha got there?
           We see now that Carter is holding a tiny plastic bag.

                                 CARTER
                        Halibut.  Did you ask Gary’s son to 
                        officiate the wedding?

                                 TREY
                        Yeah. He’s a pastor.  Or a deacon. 
                        Or a Shriner. One of those things.

                                 CARTER
                        He lives in Alaska. And you’ve 
                        never met him.

                                 TREY
                        What a great way to get to know him.  

                                 CARTER
                        I wish you guys would just SLOW 
                        DOWN.  

                                 TREY 
                        Why?

           A beat.  Now he’s lying to Trey.

                                 CARTER
                        I just don’t understand why it all 
                        has to happen so quickly.

                                 TREY
                        ‘Cause we’ve got the fever!  Can’t 
                        you feel it?  We found a french 
                        horn player yesterday.  There’s 
                        like four of those in the city!  
                             (remembering)
                        Oh.  Can you meet dad at the tux 
                        place on Thursday?

           Carter forces a smile and goes upstairs.  Trey looks at the 
           parking ticket and opens a drawer-- where a mess of parking 
           tickets are piled up-- and drops it in.     

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TUXEDO SHOP - DAY 

           Carter is having a tuxedo jacket pinned by a elderly, be-
           spectacled TAILOR.  He keeps looking around, then whispers to 
           Carter so no one can hear:

                                 TAILOR
                        Don’t do it.
                                 CARTER
                        What?

                                 TAILOR
                        Don’t do it.  I’ve been married for 
                        57 years.  Haven’t had oral sex in 
                        thirty.  

                                 CARTER 
                        I’m not getting married.  He is. 

           Trey is by the window on the phone.  The tailor looks, shakes 
           his head forebodingly.  Trey hangs up, approaches.

                                 TREY
                        Dad’s phone went straight to 
                        voicemail.  He’s never this late. 
                             (worried)
                        Maybe that shitting fire thing is  
                        like some kind of intestinal 
                        problem.

           A beat.  A thought runs through Carter’s mind.  

                                 CARTER
                        Call mom.  

                                 TREY
                        Why?

                                 CARTER
                        Just try her.

           Trey shrugs.  Dials.  

                                 TREY
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Lorraine, it’s Trey.  Is my mom 
                        around?
                             (beat)
                        Really?  Wow.  Okay, thanks.

           Trey hangs up, looks to Carter.

                        Since when does mom do pilates?

                                 CARTER
                        Goddamnit.  GOD-DAMN-IT.

           INT. CARTER’S CAR - DAY - MOVING

           He’s on the phone, speeding.

                                 CARTER
                        Chloe.  When my dad was cheating on 
                        your mom with my step-mom, where 
                        did she catch them?  
                             (beat)
                        Great, thanks.
                             (about to hang up)
                        Wait! There was a name he used..?

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY

           Carter pulls up in front of a fancy hotel.   

           INT. FRONT DESK - FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           Carter rushes up to the FRONT DESK MANAGER.  This guy didn’t 
           get in to the Cornell School of Hotel Management and is still 
           bitter about it.

                                 CARTER
                        I need the room for.. Lafite 
                        Rothschild.  

                                 MANAGER 
                        I am sorry, sir.  We do not give 
                        out that information.

                                 CARTER
                        Fine, fine, fine. Just tell me if 
                        they’re here.

           The manager notices Carter’s slightly wild eyes.

                                 MANAGER
                        I am not at liberty to say.

                                 CARTER 
                        Give me a break. It’s my mom.  And 
                        dad.

                                 MANAGER
                        Well, then you should know what 
                        room the Baron and Baroness are in.

                                 CARTER
                        Listen, friend. Everybody knows 
                        what goes on here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        People check in and have dirty, 
                        dirty sex-- and go back to their 
                        lives, feeling a little less bad 
                        because it happened at a Four 
                        Seasons.

           The manager starts shuffling papers, ignoring him.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I hope you are proud of yourself. 

           Carter walks away, makes it a few feet before he sees--

           MICHELLE from Dr. Judith’s office.  She’s walking out of the 
           elevator, toward the door.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Hey.

           She looks up, tries to place him.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Carter.  From Dr. Judith’s... 
                        home... office.  

           She looks around, uncomfortable.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’ve been trying to figure out-- 
                        are you “Claire” or “Marcy?”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sorry?

                                 CARTER
                        In Dr. Judith’s book.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Why not “Yvette?”

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t know, I pictured her black.
                             (then)
                        I’m “Rick.”

                                 MICHELLE
                             (with great pathos)
                        Lake House “Rick?”

                                 CARTER
                        It’s not that bad.  What about that 
                        girl whose father ran away with her 
                        gymnastics coach? 
                                 MICHELLE
                             (defensive)
                        What about her?

           DING.  The elevator opens and a older man walks out.  He 
           breezes up to Michelle.  

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ready?

           From their body language, this guy is definitely not her dad.  
           An uncomfortable moment.   

                                 MICHELLE 
                        Carter, this is Charles.  

           Carter shakes his hand, notices he’s wearing a wedding band.  
           Michelle sees Carter notice this. 

                                 MICHELLE (cont'd)
                        Carter and I know each other from a 
                        book... club.  

                                 CHARLES 
                             (a total dick)
                        Terrific.  I recommend “The Kite 
                        Runner.”  Let’s go.  

           She smiles awkwardly and follows him out.  Carter watches 
           them go and we PRE-LAP the pleasing rhythms of some lame-ass 
           eco-friendly world music CD...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESTINATION MOON TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

           Carter sits in a waiting area, arms folded.  He checks his 
           watch.  The music isn’t helping to calm him.  

                                 CARTER
                        Do you know how long a pilates 
                        class is?  An hour.  Hour and a 
                        half max.  But my mom’s been out 
                        for three hours? That’s a long 
                        time. Anyone find that weird?  Any 
                        consequences to that?

           He talking to LORRAINE, the receptionist, a 50-ish earth 
           mother. She shrugs, looks around at the very silent office.

                                 LORRAINE
                        Things are slow.
                             (beat)
                        Our industry is dying. 
           DING!  That’s the elevator.  He sits up straight.  The 
           elevator doors open to reveal his Mom.  She sees him.  She 
           panics, STARTS PRESSING “CLOSE DOOR” with great fervor.  
           Carter realizes what she’s doing and jumps to his feet.  But 
           he gets to the elevator as the door shuts.  To Lorraine:

                                 CARTER 
                        Stairwell?

           She points.  He dashes into the stairwell.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Carter emerges from the door to see his mother SPRINTING FOR 
           HER CAR!!

                                 CARTER (CONT’D)   
                        What the--

           He runs after her! But she’s quick. She gets in her car and 
           PEELS out of the lot before Carter can catch up.  He stands 
           there, out of breath, exasperated when his phone rings.  He 
           sees the caller ID, answers it.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’m on my way.

           INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY

           Carter rushes in.  Lauren is already sitting on a stool in 
           front of a backdrop.  She’s been sitting there for a while.

                                 LAUREN
                        It’s not even passive aggressive 
                        for you to be this late.

                                 CARTER
                        Sorry.  Let’s do this thing.

           He sits down behind her, wraps his arms around her-- prom 
           style-- and looks to the PHOTOGRAPHER.

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re sweating.  

                                 CARTER
                        Is that a woodsy glen behind us?

           We see the backdrop.  It’s the woods.  Very cheesy.
                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        You two look great!  Give me a 
                        minute to adjust the lights.

           He goes to work as Carter and Lauren sit there in their pose. 
           A beat.  

                                 LAUREN
                        I’ve been thinking about the “key” 
                        thing.  I appreciate the gesture, 
                        but it’s a little weak.  Chloe said 
                        I should have kicked you in the 
                        nuts.  

                                 CARTER
                        She’s sweet that way.  

                                 LAUREN 
                        Why don’t we just move in together.
                             (Carter raises an eyebrow)
                        People do it. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Okay, here we go!

           FLASH!  The photographer takes his first picture.  Not a 
           keeper.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (cont'd)
                        Carter?  How ‘bout a smile?

                                 CARTER 
                        See, I gave you the key so you 
                        could come and go as you please.

           Big fake smile.  FLASH.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Right.  I got that.  But I’m there 
                        every night anyway.  And my lease 
                        is up in two months, so...

           She does a fake smile.  FLASH.

                                 CARTER
                        This is something we should talk 
                        about.  Think about. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I have been thinking about it.
                                 CARTER
                        Right.  But not with me.  And the 
                        last thing we need... is to be... 
                        impulsive.  

           FLASH.  No one is smiling. 

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Impulsive gets you in trouble.

                        Right.  Got it.  

           FLASH.  The photographer is contemplating a career change.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           A weary Carter keys into his apartment, alone, to find 
           visitors.  Trey and Kieko have taken over the living room 
           with an elaborate series of charts and arts and crafts 
           supplies.  Trey looks up.

                                 TREY
                        We were out of paper.  

                                 KIEKO
                        And pens.

                                 CARTER
                        What’s this?

                                 TREY
                        This... is the big idea.  This 
                        solves all our problems.  

           He gestures to the floor, where different colored papers are 
           arranged in some kind of pattern.

                                 TREY (cont'd)
                        Thirds.  We seat everyone at the 
                        ceremony... not in two sections, 
                        but in three. 

                                 KIEKO
                        Originally, it was quadrants.

                                 TREY
                        Right, but we’ve perfected it since 
                        then.

                        See, with a center section and 
                        aisles on either side, there will 
                        be three generations of Kobayashis 
                        blocking-- physically-- mom’s side 
                        and dad’s side.  It guarantees they 
                        won’t even have to make eye 
                        contact.   

                                 CARTER
                        Right.  Can’t have that happening.

                                 TREY
                        This is totally gonna work!

           Carter turns, walks into the kitchen.  Thinks about SLAMMING 
           his head against the wall.  Notices the mail on the counter.  
           Notices a particular package.  He opens it. 

           Yet another copy of DR. JUDITH’S QUESTIONNAIRE, this one with 
           a post-it note reading: “Carter, I’m counting on you!”  

           Carter is about to throw it out, but then... thinks better of 
           it.  He’s got an idea.  He grabs a pencil, sits down at the 
           kitchen table and starts to fill it out.  Vigorously.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. JUDITH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Carter sits opposite Dr. Judith, hands her the questionnaire.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I’m so glad you reconsidered.

           It’s rumpled and covered with eraser marks and notes in the 
           margin.  She flips it open, scans it, then reads out loud:

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        What’s the worst thing you ever 
                        heard your father say about your 
                        mother?  “Nigger-lover?”
                             (she looks up)
                        That’s a spicy margarita.

                                 CARTER
                        Right?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                             (reads another page)
                        They tried to give each other 
                        chlamydia?
                                 CARTER
                        True story.  Wait ‘til you get to 
                        the hysterectomy conspiracy. 
                             (she makes notes)
                        Oh.  Can you use their real names? 

           Dr. Judith takes a second look at him.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’ve been thinking.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I bet.

                                 CARTER 
                        You know how people-- authors-- 
                        publish excerpts before the actual 
                        book?  Like in a magazine?  Or the 
                        local paper?  You should publish 
                        some of this stuff.  Immediately.  

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        What’s the rush?

                                 CARTER
                        It might get some buzz going on 
                        your book.

                                 DR. JUDITH  
                        That’s very thoughtful of you.  

                                 CARTER 
                        And my parents need to be reminded 
                        how much they hate each other. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Why is that?  

                                 CARTER
                        Because I may have accidentally 
                        gotten them back together.
                             (can’t believe it)
                        I thought they were just sleeping 
                        together.  But it’s worse.  They’re 
                        having an affair.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        NO!  

                                 CARTER
                        Yep.

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        Spectacular!
                                 CARTER 
                        Catastrophe! And we have to stop 
                        it, do you understand?  They may 
                        think the last 20 years didn’t 
                        happen, but it did. And it sucked. 
                        It was chaos and I am NOT going 
                        back to that. 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Interesting.  Carter, have you ever 
                        tried to get a table at your 
                        restaurant?

                                 CARTER
                        What’s that got to do with 
                        anything?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Seems to me that you and chaos are 
                        good friends.

                                 CARTER
                        Are you going to help me or not? 

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        I’m sorry. I’ve just started my 
                        research.  Soon, I might be ready 
                        to present in some kind of academic 
                        forum, but right now..?  I’m sorry.

           He SNATCHES the questionnaire back from her.  

                                 CARTER 
                        Thanks for your help.

           And is gone. SLAM goes the door.  Dr. Judith sits for a 
           moment, considering.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - DAY

           Carter approaches the restaurant. There appears to be work 
           going on in the street out front. A truck, some orange cones, 
           a few helmeted workers stand around a large tripod. 

           Carter looks at what they’re looking at. His building. Oh 
           shit. These are SURVEYORS. 

                                 CARTER
                        What’s going on here?
                                 SURVEYOR
                        Re-zoning for conversion to retail. 
                        I think for a Walgreens.  

                                 CARTER
                             (terrified to ask)
                        Or a Rite Aid?

                                 SURVEYOR
                        Do I give a crap?

           Carter looks back to the restaurant. In the window, he sees 
           Miguel, Margo and the staff looking out, worried. His mind 
           races to a horrible conclusion.

                                 CARTER 
                        Oh no.  She knows.

                                 SURVEYOR
                        Excuse me?

                                 CARTER
                        It’s happening.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE ART INSTITUTE OF SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           Carter hustles down the hallway of a very well-appointed 
           building, poking his head into various “classrooms.” In one, 
           a NUDE MODEL, with her back to the class poses, while a half-
           dozen “students” sketch her in charcoal. Carter finds...

                                 CARTER
                        Sondra.

           The whole class turns, stops what they are doing. 

                                 SONDRA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 CARTER
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 SONDRA
                        Not now, Carter. I am in the middle 
                        of an important study.

           He glances at her easel. Then looks up at the model. Then 
           back down at the easel. It looks like the charcoal threw up.

                                 MODEL (O.S.)
                        Carter?
           The model has turned to see what’s going on.  

                                 CARTER
                        Hey, Marguerite.

           Her eyes well with tears, her lip starts to quiver.  

                                 MODEL
                        Excuse me, I need a minute.

           Too emotional, she grabs her robe and races out of the room. 
           The whole class turns and glares at him.

                                 CARTER
                        It was, like, six years ago.  She 
                        was clingy.

           EXT. HALLWAY - ART INSTITUTE OF SAN FRANCISCO - MOMENTS LATER

           Carter has Sondra all to himself.

                                 CARTER
                        I was hoping we could...talk... 
                        before things get... ugly. Try to 
                        work something out here.

           She looks at him, confounded.

                                 SONDRA
                        What is wrong with you? Are you bi-
                        polar? 

                                 CARTER
                        No.

                                 SONDRA
                        I am convinced your father is bi-
                        polar.

                                 CARTER
                        We should...get that checked out...
                             (beat)
                        So you don’t know? 

                                 SONDRA
                        Know what, Carter?

                                 CARTER
                        About the surveyors...

                        I wonder if they are looking at the 
                        laundromat next door?
                             (beat)
                        I should find out what Chung is 
                        getting per square foot. The 
                        Chinese are very savvy 
                        businesspeople, you know.

           Carter needs to seize the initiative.

                                 CARTER 
                        Sondra. I want to buy you out.

                                 SONDRA
                        You can’t afford it.

                                 CARTER
                        Sure I can.  I’ve got money.  

           She’s skeptical. But she’s listening.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           Carter sits across from a LOAN OFFICER who is reviewing a 
           file. Flipping back and forth between many documents. Trying 
           to figure something out. He finally looks up at Carter.

                        You don’t have money. You have any 
                        family that can co-sign?

                                 CARTER
                        No. 

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        Well, that’s the fastest way to get 
                        financing.

                                 CARTER
                        Okay, what’s the second fastest?

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        Do you know Warren Buffett?

                                 CARTER
                        Come on, man. My restaurant is 
                        doing great. My credit is rock-
                        solid. We can do this.

           He looks back at the paperwork.
                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        Let me see what I can do.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Carter drives away from the bank, notices something in the 
           rear view mirror.  A blue car.

           EXT. CARTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He takes a left. The blue car takes a left. He pulls into a 
           parking lot. It’s still there. Carter jams on the brakes, 
           gets out and stomps toward it.

                                 CARTER
                        Mom! What are you doing?

                                 MELISSA
                             (rolls down the window)
                        Get in.

                                 CARTER
                        What?

                                 MELISSA
                        Just get in the car.

           He opens the door...

           INT. MELISSA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           ... and gets in.  

                                 MELISSA
                        How are you?

                                 CARTER
                             (playing along)
                        Fine.  How are you?

                                 MELISSA
                        Fine. I heard you and Gary caught a 
                        nice fish. 

                                 CARTER
                        Very nice.

                                 MELISSA
                        Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        Mom. 
                                 MELISSA
                        What were you doing at the Four 
                        Seasons?

                                 CARTER
                        They have an excellent brunch.

                                 MELISSA
                        Listen. Your father and I need you 
                        to give us a little space. We’re 
                        going to figure this out.  
                        Actually, dad wants to go up to 
                        Napa for the weekend to talk.  I 
                        guess there’s a jazz festival.

                                 CARTER
                             (dumbfounded)
                        Did you get bashed on the head? 

                                 MELISSA
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 CARTER
                        You have to stop this! You two are 
                        messing with people’s lives. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Carter.  You’re not really in any 
                        position to judge.  

                                 CARTER 
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 MELISSA
                        You think you know what’s best.  
                        For everybody.  It’s a trait you 
                        get from your father.  But I’ve 
                        never seen you in a real 
                        relationship. How long have you 
                        been stringing that poor girl 
                        along? 

                                 CARTER
                        Don’t turn this on me.

                                 MELISSA
                        I’m just saying.  At least I act on 
                        my feelings.  

                                 CARTER
                        I am not stringing!

                                 MELISSA
                        Sweetie.  
           She reaches for his hand, with complete motherly sweetness.  
           But Carter pulls away and gets out of the car.  

                                 CARTER
                        Fucking loon!

                                 MELISSA
                        Wimp!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - EVENING 

           Carter stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving. He 
           holds the blade perilously close to his neck for a beat.  Now 
           he is front of a different mirror, in the bedroom, trying on 
           a sweater.  He tries on a Clash t-shirt.  Then he tries on a 
           sport coat.  The point is... he’s trying.    PRE-LAP: A knife 
           clinking on a wine glass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lauren’s father, Mr. Stringer, stands to make a toast. It’s 
           the Stringer’s anniversary and 16 friends and family are 
           gathered around a table - 15 of whom are dressed casually, 
           save for Carter. He is wearing a suit and tie.  

                                 LAUREN
                        You look very handsome.  

           He gives her hand a squeeze.  Then, out of the corner of his 
           eye, he spots THE CREDENZA.  It is overwhelming.  Every 
           available inch of surface area is covered by a family photo.  
           Husband, wife, husband and wife, children, school pictures, 
           prom pictures, family portraits, etc.  And there’s the new 
           picture of Carter and Lauren. It’s not good.  In fact, it’s 
           horrible.  Fortunately, this credenza is all about volume.

                                 MR. STRINGER
                        Carter?  

           Carter snaps out of it.  Everyone at the table has their 
           glass raised.  He quickly raises his.  

                                 MR. STRINGER (cont'd)
                        I would like to make a toast to 
                        thirty-five years of marriage to 
                        the most spectacular woman in the 
                        world.
           He really means that.  Who are these people?  Why do they 
           like each other so much?  And why do they look like they just 
           walked out of a Lands End catalogue?

                                 MR. STRINGER (cont'd)
                        When Kate and I met, things were 
                        much simpler.  I liked her, we 
                        dated, we got married.

           He looks directly at Carter.  Carter looks away, unnerved.  
           No one else notices.  They’re just beaming, listening.  

                                 MR. STRINGER  (cont'd)
                        To be here tonight surrounded by 
                        our dearest friends, and most of 
                        all, my children-- Cynthia and her 
                        incredible husband David-- Roger 
                        and the beautiful Maureen-- and 
                        Lauren... and Carter... if I were a 
                        religious person, I would say I’m 
                        blessed.  Since I’m not, I’ll just 
                        say I’m lucky.

                                 THE TABLE 
                        Awwwwwwww.

           Cheers!  Everyone clinks glasses.  Except Carter.  He’s 
           already drinking. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LAUREN’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - LATER   

           Carter and Lauren do the dishes.  He looks around. 

                                 CARTER
                        Where’s the dishwasher?

                                 LAUREN 
                        They got rid of it.  They like 
                        doing the dishes together.  

           Carter might puke.

                                 CARTER 
                        That is...it’s just...I have no 
                        words to describe that.

                                 LAUREN
                        I think it’s cute.

                                 CARTER
                        Your dad was looking right at me, 
                        you know.  During the toast.  
                                 LAUREN
                        He was looking around the room.  
                        And you were in the room.

                                 CARTER
                        He lingered on me. “Simpler time.”  
                        When?  When there was segregation?  
                        No anesthesia? 

                                 LAUREN
                        What is wrong with you?  

                                 CARTER
                        Nothing.  I don’t like being put on 
                        the spot.

                                 LAUREN
                        Well, you can understand my dad 
                        wondering why I date someone as non-
                        committal as you.  

                                 CARTER
                        So he WAS looking at me.

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh, for Godssakes.

                                 CARTER
                        I am not going to be pressured into 
                        doing anything before it feels 
                        right.

                                 LAUREN
                             (a little hurt)
                        You’ve made that perfectly clear.

                                 CARTER
                        See?  There it is.  You make it out 
                        like you don’t care about getting 
                        married. Or having kids. But you 
                        do. You want it all. And you’re 
                        just laying in wait, hoping I come 
                        around--

                                 LAUREN
                        Carter, I’m not going to fight with 
                        you.

                                 CARTER
                        Why?  We never fight.  Fighting’s 
                        good.  
                                 LAUREN
                        Because there are fifteen people in 
                        the other room eating creme 
                        caramel.  

           A beat.  

                                 CARTER 
                        Thirty-five isn’t even a real 
                        anniversary.  

                                 LAUREN
                        You’re a dick,  “Rick.” 

           She throws the dish towel at him and goes back into the 
           dining room.  Carter stands a beat, aghast.  Then goes--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is standing around, drinking cognac.  Studying 
           pictures on the credenza.  Carter is on Lauren’s heels in a 
           hushed WHISPER.  

                                 CARTER
                        You called me “Rick?”

                                 LAUREN
                        Dr. Judith was right.  She said you 
                        are hard-wired to sabotage true 
                        intimacy--

                                 CARTER
                        You talked to her?

                                 LAUREN
                        She came into the store.  Bought 
                        jeans, then pounded me with 
                        questions for her book.

                                 CARTER
                        BITCH.  

           Everyone looks toward them.  That was too loud. 

                                 LAUREN 
                        You should go.  And I kind of think 
                        we could use a little break.   

           He realizes this is momentous.  But somehow is more consumed 
           with...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. WAITING ROOM - DR. JUDITH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Carter walks through the waiting room, past the “IN SESSION” 
           sign and right into--

           INT. DR. JUDITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           She is with a patient, and furious that he barged in.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Carter!  I beg your pardon.

                                 CARTER
                        Heard you’ve been shopping.  Nice 
                        jeans.

                                 MARK
                        You’ve got to be “Rick.”

           Carter looks to the patient. MARK has a writhing snake tattoo 
           all the way up his arm, shoulder and neck. He’s a bad-ass.

                                 MARK (cont'd)
                        I’m Mark. Aka “Kevin.”

                                 CARTER
                        Kevin with the au pair?  And the 
                        stutter?

                                 MARK
                        Stutter’s gone.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Carter.  Go, please.  We can 
                        schedule an appointment if that’s 
                        what you would like--

                                 CARTER
                        I’m sorry-- are you trying to act 
                        professional?   
                             (back to the patient)
                        Is she snooping around on you too? 

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        My research is very important.

                                 CARTER
                        Now it is.  Before I walked in that 
                        door, you weren’t too busy. In fact, 
                        things were a mess around here.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        You should talk.  
                                 CARTER
                        I was fine.  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Ha!  You were a disaster.  A poster 
                        child of dysfunction. 

                                 CARTER
                             (blown away)
                        Isn’t that a violation of some 
                        psychiatric... hippocratic... code?  
                        To say shit like that?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I have never seen a stronger person 
                        in a weaker position.  Until now.  
                        Now you are growing, and growth is 
                        painful.  

                                 MARK
                        I’m growing too.

                          CARTER
                                                       DR. JUDITH
           Shut up, Kevin.
                                              Shut up, Mark.

                                 MARK (cont'd)
                        I’ll go have a smoke.

           He hurries out.  Carter looks to Dr. Judith, accusingly.  

                                 CARTER
                        You used me.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Yes. But for a greater good. For 
                        pioneering research with the 
                        potential to help millions.

                                 CARTER 
                        You were supposed to help me!!  

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I thought I could do both.

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah?  What do you call that in 
                        your book?

           He turns and leaves.  We HOLD ON DR. JUDITH... betraying a 
           hint of regret.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CAKE SHOP - DAY

           Kieko sits at a counter, takes a bite of wedding cake.  

                                 KIEKO
                        Mmmm.  Pretty good.

           She slides it to the right.  Reveal Trey sitting next to her, 
           with four other plates of half-eaten cake in front of him.  
           He clearly can’t eat another bite.  But he does.

                                 TREY
                             (ranking it)
                        3, 1, 4, 2.   

           He slides it to the right.  Reveal Carter sitting next to 
           him.  He looks drained.  Carter takes a spoon-full, 
           surreptitiously dumps it into a napkin.  

                                 CARTER
                        Tastes like cake.

                                 TREY
                             (to Kieko)
                        Told you we should have gotten high 
                        for this.  

                                 KIEKO
                        I did.

           Kieko gives Trey a kiss, jumps up to deal with the 
           proprietor.  Trey leans in to Carter, conspiratorially.

                                 TREY
                        What’s up with you and Lauren?

                                 CARTER
                        Why?  What do you mean?

                                 TREY
                        She called Kieko and basically 
                        pulled out of being a bridesmaid.  
                        That’s sort of bad timing.  Maybe 
                        you could suck it up for another 
                        couple of weeks--

                                 CARTER
                        Trey.

           Carter has had enough.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        It’s over.  The wedding is NOT 
                        going to happen.   
                                 TREY
                        Really?  I mean, she can find 
                        another bridesmaid--

                                 CARTER
                        Mom and dad are having sex.

           Beat.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        With each other. 

                                 TREY
                        Bullshit.

                                 CARTER 
                        I caught them.

                                 TREY
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 CARTER
                        Why would I lie about that?

                                 TREY
                        Because you think I’m making a 
                        mistake.  Because you always think 
                        you know better.  Because I live in 
                        your garage and steal your cable.  
                        And also your wi-fi.

           A beat.  Carter considers.

                                 CARTER
                        Be ALL of that as it may, I’m 
                        telling you the truth. I thought I 
                        could make it go away. I really 
                        did. But this is way bigger than 
                        me. So, there it is.

           A beat.  Trey soaks it in. 

                                 TREY
                        Well, what am I supposed to do 
                        about the wedding?

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t know. I’ve got my own 
                        problems to deal with.

                                 TREY
                        I already spent Gary’s money...we 
                        have a whole double aisle system...
           Carter shrugs. Trey steams, realizes he’s kind of screwed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Typical night.  Slammed.  Kitchen going at hyperspeed.  The 
           pastry chef holds out a dessert and Carter grabs it in 
           stride.  He pushes through the double doors into--

           THE DINING ROOM.  He drops the dessert on a table, wishing 
           them a half-hearted “happy birthday.”  Then he reaches the 
           hostess stand, where Margo is besieged.  Everyone wants their 
           table NOW.  When they see Carter, their pleading voices turn 
           to him, a massive wave of upper-middle class entitlement.

           “Carter!  Robbie told us you would hook us up!”  “I work with 
           Lauren’s cousin at Pixar!” “I was your orthodontist!”  It 
           SWELLS and SWELLS until Carter can’t discern one from the 
           other.   And we SMASH CUT TO:  

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Quiet.  The dining room is empty.  Chairs are up on tables.   
           Except for one, where Carter is nursing a drink.  Margo is 
           the last one there, closing up.

                                 CARTER
                        I want to start taking 
                        reservations.

                                 MARGO
                        Really?  

                                 CARTER
                        Yes.

                                 MARGO
                        But this is a neighborhood 
                        restaurant, and--

                                 CARTER
                        It’s out of control.  Get a book.  

           A KNOCK on the glass door.  Margo waves the person off with a 
           “we’re closed.”  Carter looks up to see IT’S MICHELLE.  

           Carter nods to Margo to open the door.  Michelle steps in.  
           Margo sizes up the situation, confused. 

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’ll lock up.  

           Margo smiles, slips out the door.  
                                 MICHELLE
                        I probably should have called.  Dr. 
                        Judith told me this was your place.

                                 CARTER
                        She’s very professional.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I wanted to clear something up.  
                        The other day... what you saw... 

                                 CARTER 
                        What? You and the married guy?

           She seems troubled over this.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Don’t worry about what I think.  I 
                        am way more fucked-up than you.  

           A tiny smile.  He pushes out the chair for her to sit down.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Red or white?

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - LATER

           A bottle of wine is almost empty. A cutting board has the 
           remnants of some cheese and a broken loaf of bread.  

                                 CARTER
                        There were only five houses on the 
                        lake to begin with.

                                 MICHELLE
                        And your parents rented houses on 
                        opposite sides of your house?

                                 CARTER
                        Exactly.  We had three of the five 
                        houses on the lake. 
                             (she laughs)
                        They refused to see each other.  So 
                        twice a week, my brother and I 
                        shuttled between mom’s and dad’s.  
                        Through the woods.  Sometimes at 
                        night, in pajamas, with 
                        flashlights.  This was right after 
                        that whole “In Search Of... 
                        Bigfoot” episode...  

                                 MICHELLE 
                        Leonard Nimoy is gay.
                                 CARTER
                        That’s Sulu.
                             (anyway...)
                        One year, the main house-- the  one 
                        that’s been tied up in court for 
                        twenty years--  it had an 
                        electrical short.  And they accused 
                        each other of trying to burn the 
                        place down.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Best thing that could have 
                        happened.

                                 CARTER
                        Right.  That house was everything 
                        when I was a kid.  The drive there-- 
                        we’d turn off the highway and you 
                        could smell it.  The water tower 
                        that said “Come to US”-- somebody 
                        scratched off the Jesus.  
                             (a heavy sigh)
                        It was perfect.  At least that’s 
                        how I remember it.

           She smiles, a little buzzed.

                                 MICHELLE
                        That guy you met?  Michael?  He’s 
                        my ex-husband.

                                 CARTER
                        No!

                                 MICHELLE
                        I was 21. Thought I could do it 
                        better than my parents. I did it 
                        almost out of defiance.

                                 CARTER
                        At least you guys are still... 
                        cordial?

                                 MICHELLE
                        He calls, usually on Tuesdays, when 
                        he has meetings near my office in 
                        the Ferry Building.  I don’t even 
                        know if he really has meetings, but 
                        we...

                                 CARTER
                        --got it.
                                 MICHELLE
                        Not because I want him back. I 
                        don’t know.  It’s stupid.  I’m an 
                        ex-husband fucker.

                                 CARTER
                        Okay, you are more fucked-up...

           They both laugh.  Carter feels comforted.  Finally someone 
           who gets it.  He raises his glass for a toast.

                                 CARTER (cont’d)
                        To our parents.  Thanks for the 
                        memories.

                                 MICHELLE 
                        At a certain point, you stop seeing 
                        them as parents.  They’re just 
                        people you’d never say a word to if 
                        you weren’t related to them.

                                 CARTER
                        Until you need a bone marrow 
                        transplant.

           They touch glasses.  CLINK. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           SLAM! Carter and Michelle are making out, kind of rough, up 
           against a car.  They bump along the side of the car, 
           maneuvering around the side-view mirror.  

                                 CARTER
                        Ow.

           She angles him over toward the front. It’s clumsy, not sexy. 
           She shimmies up on the hood.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Let’s do it on the car.

                                 CARTER
                        What?  Really?

           She starts tugging at his pants when--

           CHRIP-CHIRP--we hear the sound of an alarm being de-activated 
           and see a conservative MAN IN A SUIT approaching.

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        I’m really sorry but... this is my 
                        car.
           They slide off and straighten themselves out. The man studies 
           the hood. Is that a dent?

                                 CARTER
                        We were just...

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        There is a park around the 
                        corner...with benches. But also 
                        crackheads.

           As he gets in the car, he gives Carter a look.  One that 
           doesn’t make Carter feel particularly good.  

           The car pulls away.  The “moment” has been lost. Carter fills 
           with something just short of regret.

                                 CARTER
                        I should probably head home.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah.

           But neither of them move. Something like longing is in the 
           air.

                                 MICHELLE (cont’d)
                        I’m not an answer to your problems. 
                        I’m another problem.

           He nods.  She takes out some keys and hits a button. The car 
           right next to them CHIRP-CHIRPS.

                                 CARTER 
                        That you?

           She smiles.  Then gets in and pulls away. Carter turns and 
           heads down the street.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARTER’S CAR - DAWN

           Carter pulls up in front of his apartment...

                                 CARTER
                        No way. 

           A parking spot.  Right in front.  He pulls in, turns the car 
           off.  But he doesn’t get out.  He just sits there, in 
           silence.  He hits a button on the cd player.  
                                 BURT REYNOLDS (V.O.)
                        "Towards thee I roll, thou all-
                        destroying but unconquering 
                        whale...”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           CLOSE ON the laser as it scorches the name “Todd” from 
           Chloe’s skin.  

                                 CHLOE
                        How’s it look?

                                 CARTER
                        Now it just says “odd.”  

           The laser drones on.  Carter sits beside her, watching on, 
           morose.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I’m turning into my dad.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh boy... 

                                 CARTER
                        I’ve done everything my entire life 
                        not to.  But it’s just happening. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re not turning into your dad.  

                                 CARTER
                        I am.

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re not turning into anything.  

           The Doctor switches the laser off.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh-key-dokey.  The nurse will be by 
                        in a minute.  I’ve got to go work 
                        on a skinhead who’s fallen out of 
                        love with his swastika.  

           He walks out.  Chloe smiles, but Carter is pensive.  

                                 CARTER
                        Have you heard from Lauren?
                                 CHLOE
                        No.  She quit the store.  I’m a 
                        casualty of your stupidity.

                                 CARTER
                        Great.  

                                 CHLOE
                        You know, when she said she wanted 
                        to take a break, you were supposed 
                        to protest.  

           Carter winces, knows she’s right.  His phone RINGS.  He 
           sighs, answers it.

                                 CARTER 
                        Hi, Margo.  

                                 MARGO (O.S.)
                        You better get down here. We’re 
                        being evicted. 

                                 CARTER
                        What?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITEGRASS - DAY    

           Carter rushes into the restaurant.  Two uniformed building 
           inspectors.  One city bureaucrat.  A few lawyers.  And a cop.  
           Margo meets him at the door.

                                 MARGO
                        They’re saying multiple code 
                        violations, not having a proper 
                        lease filed--

           Carter spots the source of it all.  Sondra.  She stands by 
           the bar, directing traffic, hair pulled into a tight bun, 
           eyes puffy, threatening to finish a cigarette with one 
           inhalation.  She sees Carter.  

                                 SONDRA
                        You knew!  You thought you could 
                        sneak it by me!

           He takes her by the arm, gently escorts into--

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           --where they are alone.  Except for Miguel.  Who quickly 
           takes off the hat again.  Then slips out the back door.
                                 SONDRA
                        Your mother?  Are you kidding me?  

                                 CARTER
                        Oh.  
                             (the hammer falls)
                        That.

                                 SONDRA
                        He could at least have the decency 
                        to fuck a college girl!

                                 CARTER
                        That would have been my guess.  
                        Look, Sondra-- I know you’re upset, 
                        but let’s not be rash here.  I’m 
                        sure my Dad feels... awful--

                                 SONDRA
                        Please. He feels bad about getting 
                        caught. How do you think we met? It 
                        wasn’t at a singles event.

                                 CARTER
                        Okay.  But there’s still a chance 
                        we can... you can work things out.  
                             (a badly told lie)
                        You’re good together.   

                                 SONDRA
                        You’ve hated me from day one. You 
                        call me “The Cuntessa.”

                                 CARTER 
                             (busted)
                        Who told you that?

           She had enough and heads for the double doors.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Hang on. I am prepared to buy you 
                        out. I’m going to have the money in 
                        like, days. Maybe less. Maybe 
                        today. Maybe right now. I could 
                        have it already...

           A beat.  She studies him.

                                 SONDRA
                        Fine.  I’ll sell you the building.

                                 CARTER
                        Really? 
                                 SONDRA
                        Yes.

                                 CARTER
                        That’s great!  Thank you. Thank--

                                 SONDRA
                        100 million dollars.

           Beat.

                                 CARTER
                        That’s like, 98 million more than 
                        asking.

           She steps toward him.   

                                 SONDRA
                        I made an effort with you for your 
                        father.  That’s the deal you make.  
                        But now?  It’s the one great thing 
                        about getting divorced. No more 
                        obligation to all the lousy, 
                        interchangeable losers that come 
                        with the people you marry. You have 
                        a week to vacate.  Clock is 
                        ticking.

           And she goes back into the restaurant.  Carter hesitates, 
           then BLASTS out the double doors--

           INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           --ready to counter-punch.  

                                 CARTER
                        Listen, bitch--

           That’s when he notices something he didn’t see before. THE 
           TWINS. Tyler and Emily.  Sitting at a table.  They have 
           crayons in front of them, but the atmosphere is less than 
           conducive to coloring.   

           They look scared.  Unsure.  Like Carter did many years ago. 

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        It’s going to be okay.

           It totally isn’t.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           He trudges toward his apartment.  He stops at Trey’s door and 
           KNOCKS.  It opens.  On a surprise guest.  

                                 HUGH
                        You dumb sonofabitch!  
                             (into his cell phone)
                        I have to call you back, Len.

           He hangs up.  

                                 HUGH (cont'd)
                        You know, there’s a reason we’ve 
                        been using you as a go-between all 
                        these years-- your brother sucks at 
                        it. 

                                 CARTER
                        He told her?

                                 HUGH
                        He e-mailed me to see if what you 
                        said was true... to the account I 
                        share with Sondra.

                                 CARTER
                             (ouch)
                        I would have never done that.

                                 HUGH 
                             (exasperated)
                        You don’t end a marriage like this! 
                        I could have made her miserable, 
                        got her to leave me. It costs a lot 
                        less. 

           He opens the door all the way to reveal... Melissa sitting on 
           the couch, arms folded, shaking her head like only a 
           disappointed mother can.  

                                 MELISSA
                        We were hoping to hold off on 
                        telling anyone until after Trey’s 
                        wedding. 

           She looks to Trey.  He’s sitting on a milk crate.  

                                 MELISSA  (cont'd)
                        Trey, honey, you understand we 
                        didn’t want it to be this way. 

           Trey looks to his older brother, angry.
                                 CARTER
                        What are you looking at me for?

                                 TREY
                        The wedding’s off. Kieko’s pissed. 
                        She thinks you sabotaged the whole 
                        thing...and I let you.

                                 CARTER
                        What? I was trying to protect you!

                                 HUGH
                        That’s not your job.

                                 CARTER
                        Right. It’s yours.
                             (back to Trey)
                        Let me tell you something, Trey. 
                        The only reason you’re so clear-
                        headed about getting married is 
                        because I shielded you from those 
                        two your whole life, which almost 
                        never happened.  You were a last 
                        ditch attempt to save their 
                        marriage. “Have another kid. See if 
                        that works.”  You’re not even a 
                        person-- you’re a Hail Mary. 

                                 MELISSA
                        That’s not true, honey. You were an 
                        accident.

                                 CARTER
                        And you know what?  I hate Herman 
                        Melville.  Not a big Burt Reynolds 
                        fan either, but I listen every day 
                        so you can live rent free.  

           He looks back at his parents, addresses all of them.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        For 20 years I thought there was 
                        some kind of obligation. Some 
                        family code. Who I had to lie for, 
                        who I had to look out for-- 
                             (stopping himself)
                        That’s a major hurdle for ACOD’s.

                                 HUGH
                        A-cee-oh-who?

           Carter realizes who he is channelling, goes with it anyway.
                                 CARTER
                        I have become a caretaker to 
                        parents who use their own child for 
                        emotional support.  Know what 
                        that’s called?  Parentification.  
                        That makes you... Parentifiers!

                                 HUGH
                        You’re an ass, Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        I am done accommodating.  All of 
                        you.   

           He slaps a button above the light switch.  The electronic 
           garage door RAISES and we see into the garage from outside - 
           like a Price is Right model living room, complete with 
           dysfunctional family.   

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        It’s a fucking garage.

           And he storms out.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           CUE “Sink to the Bottom” by Fountains of Wayne as we begin a 
           MONTAGE...

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Watching TV.  Women’s volleyball.  Watching sweaty women hug 
           each other repeatedly isn’t as fun as it used to be.  

           INT. EMPTY SPACE - DAY

           A real estate AGENT shows Carter potential space for a new 
           restaurant.  It’s total shit compared to what he had.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           He spots Lauren’s meditation book peeking out from under the 
           bed.  He reaches for it, considers it... then begins to flip 
           through it.

           EXT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           He aims the garage clicker.  The garage door slowly rises to 
           reveal... IT’S EMPTY. 

           EXT. LINUS’S BIRTHDAY BARBECUE - DAY 

           Carter stand beside his friend PAUL, watching him cook some 
           burgers.  Paul’s wife SARAH comes over.  
                                 SARAH
                        You’re overcooking them. 
                             (no response)
                        You listening to me?

                                 PAUL
                        Will you go into the kitchen and 
                        get the cheese?

                                 SARAH
                        What kind of cheese?

                                 PAUL
                        Doesn’t matter.

           She rolls her eyes and heads off. Paul moves aside a pack of 
           buns to reveal a STACK OF CHEESE slices, smiles to Carter.

                                 PAUL (cont'd)
                        It’s the little victories.

           Carter smiles along.  He takes in the backyard: parents 
           playing with their children.  Couples nuzzling.  A man 
           putting his hand on his pregnant wife’s belly.  

                                 CARTER
                        Hey, is Lauren coming by?

                                 PAUL
                        C’mon, dude.  Sarah called her.  I 
                        guess she’s holed up at her 
                        parents.  I sent an ex-girlfriend 
                        running to her parents once.  That 
                        was in college, though.  Not in our 
                        thirties.  Nice work.

                                 CARTER
                        We’re not officially broken up.    

                                 PAUL
                        Well, somebody should make it 
                        official.  ‘Cause we’re in limbo 
                        here.  Friend limbo.  We couldn’t 
                        have both of you at this event, and 
                        that’s one less present for my kid.    

           Carter nods.  He knows what he’s got to do.  And worse 
           still... where he has to do it.  Pre-lap a DOORBELL RINGING.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT

           The door opens.  It’s Mr. Stringer.  And he is somehow 
           wearing the same look he had on during his toast.  
           Disappointment.  No, predictable disappointment.  Carter 
           smiles wanly.

                                 MR. STRINGER
                        She’s upstairs.

           INT. LAUREN’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Carter walks the gauntlet, past the credenza.  His picture is 
           GONE.  That was fast.  

           INT. LAUREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lauren is at a computer when there’s a KNOCK on the door and 
           Carter enters.  The room is as it was when Lauren went off to 
           college.  Single bed, slightly girlish decor... is that a 
           “Friends” poster?  A few bags sit semi-packed on the floor.  
           Carter suddenly feels even worse.

                                 CARTER
                        Lauren.  I am so sorry.

                                 LAUREN
                        It’s okay--

                                 CARTER
                        No, it isn’t.  You have done 
                        nothing but... try... and I’ve 
                        given you... nothing.  Zero.  I’ve 
                        just undermined us.  Sabotaged us.  
                        And we can’t go on like that.  

           He isn’t remotely done.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I mean, think about it-- it’s so 
                        stupid. I should have told you 
                        about Trey and Kieko.  That’s good 
                        news.  And we should share that.  
                        And I should have told you about my 
                        parents... because it’s bad news.  
                        And it was freaking me out.  And 
                        we’re not anything if I’m not 
                        telling you... that.  Or wanting to 
                        tell you that.  The whole point of 
                        being in this... or something like 
                        this... is to actually share your 
                        life instead of... y’know.  So... I 
                        guess what I’m saying is... I want 
                        to be... with you?
           It felt good to say that.  In fact, he may have finally just 
           got the “feeling?”  With more confidence:

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I want to be with you.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Wow.  Carter.  I have been waiting 
                        so long for you to... talk to me.  
                        Like that.  

                                 CARTER
                        I know!

                                 LAUREN
                        It means so much to me.  And if you 
                        had said any of that a month ago-- 
                        even a week ago-- it would have 
                        meant everything.  But you’ve been 
                        off thinking and so have I.  And... 
                        I’m leaving.  

           Beat.  

                                 CARTER
                        Where you going?

                                 LAUREN
                        Bali. 

                                 CARTER
                        When are you coming back?

                                 LAUREN
                        I don’t know.  

                                 CARTER
                        Oh.  

           Beat.

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m going to go do that meditation 
                        program.  And travel a bit.  Turns 
                        out I have a cousin in Darwin.  
                        That’s in Australia.  Australia and 
                        Bali.  Maybe Thailand.  

                                 CARTER
                        Wait.  No.  You can’t go.  Not now.

                                 LAUREN
                        I was always thinking about what’s 
                        best for us.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAUREN (cont'd)
                        Because I look at my parents and 
                        think that’s how it has to be. But 
                        you and I are never going to be my 
                        parents.  And I don’t think I want 
                        that anyway.  To be honest, I have 
                        no idea what I want anymore.  Other 
                        than to go.  To leave tomorrow on a 
                        36 hour flight to Bali.  And 
                        possibly Australia.   

           Carter looks to her, plaintively.  

                                 CARTER
                        Can I come?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - DAY

           It’s empty. Stripped of all tables, fixtures and personality.  
           Standing alone is Miguel in the middle of the room, wearing 
           street clothes.  Carter comes out the kitchen.   

                                 CARTER
                        Are you sure you don’t want me to 
                        call Biscardi’s?  They got a double-
                        barrelled sink over there...

           Miguel smiles, says IN SPANISH:

                                 MIGUEL
                        Screw that.  
                             (holds up his green card)
                        I’m getting a dot-com job.

           Miguel embraces him.  Then leaves.  Carter takes in the quiet 
           of the empty space.  Alone.  

           He walks to the window and tears away a small piece of paper 
           covering it. He peers out one last time.

           EXT. WHITEGRASS RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Carter’s tiny face is nearly lost in a giant sign that says 
           “RITE AID COMING SOON.”   

                                                              FADE OUT:

           FADE IN ON:

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

           People are filing in to an auditorium.  
           INT. HALLWAY - SAN FRANCISCO STATE - DAY

           A familiar voice echoes through the speakers. A posterboard 
           by the door reads “San Francisco State Presents: Dr. Lorraine 
           Judith: The 20-Year Study: Adult Children of Divorce (ACOD).

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Dr. Judith stands strong at the lectern, delivering her 
           findings with charm and confidence. The words and voice are 
           the exact same as at the start of the movie...  

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        ...having a parent marry for the 
                        second time, or in some instances, 
                        a third. The eternal struggle over 
                        traditional family events. All of 
                        this has a profound effect on the 
                        child of divorce as they move into 
                        adulthood.  

           The back door opens. CARTER steps in. 

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        The follow-up to my landmark study 
                        of 20 years ago will be about a 
                        generation unique in history.

           He looks around.  There aren’t many open seats.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Psst.  Hey.

           He spins.  There, in the back row, smack-dab in the middle, 
           is Michelle-- with an empty seat next to her.  

                                 MICHELLE (cont'd)
                        You got my message.

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah.  Thanks.  I think.  

           He tries to figure out how to get in to the seat.  He decides 
           to just climb over.  It causes a bit of a COMMOTION.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        For this new work, I was able to 
                        reconnect with four of my five 
                        original subjects.  The fifth is a 
                        pop star currently on tour in New 
                        Zealand. But I have been studying 
                        her lyrics and they are quite 
                        revealing--
           Dr. Judith notices the COMMOTION and its source: Carter.  It 
           gives her pause.  She had an entire lecture prepared.  But 
           seeing him sit down and look up at her, it makes her re-
           consider what she wants to say.    

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        Today, I am going to focus on one 
                        subject. I called him... “Rick.” 

           PUSH IN on Carter.  His jaw tightens. 

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                        Adult “Rick” is charming... and 
                        successful... but is also... 
                        controlling and rigid... and lives 
                        in an emotional cave.   

           Carter is taken back. He looks to Michelle.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        No one’s even paying attention.  

           He looks to the person on the other side, who is riveted.  In 
           fact, the whole room is.  

                                 DR. JUDITH 
                        His parents divorce has become the 
                        defining event of his life, instead 
                        of just a milestone. But...

           We PUSH IN on Carter.  He is really listening now.

                                 DR. JUDITH (cont'd)
                             (almost as an apology)
                        Rick is not alone in this. We all 
                        hold onto the shards of our past. 
                        That doesn’t mean we need to carry 
                        them around and repeatedly stab 
                        ourselves in the thigh with them. 
                        Sometimes, they should just be 
                        buried in the backyard, with a 
                        marker if you choose.

           Carter looks away for a beat.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. AUDITORIUM - SAN FRANCISCO STATE - DAY

           Carter pushes through the doors, first one out, making a b-
           line for his car.     

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY

           Carter strolls through the massive aisles, shopping cart half-
           full of various provisions. Not sure what it all adds up 
           to...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Beautiful backroad northern California. Redwood trees, light 
           slanting through the foliage. 

           Carter turns off a main road on to a ragged, dirt path. TILT 
           UP to see the name of the street: “WHITEGRASS LANE”  

           The car bounces along and finally comes to a STOP. He gets 
           out and looks up at a something in front of him.  We see for 
           the first time...

           THE LAKE HOUSE.  A two story rustic log cabin set amongst the 
           trees. Weeds grow around the porch. 

           He eases out of the car, takes a stretch, pops open the trunk 
           and casually removes TWO CANS OF GASOLINE.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - UNDERNEATH

           SPLASH. Carter douses the base of the house. When one can is 
           empty, he moves on to the next.  He even finds some old rags 
           and soaks them.  Perfect!  Then...

           A NOISE.  From under the house he sees feet.  Walking through 
           the grass.  Down the hill toward the lake.  

           He scrambles to hide the gas cans.  Then slithers out from 
           under the house, grabbing a rotted yellow wiffle bat, to 
           vantage where he can see--

           THE BOAT HOUSE.  The door is OPEN.  He starts down the hill.

                                 CARTER
                        Hello?

           More RUSTLING in the boat house. Then a figure emerges...

                                 GARY
                        Carter?

                                 CARTER
                        Gary!?!

           Carter’s step-dad, decked in full fishing gear. 
                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 GARY
                        Um.  Your mother and I, we actually 
                        used to use the place.  

                                 CARTER
                        You did?  

                                 GARY
                        Yeah.  All the time.  I re-painted 
                        the canoe.

           He notices the canoe in the water.

                                 CARTER
                        Oh.  Looks good.  

                                 GARY 
                        I was just going to do some 
                        fishing.  Clears my head.

                                 CARTER 
                        Gary...  I’m sorry. I should have 
                        told you the truth--

                                 GARY
                        You were in a tough spot.

                                 CARTER
                        I still feel bad.

                                 GARY
                        It’s called morality. It’s what 
                        separates us from voles.

           Carter grins. Gary always was the good guy.

                                 GARY (cont'd)
                        So what are you doing here?

                                 CARTER
                        Well... um...  I might be at the 
                        tail-end of a nervous breakdown.

           Gary laughs. Doesn’t know if he is kidding or not.

                                 GARY
                        Want to come fishing?

                                 CARTER
                        Um.  No.  But maybe I’ll see you 
                        when you get back.  
           Gary smiles, climbs into the boat and pushes off.  Carter 
           waves to Gary.  Gary waves back.  Carter smiles. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Carter walks back up the hill, muttering to himself, unsure 
           what to do now.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Under the house, Carter retrieves the gasoline can, collects 
           the pile of rags.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Carter’s trunk flies open.  He tosses all the evidence back 
           in, slams it.  And sighs.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Stupid idea anyway.  

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           Carter washes his hands off in the sink.  As he dries them, 
           he looks around the beautiful great room decorated with 
           rustic charm.  He notices something underneath the coffee 
           table.  Pulls out a wicker basket filled with magazines.  And 
           two heavy duty FLASHLIGHTS.  A nostalgic grin.  

           EXT. BACK DECK - LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           Carter steps through double-doors on to a large deck and 
           STOPS.  We see it the way he sees it.  THE LAKE, stretching 
           out before him, glistening in the afternoon sun.  It’s calm, 
           quiet, sublime.  Better than he remembered it.

           He takes a deep breath.  A gust of wind rattles the trees.  
           It’s the only noise for miles around.  And for the first time 
           in 99 pages, he experiences something resembling calm.  

           He spots a lone Adirondack chair and sits.  He nudges over 
           the footrest.  Up go the feet.  He tilts his head up to the 
           warm sun and closes his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BACK DECK - LAKE HOUSE - FOUR HOURS LATER

           Carter is OUT.  Somewhere between a nap and a coma.  Then 
           VOICES stir him.  And a SLAMMING door wakes him.  

           He pops up.  Goes back to the double doors.  Opens them...
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...to find MELISSA AND HUGH taking off their jackets.

                                 MELISSA 
                        Carter? What are you doing here?

           A beat.

                                 HUGH
                        Your mother is talking to you.

                                 CARTER
                        Um...

           Now Trey and Kieko enter. They carry bags of groceries. They 
           are shocked to see Carter.

                                 TREY
                        Who invited him?

                                 HUGH
                        He’s just here.

                                 CARTER
                        What’s going on?

                                 MELISSA
                             (explaining)
                        We came up for the night.  A family 
                        getaway.

                                 CARTER
                        Oh.

                                 HUGH
                        No offense.

           Carter is about to feel left out, except there isn’t time.  
           The back door opens and--  

                                 GARY  
                        Carter! Hope you’re hungry!

           Gary enters through the back door with a fish in each hand.  
           He sees everyone.  They see him.  A really awkward moment.

                                 HUGH
                        What’s he doing here??

                                 CARTER
                             (re: Mom and Gary)
                        They’ve been coming here for years.
                                 HUGH
                        They what?

                                 MELISSA
                        No!  We came up here once or twice--

                                 CARTER
                        A month.

                                 MELISSA
                        Carter! Don’t stir!  

                                 HUGH
                             (to Melissa)
                        On the ride up here, you were 
                        saying you barely remember the 
                        place.  

                                 MELISSA
                        With you.  I barely remember it 
                        with you.

                                 HUGH
                        You map-quested directions!

                                 GARY
                        I should probably go.

                                 MELISSA
                        Gary...

           The front door OPENS.  Everyone spins to see Sondra.  She is 
           appalled!

                                 SONDRA
                        I knew it!  Secure-a-tec called to 
                        say the alarm had been tripped.

                                 CARTER
                        There’s an alarm?

                                 SONDRA
                        We put it in two months ago.

           Melissa looks Hugh.  Everyone does.

                                 HUGH
                             (re: Sondra)
                        It was her idea.

                                 MELISSA
                        What other improvements have you 
                        made to our house that you haven’t 
                        been to in twenty years?
                                 SONDRA
                             (arms folded)
                        New septic system.

                                 CARTER
                             (flabbergasted)
                        Am I the only one who hasn’t been 
                        coming up here?

           Trey and Kieko look at each other.  Confess...

                                 KIEKO
                        We camped.  

                                 TREY
                        But we never came in the house.

                                 SONDRA
                        I want you all out.  Now.

                                 MELISSA
                        Us?  

                                 SONDRA
                        You can go now or later.  But this 
                        is going to be my house.

                                 MELISSA
                        This will NEVER be your house.

                                 SONDRA
                        You haven’t met my lawyer.  

                                 MELISSA
                        Fortunately, we know how to tie it 
                        up in court. Don’t we, Hugh.

                                 GARY
                        Can I attempt to be a voice of 
                        reason--

                                 HUGH
                        Shut up, Gary--

                                 MELISSA
                        Don’t tell him to shut up.  

                                 GARY
                        Dick.

                                 MELISSA
                        Gary!
                                 SONDRA
                        He is a dick!

           She pulls out her cellphone.

                                 SONDRA (cont'd)
                             (re: Carter)
                        I had an injunction on his 
                        restaurant in 12 hours. I’ll have 
                        all you out of here in six.

           She storms out the back door to the deck to make a call.

           Carter cannot believe what his peaceful idyll has become.

           Long BEAT.  No one knows what to say.  

                                 CARTER
                             (to Trey)
                        So, how’s the wedding coming?

                                 TREY
                        We’re eloping.
                             (off Carter’s reaction)
                        To Barbados.  

                                 MELISSA
                        In September. We’ll all be there.

                                 GARY
                        I probably won’t.

                                 TREY
                        Actually, we are going to invite 
                        you.

                                 HUGH
                        No you’re not.

                                 TREY
                        Shut up, Dad. We’re doing what WE 
                        want. Deal with it.

           Carter looks at Trey, impressed.  Hugh eyes Sondra on the 
           deck.

                                 HUGH
                        She really does have an 
                        unbelievable lawyer.

           Carter turns toward the deck, then FREEZES.  Panic rips 
           across his face.  Sondra is talking a million miles a minute 
           on her cellphone, finishing off a cigarette.  And like a city 
           gal, she is about to discard the butt where she pleases...  
                                 CARTER 
                        WAIT!

           She flicks it.  What follows is an unmistakable WHOOOOSH! 

                                 GARY
                        Do you smell smoke?

           Everyone looks at each other in PANIC.  Sondra comes blasting 
           through the door.

                                 SONDRA
                        The house is on fire!

                                 MELISSA
                        Someone get a bucket!

                                 HUGH
                        We don’t have a bucket.

                                 MELISSA
                        How do we not have a bucket?!?

                                 TREY
                             (rushing to the cabinet)
                        Here’s some tupperware.  

                                 CARTER
                        That’s not going to work.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - VERY LATE AT NIGHT

           The house is in ashes. Fire trucks line the perimeter. The 
           fire is out, but it’s been a long night. 

                                 FIRE CHIEF
                        Well, the fire is contained. Five 
                        minutes later, 100,000 acres of 
                        redwoods would be gone.

           A tiny muscle moves in Carter’s face.

                                 FIRE CHIEF (cont'd)
                        There’s really nothing to salvage. 
                        Except the boat house. Couple of 
                        canoes.  Who’s place is this?

           A pregnant pause.  Everyone looks at everyone else.  

                                 HUGH
                        Sondra. It’s all yours.
           He chuckles.

                                 SONDRA
                        That’s very big of you, Hugh. But I 
                        think it belongs in your family.

           She laughs back. Now they all start to laugh. In relief and 
           out of exhaustion, but also because it’s kind of funny.  The 
           Fire Chief doesn’t have a clue what’s happening.

                                 FIRE CHIEF
                             (trying to cheer them up)
                        You still got the view.

           And he moves off. Everyone stands for a beat.

                                 MELISSA
                        Funny how nature has a way of 
                        sorting these things out.

                                 CARTER
                        Circle of life.

                                 HUGH
                        I guess we’re going back to the 
                        city.

           They turn to go, but as they approach their cars, two are 
           TORCHED.  One is Hugh’s...

                                 HUGH (cont'd)
                        Not the Lexus!

           The other is Carter’s. He smiles to himself.  Guess they’ll 
           never find those gas cans.  

                                 MELISSA
                        Hugh, me, Trey and Carter will go 
                        with...

           She looks at Gary.  That’s not going to work.

                                 HUGH
                        Carter. You and Trey and Sondra 
                        will go with...

           Sondra doesn’t seem to like that idea.  Carter is about to 
           step forward and intervene, but doesn’t.  He just watches-- 
           as they all drift toward the remaining cars; Sondra and 
           Melissa arrive at the same door, Melissa opens it for her, 
           Sondra hesitates, then gets in.  It took care of itself. 

           CARTER shakes his head in amazement. Two cars. Everyone fits.  
           No one complains. One big happy family.
                                 HUGH (cont'd)
                        Carter! Get the hell in the car! 

           Carter hurries into the backseat and they pull away. As the 
           camera pulls up over the scene, we hear:

                                 DR. JUDITH (O.S.)
                        We are bound to our family in ways 
                        that we are bound to no other 
                        people on this planet.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CSPAN’S “BOOKNOTES” - TELEVISION SHOW - DAY 

           A HOST interviews Dr. Judith.  Her new bestseller-- 
           “A.C.O.D.”-- is featured prominently on the coffee table 
           between them.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I myself have been married three 
                        times. I have five children. Two of 
                        whom are currently not speaking to 
                        me.

                                 HOST
                        So do you follow your own advice?

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Oh, I don’t give advice. I’m a 
                        terrible therapist.  It’s why I 
                        write books.

                                 CARTER
                        She’s right.  

           WIDEN to reveal Carter is sitting beside her.  He is a guest 
           on the show as well.  

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        She is a terrible therapist, but 
                        she did teach me one thing.  People 
                        like me have no model to follow. 
                        Which can kind of suck, but... 
                        there’s a certain freedom in that 
                        too.       

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        I couldn’t have said it better 
                        myself.  

                                 CARTER
                        I know.  
           The host laughs.  

                                 HOST
                        The book is ACOD by Dr. Lorraine 
                        Judith.  It’s on bookshelves now.

           Cheers ring out.  Applause.  We realize we’ve been watching 
           this from--

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s a cocktail party.  People gathered to watch the show and 
           celebrate Dr. Judith’s book.  Chloe stands with Carter.

                                 CHLOE
                             (re: him on TV)
                        That sweater does make you look 
                        gay.

           People begin to disperse.  In the crowd, we find Lauren, 
           sporting a tan and a “vacation” braid.  She’s sitting on--

           THE COUCH

           --next to Michelle.  

                                 LAUREN
                        So Carter tells me you’re in the 
                        book too?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No.

                                 LAUREN
                        Oh.

           A beat.  Michelle relents.    

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m Yvette.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Really?  I thought she was black.   

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Carter is watching Dr. Judith talk to Hugh and Melissa.  
           Well, really Melissa.  Hugh is mopping up cocktail sauce with 
           a piece of bread.  Melissa notices, slaps his hand.  

           Trey comes up behind Carter.  Stands beside him.  

                                 CARTER
                        They almost look human.
                                 TREY
                        How long do you give them?

                                 CARTER
                        It’s best not to ask.

           Beat.

                                 TREY
                        Kieko’s pregnant.

           Carter turns to him, aghast.

                                 TREY (cont'd)
                        Kidding.  I think.   

           By the door, Carter sees Lauren putting her coat on.  He 
           moves toward her.

                                 CARTER 
                        You taking off?

                                 LAUREN
                        Yeah.  Been back a week and my 
                        parents are driving me nuts. I 
                        gotta start looking for an 
                        apartment. 

           Carter smiles to himself.  

                                 CARTER
                        Can we be friends?

                                 LAUREN
                        Friend-ly  
                             (a smile)
                        Michelle is nice.

                                 CARTER
                        No she isn’t.  

                                 LAUREN
                        I think she might like you.

                                 CARTER
                        Unlikely.  She’s sleeping with her 
                        much older ex-husband.

                                 LAUREN
                        Well... he better watch out then.

           They look to the couch.  Hugh is sitting down, introducing 
           himself to Michelle.  
           Lauren gives Carter a kiss on the cheek.  And leaves.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CARTER’S APARTMENT - END OF THE NIGHT

           People are just about gone.  A few linger, including...

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        A wonderful night, Carter.  Thank 
                        you for hosting this.

                                 CARTER
                        Of course.

                                 DR. JUDITH
                        Getting to know you as an adult... 
                        has been a real pleasure.

                                 CARTER
                        Thanks.  Don’t call me in twenty 
                        years.  

           They embrace.  And she leaves.  Carter turns back to the 
           apartment.  Chloe is holding dirty plates.

                                 CHLOE
                        Yes, I will help you clean up.

           They walk into--

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Chloe starts rinsing plates in the sink, looks around for 
           something.

                                 CHLOE
                        Dishwasher?

                                 CARTER
                        Nope.

                                 CHLOE
                        Funny.  I thought you had one.

           He rolls up his sleeves, grabs a dish towel and joins her by 
           the sink, drying the plates as she hands them to him.  

                                 CHLOE (cont'd)
                        Nicely thrown party.

                                 CARTER
                        I think so.
                                 CHLOE
                        Did I hear Bread coming out of your 
                        stereo?

                                 CARTER
                        It was a mix.  There may have been 
                        some Bread in there. 

           We begin a very slow PULL BACK.

                                 CHLOE 
                        They didn’t recognize me.

                                 CARTER
                        Who?

                                 CHLOE
                        Your parents.  Your mom, I 
                        understand.  But your dad? 
                        Technically, I was his daughter for 
                        a few years.  

                                 CARTER
                        I’m thinking about moving.

                                 CHLOE
                        Really?  

                                 CARTER
                        To the midwest.  Everybody always 
                        goes west.  

                                 CHLOE
                        No one goes mid-west. 

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah.  I probably won’t go 
                        anywhere.

           We’ve pulled back far enough that they are barely audible.  
           But it doesn’t matter what they’re saying.  The tableau is 
           one of peace.  Of calm.  Shit man, it looks like Goddamn 
           Norman Rockwell.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                         The End
