           FADE IN ON: INT PRISON CELL

           In a dim, gray, Spartan prison cell, a man lies on his cot. 
           It’s very early in the morning. He is awake. He is 58. His 
           name is Saul Twyman. He is thin, not yet frail. He looks at 
           the ceiling. He waits.

                                    MORNING

           In a comfortable suburban bedroom, an alarm sounds. 6:30 am. 
           A man, 33, wakes reluctantly. The man is alone in a queen 
           sized bed. This is George Twyman.

           INT
                       PRISON HALLWAY

           A burly prison guard walks with a cup of coffee. He yawns. He 
           stops outside a cell.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Alright, Saul. It’s time.

           INT
                       PRISON CELL

           Saul rises and begins to dress. Beltless prison pants. T-
           shirt.

           INT
                       SUBURBAN KITCHEN

           George waits for coffee to brew. He is sleepy. It is not 
           quite light. He watches the machine. He rubs the sleep from 
           his face.

           INT
                       PRISON HALLWAY

           Saul and the prison guard, walking side by side. It’s quiet. 
           No one awake.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        You ready for this?

                                 SAUL
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Not really.

           They walk.

                       HALLWAY OF SUBURBAN HOME

           George walks down the hall with his coffee. He sips 
           needfully. George opens a door. He enters.

           BEDROOM

           George crosses through the dark room to the window. He lifts 
           the shade.

           Two girls groan. They roll over, they bury their faces in 
           their pillows. They don’t wanna get up. They are George’s 
           daughters. Abby is 10. Jill is 8.

                                 GEORGE
                        alright, girls. let’s go.

           George  leaves the girls groaning. This is routine. The same 
           morning ritual performed the world over. A father rouses his 
           reluctant children.

           INT
                       PRISON OFFICE

           Saul stands at a Plexiglas window which resembles that of a 
           bank teller.

           A dimwit prison bureaucrat hands Saul a manila envelope. And 
           an aged pair of shoes. Black oxfords. An aged suit, shirt and 
           belt.

           INT
                       SUBURBAN KITCHEN

           George makes breakfast. Eggs, toast, juice. Father as short-
           order cook.

           INT
                       PRISON

           In a featureless room, Saul is alone. He changes out of his 
           prison clothes, and into his suit.
           His suit is 30 years old, as are all his clothes. The suit of 
           a careful, conservative, not particularly fashionable man of 
           1978. The clothes of a mid-level manager at IBM. Or of a 
           reasonably successful undertaker.

           Saul is thinner now. His pants hang loosely around his waste. 
           He tightens his belt. It doesn’t have a hole for how skinny 
           he is.

           Saul opens the manila envelope. A money clip. A pen. A 
           wedding ring.

           Saul fingers the wedding ring. He slips it on. He takes it 
           off and puts it in his pocket.

                       SUBURBAN KITCHEN

           The girls eat. George doesn’t. He drinks his coffee and 
           supervises.

           The girls chatter to each other. They are close.

           Saul in the prison yard. Upstate New York. It’s cold. A small 
           group of prisoners wait. The others are decades younger than 
           Saul. He is alone among them.

           A bus pulls up. Thick wire cross-hatches the windows.

           Saul gets on the bus.

           A ranch house in Yonkers, a Westchester Suburb. Not fancy. He 
           is not wealthy. George stands on the front porch, coffee in 
           hand. He watches the yellow school bus drive away. He goes 
           back inside.

           The sun is setting. 5 o’clock on a winter night. George comes 
           out the front door, holding two bags of groceries. He walks 
           to the car, puts the groceries into the trunk. Abby and Jill 
           follow him reluctantly, dragging their feet.

           George drives up. The girls get out. George grabs the 
           groceries from the trunk. The house is small but well-kept. A 
           front porch.

           George walks up the steps. He stops. The girls stop behind 
           him.

                        What.
           Outside the front door, an aged pair of men’s shoes. Black 
           oxfords…

           George pulls keys from his pocket. But the door is unlocked. 
           It’s open a crack. George pushes and it yields easily.

           George stops at the threshold. Abby and Jill behind him, 
           standing on the porch.

                                 GEORGE

           George changes his mind.

                        You know what? Go back to the car.

           Abby takes Jill’s hand and scurries to the car, chastened. 
           George moves quietly into the house.

                       HOUSE

           George walks warily through the living room. Some lights are 
           on. Nothing disturbed. A couple of half empty tumblers on the 
           coffee table. A bottle of whiskey.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ma?

           George moves into the kitchen. No one there. He walks quietly 
           to his mother’s sewing room. It’s dark. George turns on a 
           light. It’s empty.

           He walks back out into the hallway. At the end of the hall is 
           his mother’s bedroom. The door is closed.
           George walks down the hall. He stands outside the door. He 
           listens intently. He turns the knob. George enters.

           BEDROOM

           In his mother’s bed, Naked under the sheets: George’s mother. 
           and Saul.

           They’re startled. They’ve been caught in a tender, post-
           coital moment. They are almost 60.

           George is stunned, embarrassed. He scurries back out the 
           door. Closes it quickly behind him.

           HALLWAY

           This is a shock. Mom doesn’t date. She’s been alone for 
           years. Decades. George has no idea who this guy is, in his

                              door.)
                        It’s fine. I should have knocked.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I’m gonna go. We’ll come 
                        next week, I have the girls in the 
                        car.

           Ann opens the door. She’s in a robe. She takes George by the 
           hand and leads him into the bedroom.

           BEDROOM

           Saul sits on the edge of the bed, pants and shirt, but no 
           shoes or socks.

                                 ANN
                        George, this is Saul.

           Saul stands to shake his hand.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry to, I should have knocked 
                        — Nice to meet you.

           They shake hands.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You know what? This is a little 
                        awkward, no offense- Why doesn’t 
                        everybody get dressed, I’ll see you 
                        in the living room, Why don’t you 
                        stay for supper —

           Ann stops him.

                        George. Honey.  It’s Saul.

           George goes suddenly cold. He looks at Saul a moment. He then 
           turns and leaves the room.

           George walks quickly down the porch steps and to the car. 
           George tries to open the car door. It’s locked. He fumbles 
           for his keys. He drops them to the ground. The girls are 
           inside. Abby unlocks the door. George gets into the car. He 
           starts it, he peels out of the driveway.

                        Was she there?

                                              LATE

           George is alone at the kitchen table. The kitchen is dark and 
           quiet. George is upset. He rubs his face. This doesn’t help. 
           He stands, he goes to the refrigerator. Nothing to drink, or 
           nothing strong enough.

           Above the fridge is the liquor cabinet. George stands on a 
           chair, he opens the cabinet.

           Dusty bottles. Ancient, dried up bits of booze in the bottom. 
           George doesn’t usually drink, not really. He is unprepared 
           for a night such as this. George finds a bottle half-full of 
           clear liquid.

           He sits at the kitchen table, pours himself a glass. He 
           drinks. It’s disgusting. He drinks some more.

           George goes to the phone. He fiddles with it, unsure if he 
           should. Then he dials. He knows the number by heart.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE
                             (Sleepy.)
                        Hello?

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey.

           She knows him, recognizes his voice in a syllable.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE
                        What’s wrong.
                                 GEORGE
                        Nothing.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE
                        What time is it?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s late. Sorry.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE
                        What happened. Where’re the girls.

                                 GEORGE
                        Nothing. They’re fine. They’re 
                        here. They’re asleep.

           A BEDROOM

           On the other end of line is Maggie. She is George’s ex. She’s 
           33. She whispers into the phone. In the bed next to her, a 
           sleeping man.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What time is it? It’s 3 o’clock. 
                        shit.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry. I didn’t know it was that 
                        late.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why are you calling me?

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        How’re you doing?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m tired. How’re you doing.

                                 GEORGE
                        My father got out.

           A pause. Maggie sits up. She takes heed. The sleeping man 
           next to her rolls over.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Do you want me to come over?

                                 GEORGE
                        no, s’ok.
                                 MAGGIE
                        When. When did he.

                                 GEORGE
                        I dunno. Today. I just saw him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You saw him?

                                 GEORGE
                        At my mother’s.

           In Maggie’s bed, the sleeping man wakes.

                                 MAGGIE’S HUSBAND
                        Who’s that?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (To Husband.)
                        Nobody. Go back to sleep. It’s my 
                        sister.

           Maggie’s husband pulls a pillow over his head. Maggie walks 
           into the bathroom. She closes the door behind her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Was he supposed to get out?

                                 GEORGE
                        I dunno. I stopped keeping track. 
                        Twenty-five years, it’s not like 
                        I’m counting the days. I forgot all 
                        about him, honestly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, that’s horseshit.

           She knows him. He admits it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I guess.

           George takes a sip from his glass. He recoils.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        The fuck is this? I think I’m 
                        drinking triple sec.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Do you want me to come over?
           George does want this.

                                 GEORGE
                        I dunno. It’s late.

           A sound. George turns. Abby stands in the kitchen doorway. 
           Watching and listening. Flannel pajamas.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (Into the phone.)
                        I gotta go.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hold on.

                                 GEORGE
                        I gotta go, Maggie, Abby’s up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh. Ok. Kiss her for me.

                                 GEORGE
                        I will.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You alright?

           A pause. George doesn’t answer.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You can call me. I’ll see you 
                        Friday.

                                 GEORGE
                        ‘kay.

           George hangs up the phone.

                        Why are you calling Mom?

           A pause.

                        No reason.

                        It’s late. Too late for you to be 
                        wandering the house. Go to bed.

                        tomorrow.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who told you that?

                        We don’t hate each other.

                                 ABBY
                        What are you drinking?

           Abby lifts the bottle.

                        Isn’t this for, like, the Cosmos?

           George smiles.

                                 GEORGE
                        For cosmos. Not for the Cosmos. 
                        Cosmopolitans. How’d you know that?

                        Does this mean you love Mom still?

           A pause. George doesn’t answer the question, exactly.

                                 GEORGE
                        Your mother’s married.

                        Alright. Go. Go to bed. C’mon. 
                        Quick kiss. Get out of here.

           Abby kisses him, exits.

                        Goodnight, Daddy.

           George sits at the kitchen table. He breathes. He drinks.

                                              DAY

           A weekday morning in front of the station house in Yonkers 
           NY. (Much of Yonkers remains stubbornly shuttered and poor. 
           Westchester is one the richest places on the planet. Yonkers 
           is the exception. It’s brick buildings, low and crumbling. 
           Boarded-up stores. Somewhere between a town and a city, Like 
           a tiny Newark.)

           At the station house,  Cops descend the stairs, some in 
           uniform, Detectives in jacket and tie.

           Two detectives. One old, well past retirement age. One young. 
           The older is white. The younger Latino.

           They are Tom McCain and Henry Leyva.

                        See an old friend of mine.

           They pull out.

                       BEDROOM

           In a quiet, comfortable, ornate room, an old man sleeps. Oil 
           paintings on the walls. Lampshades with fringe. The man is  
           Michael Bondatti. An old mobster. Once feared, he now rasps 
           and wheezes, an oxygen tube beneath his nose. A blanket 
           pulled high. By the bedside, a nurse. She is a professional 
           in white garb. She reads a book.

           Another man enters the room. He’s 30. Gaunt, pale, hard. A 
           deep crease runs down his forehead, down between his eyes.

           This is James Bondatti, Michael’s son.  He’s neat. Leather 
           coat, ironed creases in his jeans, hair gel.

                                 JAMES
                             (To the nurse.)
                        Gimme a second.

           The nurse exits. James sits by his father’s bed. He wakes the 
           old man.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Pop.

                                 MICHAEL
                        James. How’s my boy.

                                 JAMES
                        Fine. I’m alright. What’s the 
                        matter?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Maybe nothing. I don’t know. I got 
                        a call this morning. I ever tell 
                        you about Saul Twyman?

                       HOTEL ROOM

           An SRO. Unpleasant. It differs from Saul’s prison cell in few 
           respects. No bars on the windows.

           Saul lies in bed. The morning light through the smudged pane.

           Saul stands. He goes to the window.  He tries to open it. 
           It’s stuck. He hits the window sash with his palm, then with 
           a shoe. He wrestles it open.

           Saul stands before the open window in the cold air. His first 
           morning in the free world in 25 years.

                        You want coffee, Tom?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Yeah, three light and sweet, Bobby.

           Leyva and McCain pick up their previous conversation.

                                 LEYVA
                        What’s his name, your old friend?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Saul Twyman.

                                 LEYVA
                        Never heard of him.

                                 MCCAIN
                        That’s ‘cause you weren’t born yet.

                                 LEYVA
                        How long was he upstate?

           The deli guy hands them the coffees and sandwiches.

                                 DELI GUY
                        That’s on me, Tom.

                        patrolman comes in here, you tell 
                        him I said so.
           Tom McCain is an honest cop. He pays the deli guy. He 
           continues the conversation with Leyva.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        He got twenty-five years. He did 
                        all of it. Parole board hated him.

                        Why?

                                 MCCAIN
                        I made sure of it. Old Saul paid 
                        every day of his debt to society.

                                 LEYVA
                        Twenty-five years. Shit. Who’d he 
                        kill?

           Coffee, tabloids, egg sandwiches.

                                 MCCAIN
                        So this is thirty years ago, I had 
                        just made detective.

                                 LEYVA
                             (off topic.)
                        Are you ever going to retire?

                                 MCCAIN
                        No. So. At that time, there was a 
                        new mayor, crime initiative, we 
                        were gonna go after Mike Bondatti.

                                 LEYVA
                        That’s ambitious.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Yeah, and this is before he got 
                        ancient and turned into a cartoon, 
                        these were reasonably serious guys. 
                        Bondatti especially. Doing all 
                        sorts of shit, none of which we 
                        could get anybody to testify to.

                                 LEYVA
                        Sounds familiar.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Right? So we’re after Bondatti. 
                        Everybody knows who he is, half the 
                        city works for him. We can’t get 
                        anything to stick. We arrest him, 
                        he’s out that afternoon. Sometimes  
                        it’s us who fucks it up, sometimes 
                        the jury is full of retards, 
                        whatever. For a variety of reasons, 
                        we can’t get a conviction.

                                 LEYVA
                             (Pointing.)
                        Is that your guy over there?

           Coming out of the hotel, a tough looking man of about 40.

                                 MCCAIN
                        No. So anyway, finally, we actually 
                        get Bondatti on something. Very 
                        firm. Eye witness, whole thing. 
                        Bondatti kills this other mobster 
                        right in front of a mailman.

                                 LEYVA
                        Postal worker.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Right in front of a postal worker, 
                        thank you. The guy is delivering 
                        the mail, standing in the lobby 
                        next to this mobster, right? Here 
                        comes Bondatti, he shoots the 
                        mobster fourteen times.

                                 LEYVA
                             (Shaking his head.)
                        What’d he, reload? These fucking 
                        people.

                                 MCCAIN
                        It’s a revolver. He reloads twice. 
                        He’s taking his time shooting this 
                        guy over and over right in front of 
                        this mailman. Doesn’t consider that 
                        the guy might actually testify.

                                 LEYVA
                        But he does.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Turns out the mailman loves cops. 
                        Always wanted to be a cop. He 
                        failed the exam, ended up 
                        delivering mail, but he’s a cop 
                        groupie, watches cop shows, reads 
                        the crime blotter every day.  So 
                        when I go to talk to him, he can’t 
                        wait to talk, can’t wait to do his 
                        civic duty — Hold on.

           McCain stops. He looks out the windshield, out across the 
           street. He is still.
           STREET

           Saul exits the hotel. He’s in his suit. He does not look 
           threatening. He’s thin. He must work to keep the wind from 
           blowing him over. Before he crosses the street, he looks both 
           ways, then both ways again. He hurries across the street, his 
           creaky joints slowing him down.

                        Tried to. Turns out the mailman has

                        up, he’s turning 7 or 8 or some

                        the kid’s party.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Saul is a bad person. Saul works 
                        for Bondatti. Saul lacks basic 
                        human feeling. The mailman goes out 
                        to buy balloons. Saul shoots the 
                        him and he dies. This makes the 
                        mailman a less than effective 
                        witness. Bondatti goes free, he 
                        continues hurting reasonably 
                        innocent people to this day.

                                 LEYVA
                        So you find Saul.

                                 MCCAIN
                        He turns himself in.

                                 LEYVA
                        No shit. Why.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Who knows. He had a pang. But we 
                        figure it’s a good sign, right?

                                 LEYVA
                        Sure.

                                 MCCAIN
                        So we give Saul a choice. Me and 
                        the DA, we say, Saul, how about 
                        this. Give us Bondatti. He 
                        obviously hired you to do this 
                        killing, you testify and you might 
                        eventually see the light of day.

                                 LEYVA
                        but Saul won’t talk.

                                 MCCAIN
                        No he won’t. So over the last 
                        decade, every time Saul is up for 
                        parole, I go up there and I testify 
                        that he’s a psychopath.

                                 LEYVA
                        That’s some serious devotion on 
                        your part, Tommy.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Thank you.
           McCain points at Saul, out on the street.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        What’s this now, Where’s he going?

           EXT 
                       STREET

           Saul stops at an unmarked door. Right off the sidewalk. A run-
           down brick building. No windows. Saul knocks.

           CAR

           Leyva watches Saul. Leyva is hugely amused. A barking laugh.

                                 LEYVA
                        That horny bastard. 

                                 MCCAIN
                        I’ll be damned.

                                 LEYVA
                        How long you think he’s been 
                        dreaming about this?

           STREET

           The door opens a crack. Saul says something to someone 
           inside. The door opens. Saul enters.

           INT
                       WHOREHOUSE

           Saul, in his suit, out of place in this dimly lit pit. It is 
           a kind of lobby. A man sits at a small desk. Some furniture, 
           peeling paint. On one of the chairs, a sleeping woman in 
           boots and a bathrobe.

           Saul approaches the desk. The man’s teeth are brown. (Saul 
           has a formality to him. An old-world dignity. He’s quiet. 
           He’s grave. I consider him to be noble.)

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        It’s nine o’clock in the goddamn 
                        morning.

                                 SAUL
                        Are you open?

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        We’re always open.
                                 SAUL
                        Is Doreen here?

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        Who?

                                 SAUL
                        A young woman named Doreen used to 
                        work here. It’s been a while. She 
                        wouldn’t be young anymore. She’s 
                        tall. A redhead.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        I dunno. Doesn’t ring a bell. We 
                        got a Debbie. She’s kind of a 
                        redhead. Go ahead up. Number 6. 
                        You’ll like her.

                                 SAUL
                        I’d like to see Doreen, if she’s 
                        still here.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        Well she’s not.

           The unclean man now addresses the formerly sleeping 
           prostitute, who opens one eye.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Why is everybody a fucking 
                        specialist now? Can a guy just come 
                        in here to get laid anymore? 
                        Everybody has a request. If I gotta 
                        deal with one more kinky dentist 
                        who has to be tied up and abused in 
                        Japanese, I fucking swear to god. 
                        It’s a whorehouse, ok pal? We sell 
                        time. You wanna buy some, that’s 
                        fine.

                                 SAUL
                        There used to be a room at the top 
                        of the stairs to the right.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        There still is. #8.

                                 SAUL
                        I want that one.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        That’s Leslie. She had a long 
                        night. She’s asleep.
           Saul is firm. He’s very serious.

                                 SAUL
                        I’d like to see the woman in room 
                        #8.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                             (Again to the prostitute.)
                        You see what I’m saying? 
                        Everybody’s a necrophiliac now. Go 
                        ahead up, buddy, it’s three 
                        hundred, you pay her first.

           Saul ascends the stairs, brown bag in hand.

           HALLWAY

           A long hall, doors on either side. Saul turns right at the 
           top of the stairs. He knocks lightly on the first door. There 
           is no answer. He opens the door quietly.

           INT
                          BEDROOM

           A woman sleeps in the bed. There is little else in the room. 
           Bare floor and walls. Except on one wall, an aged photograph.

           A soiled blind covers the only window. Saul lifts the blind, 
           bringing light to the room. (This recalls George doing the 
           same in his daughter’s room earlier.)

           The woman groans, rolls over.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hey Daddy.

           Saul stands awkwardly in the center of the room. The woman is 
           not fully dressed. She sits up to appraise Saul.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Who sent you up here.

                                 SAUL
                        The man downstairs.

                                 WOMAN
                        He didn’t tell you I was sleeping?

                                 SAUL
                        He did.
                                 WOMAN
                        Well I guess I ain’t anymore. I’m 
                        Leslie. How you doing.

                                 SAUL
                        You can go.

           A pause. She is surprised.

                                 WOMAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 SAUL
                        You can go. Go get a cup of coffee, 
                        I’ll be a minute.

           The woman regards him.

                                 WOMAN
                        I been at this a long while, I 
                        finally heard one I ain’t heard 
                        before.

                                 SAUL
                        Go get something to eat.

                                 WOMAN
                        See, I don’t know where you’re 
                        from, but it usually goes where I’m 
                        a participant. That’s most of what 
                        they pay me for.

                                 SAUL
                        You can stay if you want. Watch 
                        your eyes.

                                 WOMAN
                        Why?

           Saul opens the paper bag. He removes a hammer.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Woa. Excuse me. You got special 
                        interests, that’s a different 
                        payment. Old man and a hammer, 
                        that’s it’s own separate category.

           Saul removes the aged photograph from the wall. A rectangle 
           of discoloration is revealed. Saul takes aim. He swings the 
           hammer, claw first, into the wall. An explosion of plaster 
           dust. The woman yells. Saul swings the hammer. The hole is 
           large enough for his hand. He reaches into the hole, he feels 
           around inside the wall.
           Saul swings again. and again. He reaches into the enlarged 
           hole and removes a leather bowling bag. Dusty and dried up 
           and 25 years old.

           Saul unzips the bag. He looks inside. The woman cowers on the 
           bed, arms covering her head. A fine white dust is everywhere. 
           The woman looks at him.

           Saul removes three one hundred dollar bills from the bag. He 
           places them near the woman, gently.

                                 SAUL
                        Thank you Ma’am.

           Saul exits with the bowling bag.

           EXT
                          STREET

           Saul exits the whorehouse. He walks.

           INT. CAR

           McCain and Leyva watch him go.

                                 LEYVA
                        That was quick.

           McCain sees the dusty bowling bag.

                                 MCCAIN
                        What’s he got there.

                                 LEYVA
                        You wanna pick him up?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Not yet.

           McCain starts the car.

           STREET

           Saul boards a city bus. The bus pulls away. The cops’ sedan 
           follows discreetly. When they pull out, a parked car is 
           revealed a block behind them.  A black Mercedes.

           Behind the wheel, James Bondatti, son of the aging mobster.

           Bondatti gets out of his car, crosses the street. He enters 
           the whorehouse without knocking.
           INT
                       WHOREHOUSE LOBBY

           Bondatti crosses to the desk.

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        The old man who was here.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        Who’re you supposed to be?

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        The old man, what did he want.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        We don’t divulge client 
                        information. Even if we did —

           Bondatti grabs the manager by the back of his head. Both 
           hands. He slams the man’s head down into the desk with great 
           force. The Manager is hurt, his nose broken and gushing 
           blood.

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        What room.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        oh my god.

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        What room.

                                 WHOREHOUSE MANAGER
                        Number 8. Jesus Christ.

           Bondatti walks past him and up the stairs. The man’s face and 
           hands and shirt and desk are covered in blood.

           UNDER THE DESK

           The manager’s hand reaches for a white button. It looks like 
           a doorbell, inexpertly wired, underneath the desk.

           STAIRWAY

           James Bondatti ascends. An alarms sounds.

           HALLWAY

           In the long hallway, doors open and shut, women burst out of 
           their rooms and run. Other doors are locked and bolted.  In 
           the distance, sirens.
           Bondatti enters the hallway. He finds the door with an “8” on 
           it, scratched roughly into the paint. He kicks this door in.

           BEDROOM

           The prostitute from the previous scene stands in a corner. 
           Bondatti looks around the room. He sees the hole in the wall.

                                 BONDATTI
                        What’d he want.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who.

                                 BONDATTI
                        The old man. What did he want.

           She doesn’t answer. Bondatti advances on the woman.

                                 WOMAN
                        Get the fuck away from me.

           Bondatti closes in. Hidden behind the woman’s back, the 
           hammer. She swings it, knocking him to the floor. She runs 
           from the room.

           He lies on the floor, his mouth bloodied. He struggles to his 
           knees. He stands. The sirens are loud now, just outside. The

           Bondatti looks out the window. He kicks the glass from the 
           window. He jumps out and down and away.

           wine, glasses. This is very familiar, very family, only now

           Saul sits on the edge of the bed, a phonebook in his lap. A 
           lamp on the night table sheds a small pool of light.

           Saul runs his finger down a list of names. “Thompson.”  Down 
           past A. Thompson and Benjamin Thompson, down to “L. 
           Thompson.” There are three. Each with a different address.

           Saul dials the phone.

           Saul hangs up the phone. He sits a moment. Then he circles 
           the name and address in the phone book. He rips the page from 
           the book.

           He stands. He takes the dusty bowling bag from the table. He 
           exits.

           the bus stop. Behind Saul, a block away,  headlights come on 
           in a parked car. A black Mercedes edges out into the street. 
           James Bondatti behind the wheel.

           Saul on a city bus at night. Just him and the driver. The 
           dusty bag between his feet. Greenish light. Saul looks out 
           the window but sees only his own reflection.

           EXT 
                       SUBURBAN STREET

           Saul walks down a leafy street. A wealthy area. Outside of 
           Yonkers, a place like Bronxville. Saul is in his suit. An 
           undertaker with a bowling bag. He consults the torn page from 
           the phonebook. He stops in front of a comfortable home. 
           Warmly lit from inside. He looks through a bay window. In the 
           living room a 40 year old man plays with his kids. The man is 
           on the floor, wrestling with a swarming brood of boys and 
           girls.

           Saul on the front porch. He rings the doorbell. A friendly, 
           open woman in a sweater-set opens the door. She smiles.
                                 WOMAN
                        Yes?

           Saul says nothing. An awkward moment. He looks away, unable 
           to meet her gaze.

                        No.

           Another pause. Saul looks at his shoes.

                                 WOMAN
                        Alright. (Calling off.) Hey Larry 
                        honey? There’s somebody here. 
                        (Pause.)  Larry! (Then, to Saul.) 
                        He’s wrestling with the boys. Why 
                        don’t you come in a second, I’ll 
                        get him.

           The woman opens the door wide. After a moment, Saul enters 
           reluctantly.

           VESTIBULE

           Saul is uncomfortable in this very comfortable home. From all 
           over the house, happy family sounds. Screaming and laughing. 
           A fire crackles in the living room fireplace. The American 
           dream come true.

           Larry Thompson enters, tousled from the horseplay. A plain, 
           easy, friendly man. A good neighbor. He walks toward Saul 
           with his hand extended. They shake.
                                 LARRY
                        Larry Thompson. When was the last

                        tell you. Used to be people stopped 
                        by. What the hell am I saying. No 
                        one ever stopped by.

           Larry laughs loudly. Saul is silent. An awkward pause.

                                 LARRY
                             (To Saul.)
                        He was.

                                 SAUL
                        He was a mailman.

                                 LARRY
                        That’s right. Did you know him?

           One of Larry’s many children enters. He’s 6. He grabs his 
           father’s hand and pulls.

                                 CHILD
                        Daddy, c’mon, supper.

                                 LARRY
                        Hold on a second, Timmy. Which one 
                        are you? Billy. (Then to Saul.) Why 
                        don’t you come in, have supper with 
                        us?

                                 SAUL
                        No thank you.

                                 LARRY
                        Come on. Stay for a bite. Friend of 
                        my father’s? No shit. (Then off.) 
                        Honey?

           Larry and the child exit. Saul is alone for a moment. He 
           sighs deeply. Then he goes inside. He takes the bowling bag 
           with him.
           INT
                          DINING ROOM

           A big informal supper. Sunday night. Steaming pots out on the 
           table. A gallon of milk.  There are a lot of children. Six of 
           them, ranging in age from 10 to 1. The little one is in 
           Helen’s lap.

           It’s bedlam. Plates passed, drinks spilled, a steady din. 
           Saul, in the center, quiet as a stone. Immobile. Under his 
           chair, tucked tightly between his feet, the bowling bag.

                                 CHILD
                        Don’t you want some potatoes 
                        Mister?

           The child to Saul’s right offers a plate. Saul doesn’t 
           answer. Then the kid serves Saul. Saul is the recipient of 
           potatoes.

                                 CHILD (CONT’D)
                             (To Saul.)
                        Can you pass that to my sister, 
                        please?

           The kid engages Saul in a completely innocent way. Saul is 
           accepted into this family, without question, without 
           qualification. Saul passes the plate to the young girl on his 
           left.

           and then quiet. as if by some invisible cue, all the children 
           and parents bow their heads in prayer. They hold hands, a 
           ring around the table. Saul consents to hold the hand of the 
           children on his right and left.

                                 LARRY
                        Bless us oh Lord and these thy 
                        gifts which we are about to receive 
                        from thy bounty through Christ our 
                        Lord.

                                 ALL, EXCEPT FOR SAUL
                        Amen.

           The din resumes. They eat. Saul does not. The child notices.

                                 CHILD
                        You’re not hungry?

           Saul doesn’t answer.

                                 CHILD (CONT’D)
                        You have to eat. You won’t grow.
           Saul attempts to take a bite. He can’t swallow it. It sticks 
           in his throat. He stands suddenly, takes his bag and rushes 
           from the room.

           KITCHEN

           Saul is short of breath. He tries to calm himself. He does 
           not succeed. Saul heads for the exit. He stops.

           He places the bowling bag on the kitchen table. An obvious 
           spot, in the light. He crosses again to the door. Larry 
           Thompson enters.

                                 LARRY
                        You’re not hungry?

                                 SAUL
                        No. I’m sorry.

           Larry shrugs.

                                 LARRY
                        Nothing to be sorry about.

                                 SAUL
                        There is.

           A pause. Saul says nothing further. Saul is in agony. Larry 
           doesn’t know why. Larry is a kind man.

                                 LARRY
                        How about a drink? Don’t tell the 
                        missus, she hates it when I get 
                        into the liquor. Her father had a 
                        taste for it. I’m not him, I tell 
                        her, but she can’t hear it.

           Larry pours a couple whiskeys. He hands one to Saul. Saul 
           drinks.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        So, how long were you with the 
                        postal service?

                                 SAUL
                        What’s that?

                                 LARRY
                        You said you were a friend of my 
                        father’s, I thought….

                                 SAUL
                        I wasn’t a friend of you father’s.
                                 LARRY
                        No? I thought you said you were.

                                 SAUL
                        I didn’t know him. I’m sorry. 
                        Listen -

                                 LARRY
                        You didn’t know him?

                                 SAUL
                        No.

                                 LARRY
                        So then…. So, Excuse me, I’m 
                        confused,  who did you say you were 
                        again?

                                 SAUL
                        I’m Saul Twyman.

           A pause. Then Larry turns pale. He wobbles. He leans against 
           the counter. He would fall to the floor if the counter 
           weren’t there.

                                 LARRY
                        oh christ.

                                 SAUL
                        I understand that an apology might 
                        not -

                                 LARRY
                        I thought you were dead.

                                 SAUL
                        I would like to —

           Larry spits in his face. Saul calmly removes a handkerchief 
           from his pocket, wipes his face, and continues. He’s been 
           planning this for decades, but it doesn’t come easily.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        I would like to offer my ….I’m very 
                        sorry. I didn’t know your father. I 
                        understand that he was a good man -

                                 LARRY
                        Get out of my house.

                                 SAUL
                        I understand that he was a decent 
                        man-
                                 LARRY
                        GET OUT.

           Larry grabs Saul roughly and throws him through the swinging 
           kitchen door. Saul stumbles into the dining room, where 
           children scream.

           Saul falls across the dining room table, knocking plates and 
           food to the floor. Larry pursues Saul. Striking him, pushing 
           him. Saul covers his head, but does not fight back. Larry 
           tosses him out the front door. Larry slams the door shut.

           FRONT LAWN

           Saul sits. Breathless. His lip split, his shirt torn. Food on 
           his coat. Inside the house, Larry yells at his wife and 
           children. The children cry. Saul listens to the bedlam 
           inside.

           Saul stands. He walks back up the steps to the front door. He 
           tries again. He knocks. In response, he hears the door bolted 
           from inside.  He rings the bell. No answer.

           After a moment. Saul places the bowling bag on the welcome 
           mat. He walks off the porch, and down the street. He limps a 
           little. One of the cars he passes is a black Mercedes.

           INT 
                       DINING ROOM

           Larry and his wife sit on the floor. Larry is in shock. She 
           comforts him. Upstairs, children yell.

           A young child enters, holding the bowling bag.

                                 CHILD
                        Daddy?

           The kid pulls a fat bundle of money from inside the bag.

           INT
                       DEN - LATER

           It’s dark and quiet in the house. Larry is alone at  his 
           desk, the money spilled out in a heap among the staplers and 
           tape dispensers. Larry slumps in his chair. He stares 
           vacantly at the pile.

           A creak from the hall. Larry turns to look. He turns back. It 
           must be the kids.

           Another sound. A footstep.
                                 LARRY
                        Honey, is that you? (Pause.) Billy? 
                        Go back to bed.

           Larry begins to put the money back into the bag. And then a 
           gun at his temple. The trigger cocked. A gloved hand.

                                 A VOICE
                        Put it all in the bag. Don’t turn 
                        around. Don’t look at me.

           Larry gathers up the money, puts it into the bowling bag. He 
           moves very cautiously, the gun at his temple. The bag is 
           full.

           James Bondatti takes the bag. He backs out of the room, 
           slowly, quietly.

                                 BONDATTI
                        Don’t look at me. Thatta boy. Easy, 
                        papa bear.

           Larry sits very still. He hears the front door close. He 
           hears a car start on the street, the squealing of tires as 
           the car pulls away.

           Larry throws up into a waste basket.

                                 NIGHT

           Saul gets off a city bus. Walks down the street.

           EXT
                          ANN’S HOUSE

           Saul walks up the front steps. It’s late. He knocks quietly 
           on the door. Wanting to wake her, not wanting to wake her.

           He knocks again. After a moment Ann opens the door in her 
           nightgown. She sees his split lip. She takes his head in her 
           hands. She leads him inside. She closes the door.

           INT. ANN’S LIVING ROOM

           Saul’s lip is split, his shirt torn.

           The old man sleeps, rasping into his oxygen tube. The nurse 
           by his bedside. James Bondatti enters. He holds the bowling 
           bag. He addresses the nurse.

                                 JAMES
                        Get out.

           The nurse exits. James sits. He gently rouses the old man.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Pop.

           Michael Bondatti opens his eyes, just a little. James reaches 
           into the bag. He removes one of the bundles of bills.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        This look familiar?

           Michael examines the top-most bill. In the lower left, 
           printed on the bill by the US Mint, the date. It reads 
           “Series 1983.”

           George pulls into his parking spot at the office. He gets out 
           of the car. Cup of coffee, tabloid. George owns a beer 
           distributorship in Lower Westchester County. The parking lot 
           is full of beer trucks. A warehouse and a very modest office 
           building, much like the temporary offices at construction 
           sites.

           George enters the office building.

                          OFFICE

           The company functions in two rooms. A workroom up front (time 
           clock, big white eraser board, shabby couches, a secretary’s 
           desk, three or four other desks separated by crates piled 
           high) and George’s office in the back, with a  door.

           George enters.  Shirley is his longtime secretary. A woman in 
           her 50’s.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Look what the cat dragged in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hold my calls please Shirley.

           George walks past her and into his office, much on his mind. 
           Shirley watches him go with a look of concern.

                          GEORGE’S OFFICE

           Wood paneling. Beer crates for furniture. A desk. Stacks of 
           paper. A  picture of his daughters is the only human touch.

           George sits. He makes a call.

           MAGGIE’S KITCHEN

           George’s ex-wife and her husband having a hurried breakfast. 
           Dressed for work, eating toast standing up. The phone rings.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll get it.

                        I got it. (Into the phone.) Hello?

           GEORGE’S OFFICE

           George hangs up. Not the voice he wanted to hear. Then 
           George’s phone buzzes.

                                 GEORGE
                             (Into an intercom.)
                        I said no calls.

                                 SHIRLEY’S VOICE
                        It’s not a call, it’s some guy.

                                 GEORGE
                        No salesmen. Alright? Not today. 
                        Tell him I’m not here.

                        He says he’s here for the job.

                                 GEORGE
                        Didn’t we fill that?

                                 SHIRLEY’S VOICE
                        Nope.

                                 GEORGE
                        Shit. Just hire him, ok?

                                 SHIRLEY’S VOICE
                        You don’t wanna meet him?

                                 GEORGE
                        Can he lift a case of beer?

                                 SHIRLEY’S VOICE
                        I’m not sure.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alright, send him in, just send him 
                        in, fine.

           George hangs up the phone. His door opens. There’s Saul. In 
           his suit. He is wrinkled and thin. His lip swollen, a scrape 
           across his face.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Oh for Chrissake. What are you

                        What would you like me to call you?

           A pause. There is no answer to this question. George shuffles 
           the papers on his desk.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a lot to do. Ok? I’m busy. I

           Saul persists.

                        I saw your ad in the paper.

           A pause. Saul is stubborn. He’s calm. George is annoyed.

                        you have any felony convictions?

           Saul doesn’t answer.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)

                        you at that?

           A pause. George’s words have a double meaning. Saul hears it. 
           But he persists.

                                 SAUL
                        I’d like a chance to prove myself.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why?

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        What are you proving? That you can 
                        fill a truck? Why would I need to 
                        know that?

                                 SAUL
                        I want to work. I don’t need 
                        special treatment. I’m not asking 
                        for any favors.

                                 GEORGE
                        You are, actually. You’re asking me 
                        to hire somebody unfit. Who I know 
                        doesn’t qualify. You’re asking for 
                        a huge favor.

                                 SAUL
                        Let me work a day. Fire me this 
                        afternoon if I haven’t done my 
                        share. If I have, let me come back 
                        tomorrow.  

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

           George pretends to work. He opens a filing cabinet, closes 
           it, opens it again, slams it shut. But Saul doesn’t leave. He 
           stands in the doorway. He is unrelenting, undeterred.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        What. Please go away.

                                 SAUL
                        I need a job.

                        Jesus Christ. 
           A pause. George shakes his head. Saul is a tough old badger. 
           George takes a weight belt from his desk. He tosses it to 
           Saul.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Go see Lou on the loading 
                        dock. He’ll tell you what to do.

           After a moment, Saul exits with the belt. George watches him 
           go.

           George dials the phone. He calls Maggie. Then he hangs up 
           before it rings.

           truck. They work steadily, their breath fogging the cool air.

           and Saul. He wears a weight belt around his waist. And his 
           dress shirt and suit pants. He works hard. He is determined, 
           single minded. It is a penance.

           LATER

           Saul works. Each case is heavier than the last. He’s tired. 
           He drops a case. He picks it up. He is offered assistance by 
           one of the men. He declines.

           From the back of the warehouse, George watches his father 
           struggle.

           LATER 

           Saul works. He sweats in the cold. His shirt soaked through.

                                 LATER

           Lou, a burly man in his 30’s, pokes his head into George’s 
           office. George is at his desk.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s up, Lou.
                                 LOU
                        Not much. He hasn’t died.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is he still going?

                                 LOU
                        Oh, he’s still going. Can’t stop 
                        him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let him go, then.

                                 LOU
                        You sure about that?

                                 GEORGE
                        Man wants to work. Let him work.

           Lou thinks that’s a bad idea. Perhaps it is a cruel idea. He 
           leaves the office.

           LATER

           An exhausted Saul lifts a case. A buzzer sounds. The others 
           instantly drop their weight belts, leave their hand trucks 
           where they lie. They walk off.  But Saul doesn’t stop. Like 
           he’s in a trance.

                                 WAREHOUSE WORKER
                        Yo. That’s it. Time to go home, big 
                        man.

           Saul stops. He’s exhausted. He takes off his belt. The sweat 
           has soaked a thick ring around his waist. He sits down on a 
           box.

                                                  NIGHT

           It’s dark. The workers file out of the shop. They get into 
           their cars and drive away. Then Saul emerges from the 
           building, last and alone.

           INT
                       GEORGE’S CAR

           George sits in his warm car, the engine running. He looks out 
           the windshield at his father, who is standing alone. George 
           pulls out, leaving Saul behind.

           Saul walks through the parking lot and out to the street.
           EXT
                          BUS STOP

           Saul pulls up his collar against the cold. He looks down the 
           street, searching for the bus.

           From the other direction, the brown sedan screeching up to 
           the curb. Tom McCain rolls down the window.

                                 TOM
                        Get in the car.

                                 SAUL
                        Tom McCain. Christ. You still 
                        alive?

                                 TOM
                        Get in the car, Saul.

                                 SAUL
                        I’ll take the bus.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not asking.

           Henry Leyva opens the passenger side door. He stands, the 
           threat implicit. Saul sighs. Then he gets into the car.

           INT
                          DINER

           A booth in an unclean diner. Saul is squeezed in between the 
           wall and Leyva. McCain is on the other side.

           A weary waitress.

                                 MCCAIN
                        What are you gonna have, Saul?

                                 LEYVA
                        Treat yourself. Take a look at that 
                        menu. It’s a foot thick. They have 
                        everything.

                                 SAUL
                             (To the waitress.)
                        Do you have hot tea?

                                 WAITRESS
                        We got Earl Grey.

           Tom interrupts, patronizing.
                                 MCCAIN
                             (To the waitress.)
                        He’ll have a cup of coffee. And a 
                        cheeseburger. How do you want that 
                        done, Saul? Medium?

                                 SAUL
                        I’ll have the tea.

                                 MCCAIN
                             (To the waitress.)
                        Medium rare. Put a slice of red 
                        onion on there, if you have it. You 
                        want anything, Henry?

                                 LEYVA
                        Just the coffee is fine.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Three coffees then, and a burger 
                        for Saul.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sure.

           The waitress leaves.

                                 LEYVA
                             (To McCain, referring to 
                              Saul.)
                        You positive this is him?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Oh, it’s him.

                                 LEYVA
                        He doesn’t look like much.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Trust me, stone cold killer.

                                 LEYVA
                        I don’t see it. Maybe he’s been 
                        redeemed. Those guys upstate, they 
                        get into the bible, power of the 
                        word, youneverknow.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Are you redeemed, Saul?

           Saul stands.

                                 SAUL
                        I’m going to go.
                                 LEYVA
                        You don’t want your cheeseburger?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Stay and eat, Saul, we’ll catch up 
                        on old times.

           Leyva blocks his exit from the booth. Saul is trapped. He 
           remains calm.

                                 SAUL
                        Excuse me. I’d like to leave.

                                 MCCAIN
                             (To Saul.)
                        Go ahead. I’ll give you a couple a 
                        minutes, then I’ll send Henry out 
                        to run you over with the car.

           A pause. Then Saul sits.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        So how’ve you been. 25 years is a 
                        long time.

                                 LEYVA
                        People change.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Henry thinks people change.

                                 LEYVA
                        I’m an optimist.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Me? Not so much.

                                 LEYVA
                        Tom thinks you’re still a piece of 
                        shit.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Something my father taught me. You 
                        can take the dog out of the fight, 
                        but you can’t take the fight out of 
                        the dog.

                                 LEYVA
                        Or in this case, you can lock up a 
                        piece of shit for twenty-five years 
                        in a federal penitentiary, but when 
                        he comes out, he’s just an older 
                        piece of shit.
           The waitress returns. Sets down drinks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Coffees.

           She leaves.

                                 SAUL
                             (To McCain.)
                        What do you want?

                                 MCCAIN
                        What do I want? I’m a cop. I want 
                        to solve crimes. If a guy does 
                        something, I want that guy to be 
                        punished in an appropriate manner. 
                        Is that so much to ask?  If a guy 
                        hurts someone, I want that guy to 
                        be hurt.

                                 LEYVA
                        By the justice system, he’s talking 
                        about.

                                 MCCAIN
                        By whomever. If somebody inflicts 
                        pain, in a perfect world, that 
                        person will experience pain.

                                 LEYVA
                        Somebody shoots a postal worker for 
                        instance?

                                 MCCAIN
                        For money? If someone is hired to 
                        kill another person, Saul? Can I 
                        ask you something? What’s he gonna 
                        do with that money? Buy a house? 
                        live in it? with the money he was 
                        paid to take another person’s life? 
                        He’s gonna put his feet up on the 
                        sofa and watch TV? With another 
                        guy, who he didn’t even know, with 
                        that guy dead? You were gonna 
                        purchase a bed and lay your head 
                        down and go to sleep? Was that the 
                        idea?

           A pause.

                                 SAUL
                        You tell me when you’re finished.
                                 MCCAIN
                        I’ll do that. I’ll make sure to do 
                        that, Saul. (Beat.) Now I lost my 
                        point. dammitt.

                        Someone inflicts pain.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Yes, thank you. In an ideal world, 
                        a man who killed for profit, will 
                        never again see the light of day.

                                 LEYVA
                        It’s right there in the bible, 
                        Saul. An eye for an eye.

                                 MCCAIN
                        If we go by the good book, we shoot 
                        you dead. That’d be correct.

                             (Looking into his cup.)
                        This coffee has no flavor 
                        whatsoever.

                             (To Saul.)
                        But.  Here you are. A free man.

                                 SAUL
                        I did my time.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Yes you did. In the eyes of the 
                        state, your debt is paid.

                                 LEYVA
                        You know who the state is, Saul? 
                        Some fat judge living on a boat in 
                        Florida. The state is a Retiree. 
                        The actual person who is your 
                        redeemer? He’s playing pinochle 
                        with his cronies in Boca Raton.

                                 MCCAIN
                        He doesn’t remember you. He 
                        wouldn’t know you from Jesus.

                                 LEYVA

                        of a bitch has been thinking about 
                        you every day for the last twenty-
                        five years.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Take it as a compliment.

                                 SAUL
                        I don’t owe you anything.

                                 MCCAIN
                        That’s true. That’s probably true. 
                        Fuck me. A bitter old Irishman, if 
                        every guy I held a grudge against 
                        were to drop dead? That’s half the 
                        population of the County.

                                 LEYVA
                             (To Saul.)
                        Plus, he’s the one who locked you 
                        up, left your wife a widow, pretty 
                        much. Orphaned your young son, this 
                        guy right here.

                                 MCCAIN
                        With pleasure.

                                 LEYVA
                        You don’t owe him shit.

           The waitress places a steaming burger in front of Saul. Saul 
           will not touch the food.

                                 LEYVA (CONT’D)
                        You eat, Saul. Don’t let us keep 
                        you.

                                 SAUL
                        Lemme out of here.

           They ignore his pleas.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Michael Bondatti is still operating 
                        in Yonkers, if you can believe it. 
                        He must be a hundred and two. He’s 
                        barely breathing, he still orders 
                        the occasional beating. The guy’s 
                        on death’s door, he’s still 
                        committing crimes daily, I don’t 
                        know how they find the energy.
                                 LEYVA
                        Can I ask you a question, Saul? 
                        Personal question: What do you owe 
                        that guy?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Twenty-five years inside, not a 
                        word from old Saul. You coulda 
                        done, I dunno, twelve years? You’d 
                        still have your youth. Just flip. 
                        Tell us Bondatti hired you to kill 
                        the mailman, you’d do half the 
                        time. What do you owe him?

           A pause.

                                 LEYVA
                        Loyalty? To the biggest cocksucker 
                        on the planet?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Has he been paying you?

                                 LEYVA
                        How much money would you have to 
                        give a guy to spend his life in 
                        prison?

                                 MCCAIN
                        I hope it’s not out of honor, Saul, 
                        some fucked up thing, The guy 
                        doesn’t deserve it. He’d flip on 
                        you in an instant.

           A pause.

                                 SAUL
                        I’m not involved with this anymore.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Oh please. Don’t give me that shit. 
                        You don’t get to decide whether 
                        you’re involved. You can’t retire.

                                 LEYVA
                        Do you ever get over doing a thing 
                        like that? I’ve heard a sociopath, 
                        he’s doesn’t even feel it. He kills 
                        some guy, then he goes to pick up 
                        his dry cleaning.

                                 MCCAIN
                        That’s not Saul, though. You can 
                        see it on him.

                        Tuesday, April Nineteenth, 1983. He 
                        thinks about it every day.

           A pause. This is the truth.

                                 SAUL
                        You done yet?

                                 LEYVA
                             (To Saul.)
                        We’re gonna give you an 
                        opportunity. Consider it a gift. 
                        There’s no statute of limitations 
                        of murder.

                                 MCCAIN
                        You don’t owe Bondatti anything.

                                 LEYVA
                        We’re gonna let you put him away. 
                        Let him die behind bars, how he 
                        deserves it.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Testify. Put the whole thing to 
                        rest, Saul. Make amends. Whoever 
                        you answer to. God. Yourself. We’re 
                        gonna give you a chance to make it 
                        right.

           A pause.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        Why not, Saul. Why not end it?

           Saul takes a sip of his coffee.

                                 SAUL
                        I’ll tell you. A long time ago, 
                        Michael Bondatti and I worked out a 
                        deal. If I agree not to talk. He 
                        agrees not to have me killed. Far 
                        as I know, that deal still stands.

           Saul stands.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        Let me go.

           Leyva doesn’t move. Saul smashes his coffee cup down hard on 
           the table,  shattering it. Coffee spills, ceramic flies. The 
           diner stops dead. All eyes on Saul.
                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                             (Quietly.)
                        Let me out of here.

           The cops have little choice in this very public place. Leyva 
           stands. Saul walks out through the very quiet, very still 
           restaurant.

           EXT
                          DINER

           On the street, in his black Mercedes, James Bondatti watches. 
           Through a window in the diner, he sees Leyva and McCain. Saul 
           walks out the front door of the diner. Bondatti watches him 
           go, then looks back to the cops, the shattered mug, the 
           waitress cleaning up.

                                              NIGHT

           It’s quiet. George is back at the kitchen table, in a pool of 
           light with the Triple Sec at his arm. He messes with the 
           phone, wanting to call, resisting.

           He dials from memory.

           MAGGIE’S BEDROOM

           Maggie’s husband answers.

                                 MAGGIE’S HUSBAND
                        Hello? (Beat.) Who’s this? (Beat.) 
                        Hello.

           No response. He hangs up the phone. Maggie enters from the 
           bathroom. She’s in a robe.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who was that?

                                 MAGGIE’S HUSBAND
                        Didn’t say. No one, I guess.

           He lies down, turns his back to her. A big silent, unhearing 
           mound. She looks at him a moment.

           GEORGE’S KITCHEN

           George hangs up the phone. He stands, he walks down the hall.
           THE GIRLS’ BEDROOM

           George enters. They are asleep. He speaks to them anyway.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re at your Mom’s this weekend. 
                        You gotta pack yourselves, 
                        remember. new rule. (Beat.) and 
                        your grandfather is alive. I don’t 
                        know if you knew that, I suppose I 
                        might of mentioned it at some 
                        point. Maybe I didn’t. Gramma’s 
                        husband. We might see him around. 
                        So. (Beat.) Alright. I’ll try this 
                        again when you wake up.

           INT
                          SAUL’S HOTEL ROOM

           Saul in the bathroom, washing his clothes in the sink. He’s a 
           little beat up. The lip. The scrape across his face. A bruise 
           on his chest. Plus he’s tired. He wrings out the shirt, hangs 
           it up over the shower rod. He washes his pants. The mirror 
           over the sink confronts him. He regards himself.

           GEORGE’S BEDROOM.

           George lies in his bed alone. He gets up, walks down the 
           hall.

           THE GIRLS’ BEDROOM.

           George makes a pillow from his daughters dirty socks and 
           shirts and pants. He lies down on the floor. He tries to 
           sleep.

           A faint knock on the front door. And then another. George 
           stands.

           ENTRY HALL

           George unlocks and opens the door. Maggie is on the porch in 
           her overcoat.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Were you asleep?
                                 GEORGE
                        No. I was just reading. A book. 
                        Magazine.

           He’s lying. She knows him. She knows he’s lying.

                                 MAGGIE
                        yeah?

                                 GEORGE
                        I was on the floor. I don’t know 
                        what I was doing.

           A pause.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can I come in?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure. Yeah, sorry, come in. You 
                        want a drink or anything. I don’t 
                        know what I have...

                                 MAGGIE
                        No thanks.

           A pause. They stand there.

                                 GEORGE
                        What time is it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t know. It’s late. Two.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is everything ok?

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s fine.

           An awkward pause. She doesn’t ever visit. They’re divorced. 
           It’s late. And yet here she is.

                                 GEORGE
                             (Making conversation.)
                        How’s Bob.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s alright.

                                 GEORGE
                        How’s work.
                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s fine.

           Another pause.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you call me?

                                 GEORGE
                        I did. Sorry. I shouldn’t, I 
                        realize it’s not.... I realize 
                        that’s not part of our arrangement. 
                        I tried to talk to my Mother, that 
                        didn’t go so well…

                                 ABBY
                        Mom?

           Abby in her pajamas. Tousled with sleep. She stands in the 
           door to her room, not fully awake.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi honey.

                                 GEORGE
                        Go back to bed, Abby.

                                 ABBY
                             (To her Mother.)
                        What are you doing here?

           A pause. There is no answer available.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nothing. I came by.

                                 ABBY
                        Why?

           A pause.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t know.

                        Abby. Back to bed.

                                 ABBY
                             (To her mother.)
                        Will you be here in the morning?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.
                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (To Abby.)
                        Go to bed. I’ll see you Friday.

                                 ABBY
                        ok.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sleep tight.

           Abby goes quietly, sweetly back to bed. They are alone again. 
           Pause.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I should go.

                                 GEORGE
                        yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        ok.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’d be confusing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What would be?

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        For the girls, I mean, seeing you 
                        here. You being here. You stopping 
                        by.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah. Alright.

           Maggie goes to the door. George stops her.

                                 GEORGE
                        I miss you. I’m not sure if I’m 
                        allowed to say that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re allowed.

           A pause.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I drove here.
           Maggie intends subtext. George doesn’t get it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I figured, yeah.

           Maggie gently underlines the subtext.

                                 MAGGIE
                        My car is outside.

           She looks at him a moment. Then she leaves. After a bit, he 
           follows. He locks the front door behind him.

           INT
                          MAGGIE’S CAR

           She sits behind the wheel. George in the passenger seat. They 
           are divorced. They sit in her car in his driveway, their 
           children asleep inside the house. They don’t look at one 
           another. Then they kiss. They make love.

           INT
                          SAUL’S HOTEL ROOM
                                                  NIGHT

           Saul in bed awake. A noise outside the door. Saul sits up. 
           The knob turns. The door opens a crack. It is held up by the 
           chain lock. Saul runs into the bathroom. The door is kicked 
           open, the chain proves useless.

           James Bondatti enters.

           BATHROOM

           Saul has his damp pants halfway on, the bathroom window is 
           his intended exit. Bondatti enters. He is calm. He holds a 
           gun.

                                 BONDATTI
                        Let’s go.

           Saul does not resist. He goes.

           INT
                       BLACK MERCEDES

           The car is parked on quiet street. It’s dark. Saul is in the 
           back seat with Michael Bondatti. James sits behind the wheel. 
           The older man is dressed for this occasion, up from his 
           sickbed. He wears a pastel golf sweater.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        So good to see you, Saul. 
                        Everybody’s dying.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI (CONT'D)
                        I can’t tell you how many times 
                        I’ve sworn: I will outlive all of 
                        you. Now I have, and I don’t like 
                        it.

           Saul does not respond.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI (CONT’D)
                        Except you of course. You’re alive. 
                        So far. Congratulations.

           Bondatti reaches down near his feet. He produces Saul’s 
           bowling bag, empty. He offers it to Saul.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI (CONT’D)
                        You want this back? Do you bowl?

           Saul goes pale.

                                 SAUL
                        Where’d you get that?

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        You making reparations now? Is this 
                        the thing?

                                 SAUL
                        If you hurt him, if you touched 
                        that man-

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        What. What would you do. Call the 
                        cops?

           A pause.

                                 SAUL
                        What the hell do you want?

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        You know what you should’ve been? 
                        an undertaker. The serious nature. 
                        The suit. The family of the 
                        deceased, in my experience, they 
                        want to see everyone grieve. That 
                        woulda been a perfect job for you, 
                        Saul. Have you ever cracked a 
                        smile?

           Saul tries to open the car door. It’s locked.

                        Killing, on the other hand. Maybe 
                        this wasn’t your calling.

                        You perform exactly one job. You 
                        then turn yourself in. You confess. 
                        You spend most of your life in 
                        jail. Not so good. Maybe killing 
                        should not have been your chosen 
                        occupation.

                                 SAUL
                        It wasn’t.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        No? What were you, moonlighting?

                                 SAUL
                        Go fuck yourself.

                             (From the front seat, 
                              turning.)
                        Excuse me?

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        That’s alright, Jimmy. Saul takes 
                        offense. He’s changed. He’s a man 
                        of god, now. Or something. I don’t 
                        know what he is. A monk. What are 
                        you, Saul?

                                 SAUL
                        I’m old. As a result, I can now 
                        tell you to shove it up your ass.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        Is that true? I wonder. You don’t 
                        value your life. That’s fine. 
                        That’s your choice. But your wife 
                        and kids are still alive. That’s my 
                        choice, Saul. But they’re still in 
                        play-

                                 SAUL
                        If you come near them -

                        Excuse me. I’m talking. You 
                        interrupt me again, Jimmy’s gonna 
                        hurt you.

           Saul is quiet. He seethes.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always been a good boy. We

                        bothered you? No. But now what.

                        Now I hear that you’re talking to 
                        cops. To McCain and his monkey. You 
                        have lunch. What do you talk about?

           Saul doesn’t answer.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI (CONT’D)
                        They want you to testify against 
                        me, Saul. Tell me this isn’t true.

                                 SAUL
                        Fuck you.

           Bondatti remains calm.

                                 MICHAEL BONDATTI
                        I’m not gonna go to jail. Not 
                        because of you. Not because you 
                        have some kind of change of heart. 
                        Lemme tell you what I am gonna do. 
                        I’m gonna save the lives of your 
                        wife and son. I’m gonna get out of 
                        the car. I’m gonna have Jimmy take 
                        you someplace and I’m gonna put an 
                        end to all this nonsense.

           James unlocks his father’s door, using a control in front. 
           Michael gets out. James starts the car.

           SMASH

           The windshield explodes. A bat, wham, from outside the car. 
           The driver-side door is opened, James is dragged from the 
           car, kicking.

           OUTSIDE THE CAR

           McCain and Leyva. McCain holds a gun on Michael Bondatti. 
           Leyva drags James out onto the ground, cuffs his hands behind 
           his back. Leyva finds a pistol in Bondatti’s shoulder 
           holster.

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        I got a permit for that.

                                 LEYVA
                        Shut up.

           Saul gets out of the car. He immediately walks away.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Where’re you going?
                                 SAUL

                        I’m saving your ass, is what I’m 
                        doing.

           Saul keeps walking.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t protect you, Saul.

           Saul walks off. The cops and the Bondattis watch him go.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Just before dawn. The gray winter morning coming soon. Saul 
           walks quickly through downtown Yonkers, he’s almost running. 
           He is wary.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Saul walks. A car approaches from behind. Saul hears it 
           coming, he looks over his shoulder. He’s skittish and afraid. 
           The car passes. No one he knows. Saul walks on. Faster.

           EXT
                          GEORGE’S HOUSE

           Saul approaches his son’s house.

           He walks around to the back. He knocks on a screen door. 
           George answers. He’s sleepy. Coffee cup in hand.

                                 SAUL

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        Where.

                        I don’t know. I don’t know if I’d

                                 SAUL
                        I need to leave here. I had some 
                        ideas about coming back. None of 
                        ‘em has worked out, so… I don’t 
                        want to make anything worse.

           A pause. Saul sits on the porch rail. He’s tired. George 
           steps out of the house.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        I was thirty two years old. I had a 
                        seven year old son. You. I never 
                        was able to keep a job. I haven’t 
                        had a job for more than a month 
                        straight ever in my life. We had 
                        rent due. Grocery bills. Nothing 
                        unusual, I don’t make any excuses. 
                        Who doesn’t have bills to pay. 
                        (Beat.) So a guy I sort of knew 
                        offered me a lot of money. Thirty 
                        thousand dollars was a lot at the 
                        time.

                        You don’t have to tell me this.

                        I regretted it before I even did 
                        it. Before I did it, I was sorry. I 
                        killed someone. An innocent man. I 
                        marred my soul. As it turns out, I 
                        did something you can’t undo.

           A pause.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m deeply sorry. I know that 
                        doesn’t mean much. But in addition 
                        to everything else, I was an 
                        insufficient father. I could not 
                        have done any worse.

           A pause. And then a screech. A far off sound. The squeal of a 
           car cornering fast. Then a roar of acceleration. Saul 
           flinches. He looks over his shoulder.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go. I’m sorry to disturb

                        Thank you for your time.

           Saul gets up off the porch rail. He walks away.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hold on. Saul.

           Saul walks fast. He comes to a busy intersection. He doesn’t

           Drivers brake, honk and yell. Saul walks on.

                             (Screaming.)

                        Woa Woa Woa Tom Hold on!

           The doctor pulls out his cell phone. Leyva pulls McCain off 
           Bondatti. McCain struggles to get at him.

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                             (To McCain.)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 MCCAIN
                             (To Leyva.)
                        Let me Go!

                                 LEYVA
                        That’s enough.

           Leyva drags McCain toward the door.

                                 MCCAIN
                             (Yelling at Bondatti.)
                        You touch her, she shows up with a 
                        hair outta place, I will make it my 
                        mission, you piece of shit!

                                 JAMES BONDATTI
                        Get outta here! You fucking 
                        psychopath!

           Leyva drags his partner out the door. To this point, Michael 
           Bondatti has not moved, he’s been as still as a corpse.

           Now, Michael opens his eyes. He looks at his son.

           EXT
                       MODEST RANCH HOUSE

           A tiny house. Aluminum siding. TV antenna.

           INT
                       BEDROOM

           Inside, Abby Twyman is blindfolded. She sits on the edge of a 
           bed. She’s 10. The shades are drawn. Behind her, a nurse in  
           uniform. The same woman that tended Michael Bondatti in an 
           earlier scene.

           The nurse hands Abby a glass of water, carefully placing the 
           glass in her hands. Abby can’t see.

                                 ABBY
                             (re: the blindfold.)
                        Can I take this off?
                                 NURSE
                        No. I’m sorry.

                                 ABBY
                             (re: the water.)
                        Is this ok to drink?

                                 NURSE
                        It’s fine. It’s water.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m thirsty.

                                 NURSE
                        Just take some, I promise it’s ok.

           Abby is wary. Distrustful. Terrified.

                                 ABBY
                        Who are you?

           The nurse does not respond. Abby hands the glass back to the 
           nurse without drinking.

           The phone rings. The nurse answers. She listens, then 
           whispers.

                                 NURSE
                        No, of course she’s not alright. 
                        (Beat. She listens.) When?

           MICHAEL BONDATTI’S BEDROOM

           James Bondatti, on the other end of the line.

                                 JAMES
                             (Into the phone.)
                        Just stay there until I call you.

           Bondatti hangs up the phone. He licks the blood from his lip.

                       GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM
                                              NIGHT

           Cops litter the room. Some in hushed conversation. Ann Twyman 
           makes coffee.

           Down the hall, outside the girls’ room, George sits on the 
           floor. Maggie enters from the girls’ bedroom. She sits next 
           to George.

                                 GEORGE
                        She alright?
                                 MAGGIE
                        She’s asleep. We’ll see how long it 
                        lasts.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is she scared?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Terrified.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        You want a drink?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 GEORGE
                        You gonna try to sleep?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

           They hear the front door open and close. Murmured 
           conversation from the Living Room. Tom McCain walks toward 
           them.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Are you Mr. and Mrs. Twyman?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Close enough.

                                 MCCAIN
                        May I speak to you for a moment?

                                           NIGHT

           A Greyhound bus travels South on I-95. A police car, sirens 
           wailing, comes flying up from behind. The bus pulls over.

                       BUS

           A uniformed state trooper walks down the aisle, holding a 
           picture. He stops. He looks at the picture. He looks at Saul.

                                 TROOPER
                        You Saul Twyman?

           George, Maggie, Leyva and McCain.

                                 MCCAIN
                        I’m Detective McCain, this is my 
                        partner, Detective Leyva. We’re 
                        very sorry to hear about your 
                        daughter-

           Maggie and George are at wits end. They interrupt.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where is she?

                                 MCCAIN
                        We don’t know. We’re gonna find 
                        out.

                                 GEORGE
                        How. How are you gonna find out?

                                 LEYVA
                        We’re working on that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why haven’t they called? We can 
                        pay. We’re happy to pay whatever 
                        they want.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why haven’t they called us?

                                 MCCAIN
                        They may not want money.

           This makes Leyva uncomfortable. McCain is speaking to a 
           hunch, unsubstantiated.

                                 LEYVA
                             (Stopping him.)

                        They don’t want money? Why not? 
                        What do they want?
                                 LEYVA
                             (Breaking in.)
                        Tom. Can I talk to you privately 
                        for a second?

                                 GEORGE
                        No no no, No one’s talking to 
                        anybody. What are you saying? 
                        What’s that mean if they don’t want 
                        money?

                                 MCCAIN
                        Mr. Twyman. How much do you know 
                        about your father?

                                 GEORGE
                        My father? Why.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Do you know who Michael Bondatti 
                        is?

                                 GEORGE
                        What does my father have to do with 
                        anything?

                                 MCCAIN
                        I’m gonna be plain. Michael 
                        Bondatti wants your father dead. 
                        Your father’s gone. He left town.

                                 GEORGE
                        What are you saying. So Bondatti 
                        took my daughter?

           Maggie begins to lose it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        YOU KNOW WHO HAS HER?

                                 LEYVA
                        We don’t know anything.

                                 MAGGIE
                        YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

                                 LEYVA
                        No Ma’am, no we don’t. Please try 
                        to calm down. My partner has a 
                        theory. The best thing for us to do-

                                 GEORGE
                        You think my father caused this?
                                 LEYVA
                        Not directly, sir, no.

                                 MCCAIN
                             (Contradicting Leyva.)
                        I dunno about that. I’m not sure I 
                        would say that.

           The front door opens. A state trooper enters.

           Then Saul. George attacks him. He crosses the living room, 
           yelling.

                                 GEORGE
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE.

           Cops intervene. George is pulled away. George struggles to 
           get at his father. George is red-faced and enraged. Saul is 
           ushered outside.

           Jill wakes up. An eight year old, in pajamas, steps into the 
           tumult.

                                 JILL
                        Daddy?

           Everything stops. Maggie and George go to her. They take her 
           from the room. Quiet is restored, unnaturally.

           On the front porch, Saul sits in the cold. It’s still dark, 
           though dawn approaches.

           Tom McCain comes out of the house. He holds a steaming cup of 
           coffee. He drinks. He offers nothing to Saul.

                                 MCCAIN
                        They’re all inside waiting for the 
                        phone to ring.

           Saul says nothing.

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not gonna ring, Saul.

                                 SAUL
                        Why not?

                                 MCCAIN
                        ‘Cause they don’t want money. And 
                        what they want, they can’t exactly 
                        ask for. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MCCAIN (CONT'D)
                        They call up asking for a certain 
                        person in exchange, that’d make it 
                        fairly obvious who the kidnapper 
                        is, wouldn’t it?

           A pause. 

                                 MCCAIN (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 SAUL
                             (Quietly.)
                        yeah.

           McCain asks a sincere question.

                                 MCCAIN
                        What kind of person are you?

           A pause. Saul answers sincerely.

                                 SAUL
                        I don’t know. (Beat.) Lately, I’m 
                        somebody who gets a girl kidnapped. 
                        I stumble around. I do what I think 
                        is best.  I make it worse. (Beat.) 
                        I tried to do ‘em all a favor and 
                        disappear, even that I couldn’t 
                        accomplish.

           A pause. McCain takes a slip of paper from his pocket. He 
           writes on it. He takes out his cell phone. He offers both to 
           Saul.

                                 MCCAIN
                        I’ll tell you what. I probably 
                        shouldn’t do this. This is 
                        Bondatti’s phone number at his 
                        house. Use my phone if you want. 
                        You do what you think is right.

           Saul accepts the paper and phone.

                                 SAUL
                        Thank you.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Don’t thank me, Saul. He’s gonna 
                        kill you.

           McCain stands. He goes back inside. Saul sits a moment. The 
           sun begins to rise. Saul dials the phone.
                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        Yeah.

                                 SAUL
                        This is Saul Twyman. I’m here.

           A pause.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE.
                        Go to Teddy’s downtown. Half an 
                        hour. Go alone. I’ll call you on 
                        this number. I’ll be watching.

                                 SAUL
                        I want the girl there.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        You do your part.

                                 SAUL
                        I want to see the girl.

           The line goes dead.

           INT. MICHAEL BONDATTI’S BEDROOM

           James Bondatti hangs up the phone. He places the receiver 
           back onto the cradle on the table next to his father’s bed. 
           He exits quickly.

           INT
                       GEORGE’S BEDROOM

           George, Maggie and Jill huddle. Detective Leyva stands just 
           outside, discretely. After a moment, McCain approaches, 
           whispers something in Leyva’s ear. They exit.

           EXT
                       STREET - SUNRISE

           Saul very much alone. He walks toward town, down the center 
           of a deserted street. The houses are shuttered, the wind 
           whips. Saul walks toward his fate.

           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE

           Leyva and McCain move quickly to their car.

                                 LEYVA
                        This isn’t right, Tom.
                                 MCCAIN
                        So don’t come.

                                 LEYVA
                        I shouldn’t. I should go back in 
                        there and tell the Captain.

           A pause. They stand just outside their brown sedan.

                                 MCCAIN
                        But you wouldn’t do that.

                                 LEYVA
                        I should.

           McCain opens the door for Leyva. 

                                 MCCAIN
                        But you won’t. Get in the car 
                        please, Henry.

           Leyva gets in. Reluctantly.

           EXT. STREET 

           Saul walks on. In his right pants pocket, the rectangular 
           outline of Tom McCain’s cell phone.

           INT. MCCAIN’S CAR

           McCain behind the wheel. Leyva holds a GPS device.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Where is he?

           Leyva messes with the GPS.

                                 LEYVA
                        Hold on. It’s coming up.

           McCain snatches the device from his hands, impatiently. He 
           drives away from the curb.

           EXT ROOFTOP

           The tarred roof of a five story brick building in downtown 
           Yonkers.

           James Bondatti walks out onto the roof. He lifts a pair of 
           binoculars to his eyes. He looks down onto the street.
           INT MCCAIN’S CAR 

           McCain is driving with the GPS pinned to the wheel, looking 
           at the screen and the road simultaneously. On the GPS, a red 
           dot flashes.

                                 MCCAIN
                        I got him.

                                 LEYVA
                        Don’t get too close.

           ROOFTOP

           Bondatti scans the street with his binoculars. Then he sees 
           Saul. He scans the surrounding area. Saul is alone. Bondatti 
           removes a cell phone from his pocket.

           EXT. TEDDY’S BAR

           Saul stops on the corner. Behind him, the beaten-down bar 
           with a neon sign. Saul looks up and down the street. He 
           checks his watch.

           MCCAIN’S CAR

                                 MCCAIN
                             (Looking at the GPS.)
                        He stopped moving.

                                 LEYVA
                        Just go easy. Pull over here.

           McCain slows the car to a stop. 

                                 MCCAIN
                        He’s over there. Three blocks up.

           The car idles. Across the street, a pharmacy with a big plate 
           glass window. McCain’s car is reflected in the glass.

           EXT
                          TEDDY’S BAR

           Saul in his black suit, waiting.  A cellphone rings. Saul is 
           startled. He checks various pockets. He finds the ringing 
           phone. He answers it.

                                 SAUL
                             (Into the phone.)
                        yeah.
                                 JAMES BONDATTI’S VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        Good boy. Now get in car. I’m 
                        watching.

           The phone goes dead before Saul can respond.

           ROOFTOP

           Bondatti has his cellphone at his ear and the binoculars up 
           to his face. Bondatti hangs up the phone. He watches Saul 
           through the binoculars.

           He sees a white sedan approach Saul’s position.

                                 BONDATTI
                             (to himself.)
                        Just get in the car, Saul.

           He begins to lower the binoculars. Then he stops.

           On an adjacent street, three blocks South, reflected in the 
           pharmacy window, Tom McCain’s brown sedan. Bondatti can just 
           make out McCain behind the wheel.

                                 BONDATTI (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Bondatti hurriedly opens his cell phone and pushes a speed-
           dial number.

           INT WHITE SEDAN

           An anonymous man drives. Abby Twyman is in the back seat, 
           blindfolded. A phone rings. The anonymous man answers his 
           cell.

                                 BONDATTI’S VOICE ON THE PHONE
                             (Screaming.)
                        Don’t Stop! It’s FUCKED!

           The anonymous man steps on the gas.

           EXT. TEDDY’S BAR

           Saul watches the white sedan approach. Then suddenly, tires 
           squealing, the sedan speeds off. Through the rear window, 
           Saul sees Abby, blindfolded. 
           MCCAIN’S CAR

           The distant screech of tires on pavement.

                                 MCCAIN
                        You hear that?

                                 LEYVA
                        What.

                                 MCCAIN
                        You didn’t hear that?

                                 LEYVA
                        (Re: the GPS)
                        Is he moving?

                                 MCCAIN
                             (Looking at the GPS.)
                        No. Yes. Goddammitt.

           McCain shoves the car into gear, peels away from the curb.

           EXT. STREET

           Saul runs. He makes a futile attempt to chase the white 
           sedan. The car quickly disappears down the street and around 
           a corner. Saul runs half a block, then stops. He looks to 
           various rooftops, but sees nothing. 

           Saul is winded. After a moment, McCain’s brown sedan 
           approaches, fast. 

           They screech to a stop.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Which way?

           Saul points. McCain drives away, tires squealing. Saul is 
           left alone. He collapses onto a bus-stop bench with 
           advertising for its back. Saul looks at his shoes.

           INT. MCCAIN’S CAR - LATER

           McCain and Leyva drive up and down the streets, a hopeless 
           search. The white sedan is nowhere to be seen.

                                 LEYVA
                        He’s gone, Tom.

                                 MCCAIN
                        We’ll keep looking.
                                 LEYVA
                        You’re not gonna find him.

           McCain drives on. He’s stubborn.

                                 LEYVA (CONT’D)
                        We gotta call the captain.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Gimme a minute.

                                 LEYVA
                        I’m calling it in. We shoulda done 
                        it before.

           Leyva takes out his cell phone. He begins to dial. McCain 
           knocks the phone from his hands. It bounces off the 
           windshield.

                                 LEYVA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 MCCAIN
                        Gimme a MINUTE.

           McCain drives faster.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Saul is still sitting on the bench. The city is waking up. 
           Commuters, cars, buses. The sun is higher in the sky.

           Saul stands. As if in a trance, he steps out into the street 
           without looking.

           A loud honk and screech. A garbage truck swerves to miss him. 
           He is almost hit, almost killed. The truck goes up on two 
           wheels, it careens down the street. Saul seems not to notice.

           Saul stumbles on.

           EXT. MICHAEL BONDATTI’S HOUSE - LATER

           The brown sedan pulls up to Bondatti’s brownstone. McCain 
           jumps out. Leyva does not follow. He stands by the car, 
           watching.

           McCain kicks at the front door. It yields easily. It’s 
           unlocked. He runs inside.
           INT. MICHAEL BONDATTI’S HOUSE

           McCain searches the house in a panic. The living room is 
           empty. He runs up the stairs.

           BEDROOM

           McCain bursts through the door. The bed is unmade. There’s no 
           one there.

           EXT. MICHAEL BONDATTI’S HOUSE

           Leyva stands by the brown sedan. He’s talking on his cell 
           phone. Tom McCain emerges from the house.

                                 LEYVA
                        Yeah. Captain, it’s Henry Leyva. We 
                        fucked up.

           McCain doesn’t attempt to stop Henry. It’s too late. He sits 
           heavily on the porch step. He spits. He puts his head in his 
           hands.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Saul sits at the counter of an unremarkable diner. A waitress 
           approaches. She is matronly.

                                 WAITRESS
                        What can I get for you, hon?

           Saul is lost in thought.

                                 SAUL
                        Sorry. What?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Is there something I can get you?

           Saul looks at her. He begins to cry.

                                 WAITRESS (CONT’D)
                        How about a nice cup of coffee?

                                 SAUL
                        ...tea please.
           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - LATER

           A black sedan pulls into the driveway. A police captain gets 
           out of the car. He walks toward the house. He is followed, at 
           some distance, by two detectives.

           INT. GEORGE’S HOUSE 

           The Captain enters. He speaks to a uniformed cop.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Where’re the parents?

                                 COP
                        In there.

           The cop points to the bedroom, The Captain knocks softly on 
           the bedroom door, then enters. The Captain closes the door 
           behind him. The living room goes very quiet. A dozen cops are 
           suddenly still. No sound from the bedroom. A pause. And then 
           screaming.

           George bursts through the bedroom door.

                                 GEORGE
                        OUT. EVERYBODY OUT OF MY FUCKING 
                        HOUSE. GET OUT.

           George pushes at one of the cops, shoves him toward the door. 
           He grabs papers off the kitchen table, he throws them. He 
           throws walkie-talkies and coffee cups.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT. NOW!

           The cops stand. Some try to calm him. George won’t have it.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT OF MY GODDAMNED HOUSE.

           The Captain stands behind George.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You heard him. Everybody out. Now.

           The cops move toward the door. Then George turns on the 
           Captain.

                                 GEORGE
                        You too. Get away the hell outta 
                        here.
                                 CAPTAIN
                        Mr. Twyman -

           George grabs him. A police Captain, full uniform, 
           distinguished gray at his temples, given the bum’s rush out 
           the front door.

           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE

           The front door slams closed. The Captain and a dozen cops on 
           the front lawn. Their papers swirl about them, yellow and 
           white, whipped up by the wind.

           FADE OUT

           FADE IN ON: GEORGE’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           The house is dark and quiet. George, Maggie and Jill sit at 
           the kitchen table. No one looks at anyone. Ann brings plates 
           of food from the kitchen. She sets them down.

           A pause. No one eats. No one moves.

                                 ANN
                        It’ll get cold.

                                 JILL
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 GEORGE
                        Eat your supper.

                                 JILL
                        You eat it.

           Jill leaves the table. She goes to her room, closes the door 
           behind her.

           Then Maggie stands and leaves the table without a word. Ann 
           regards her son.

                                 ANN
                        That leaves two of us.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can’t eat it, Ma, I’m sorry.

                                 ANN
                        Don’t be. It doesn’t matter.

           A pause.
                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        They’ll find her.

                                 GEORGE
                        Will they?

                                 ANN
                        Of course.

                                 GEORGE
                        What makes you so sure?

           A pause. Ann stands to clear the plates.

                                 ANN
                             (Re: the food.)
                        I’ll wrap this up.

           George remains at the table.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        You should try to sleep.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m alright.

           A pause.

                                 ANN
                        Do you want me to stay with you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Either way.

           Ann sits next to him. She stays.

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Saul has been at the counter for hours. The diner is empty. 
           The waitress counts her tips.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You want any more tea?

                                 SAUL
                        No. Thank you.

                                 WAITRESS
                        I gotta close up.

                                 SAUL
                        Alright. I’ll be on my way.
                                 WAITRESS
                        You got anywhere to go?

           Saul thinks this over. He knows what he must do.

                                 SAUL
                        I do.

           Saul pays with all the money he has. Everything from his 
           pockets, everything from his wallet. Many crumpled bills. 

           Saul walks out. The waitress watches him go.

           INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ann is asleep on the sofa. George looks out a window into the 
           black. A knock on the front door. George opens it.

           Saul stands outside.

           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE

           On the front porch on a cold Winter night.

                                 SAUL
                        I tried, George, I’m sorry. I’m 
                        done trying. I can’t screw it up 
                        again.

           Saul opens Tom McCain’s cell phone.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        The last number there. Bondatti’s 
                        kid called me this afternoon from 
                        that number. You dial that.

           Saul hands the phone to his son.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        Is your mother here?

                                 GEORGE
                        She’s inside.

                                 SAUL
                        I’ll be inside, then. I’ll wait 
                        there for you.

           Saul goes into the house. George holds the phone in his 
           hands. Then he dials.
                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        Who’s this.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is George Twyman. Where’s my 
                        daughter.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Where is she.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE 
                        Bring me Saul.

           A pause.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear what I said?

                                 GEORGE
                        I did.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        Your daughter’s fine. You want her 
                        back? Your bring me Saul.

           A pause. Then George decides.

                                 GEORGE
                        Where.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        If I see a cop this time -

                                 GEORGE
                        There won’t be any cops.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        There better not be. I’ll kill you.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fine. That’s fine. Where do we meet 
                        you.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        There’s a parking lot behind the 
                        old A&P.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know where it is.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        There’ll be a car there. Follow it.
                                 GEORGE
                        Bring my daughter.

                                 A VOICE ON THE PHONE
                        Twenty minutes.

           The line goes dead.

           INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM

           Ann is asleep. Saul sits in a chair next to her. He watches 
           her breathe. George enters.

                                 SAUL
                             (To George.)
                        I can’t bring myself to wake her.

           A pause. George stands behind his father. They don’t look at 
           one another.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        To tell her what. To tell her: here 
                        I go again.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        I spoke to him.

                                 SAUL
                        Good.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know what he wants.

                                 SAUL
                        Yes I do.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        We could call a cop.

           Saul won’t address it. He’s made up his mind.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Saul.

                                 SAUL
                        Would you get me a winter coat 
                        please, George? If you wouldn’t 
                        mind. I’d like to borrow a coat 
                        from you.
                                 GEORGE
                        We can still call a cop.

                                 SAUL
                        It’s cold outside. I didn’t think 
                        to bring a jacket. You get to a 
                        certain age, it goes right to the 
                        bone.

           George doesn’t move. A pause. Saul turns to him.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        George. A coat. Go on now.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alright.

           George walks off. Saul is alone with his sleeping wife. He 
           wakes her. She smiles.

                        Yeah. For better or for worse.

           He brushes her hair from her face.

                        I fell asleep.

                        It’s late.

           A pause.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you to do me a favor?

                        Would you look at me how you do?

           She regards him. There is no discernible change in her.

                        How’s that.

                        I dunno. Sometimes you need to be 
                        reminded who you are.

           A pause. And then, from Saul, a rueful smile.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                         Alright. I gotta go.

           Saul stands.

                        We’re gonna go get the kid. 

           Saul turns from her. He walks to the door. She tries to stop 
           him.

                        Saul.

           He doesn’t stop. Saul exits out the front door. George comes 
           down the hall with two coats. He walks toward the exit.

           George stops. He places Tom McCain’s cell phone down on the 
           table by the door. George follows Saul outside.

           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE

           Saul stands by George’s car. George approaches. He hands his 
           father a coat. 

                                 SAUL
                        Thank you.

           Saul does not put the coat on. He gets into the car. He 
           tosses the coat into the back.

           INT. GEORGE’S CAR

           George drives. Saul sits next to him. The dim light off the 
           dashboard and otherwise darkness. Each looks ahead, lost in 
           thought. Saul is calm.
           EXT. PARKING LOT

           An unlit signs says A&P. George pulls into the lot. A green 
           SUV is the only car there. The SUV pulls out into the street. 
           George follows.

           INT. GEORGE’S CAR

           They follow the SUV down a deserted road.

                                 GEORGE
                        Will they kill you?

                                 SAUL
                        You don’t worry about that.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE
                        They will, won’t they.

                                 SAUL
                        I’m old enough.

           A pause. George drives.

                        Saul -

                                 SAUL
                        I’m sorry to involve you.

                                 GEORGE
                        We can call a cop.

                                 SAUL
                        No. We’re not gonna do that. Let’s 
                        get her home safe. No more cops.

           Saul looks at his son.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        This is what I want to do, George. 
                        It’s my choice. This is what’s 
                        right.
           The car in front of them stops. George stops behind him. A 
           quiet moment, then Saul reaches for his door handle.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        Ok. I’ll see you.

           Saul opens his door. George tries to stop him. George is in 
           despair.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t get out of the car. 

                                 SAUL
                        Now, now.

                                 GEORGE
                        Saul. Don’t get out of the car.

                                 SAUL
                        It’ll be alright.

           Saul pats him twice on the knee. Saul goes. He closes the 
           door behind him.

           Inside his silent car, George watches him walk toward the 
           SUV. Saul is lit by George’s headlights. Saul stands near the 
           SUV. He shows himself to be unarmed, lifting his jacket, 
           turning around.

           The rear door of the SUV opens. Abby stumbles out. She is 
           blindfolded. Saul removes her blindfold. He talks to her, 
           gently. George can’t hear them.

           Abby nods assent. She’s alright. Saul points toward George’s 
           car. Abby walks toward George. Saul watches her go.

           Abby opens the car door. George pulls her into the car. He 
           hugs her. She cries.

                                 ABBY
                        Daddy.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh god, Abigail.

           George kisses her hair, her face.

                                 ABBY
                        I wanna go home.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ok.
                                 ABBY
                        Take me home, please Daddy.

           Abby clings to him as George puts the car into gear. Clings 
           to him as George turns the car around. Clings to him as 
           George drives away.

           George looks into the rearview mirror. He sees Saul and the 
           SUV, receding. Saul walks around to the front of the car. He 
           stands before it, unbowed. 

           The SUV’s headlights shine brightly on him.

           The front door of the SUV opens. A man steps out. George 
           drives on. Saul recedes from view.

           FADE OUT

           FADE IN ON: CEMETARY - DAY

           Noon on a Winter day.

           An undertaker.  Suitably grave. He’s thin. He wears a rumpled 
           black suit. He helps to lower Saul’s casket into the ground.

           A small group is assembled. George and his daughters. Ann. At 
           some distance, Maggie and her husband.

           George steps forward. He gives this eulogy.

                                 GEORGE
                        Saul Twyman was my father.

           FADE TO BLACK
