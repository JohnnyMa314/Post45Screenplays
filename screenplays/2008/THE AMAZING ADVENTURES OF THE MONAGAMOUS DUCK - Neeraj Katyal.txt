           EXT. VACANT LOT (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           GRADY HERMAN (27) stands forty feet away from a graffiti-covered 
           wall. He fires a baseball towards the expanse of artwork in front 
           of him, then fields the ricochet with all the flash and flair of a 
           seasoned shortstop. He continues his back and forth with tenacity.

                                 GRADY (V.O.)
                        The single most abused, misused...I 
                        would go so far as to say perverted 
                        word in the English language -- not 
                        that I can claim to be any sort of 
                        authority on it -- but the single 
                        most abused and perverted word in 
                        the English language is the word 
                        beautiful.

           Grady ranges to his right, snares the ball, then grinds to a halt. 

                                 GRADY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s a precious word is what it 
                        really is, and therefore one that 
                        should be reserved for precious 
                        people: your mother; your daughter; 
                        a girlfriend.  And I do obviously 
                        realize that in the grand scheme of 
                        things it’s pretty much useless to 
                        have this at or near the top of 
                        your list of pet peeves, but still  
                        -- just break down the actual word: 
                        Beautiful.  Beauty-full...full-of-
                        beauty.

           He sifts through a pocket and removes his “bullet” -- a small, 
           portable device that delivers the perfect hit of cocaine.

                                 GRADY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now it may be trivial, but I kinda 
                        hesitate at describing some random 
                        girl as being beautiful, full of 
                        beauty, when I find most girls to 
                        be full of something else.

           He takes a hit.

           EXT. CITY PARK (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           Grady, at a stone chess table. White lines all around. 

           He moves a Bishop, gets up and switches seats, then debates. 

           Playing against himself, he moves a Knight.
                                 GRADY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now the only other word that 
                        approaches beautiful in terms of 
                        its overuse is the word genius.  
                        Every other conversation I have, 
                        someone’s like ‘Oh, you need to 
                        meet my friend Steven.  He’s a 
                        genius.’  It’s like ‘Listen 
                        sweetie, beautiful and genius are 
                        not words you just float around.’  

           We see the name “Diane” spelled out in lines of cocaine.

           Two COPS make their approach. Grady’s busted. 

           Unfazed, he snorts the “A”. A moment, and he rips the “N” as well.

                                 GRADY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s a difference between being 
                        brilliant and being a genius.
                        Brilliant smart people know that 
                        the capital of Burkina Faso is 
                        Ouagadougou, they know the literacy 
                        rate is twenty-seven percent, the 
                        chief natural resource is maganese, 
                        and the percentage of arable land 
                        is whatever the fuck the percentage 
                        of arable land happens to be.

           So high he’s oblivious, Grady innocently offers his straw to the 
           Cops as if to say, “Your turn.”

           Minus the “A” and the “N”, “Diane” now spells out “Die”.

           INT. PHOENIX HOUSE TREATMENT CENTER - (PRESENT) DAY

           As they sit in an office, Grady and DR. ROSEN are knee-deep in 
           conversation. The former is a hipster/jock hybrid of sorts.

                                 GRADY (CONT’D)
                        Genius is a little deeper than all  
                        that.  Coco Chanel and Cristobal 
                        Balenciaga were geniuses.  Dorothy 
                        Parker was a genius.  Fucking Greg 
                        Maddux is a genius.  But as much as 
                        it may tear at the heartstrings, 
                        some girl’s friend Steven who 
                        painted a bag lady taking a shit on 
                        the side of the FDR Drive is just 
                        not.  It takes more than that.  I 
                        mean...I realize we live in an age 
                        of diminished expectations and the 
                        lowest common denominator, but the 
                        bar is set pretty high with me.
           EXT. PHOENIX HOUSE TREATMENT CENTER - DAY

           Grady and Dr. Rosen weave their way through a vegetable garden.

                                 GRADY
                        Y’know how the little things in 
                        life are what’s really important?

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Children making rainbows with 
                        garden hoses...their fascination 
                        with bubble-wrap...sure.

                                 GRADY
                        Well the last time I remember 
                        having an identity outside of drugs 
                        I was this eighteen-year-old, 
                        swashbuckling romantic. I had all 
                        the little things totally covered. 
                        Now I feel like I’ve awakened from 
                        this long slumber, but I don’t have
                        anything basic to offer besides the
                        eternal affection sunshine shit.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Which is the icing on the cake.

                                 GRADY
                        Right.  But I’m missing the batter.

           Grady fires water straight up, then steps aside upon its re-entry.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        And?

                                 GRADY
                        And whatever, it doesn’t look like 
                        I have any sorta shot at a future.  
                        I got like seventeen dollars in the 
                        bank and a girlfriend that passed 
                        away four-and-a-half years ago...
                        And I still can’t deal with it.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 GRADY
                        Well...the thing that really sucks 
                        is that it’s seventeen dollars and 
                        the minimum I can take out from an 
                        ATM is twenty.
                                (to himself)
                        Except Citibank.  Citibank lets you 
                        take out tens.
           Grady picks up a garden hose, then alternates between the hard 
           stream and gentle spray. The fine mist results in a rainbow.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Do you have any specific ambitions?

                                 GRADY
                        Re-connect with that swash-buckling 
                        kid I used to be?  That’s short-
                        term...I guess my sophomore year I 
                        sold a manuscript to Doubleday.  
                        They never ran it, but like...

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        They never ran it.  Meaning it was
                        never officially published?

                                 GRADY
                        It was never published, no.  They
                        bought it, edited it...but then 
                        they did to it what they would
                        eventually do to my girlfriend.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Which is what?

                                 GRADY
                        They buried it in a box.

           EXT. CEMETERY (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Grady places flower petals against the glass of an 8 x 10 frame.

           INT. APARTMENT (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           A model’s flawless cheekbone. It belongs to DIANE BAKER-SIMS. 

           A makeup brush, manned by Grady, sweeps its way across her face.

                                 DIANE
                        You gave me a look.  Seriously.
                                (beat, no answer)
                        You’re getting the silent treatment 
                        for the rest of the day.  Starting
                        ...wait...wait...not yet...now.

           Grady blends away as Diane’s head remains at a tilt.

                                 DIANE (CONT’D)
                        There was a distinct inhale then a 
                        shift of your eyes towards me like 
                        some...bad subject was about to be 
                        breached.  Broached?  Breached?  
                                      (MORE)
                                      DIANE (CONT’D)
                        ...You haven’t been fucking Eastern 
                        European hookers again, have you?

                                 GRADY
                        Other women, Diane?  Hookers or 
                        otherwise?  They do not, have not, 
                        and will not...ever exist.

                                 DIANE
                        I love you very much, Mister.

                                 GRADY
                        I know you do.

                                 DIANE
                        How generous.  Magnanimous, even.

                                 GRADY
                        Well you never say I’m cute, right?  
                        I mean you never...say I’m cute.

                                 DIANE
                        That’s because I’m not attracted to 
                        you.

                                 GRADY
                        That’s true...I thought you were 
                        giving me the silent treatment, by 
                        the way.

                                 DIANE
                        ...I am.

           Grady eyes Diane. After awhile, he leans in and kisses her neck.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Sprawled on the floor, Grady cleans the toilet with a toothbrush.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        You’ll stay with your family then?

                                 GRADY
                        Well...I’m actually gonna stay with 
                        this woman I used to intern for in 
                        college.  We’re close, she’s the 
                        reason I got set up at Doubleday.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        And that’s agreeable to her?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah-no, I pretty much helped raise
                        her kids.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      GRADY (CONT'D)
                        I mean, from seventeen to twenty-
                        six I more or less spent every day 
                        with her family.  We all sorta grew 
                        up together.  She separated awhile 
                        back, so before I came in we 
                        figured it might be good for the 
                        kids and all if I were there.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        And for you.

                                 GRADY
                        And for me.
                                (beat)
                        They’re actually not in New York 
                        anymore.  They moved to California 
                        like a year ago.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Hm...Have you been involved with 
                        anyone since -- Diane is it?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        And how long has it been?

                                 GRADY
                        Four-and-a-half years.

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        That’s a long time.

                                 GRADY
                        Depends on the way you look at it.

                                 DR. ROSEN

                        Interesting.  Do you know what the
                        original quote was?

                                 GRADY
                        That’s not it?

                                 DR. ROSEN
                        Not exactly.  It is the original 
                        quote, but it’s incomplete.  The 
                        actual quote...was ‘Go West, young 
                        man, and grow up with the country.’
           INT. AIRPORT (LAX) - DAY

           Grady’s arrival in California. He rides a horizontal escalator. 

           He looks down. An errant shoelace.

           He looks back up. 

           After a moment, he bends down and wisely tucks it in his shoe.

           In front of him, the stunning and sensible CAITLIN FOUNTAIN (20’s) 
           is with a CHILD. 

           Grady notices her ridiculously expensive shoes.

                                 GRADY
                        Hey...

           Caitlin turns around.

                                 GRADY
                        I really like the fake Christian 
                        Louboutins ya got there.

                                 CAITLIN
                        ...They’re not fake.

                                 GRADY
                        Well...yeah.  It was a point of 
                        entry in starting a conversation.  

                                 CAITLIN
                        Insulting my shoes?

                                 GRADY
                        No.  Showing off the fact that I'm 
                        the only guy in a ten mile radius 
                        that knows who Christian Louboutin 
                        even is...And by saying they’re 
                        fake I not only challenge you a 
                        little, I avoid a dead end 
                        conversation.  If I just say ‘Nice 
                        Christian Louboutins,’ you’ll be 
                        like ‘Thanks,’ and that’ll be it 
                        ...Instead, we have this.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh?  And what exactly is ‘this’?

                                 GRADY
                        ‘This’...is something.
           EXT. LAX (BENCH) - DAY

           Later, Grady and Caitlin watch the Child play in front of them.

                                 CAITLIN
                        He looks more like my mom than he 
                        does my sister...Do you have kids 
                        yourself?

                                 GRADY
                        Ummm...I don’t think my lifestyle’s
                        really conducive to that.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Why, what do you do?

                                 GRADY
                        I don’t.

                                 CAITLIN
                        No, seriously.

                                 GRADY
                        No...seriously.  What about you?

                                 CAITLIN
                        English teacher.  Honors English, 
                        mind you.  I’ve made the leap.  
                        Gatsby, Catcher, Cliff’s Notes...
                        It is Cliff’s Notes, by the way, 
                        not Cliff Notes.  Most people say 
                        Cliff Notes.  But it’s Cliff’s.

           They watch the Child play in front of them.

                                 GRADY
                        I actually love kids.  I wish I 
                        could have like seven or eight.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, is that right?

                                 GRADY
                        Well I realize I’d have no say in
                        it, I mean...inevitably that’ll be 
                        the decision of whatever lesbian I 
                        end up figuring out the options 
                        with...I just want a family.

                                 CAITLIN
                        So where do you live?

                                 GRADY
                        ...In the past.
           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Grady’s old boss and mother-figure, DARLA KEILING (45), drives. 

           Window open, Darla’s elbow rests on the door, while Grady’s is 
           perched awkwardly on the half-raised glass. 

           He fiddles with the window button.

                                 GRADY
                        Hey uh...Grandma, ya wanna cut me a 
                        little slack with the child safety 
                        thing here?

           Darla ignores his request for quite awhile, then finally lowers 
           the window. Grady keeps his arm in place as the glass drops.

                                 GRADY
                        How’s Ed?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Is he still dating that nurse?

                                 DARLA
                        Massage therapist, and yes, thank 
                        you for asking.

                                 GRADY
                        Well that’s what I’m here for.

                                 DARLA
                        And where were you when it counted?  
                        What was I supposed to tell Meghan  
                        -- that you couldn’t fly out cuz 
                        you were too busy self-destructing?

                                 GRADY
                        The truth never hurts, Darla.

           She steals a glance at him, confirming something.

                                 DARLA
                        Are you wearing your seatbelt?

           As he reaches for his belt, Darla slams on the brakes. 

           Grady flies into the dash. On the recoil, he’s thrown back into 
           his seat.

           Darla grabs his ear as if he were an insolent child.

                                 DARLA
                        The truth never hurts?  The truth 
                        never hurts?  The truth always
                        hurts.  Understand that, you shit.
           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Darla pushes a cart. Grady periodically tosses items in it. 

           Darla, in turn, nonchalantly removes them. He doesn’t notice, and 
           she doesn’t care about re-shelving them in the wrong sections.

                                 DARLA
                        Sweetie, you’re not a drug addict 
                        per se.  Everyone knows that.  But 
                        we do have to address your mental 
                        issues, your gambling issues...

                                 GRADY
                        A’right.  First of all, I wouldn’t 
                        have had any gambling issues if 
                        this guy on the Indians, Russell 
                        Branyan?  If Russell knew how to 
                        make contact with any incarnation 
                        of an off-speed pitch, gambling 
                        woulda never been a problem.  Or, 
                        if fucking Jeremy Giambi figured 
                        out that it might be a good idea to 
                        maybe slide at some point in his 
                        career.  Fuckin’ Victor Conte 
                        forgot to put that one in the BALCO 
                        instruction manual.

           Shameless, Darla shelves bananas among soda, milk among pasta. 

                                 DARLA
                        I didn’t understand any of that.

                                 GRADY
                        It was for my own amusement.  I 
                        just wanted to hear myself say it.

           INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

                                 GRADY
                        Have you spoken with Aunt Liz?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Have you been dating at all?

                                 DARLA
                        Dating leads to love.  And love is 
                        an illusion created by lawyers to 
                        perpetuate another illusion called 
                        marriage that creates the reality 
                        of divorce and the illusionary need 
                        for divorce lawyers.
                                 GRADY
                        ...Did you just make that up?

           They drive in silence. Noticing his shoes on the dashboard...

                                 DARLA
                        Get your feet off the car.

           Grady complies. After a moment, he wisely clicks on his seatbelt.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Grady sits on the porch and holds a drink. A car stops out front.

           MEGHAN KEILING (8) emerges. The car leaves, she approaches.

                                 MEGHAN
                        What are you drinking?

                                 GRADY
                        I think you know exactly what I’m 
                        drinking.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Cherry 7-Up?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Can I have some?

                                 GRADY
                        Maybe I’ll save some at the end...
                        So are the rumors true?  Mommy said 
                        you got a boyfriend.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Mommy doesn’t know what she’s 
                        talking about.

                                 GRADY
                        Is he hot?

                                 MEGHAN
                                (beat, then giving in)
                        He’s cute.

                                 GRADY
                        I bet.  What’s his name?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Cary Volkman.

                                 GRADY
                        Cary Volkman.  Now...when people
                        refer to you guys, do they say
                        Meghan and Cary or Cary and Meghan?
                                 MEGHAN
                        Meghan and Cary.

                                 GRADY
                        Nice.  That’s key.  I’ve never been
                        first myself, but whatever.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Well you haven’t really dated that
                        many girls.

           Grady smiles, then takes a sip of his drink.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Don’t drink it all, you said you
                        were gonna save me some.

                                 GRADY
                        I said ‘maybe’ I would save you 
                        some.

                                 MEGHAN
                        And?

                                 GRADY
                        And, did you ever think about the
                        fact that ‘maybe’ is just a nice 
                        way of saying ‘no’?

                                 MEGHAN
                        You’re a dork, Grady.

                                 GRADY
                        I’m not a dork, you’re a dork.  
                                (beat)
                        So are you just gonna stand there 
                        or am I ever gonna get a kiss?

           Meghan closes the gap, Grady stands on his knees, and pecks on the 
           cheek morph into a hug. 

           Then, at the height of sentimentality...

                                 GRADY
                        A’right, get off.

           They let go. She kisses him, and he hands over his Cherry 7-Up.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           ANDREW KEILING (15) puts the final touches on a fish tank. 

           Andrew is mid-teen awkward, a cute little nerd boy with glasses.
                                 ANDREW
                        Scissors?

           Nurse to Doctor, Grady places scissors in Andrew’s open palm.

                                 GRADY
                        Scissors.

           Andrew snips leaves from a plant that sits on the counter. He adds 
           them to the water’s surface, already covered in lily pads.

           Andrew takes a water-filled bag and places it in the sink. 

           He opens it, then places a fiddler crab on top of a surface pad.

                                 ANDREW
                        Five bucks says Meghan and Vanessa 
                        try to name him Sebastian.

                                 GRADY
                        Why Sebastian?

                                 ANDREW
                        The Little Mermaid?

           They watch the crab do his thing.

                                 ANDREW
                        We should name him Herpes.

           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Grady opens a wooden wine box. It’s filled with keepsakes.

           He leafs through letters. Reads a few paragraphs here and there. 

           He flips through pictures. The last one is of Diane.

           Grady takes out a box of candlesticks. Examines each one closely.

           He places one aside. Grabs another and takes a pen from the box.

           Grady uses the pen to hollow out the core from the stick’s base.

           He takes the candle he set aside and digs up its base as well.

           Out fall two small bags of cocaine.

           Grady sticks one bag in the dug out space from the second stick.

           He takes the first stick, melts it with the flame of a lighter.

           He drips wax onto the second stick, forming a seal over the bag.
           That bag now back in hiding, he puts the freed one in his pocket.

           INT. DARLA’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Fresh from the shower, Darla anxiously stands in front of a scale.

           She taps it with one foot to turn it on, waits, then gets on.

           As the screen calibrates, she plays a game of Wheel of Fortune.

                                 DARLA
                        C’mon -- Big money-Big money-Big
                        money...Crap.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Grady and Meghan in the mirror. Each have green facial masques on. 

           Meghan looks adorable in a bathrobe, hair wrapped in a towel.

                                 MEGHAN
                        You lost weight.

                                 GRADY
                        I did.  I had to go on hunger 
                        strike a few times out there.

           Meghan needs further clarification.

                                 GRADY
                        It’s when you stop eating.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Why would you do that?

                                 GRADY
                        To prove a point.  Couple o’ 
                        points, really.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Well, knowing how you are, I’m sure 
                        you showed them a thing or two.

                                 GRADY
                        Um...actually, yeah -- it didn’t
                        really work out like that.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Why not?

           He takes the towel off her head and brushes out the knots.
                                 GRADY
                        They had a lotta Kryptonite there, 
                        y’know what I mean?  A lotta smart 
                        people worked there.  And plus...I 
                        think a lot of my little schemes 
                        woulda benefitted from like...I 
                        dunno, some more effort during the 
                        planning stages maybe?

           Darla enters and places linens in the closet.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Mom, my face is burning.

                                 GRADY
                        Shut up, that means it’s working.

           Darla gives Meghan a kiss on the head and leaves.

                                 MEGHAN
                        How long do you keep it on for?

                                 GRADY
                        Whenever.  As long as it takes to 
                        make me beautiful.

                                 MEGHAN
                        ...I have to be in bed by ten.

           She offers a smirk. It’s returned with a smile.

                                 MEG
                                (long beat)
                        So how come you use drugs?

                                 GRADY
                        I don’t really know.  I know that
                        people who do, who get really deep
                        in...they’re usually trying to 
                        escape from something.  And they 
                        don’t like themselves very much.

                                 MEGHAN
                        You don’t like yourself?

                                 GRADY
                        No, I do.  I love myself, actually.
                        I just...don’t really like myself.

                                 MEGHAN
                        I understand.

                                 GRADY
                        Good...good.  At least one of us 
                        does.
           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - DAY

           Early next morning. VANESSA KEILING (16) stands at the door and 
           watches Grady sleep. His covers don’t cover, they’re on the floor. 

           She enters and fixes the sheets, effectively tucking him in. 

           But after some more observing, she quietly says to herself...

                                 VANESSA
                        Fucking hate you.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Caitlin Fountain (Grady’s LAX friend) draws a heart on the board. 

           Throughout the scene, Andrew creates a first-rate pencil sketch of 
           LYNDA CARR, who sits twenty feet away.

           School bully ROB HILDRETH dumps some lunch down Andrew’s back. 

                                 CAITLIN
                        Okay.  So I think that if we
                        combine English Week with the fact
                        that Valentine’s is coming up, it’d 
                        be fun to have you guys write your 
                        own personal ads.

                                 HILDRETH
                        That’s kinda lame, isn’t it?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Hildreth, you’re kinda lame.

           Scattered laughter. Andrew cleans out the macaroni, then sketches.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        Now when we’re done, we’re gonna 
                        keep them anonymous, read them out 
                        loud, and then try and determine 
                        whose ad is whose.

                                 STUDENT #1
                        How long do they have to be?

                                 STUDENT #2
                        Same stupid question every time.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Barna, don’t be a loser.  I am
                        sensitive to the challenge that
                        presents you, but at least make an 
                        effort.
           More scattered laughter. Student #1 kicks Student #2’s desk.

                                 CAITLIN
                        And you, Wilson.  Try not to 
                        express whatever hidden feelings 
                        you have for Barna through 
                        violence.  It’s hardly an 
                        appropriate form of flirtation.

           Big laughs all around. Caitlin Fountain is a very cool teacher.

                                 LYNDA
                        Have you ever done a personal ad,
                        Ms. Fountain?

                                 CAITLIN
                                (echoing Hildreth)
                        No, they’re lame.

                                 LYNDA
                        So what are you looking for in a 
                        guy?

                                 CAITLIN
                                (beat)
                        Someone to go to garage sales with.

           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - DAY

           As he sleeps, Meghan’s eyes are right up against Grady’s. 

           A moment, and his eyelids flutter open. Their eyes stay locked in 
           on one another. He remains still as she stays right in his face.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Are you awake?

           No answer. Just the blink of an eye. Followed by another.

                                 MEGHAN
                        We have to pick up Vanessa later.
                                (beat)
                        You look really old.

           Grady palms her face like it’s a basketball and holds it there.

                                 GRADY
                                (gravel-voiced)
                        I will fucking...stab you.

                                 MEGHAN
                                (speaking through his hand)
                        Well...we have all day for that.
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Another classroom, where get our first real look at the brilliant 
           and indomitable Vanessa Keiling. The class is divided into groups, 
           with Vanessa joined by WILL HERZOG and JOCELYN AFRAME.

                                 JOCELYN
                        So Will...are you and Heather going 
                        to the Valentine Ball?

                                 WILL
                        I guess.

                                 JOCELYN
                                (to Vanessa)
                        What about you?

                                 VANESSA
                        ...I think I have a date with Tavis 
                        Smiley and some Cheese Doodles.

                                 WILL
                        I like ‘Entertainers with Bryon 
                        Allen’ more than Tavis Smiley.

                                 VANESSA
                        Nah, Byron Allen is fluff.  Tavis 
                        Smiley is more like a black Charlie 
                        Rose.  And plus...Byron Allen comes 
                        off as a bit of an Uncle Tom.

                                 JOCELYN
                        You should come; a lot of us are 
                        going stag.  Anyway.  So are we 
                        gonna be Democrats or Republicans?

                                 WILL
                        Does it matter?

                                 VANESSA
                        How does it not?

                                 WILL
                        Because the parties are a lot more 
                        similar than they are different.

                                 VANESSA
                        Whatever.

                                 WILL
                        ‘Whatever’ is one of the last lines
                        of defense for someone who’s just
                        lost an argument.  Next you’ll
                        probably resort to name-calling.
                                 VANESSA
                        ...You’re a dick.

                                 WILL
                        Jocelyn, we can be Democrats if 
                        Vanessa can gimme one example, 
                        other than stem cells and partial 
                        birth, of how Kerry and Bush had 
                        different platforms in ‘04.  Or
                        anyone -- Clinton/Dole, Rutherford 
                        B. Hayes and friggin’...Samuel 
                        Tilden...anyone. One example.

                                 VANESSA
                        I won’t justify your shit.

                                 WILL
                        You won’t...or you can’t?

                                 VANESSA
                                (beat, holding on him)
                        How ‘bout we start with Energy?  
                        Can we start with Energy?

                                 WILL
                        Energy’s great.

                                 VANESSA
                        Great.  Well...I can tell you that
                        Republicans support the funding of
                        new technologies, such as hydrogen
                        fuel cells, as well as the use of 
                        domestic sources that include 
                        drilling for oil in the ANWR.  That 
                        stands for Arctic National Wildlife 
                        Refuge.  Democrats on the other 
                        hand, wanna increase research into 
                        alternative and renewable fuels, 
                        seek independence from Middle 
                        Eastern oil reserves, and oppose
                        domestic drilling.  Immigration: 
                        Republicans favor a program that 
                        would grant a three-year renewable 
                        visa for immigrants who have jobs 
                        in the U.S. and who also pay taxes.

           Vanessa hasn’t broken her stone-faced hold on Will.

                        Don’t fuck with me, William.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Grady and Meghan pull up in front of Andrew and Vanessa’s school. 

           After he puts the car in park, Grady sorts through CD’s.

                                 GRADY
                        Whaddaya wanna listen to?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Metallica.  Enter Sandman.

                                 GRADY
                        Meghan, Enter Sandman might be the 
                        most played-out shit I can think 
                        of.

                                 MEGHAN
                        What about your hair?

           Grady stares at her forever, not batting an eye. Still staring...

                                 GRADY
                        Do you listen to those Prince tapes
                        I sent you?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Vanessa does.  Mommy says I’m not 
                        old enough for Prince.

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah, well Mommy’s also oblivious 
                        to the fact that kids your age 
                        these days are partial to anonymous 
                        oral sex in movie theaters.
                                 MEGHAN
                        What?

                                 GRADY
                        Kids your age -- maybe a little 
                        older I guess -- they’re having 
                        anonymous oral at the movies.

           After a moment, Meghan delivers a routine, non-comprehending...

                                 MEGHAN
                        Okay.

           Grady exits, puts on sunglasses, then rests his arms on the door.

                                 GRADY
                        Look at me.  Don’t go anywhere.

                                 MEGHAN
                        I won’t.

                                 GRADY
                        Seriously...don’t go anywhere.

                                 MEGHAN
                        I don’t know how to drive.

                                 GRADY
                        I know, that’s what I’m afraid of.
                        Neither did your sister when she 
                        was your age.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Grady walks through the school. Lockers and linoleum everywhere.

           Ms. Caitlin Fountain will cross his path in about thirty feet. 

           Grady is looking down, so Caitlin feels safe to check him out. 

           She then looks down, and he, in turn, gives her the once over.

           They pass, averting one another’s eyes. 

           After ten feet, she looks over her shoulder, then turns back. 

           Five more feet, and Grady does the same. 

           Ten more, and Caitlin does an about-face.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Excuse me, sir?  Can I help you 
                        with something?
                                 GRADY
                        No, but uh...thanks for asking.

           With a slow stride, Caitlin bridges the gap.  No recognition.

                                 CAITLIN
                        That’s not what I meant.

                                 GRADY
                        You don’t mean what you say?

                                 CAITLIN
                        That’s...not it.

                                 GRADY
                        You don’t say what you mean.

                                 CAITLIN
                                (beat, not amused)
                        What do you need?

                                 GRADY
                        Well...I’m looking for a girl.  
                        Very intelligent, very pretty.  A 
                        little standoffish, but the 
                        standoffish-ness is only a function 
                        of her intelligence, so ya can’t 
                        really fault her for that.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Does this girl have a name?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno.  Does she?

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Meghan listens to ear-splitting death metal.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Vanessa, alone in the gym. She fires a lacrosse ball against a 
           wall, catches it with her stick -- a chip off the old Grady block. 

           She spots him, and he slowly approaches. She ignores him.

                                 GRADY
                        So I heard you were mad at
                        me.  I mean obviously, right?

                                 VANESSA
                        I’m not mad at you.
                                 GRADY
                        You’re not?

                                 VANESSA
                        I was.  At one point I was.  But 
                        now I figure I should just accept 
                        you for what you are.

                                 GRADY
                        What does that mean?

                                 VANESSA
                        I’m not sure.  I think some people 
                        in life are meant to fall by the 
                        wayside, y’know?  Certain people 
                        are meant to fall off the path and 
                        serve as cautionary tales for the 
                        rest of us.  Sign posts on the way.

                                 GRADY
                        On the way to where?

                                 VANESSA
                        Happiness.

           Vanessa takes a moment to finish up, then turns to face Grady.

                                 VANESSA
                        Who were your heroes growing up?  
                        Darryl Strawberry and Dwight 
                        Gooden?  Right?  Cuz it occurred to 
                        me that like...both of them had New 
                        York in the palm of their hands at 
                        a really young age.  Just like you 
                        did.  And both of them had their 
                        demons.  Just like you did.  And 
                        y’know what they did with the whole 
                        world in the palm of their hands?  
                        Y’know what they said?
                                (beat, holding out her palm)
                        Here.  Take this.  I don’t want it.  
                        ...Y’know what the problem with 
                        having heroes is, Grady?  They have 
                        a nasty habit of disappointing us 
                        in the end.

                        Vanessa, I am right now in the 
                        process of taking it in the ass 
                        from every angle that I can 
                        possibly conceive of.  Now I know 
                        that’s not the point, but --
                                 VANESSA
                        -- Well boo-hoo you fucking tampon!
                        And you’re right, it’s not the 
                        point.  The point is that people 
                        care about you.  I had something 
                        invested in you.

                                 GRADY
                        Well there’s --

                                 VANESSA
                        -- I’m speaking...I had shit 
                        invested in you.  I’m an extension
                        of you.  Not by blood, maybe, but 
                        something more important than that.

                                 GRADY
                        What’s more important than blood?

                                 VANESSA
                                (beat)
                        Love...What would Diane have
                        thought of all this?  You were --

                                 GRADY
                        -- Y’know what?  I fucked up, I 
                        know I fucked up, and no one knows 
                        I fucked up more than I know I 
                        fucked up.  But a part of Diane 
                        woulda found it borderline romantic
                        that I couldn’t handle life without 
                        her.  So don’t gimme some clichéd 
                        bullshit about how when she died, a 
                        part of me gave up and died, too.  

                                 VANESSA
                        I wasn’t suggesting that at all.

                                 GRADY
                        Then what are you suggesting?

                                 VANESSA
                        ...I think she’s better off dead 
                        than she ever was with you.

           EXT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Grady, in front of the vanity. He holds a toothbrush and paste in 
           one hand. In the other, he fingers his small bag of cocaine. 

           He spreads a cylinder of paste along the length of the bristles. 

           Carefully opens the bag. 
           Dusts the surface of the paste with a healthy amount of cocaine.

           Grady brushes his teeth. Normally, at first, but as his gums grow 
           numb, his strokes become forceful. Furious. Violent.

           He spits, and the spit has been colored by blood. 

           He pauses to look at it. Unfazed, he continues to brush.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Grady looks at the sky. Andrew joins him.

                                 ANDREW
                        What are you up to?

                                 GRADY
                        Just wondering how I got here.

                                 ANDREW
                        You and me both.  I mean what can 
                        you say about a place where the sun 
                        shines three-hundred sixty-five 
                        days a year yet there’s a tanning 
                        salon on every corner?

                                 GRADY
                        That’s funny.

                                 ANDREW
                        It is funny.  It was a good line I 
                        read in an otherwise shitty book.

                        My shit doesn’t translate out here.  
                        And compared to your average New 
                        York girl, anything else is like a 
                        step down.

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah, well it’s New York.  Even the 
                        ugly girls are hot.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think I might wanna go back and 
                        live with Dad.  I haven’t gone out 
                        like a single weekend night so far.

           Andrew walks a few paces towards the house, then turns around.
                                 ANDREW
                        I wanna show you something.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Andrew and Grady descend the staircase and find themselves in a

                        Andrew, I can’t believe you don’t 
                        have girls crawling all over you.

                                 ANDREW
                        There is this one girl.  Lynda 
                        Carr.  I’ve never talked to her, 
                        but we got this assignment to write 
                        personal ads.  I wanna like...I 
                        dunno, show her that we share the 
                        same airspace or what have you.

                                 GRADY
                        That’s a pretty cool assignment.

                                 ANDREW
                        Well it’s English week.  We did a 
                        Social Studies week where we do war 
                        re-enactments, Art week’s coming up 
                        -- I’m submitting for that -- but 
                        now we’re in English week.

                                 GRADY
                        ...That’s actually kinda lame.

                                 ANDREW
                                (right on his heels)
                        Oh, it’s totally lame.  

           Grady wanders around until he comes to a painting of he and Diane.

           EXT. CEMETERY (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Again, Grady kneels in front of a headstone. He still works the 
           picture frame, placing petals face down against the glass square.

           INT. BATHROOM (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Grady pulls a messy tangle of hair from the drain. 

           Diane appears in the doorway, her face devoid of color.
                                 GRADY
                        Y’know what commitment is?  It’s 
                        finding yourself on your hands and 
                        knees, pulling your girlfriend’s 
                        grease-coated hair out of a drain.

                                 DIANE
                        Aunt Liz called.

           A moment. Diane then places a vial of cocaine on the vanity.

                                 DIANE
                        I found it in the dog’s mouth
                        ...Grady, I can’t stop you from 
                        going down whatever path it is 
                        you’re going down.  But I’d prefer 
                        that you not take Marcie with you.
                                (beat)
                        Why do you lie to me?

                                 GRADY
                        ...Because I care about you.

           Diane walks out, leaving the evidence. 

           Grady gets up, examines the bag, then tosses it in the toilet. 

           He stares at it, then flushes the handle and watches the bag spin. 

           But quick as lightning, he plunges his arm into the bowl to 
           retrieve his one, true love.

                        Mr. Herman, it’s Kerianne Watson.

                        Oh yeah?  And if I don’t?

                        The game begins in the spring, when

                        Then, just as the chill rains come, 
                        it stops and leaves you to face the 
                        fall alone.  You count on it, rely 
                        on it to buffer the passage of 
                        time, but just when the days are 
                        all twilight, when you need it 
                        most, it stops.  Today, a Sunday of 
                        rain and broken branches and leaf-
                        clogged drains and slick streets, 
                        it stopped, and summer was gone.  
                        Of course, there are those who were 
                        born with the wisdom to know that 
                        nothing lasts.  I am a simpler man, 
                        tied to simple patterns and cycles.  
                        I need to think that something 
                        lasts forever, and it might as well 
                        be the state of being that is a 
                        game.  It might as well be that, on

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The Caitlin/Andrew/Lynda group from yesterday. Andrew works on his 
           latest sketch of Lynda.

                        Who’s next?  Lynda?

           Lynda approaches the bench. Andrew’s interest is piqued. 

           Lynda grabs an essay, then heads to the front of the room.

           As Lynda reads what will predictably turn out to be Andrew’s ad, 
           his pencil comes to a sudden stop. He then writes c-r-a-p-s-h-i-t-
           m-o-t-h-e-r-f-u-c-k-e-r-c-r-a-p-s-h-i-t-m-o-t over and over again.

                        Um...okay.  The expectations I have
                        for women are not often met, as the
                        majority who express their interest
                        are either exceptionally brilliant
                        and not particularly attractive, or
                        exceptionally attractive and none
                        too bright.  The precious few who
                        toe the median on both qualities,
                        and do in fact, have slight-to-
                        moderate crushes on me, are
                        invariably matriculated at Spence 
                        or Chapin.  Or, as is equally the 
                        case, have children that are.

                        attorneys and standard-issue wives

                        Over my left shoulder, a lone

                        on a sheet of brownies as a third 
                        divides it with a plastic fork.  Of 
                        the pair, one of them is gazing at 
                        me with a helpless, hopeless 
                        expression of both resignation and 
                        want.  Slowly, a moment passes, and 
                        she abruptly turns away, realizing 
                        that I have caught her.

                        Dear Grady...I could sit here for 
                        days and never know exactly what I 
                        should say.  And that’s probably 
                        because I’ll never know exactly 
                        what I feel.  Still, I wanted to 
                        leave you genuine, heartfelt words, 
                        forever lasting. And it’s tough.  
                        Not because of our feelings for one 
                        another, but because of all the 
                        billions of grayish shades that 
                        have been penciled into our hearts 
                        and minds over the last ten months.

           Vanessa’s next words gradually fade away, as the conclusion of her 
           presentation/Diane’s yearbook entry to Grady will continue later.

                        ironic.  Baltic and Mediterranean 
                        are like the low-income housing 
                        projects of Monopoly.  It’s funny.

                        once again...Marvin Gardens.

           Vanessa, a slight smile on her face. The girls don’t notice. 

           Will does. After a moment, he and Vanessa make eye contact. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Darla and Andrew sit across from the school principal, BURT EHMAN.

                                 DARLA
                        Where did he plagiarize from?
                                (to Andrew)
                        Where did you plagiarize from?

                                 BURT
                        It from a magazine called Granta.  
                        It’s a prominent literary journal.

                                 DARLA
                        I know what Granta is, thank you.

                                 BURT
                        Right.  Well the thing is, aside 
                        from Ms. Fountain being able to 
                        tell that the overall quality 
                        wasn’t indicative of a tenth 
                        grader’s abilities, she also 
                        happens to have a certain fondness 
                        for the short story in question. 
                                (beat)
                        I guess you could say it was fate.
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Andrew exits the office. After a bit, he crosses paths with Lynda.

                                 LYNDA
                        Hey, I really liked your thing.

                                 ANDREW
                        Thanks.  You and Ms. Fountain both, 
                        apparently.

                                 LYNDA
                        Walk with me.  I actually read the 
                        Facebook pages of older girls all 
                        the time.  I like to see how I 
                        stack up.

                                 ANDREW
                        Really?  I read older girls’ too, 
                        but mainly to see what’ll be coming 
                        down the pipeline in a few years.

                                 LYNDA
                        Well if you’ve read one, you’ve 
                        read ‘em all: ‘I’ve traveled like 
                        ...all over, but my dream trip is 
                        an African safari, and I’d love to 
                        move to Bangkok for a few years.’

                                 ANDREW
                        I know, right?  ‘Oh wow, you went 
                        to Bangkok?  Congratulations, you 
                        bought an airline ticket.  It’s not 
                        like you discovered the place while 
                        sailing the spice routes for the 
                        Dutch East India company.’

                                 LYNDA
                        That’s funny.  The best are the 
                        girls who say ‘I like to have fun.’  
                        It’s sorta like saying ‘I see 
                        things with my eyes.’

           Andrew spots Rob Hildreth, the macaroni salad bully, and stops.

                                 ANDREW
                        Lynda, I gotta go this way.  Maybe 
                        I’ll see ya later.

           He takes off. Lynda watches him, then turns to look at Rob.
           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Darla, about to wrap things up.

                                 DARLA
                        My youngest has been out awhile.  
                        She’ll be back soon but I don’t 
                        want her falling behind, so I was 
                        hoping you could recommend someone. 

                                 BURT
                        Well most of our faculty does home 
                        tutoring, so on your way out -- 

                                 DARLA
                        -- Wait...you said he plagiarized 
                        the essay from Granta?

           INT. DARLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Darla tears Grady a new one.

                                 DARLA
                        Now did he copy it himself or did
                        you encourage him to use it?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Listening in on the other side, Vanessa presses her ear to the 
           door, while Meghan enlists the aide of a tall drinking glass.

                                 GRADY
                        Darla, Granta’s circulation is like 
                        fifty thousand, and if you Google 
                        either me or the story, nothing 
                        comes up.  We didn’t think she’d 
                        know it.  

                                 DARLA
                        So if you cheated and got away with
                        it, it woulda been alright?

           Grady makes a subtle gesture with his face and eyes.

                                 DARLA
                        It would not have been alright you 
                        fucking dickhead!

           Darla calmly walks backwards towards the door. Once there (still 
           facing Grady), she kicks it hard with the bottom of her foot. 
           On the other side, Vanessa and Meghan go reeling.

                                 DARLA
                        Do you realize the consequences of 
                        this for him?  I mean goddammit!

                                 GRADY
                        ...You’re upset.

                                 DARLA
                        Oh, am I?  Well I’m glad you 
                        noticed.  I’m glad that surfaced on 
                        your little NORAD radar screen, cuz 
                        I’ve been walking around all day 
                        under the distinct impression that 
                        you were an asshole!

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Grady in the tub, lots of rubber ducks. Andrew sits on the edge.

                                 ANDREW
                        She stopped me after I met with the 
                        principal and we like...talked.  It 
                        was awesome.  She’s like Medusa: I 
                        don’t wanna look her in the eye cuz 
                        I’m scared I’ll turn to stone...Oh, 
                        hey -- I told my teacher that I 
                        didn’t just steal the story and 
                        that I know the author really well.  
                        She said to give you this.

           He fishes out a piece of paper.

                                 GRADY
                        What is it?

                                 ANDREW
                        I dunno.  An act of war, I think.

           Grady does a thorough job of drying his hands on Andrew’s shirt. 

           He unfolds the note, then reads. A moment.

                                 GRADY
                        She thinks she’s quite clever,
                        doesn’t she?

           EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

           The next day, after school. Will sits and fumbles with a guitar. 

           In full lacrosse attire, Vanessa approaches with her stick.
                                 VANESSA
                        What are you playing?

                                 WILL
                        The Indigo Girls.

                                 VANESSA
                        You like The Indigo Girls?

                                 WILL
                        I like a lot of things.

                                 VANESSA
                        You like baseball.

                                 WILL
                        Why, do you?

                                 VANESSA
                        Love it.  The Green Fields of the 
                        Mind is a classic.  Bart Giamatti 
                        wrote that when he was at Yale.

                                 WILL
                        Really?  Jacqueline’s was the best, 
                        though.  That girl is crazy smart.

                                 VANESSA
                        Plenty of girls are smart, William.

                                 WILL
                        Not the ones I know.

                                 VANESSA
                        Whatever.  Guys are mean, ignorant, 
                        and stupid.  And then they go bald.

                                 WILL
                        Not all guys are like that.  Only 
                        the ones who you notice are, which 
                        says a whole lot more about you 
                        than it does about them.

           Vanessa holds on him a bit, then walks away.

                                 WILL
                        Hey...

           She does an about-face. Then...

                                 WILL
                        Call me Will.

           Again, Vanessa turns and walks away. Will watches.
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Caitlin grades papers. Andrew appears.

                                 ANDREW
                        I just wanted to apologize again.

                                 CAITLIN
                        It’s fine Keiling, really.  I’m 
                        just glad you got caught.

                                 ANDREW
                        Um...so I gave my friend that note.

                                 CAITLIN
                        So soon?

           He hands over an envelope.

                                 ANDREW
                        Well he lives with us.

                                 CAITLIN
                        The author does?

           She tries to open the envelope, but her finger gets caught.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Is this a...wax seal?

                                 ANDREW
                        He’s kinda different.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What is he, the Duke of Windsor?

                                 ANDREW
                        No.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Is he an Earl?

           Andrew shakes his head.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Is he a Count?

                                 ANDREW
                        No, he’s just...different.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I’ll say.  Freak.

           Caitlin reads the note and puts it back in the envelope. 
           She looks at Andrew for a while, then echoes Grady’s response:

                                 CAITLIN
                        He thinks he’s quite clever... 
                        doesn’t he?  Anyway, go home; I 
                        gotta run, too.

                                 ANDREW
                        Hot date?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Nope.  Tutoring session.  Tutoring, 
                        tutoring, tutoring.  Tu-tor-ing.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Grady and Andrew near the house. They arrive, and find Caitlin’s 
           car blocking a large art installation of sorts.

                                 ANDREW
                        So were you able to write at all?

                                 GRADY
                        Nah.  I don’t have anything to 
                        write about, anyway.

                                 ANDREW
                        Write about me.  People might like 
                        me. 

           Grady offers him a Mona Lisa half-smile: “People would like you.”

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Caitlin shuffles papers. Grady enters. After a moment...

                                 CAITLIN
                        I know you.

                                 GRADY
                        You were the teacher in the pencil 
                        skirt with the white linen shirt.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You remember what I was wearing?

                                 GRADY
                        Sure I do.  You dress pretty well
                        for a girl who buys all her clothes
                        off the rack.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Touché.
                                 GRADY
                        Um...saying touché implies that you 
                        said something biting, then I said 
                        something even more biting back, so 
                        then you say touché.  But you never 
                        ...said anything biting.  I did.

                                 CAITLIN
                                (beat, studying him)
                        Are you the guy from the airport?

                                 GRADY
                        Wow, yeah.  Huh.  You were wearing 
                        glasses and had your hair up when 
                        we met the second time.

                                 CAITLIN
                        And you had sunglasses and a hat on 
                        ...That wasn’t a bad look for you, 
                        by the way.  Kinda hides the fact 
                        that you don’t have a twenty-two-
                        year-old’s hairline anymore.

                                 GRADY
                        ...Touché.

           Andrew enters and immediately plops face down on the couch. As a 
           result, he mistakes Caitlin’s general female form for Vanessa’s.

                                 ANDREW
                        Vanessa, tell your fucking friend 
                        to move her piece of shit car.  
                        Stupid cunt.

           Andrew flips over, and his eyes lock right on Caitlin’s. 

           Neither of them move a muscle for an eternity. Then...

                                 ANDREW
                        What I meant to say...

           Everyone’s frozen. Andrew and Caitlin maintain eye contact.

                                 ANDREW
                        Mooooom?

           Caitlin looks at Grady, then at Andrew, then back at Grady.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Wait a second...Oh my God.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Darla, Andrew, Grady and Vanessa hash things out.
                                 DARLA
                        Isn’t that a conflict of interest?

                                 ANDREW
                        Yes!  Yes it’s a conflict of
                        interest!  It conflicts!

                                 DARLA
                        She never connected you and Meghan 
                        having the same last name? 

                                 ANDREW
                        I don’t wanna be downloading porn 
                        while my teacher’s downstairs, much 
                        less have her pissing and shitting 
                        in our bathroom.  Cuz y‘know that’s 
                        the totally inevitable next step: 
                        Denial, anger, bargaining...what’s 
                        next?...Oh, that’s right -- pissing 
                        and shitting in our bathroom!

                                 GRADY
                        You should ask her to stay for
                        dinner.  Maybe if you get tight 
                        with her she’ll drop the charges.

                                 ANDREW
                        Uh-uh -- no way.  Just cuz you two 
                        are bonding over the story doesn’t
                        mean doo-doo.  Just give her an 
                        autographed copy and send her on 
                        her way.  Chop-chop.

                                 VANESSA
                                (to Grady)
                        Do you wanna fuck Ms. Fountain?

                                 DARLA
                        Vanessa, go to your room!

           The fuck/subsequent yelling freezes Andrew and Grady. Then...

                                 ANDREW
                        I think I’m gonna go to my room.

           He leaves. Grady and Darla are alone. She eyes him.

                                 DARLA
                        Well?

                                 GRADY
                        Well what?

                                 DARLA
                        Do you wanna fuck Ms. Fountain?
                                 GRADY
                        No!  No...she’s ugly.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Caitlin’s flawless face. Everyone waits on Darla and dinner.

                                 CAITLIN
                        So Vanessa, you’re a junior, right?  
                        Have you thought about what 
                        colleges you might wanna look at?

                                 VANESSA
                        Smith.  Early decision.

                                 GRADY
                        What about Wellesley?  You should 
                        apply to Wellesley, too.  And 
                        Barnard.  Barnard’s like the gold 
                        standard.

                                 VANESSA
                        Chill your penis...a’right?  I’m 
                        applying to Smith.  Early decision.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well, ultimately it’s up to you,
                        and I’m sure you’ll get in, but 
                        what about safety schools?  Do you 
                        have a safety school?

                                 VANESSA
                                (beat, holding on her)
                        Harvard.

                                 CAITLIN
                                (to Grady)
                        And you?  What do you do?

                                 GRADY
                        Um...I dunno, I like to listen to
                        music, read...I go to the beach a 
                        lot...watch Felicity re-runs...I 
                        dunno.  Why, whaddayou like to do?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well...I was asking what you do-do.

                                 GRADY
                        Ohhhhh, what do I do.  Oh, I don’t 
                        do shit.  I think I told you at the 
                        airport; remember?
                                 VANESSA
                        Grady likes to play tennis in 
                        Central Park and freebase cocaine 
                        in the locker room between sets.

           Andrew kicks Vanessa under the table. 

           She, in turn, fakes like she’s going to throw her fork at him. 

           Andrew flinches. After he settles himself, she nails him with it.

           He rubs his face, then recovers. An uncomfortable silence. Then...

                                 MEGHAN
                        I like your hair, Ms. Fountain.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Do you really?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Oh, yeah.  It’s totally boss.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Darla takes a pizza out of the oven, but drops it on the floor. 

           She stares at it. It’s cheese side up. 

           She holds out her fist and counts to five, one digit at a time. 

           At the five-finger mark (hitting the five second rule), she picks 
           up the pie and proceeds.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

                                 MEGHAN
                                (to Grady)
                        I’m hungry.  Cook something.

                                 GRADY
                        Cook something?  What is this,
                        Charles in Charge?  Fuck a cook.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Do you really think it’s a good 
                        idea to be cursing in front of a 
                        small child like that?

           Grady takes a sip of his drink, then calmly sets down the glass.

                                 GRADY
                        I’m sorry, who are you again?
           Things get quiet. Andrew throws daggers at Grady with his eyes.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Do you like chocolate, Ms. 
                        Fountain?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, I love chocolate, Meghan.

                                 MEGHAN
                        You should get a chocolate shoe.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I’m sorry sweetie, what?

                                 MEGHAN
                        You should get a chocolate shoe.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Why?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Because you keep putting your foot
                        in your mouth.

           Andrew chokes on his water and coughs.

                                 VANESSA
                        I want seafood.

                                 CAITLIN
                        There’s actually a seafood place
                        down the road that has the best
                        lobster salad in Southern
                        California.  My opinion.

           Darla enters with the pizza. Begins to serve. Caitlin helps.

                                 GRADY
                        Actually, eating lobster sorta goes 
                        against our personal ethics around 
                        here.

                                 VANESSA
                        You have ethics?

                                 DARLA
                        He does.  They’re just not rooted 
                        in any sort of tangible logic.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well what’s wrong with lobster?
                        Lobster’s great.
                                 GRADY
                        I know, that’s the word on the
                        street, but like...lobsters mate 
                        for life.  Did you know that?

                                 CAITLIN
                        I did not.

                                 ANDREW
                        It came up on ‘Friends’ once.

                                 GRADY
                        Did they?  Shit, I thought I had 
                        like an original idea.  But yeah, 
                        lobsters only have one mate their 
                        whole entire lives.  I mean a 
                        rabbit or a deer, they’re cute, but 
                        they’re not...monogamous, I guess.  
                        So every time you eat a lobster, 
                        you’re effectively robbing another 
                        lobster of their life partner.  
                        That’s so sad...Mountain lions are 
                        monogamous, too.  Foxes, wolves...

                                 ANDREW
                        Eagles.

                                 GRADY
                        Prairie voles...marmosets...Ducks 
                        are monogamous.  I don’t eat
                        ducks, either.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You’re funny.

                                 GRADY
                        You bet your fat ass I’m funny.  
                        How do you think I get girls, with 
                        my face?

                                 CAITLIN
                        My ass -- excuse me, Ms. Keiling
                        -- my ass is not fat.

                                 GRADY
                        Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t...I 
                        hadn’t noticed one way or the 
                        other.

           Meghan doesn’t look up as she cuts her slice with a knife.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Liar.
           A beat. Darla chortles sharply through her nose. She then places 
           her hand in front of her mouth, but a replica chortle escapes.

           INT. CAR/EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Covered in grease, Grady sits in the car’s back seat. 

           Out comes his bag. He dips a car key, then sniffs the product.

           Later, Vanessa gets in the front and joins Grady in his silence. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 GRADY
                        Nothing.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s never nothing...Tell me.

                                 GRADY
                        Well, I was thinking about how when 
                        I used to see a girl on the subway 
                        with a ring on her finger, I had to 
                        like...superimpose myself onto her 
                        to tell if she was married or not.  
                        Like I had to imagine my body 
                        rotated 180 degrees to sit in the 
                        same position she’s sitting in, so 
                        I can match up my left hand with 
                        her left to see if she’s wearing it 
                        on the proper hand or whatever....I
                                (beat)
                        I don’t know if that was the answer
                        you were looking for.

                                 VANESSA
                        You’re cute...Grady, I’m sorry for 
                        being a brat.  That’s my apology.

           Grady gets out. Vanessa follows. He resumes his engine work.

                                 VANESSA
                        Mom was excited about you coming. 
                        Maybe not ideal circumstances on 
                        your end, but fuck it.  She’s just 
                        been pretty bad.  I mean she’s 
                        still figuring out the divorce and 
                        that’s fine, but she spends so much 
                        time focusing on our happiness.

                                 GRADY
                        Well what about your happiness?
                                 VANESSA
                        I dunno.  Andrew was so popular at 
                        Trinity, but now he’s pretty much a 
                        social pariah.  He wants to leave.  
                        Mom would totally die.  Meghan...I 
                        just worry about her development 
                        without a father figure.

                                 GRADY
                        And what about Vanessa?

                                 VANESSA
                        What about Vanessa?

                                 GRADY
                        Well she’s sixteen years old and
                        she’s worrying about father figures
                        and emotional development.

                                 VANESSA
                        Whatever...So our school’s in a 
                        magnet program where the smarties 
                        go to this prep school for senior 
                        year.  All it means is a full year 
                        of eighty percent girls, then four 
                        years at Smith with all girls, so 
                        that’s another five years without 
                        ever having a boyfriend.  And then 
                        what?  I move back to New York and 
                        end up with four cats and syphilis?

                                 GRADY
                        I thought you were into girls.

                                 VANESSA
                        Stop...That was just a phase.
                                (beat)
                        I really love you, Grady.

           He wipes grease on her face and delivers a familiar line:

                                 GRADY
                        I know you do.  I just wish I could 
                        be better for you.

           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

           The next day. Grady and the family sit in the bleacher crowd.

           A foul ball is HIT.

           Vanessa and her TEAMMATES sing softball cheers in the dugout. 
                                 TEAMMATES
                        Holy cow, the ball went foul/ 
                        Moooove it over/Hey hey, whaddaya 
                        say/Hit that ball the other way/ 
                        Hit it high, hit it low/Hit it down 
                        to Mexico!

                                 VANESSA
                        We don’t play with Barbie dolls/We
                        just put the bat to the ball/We
                        don’t wear no miniskirts/We just
                        wear our pants and shirts/We don’t
                        drink no lemonade/We stick to our 
                        Gatorade.

           Andrew notices Lynda across the way. She talks to CUTE GUY #2.

                                 TEAMMATES
                        Strawberry shortcake/Banana
                        split/We make your team/Look like
                        /Shift it to left/Shift it to the

                        Fight!  Fight!

           LATER

           The game’s over. Andrew draws and sculpts on the infield dirt. 

           Lynda approaches.

                                 ANDREW
                        Hey.  What are you doing here?

                                 LYNDA
                        I’m sort of on the Quiz Bowl team.

                                 ANDREW
                        I know.  I was cut last year on the 
                        Nathan Hale quote.

                                 LYNDA
                        ‘I only regret that I have but one 
                        life to lose for my country.’  He  
                        and John Brown are always tricky.

                                 ANDREW
                        Who’s John Brown?

                                 LYNDA
                        John Brown’s Raid?  Harper’s Ferry,
                        Virginia?  Militant abolitionist 
                        who spawned the bastard child more 
                        commonly known as The Civil War.
                                 ANDREW
                        Lynda...do you...forget it.

           LATER

           Lynda underhands softballs to Andrew. He misses with each swing.

                                 LYNDA
                        Can I ask you a question?  Why 
                        don’t you stand up to Rob Hildreth?

                                 ANDREW
                        Oh, come on.  Y’know why?  There’s 
                        this whole after-school-special, 
                        propaganda-bullshit about how all 
                        bullies are cowards, and if you 
                        stand up to them they’ll either 
                        back down or respect you for it.

                                 LYNDA
                        Exactly.

                                 ANDREW
                        No.  Not exactly.  It’s a myth.

                                 LYNDA
                        Girls want men, Andrew, not boys.  

                                 ANDREW
                        ...I’m fifteen.

                                 LYNDA
                        It’s more the principle behind it.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           DOORBELL. Grady answers. It’s Caitlin. Feigning unfamiliarity...

                                 GRADY
                        Hi, can I help you?

           Caitlin offers an over-the-top smile.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Y’know what your problem is?
                                (beat, still smiling)
                        You’re an asshole.

                                 GRADY
                        That’s not fair, only I’m allowed 
                        to be funny in this house.

           As Caitlin brushes past him...
                                 CAITLIN
                        Sorry, slugger.  There’s a new 
                        sheriff in town.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Grady, Vanessa, Andrew. Enter Meghan, Caitlin, and their books.

                                 CAITLIN
                                (to Grady)
                        So what’re your plans for tonight?  
                        Stealing books from the library?

                                 GRADY
                        Hi Meggie.  Hey, show Ms. Fountain 
                        your Muhammad Ali impression.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Oh, yeah!  Okay, ready?
                                (beat)
                        Ahm a baaaaad man!  Ahm a bad man!

                                 CAITLIN
                        You’re so cute, Meghan.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Cute?  I ain’t cute.  Ahm mean.  
                        Ahm so mean I make medicine sick.

                                 GRADY
                        I’m sorry, what am I doing tonight?
                        Um...probably the same thing I do 
                        every Saturday.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Which is what?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno.  Watch Cocktail on TBS and 
                        then cry myself to sleep maybe?

           Darla enters, which reminds Grady of...

                                 GRADY
                                (to Caitlin)
                        You’re Irish, right?  I’m Irish.   
                        I was just telling Darla about my 
                        best friend from rehab, this kid 
                        Rashaun Scantlebury.  He was so 
                        obsessed with blonde-haired girls; 
                        that’s all he ever talked about.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Thing is, he was only interested in 
                        blondes who were Irish, cuz he was 
                        saying how there’s basically this 
                        unspoken sociocultural hierarchy of 
                        blondes, with German girls being at 
                        the top, Northern Europeans in the 
                        middle, and Irish girls at the 
                        bottom.  The whole attraction was 
                        based on his theory that blonde 
                        Irish girls are like the niggers of 
                        blondes.

           Darla chuckles to herself. 

                                 ANDREW
                                (to Grady)
                        You’re a fucking asshole.

                                 DARLA
                        No, you’re the asshole.  Go to your 
                        room right now.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m the asshole?  I’m the asshole?

           He gets up and pushes in his chair. He then places his hand on 
           Vanessa’s shoulder as a means of dramatically addressing her.

                                 ANDREW
                        He just called my English teacher a 
                        nigger, and I’m the asshole.

           Andrew leaves. Caitlin giggles.

                                 GRADY
                        It’s not my theory.  Though I’m 
                        from Long Island, so I do kinda 
                        know everything there is to know 
                        about Irish girls.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, is that so?

                                 GRADY
                        It is so.  Lemme tell ya something 
                        about Irish girls.  Irish girls... 
                        are always right.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Grady and Caitlin exit the house and stop on the porch.

                                 CAITLIN
                        So listen...um...do you wanna maybe
                        like...do something tomorrow night?
                                 GRADY
                        Well I can’t just come and go as I 
                        please; I would have to sort of ask 
                        and all.  And you don’t mean like a 
                        date, right?  Cuz I’m obviously not 
                        in a place where I should be --

                                 CAITLIN
                        -- No, not a date.  No.  God no.  I
                        just figured you don’t have anyone
                        your age to hang out with, and 
                        like...

                                 GRADY
                        I’ll tell Darla.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh.  Okay.  Well then I’ll call you 
                        tomorrow?

           He nods. She walks to her car, then turns.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, and Grady?  Date or no date?  
                        I’m a flowers and candy kinda girl.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Andrew and Meghan finger paint on easels.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           The family, clad in PJ’s, t-shirts and nighties, eat breakfast.

                                 DARLA
                        Grady, I don’t want to sound trite, 
                        but we’re all very proud of your 
                        courage in dealing with this.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s not trite, it’s sweet.  Eighty 
                        percent of addicts relapse within 
                        the first twenty-fours after rehab.

                                 GRADY
                        ...Eleven.

           No one really notices Grady’s thinly veiled confession. 

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Andrew and Vanessa play ping-pong.
                                 ANDREW
                        Sixteen-Four, yours.

                                 VANESSA
                        Sixteen-Three.

                                 ANDREW
                        Fine, Sixteen-Three.

                                 VANESSA
                                (smiling)
                        Ew, whatever; I don’t need a hand-
                        out.  Now I’m gonna beat you out of 
                        spite you fucking bitch-ass bitch.

           She serves, he returns, she rips a winner. Five times until 21.

                                 VANESSA
                        You should come out with us 
                        tonight.

                                 ANDREW
                        Who’s ‘us’?

                                 VANESSA
                        Me and Jocelyn.  We’re going to the 
                        pool hall...Lynda usually goes.

                                 ANDREW
                        Does she?

                                 VANESSA
                        Yeah, come.  We never hang out
                        anymore.

           EXT. CITIBANK - DAY

           Grady dips his card, enters his PIN, and is presented with his 
           balance: $17.28. Citibank, as we learned earlier, doles out tens. 

           He proceeds, and the ATM presents Grady his lone, single bill.

           EXT. NATURE PRESERVE - DUSK

           The perfect sunset. Grady collects flowers.

           INT. DARLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Darla in bed. A wet towel covers her face.

                                 GRADY
                        Are you feeling okay?  I can stay.
                                 DARLA
                        Do you mean that?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah.  Of course I do.

           Darla lies there awhile, then removes the towel.

                                 DARLA
                        Grady...I’m fat.

                                 GRADY
                        You’re not fat, Darla -- you weigh 
                        like 120 pounds.  And whatever; I 
                        mean...beauty comes in all shapes 
                        and sizes.

                                 DARLA
                        Are you insane?  Women come in all
                        shapes and sizes.  Beauty is a 
                        much, much smaller category.
                                (beat)
                        Y’know, I can’t do this myself.  
                        It’s good to have you here.

                                 GRADY
                        It’s good to be here.

                                 DARLA
                        I’m glad to hear you say that...So 
                        have you thought about writing?

                                 GRADY
                        There’s nothing to write about.

                                 DARLA
                        There’s everything.  Everything is 
                        copy.  Diane’s copy.  Aunt Liz is 
                        copy...Ms. Fountain is copy.

                                 GRADY
                        Ms. Fountain is not copy.

                                 DARLA
                        You can’t let go of Diane until you 
                        open your heart to someone else.

                                 GRADY
                        Did you really just say that?  That 
                        is quite possibly the corniest 
                        thing you have ever said.  And I’ve 
                        let go, a’right?  I’ve let go.

                                 DARLA
                        ...I know you have.
           INT. FOYER - NIGHT

           DOORBELL. Andrew opens the door and sees Caitlin. He waits a bit.

           He slowly closes the door, then stands there for a long time.

           She RINGS. He opens it a bit, peering through a sliver of space. 

           Caitlin, not amused, slams it against him. He recoils.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Don’t even front, Keiling.  Know
                        your role.

           She enters. Andrew leaves, but in passing the stairs...

                                 ANDREW
                        Hey Grady?  Your girlfriend’s here!

           Caitlin winces. Grady comes down with her flowers, then pauses.

                                 GRADY
                        You showed up.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Looks that way.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Vanessa sits at the table, Grady stands at the counter. 

           He opens a Tupperware container that Caitlin brought.

                                 GRADY
                        You made me gingerbread men?  
                        That’s so sweet of you.  Are they 
                        laced with arsenic?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Arsenic?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah, like Flowers in the Attic?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, that’s so weird, I’m reading
                        Flowers in the Attic right now.

                                 GRADY
                        Are you?  Great book.  Great book.
                        But yeah, the mom poisons her kids 
                        by lacing their gingerbread cookies 
                        with arsenic.
           She looks at him as if to say, “Thanks.” Grady feigns ignorance.

                                 GRADY
                        The kids figure it out after one of
                        the brothers dies so they escape
                        from the attic and run away, but...
                        y’know, not before telling everyone
                        at the reception how their mom 
                        tried to kill them.  It’s a really 
                        good ending.  Really well-executed.

           Grady moves to put the cookies away. 

           In doing so, he gives Vanessa a wink. She winks back.

                                 GRADY
                        Oh, I almost forgot.  I made a 
                        special formula for the flowers so 
                        they keep longer.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What?

           As Grady explains, he grabs a pitcher from the refrigerator, takes 
           the flowers from Caitlin, then begins to replace the water.

                                 GRADY
                        Water alone doesn’t really cut it.
                        You take a quart of water, add one
                        tablespoon of sugar, one teaspoon 
                        of vinegar, one teaspoon of 
                        mouthwash, and then just a little 
                        bit of dishwashing detergent.  
                        Liquid or powder, doesn’t matter.  
                        And never put flowers in the fridge 
                        if there’s fruit in there.  Fruit 
                        releases ethylene gas, and ethylene 
                        gas makes them age faster.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Hey Grady?

                                 GRADY
                        Hey Darla?

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Do you think you could grab ahold
                        of your sexuality and come here for
                        a second?

           INT. DARLA’S ROOM - DAY

           Grady heads for the phone that awaits him.
           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. WATSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Officer Watson and her Baby. This time she changes a diaper.

                                 WATSON
                        I just wanted to go over a few --

                                 GRADY
                        -- Mrs. Watson?  I have something I 
                        wanna do tonight, and I don’t know 
                        if I’m gonna get in before nine.  
                        I’m obviously gonna try, but what 
                        if I’m a few minutes late?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        This is something I want to do.

                                 WATSON
                        After nine, a bench warrant will be 
                        issued for your arrest.  Mr. 
                        Herman, we all want things in life.  
                        Maybe it’s time to start separating 
                        your wants from your needs.

                                 GRADY
                        ...This is something I need to do.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Grady and Caitlin balance on a see-saw and eat ice cream cones.

                                 GRADY
                        Well Darla used to be the Senior 
                        Features Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Really?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah.  I interned there when I was 
                        a sophomore, and she sorta took me 
                        under her wing and put my writing 
                        out there.  So I was over their 
                        apartment every day from the start.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Interesting.  I have to admit I’ve 
                        noticed certain parallels between
                        the character in your Granta piece
                        and this whole flower formula-slash-
                        ‘I don’t eat lobster’ business.
                                 GRADY
                        Well the character is me.

                                 CAITLIN
                        No, I know.  I’m just curious as to 
                        how you’d be inclined towards this 
                        world of bunny rabbits and flowers 
                        and...y’know...oven mitts or what 
                        have you.

           With her end of the see-saw on the ground, Caitlin suddenly gets 
           off, sending Grady (and his ice cream) crashing to the earth.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Caitlin chauffeurs Grady.

                                 GRADY
                        Well because I was mainly raised by 
                        women, things like dance or beauty 
                        and fashion weren’t really gender 
                        specific.  Then again, I don’t even 
                        know if I like women all that much.  
                        I mean I’m a big fan of Gloria 
                        Steinem and second-wave feminism, 
                        but I don’t particularly care for 
                        ninety percent of the slits I do
                        meet, and I certainly don’t stick 
                        my cock in every two-eyed whore 
                        that looks my way.

                                 CAITLIN
                        ...Did you just use the word slits?

                                 GRADY
                        I don’t think so, no.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You didn’t say the word slits?

                                 GRADY
                        No.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I’m pretty sure you just referred 
                        to women as being slits.

                                 GRADY
                        ...It’s possible I may have.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I see.  Now I have my suspicions,
                        but what exactly do you mean when
                        you refer to women as being slits?
                                 GRADY
                                (beat, holding on her)
                        Do you deep condition your hair?
                                (longer beat)
                        It’s derogatory slang for a vagina.
                                (a final beat)
                        Usually preceded by Vassar.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Usually preceded by Vassar.  As in
                        ‘I was out with my friend and we
                        were being chatted up by these
                        Vassar slits who were on break’?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Right.  I also noticed that you
                        forgot my candy.

           Grady reaches into his pocket, then places something on the dash. 

           He takes his hand away to reveal two Hershey’s Kisses. 

           Caitlin eyes them, then looks back at the road. 

           She slows down, puts the car in park, and takes one of the Kisses. 

           She examines it, then places it back next to the other one.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You fancy yourself as being quite
                        smooth, don’t you?

                                 GRADY
                        Not really.  Why, do I tickle your
                        fancy?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Yeah, you tickle me...I don’t
                        know about my fancy, though.

           INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

           Vanessa plays with Jocelyn. 

           She also checks out Will on the other side of the room. Of course, 
           when Vanessa’s not looking, Will is.

           AT ANOTHER TABLE

           Andrew and Lynda. Andrew’s conscious of the fact that Rob Hildreth 
           lurks nearby, and it shows.

           A skilled Lynda runs the table.
                                 LYNDA
                        Your sister is really pretty.

                                 ANDREW
                        Well she’s never had a boyfriend.  
                        And she hates attention.  She usta 
                        dye her hair brown cuz she thought 
                        people didn’t take her seriously as 
                        an academic powerhouse. 

           Lynda looks over at Vanessa.

                                 LYNDA
                        I wish people wouldn’t take me
                        seriously as an academic powerhouse 
                        ...She looks like Kahlen from Cycle 
                        Four of America’s Next Top Model.

           Andrew bumps into Hildreth.

                                 HILDRETH
                        Fucking back up, douche.

                                 ANDREW
                        Sorry.

           Hildreth takes Andrew’s glasses and tries them on. 

           Andrew makes a play for them, misses, and lands against Rob. 

           Hildreth then pushes Andrew. 

           Across the room, Will notices.

                                 ANDREW
                                (under his breath)
                        Asshole.

           Hildreth hears this and throws Andrew into a table -- viciously.

           Will casually finishes a sundae, then slowly makes his way over. 

           With an odd sort of calm, like a varsity wrestler on Valium, he 
           drives Hildreth into the ground. 

           He puts a choke hold on Rob, who turns red.

                                 CROWD
                        Fight!  Fight!  Fight!  Fight!

           Will releases and stands up. He approaches Andrew.

                                 WILL
                        Let’s take a walk.
           EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

           Will offers Andrew a cigarette. It’s declined.

                                 ANDREW
                        I didn’t figure you for a smoker.

                                 WILL
                        Well if it means anything to you, I
                        don’t inhale.

                                 ANDREW
                        Then why bother?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t smoke for the nicotine, I
                        smoke because I’m insecure.

                                 ANDREW
                        You’re insecure?

                                 WILL
                        Isn’t everyone?

                                 ANDREW
                        Not guys who date Heather Church.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, do you know Heather?

                                 ANDREW
                        I don’t know her-know her, but 
                        we’re both in Chorus.  She’s nice.

                                 WILL
                        This is Heather we’re talking 
                        about?

                                 ANDREW
                        I dunno, she seems nice.  There’s 
                        always a joke or two at my expense, 
                        but she’s one of the people that 
                        doesn’t end up laughing, so...

                                 WILL
                        Listen, Sparky.  If she’s not 
                        laughing, it’s not cuz she’s nice, 
                        it’s cuz she doesn’t get the joke.

                                 ANDREW
                        Well again, then why bother?  Cuz 
                        she’s hot?
                                 WILL
                        Nah.

                                 ANDREW
                        Cuz you’re insecure?

                                 WILL
                        ...Isn’t everyone?

                                 ANDREW
                        I don’t get it.  I do, but like...

           Vanessa exits the hall and spots the pair.

                                 VANESSA
                        Were you guys having a moment?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, we had a moment.  It was 
                        nice, right?

           Andrew nods in faithful agreement.

                                 VANESSA
                                (to Andrew)
                        I think there’s someone worried
                        about you in there.

           Before heading back in, Andrew stops at the door.

                                 ANDREW
                        Thanks for taking me out, Vanessa,  
                        I had a really fun night.  I hope 
                        we can do this again sometime.

                                 VANESSA
                        Ass.

                                 WILL
                        Wait, is that your brother?

                                 VANESSA
                        You didn’t know that?

                                 WILL
                        Jesus, no.  I woulda let him get 
                        pounded a little longer if I knew 
                        he belonged to you.

                                 VANESSA
                        That’s cute, William.

                                 WILL
                        It’s Will.  My name’s Will.
           EXT. DUCK POND - NIGHT

           Grady’s taken Caitlin to a duck pond. They feed, ducks eat.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You realize most people have these 
                        things called jobs that they go to.

                                 GRADY
                        A job?  What’s...what’s that?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Yeah, I don’t know.  Job.  I think 
                        it’s a verb.  Like to ‘job’ 
                        someone?  I remember I came across 
                        it when I was reading a book once, 
                        so I looked it up in the dictionary 
                        and copied down the definition in 
                        the margin, but I don’t really 
                        remember what I wrote down...

           Grady gently twists her wrist to see the time: 8:04.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Y’know...if it’s any consolation, I 
                        more or less hate mine.

                                 GRADY
                        Why?

                                 CAITLIN
                        You just go in thinking you’ll 
                        affect young lives, you’ll have 
                        summers off, but then you realize 
                        that lesson plans get stale, you’re 
                        gonna be on autopilot for the next 
                        forty years, and it just seems like 
                        it’ll end up being the perfect 
                        complement to one of those flat
                        suburban marriages...I came out 
                        here because growing up in Wyoming, 
                        it’s land-locked.  I figured water 
                        equals change, metamorphosis... 
                        baptism, all those things.  Problem 
                        is, the emptiness follows you.
                                (beat)
                        Plus it’s really Midwestern and 
                        hokey, but I miss my family, and if 
                        you don’t have loved ones around, 
                        there’s no point in being anywhere 
                        ...I think if things are still 
                        stagnant in a couple years, it’s 
                        back to Wyoming, tail between legs. 
           A long moment. 

                                 GRADY
                        Y’know...I don’t know if I’ll let
                        you stick around long enough for me
                        to consider sleeping with you.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I wouldn’t be intimate with someone 
                        unless I was in a relationship, 
                        anyway.  Boys I date don’t qualify.

           Grady mulls this over a bit.

                                 GRADY
                        Caitlin?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Yeah?

                                 GRADY
                        It’s not a date.

           INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

           Andrew and Lynda play pool. Again, she runs the table.

                                 LYNDA
                        So Carol and Eben are crashing the 
                        Valentine Ball.

                                 ANDREW
                        They are?

                                 LYNDA
                        So are Megan Delage and Ryan 
                        Muzzatti.  It’s tradition for 
                        sophomores to crash.

                                 ANDREW
                        That’s cool.

                                 LYNDA
                        Y’know what else it is?

           She places the butt end of her stick in front of him.

                                 LYNDA
                        It’s your cue.  It’s your cue,
                        Andrew Keiling, to ask me to crash
                        the Ball with you on Thursday.
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Vanessa and Will walk slowly down the street.

                                 WILL
                        There’s no Driver’s Ed in New York?

                                 VANESSA
                        Nah.  My friend had a country house 
                        and she took me out once, but I 
                        almost totaled her brother’s car 
                        trying to avoid a squirrel.  Which 
                        is weird actually, cuz I think most 
                        people would peg me as the type to 
                        head straight for the squirrel.

                                 WILL
                        You must miss it.  Manhattan, I 
                        mean.

                                 VANESSA
                        Totally.  But there’s a love-hate 
                        relationship.  New York is like the 
                        dirty uncle that molests you, but 
                        then pays your way through college.

                                 WILL
                        That’s funny...So are you gonna do 
                        the whole magnet school thing at 
                        Pencey next year?

           Vanessa stops her stroll. Will follows suit. She eyes him.

                                 VANESSA
                        It depends.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

           Darla and Meghan walk from one end of the store, items in tow, 
           while SINGLE DAD and SON walk towards them from the other end. 

           Both pairs come to the middle check-out line. 

           Our girls arrive first and load up: ice cream and other desserts. 

           Single Dad then loads his things. 

           The four of them wait. Son kicks his dad, then nods towards Darla. 

           Single Dad’s not having it. But after a moment...

                                 SINGLE DAD
                        Interesting selection.
                                 DARLA
                        Pardon?  Oh, right.  It’s high 
                        fructose corn syrup night.  A.K.A. 
                        Girls’ Night Out.  In...rather.

                                 SINGLE DAD
                        Huh.  We’re having a Guys’ Night.

           Darla takes a look at what he’s picked out.

                                 DARLA
                        Looks like you’ll be well prepared.

           Single Dad gets a view of his food from a more objective 
           perspective: condiments, and way too many packages of hot dogs.

                                 SINGLE DAD
                        Oh.  Right, well...

                                 DARLA
                        Talk about your sausage fest.

           Darla gets rung up, conversation stalls. Single Dad is too shy. 

           Son nudges him. Dad cranes his neck to see Darla’s food items.

                                 DARLA
                        I’m sorry, did I take something
                        from your pile?

                                 SINGLE DAD
                        Oh, no...I was just trying to see 
                        if you had a wedding ring on.
                                (beat)
                        It’s so hard to tell sometimes.

           EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

           Andrew and Lynda sit out in the lot behind the pool hall.

                                 ANDREW
                        So what do you like?

                                 LYNDA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANDREW
                        Like what’re the things you like?  
                        Do you like unicorns, four-leaf 
                        clovers, Archie comics...do you 
                        like Little Debbie snack cakes more 
                        than Drake’s devil dogs and yodels?
                                 LYNDA
                        I like Archie comics.

                                 ANDREW
                        Me too.  I like Mr. Weatherbee.  
                        And I’d take Betty over Veronica.

                                 LYNDA
                        Guys say they like Bettys, but they 
                        always end up going for Veronicas 
                        ...What’s your favorite movie?

                                 ANDREW
                        Dead Poets...Benny and Joon...

                                 LYNDA
                        What’s your favorite book?

                                 ANDREW
                        Love Story.  Favorite band.

                                 LYNDA
                        The Silvertones?  This album Baja 
                        Sessions they did is amazing.
                                (beat)
                        I also like you.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Grady and Caitlin wrap the night up.

                                 CAITLIN
                        How come phone numbers never start 
                        with the number one?  Anyway.
                        Y’know what I was just thinking?

                                 GRADY
                        I’m not gay, I’m just feminine.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well you’re not good-looking enough 
                        to be gay.  You definitely have 
                        some gay tendencies, though.

                                 GRADY
                        No, I have gay qualities.  That’s 
                        not the same as having gay 
                        tendencies.  Like knowing a lot 
                        about makeup?  Trish McEvoy and Jo 
                        Malone, eyeliner and eye cream, 
                        mascara, foundation...knowing that 
                        the hardest thing to achieve is the 
                        balance between too much eye shadow 
                        and too little?  
                                      (MORE)
                                      GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Knowledge of these things is a gay 
                        quality...I don’t know if I 
                        elucidated that well.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What does elucidate mean?

                                 GRADY
                        To like...make clear?  Explain?

                                 CAITLIN
                        I know what it means you prick.

           The pair stand uncomfortably for several moments.

                                 GRADY
                        Y’know what?

                                 CAITLIN
                        What?

                                 GRADY
                        I don’t know if I’ll ever get over 
                        the fact that you made me 
                        gingerbread men for our first date.

           A moment. Caitlin slowly draws closer and gives him an innocent, 
           two-second long kiss on the cheek. 

           She pulls back. Eye contact.

                                 CAITLIN
                        It’s not a date.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Grady enters. The phone RINGS. He’s oblivious as he walks past a 
           clock -- 9:03. The phone RINGS again. He pauses mid-stride. 

           Then, a third RING. Grady bolts through the house, up the stairs, 
           and around a corner. His momentum sends him crashing into a wall.

           Grady recovers, runs, picks up a baseball mid-run, then fires the 
           ball through the opening in Darla’s door. It knocks the phone to 
           the floor as he continues his post-throw forward progress. 

           Grady bangs through the door and dives for the receiver. Calmly...

                                 GRADY
                        This is Grady.

           INT. ANDREW’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andrew browses an art catalog. Grady appears at his door.
                                 ANDREW
                        Hey, how’d it go?

           Grady leans on the doorjamb and sighs.

                                 GRADY
                        Andrew...when ya look at a pretty
                        girl’s face...I mean really look at 
                        it...let’s just put it this way: 
                        Never trust a girl who doesn’t have 
                        pores.  Y’know what I mean?

                                 ANDREW
                                (beat)
                        I think I have a pretty good idea.

           INT. ART ROOM - DAY

           The next day. Andrew paints, MRS. BENSON flips through papers.

                                 MRS. BENSON
                        Andrew.  You need to come to a 
                        final decision on your show 
                        submissions.  Make a decision.

           Andrew gazes at a distant wall. Walks over. Benson then joins him.

           He sizes up a life-sized, full-color sculpture of George Bush. A 
           gun is held to Bush’s head by a similar sculpture of Uncle Sam.

           Andrew bypasses the pair for a nearby, gigantic map of the world. 
           The U.S. is blacked out, while 300+ metal pegs dot other nations.

                                 MRS. BENSON
                        This is yours, too?  No one knew 
                        who this belonged to; what is it?

                                 ANDREW
                        Well...each of these little things 
                        are actually bullets that are for 
                        the smallest revolver in the world, 
                        the Swiss MiniGun.  It’s like six 
                        centimeters.  Smaller than a pinky.  
                        And each bullet represents one of 
                        the three hundred six soldiers from 
                        around the world who died for us in 
                        Iraq.  I glued each bullet to a 
                        pin, then stuck the pins in every 
                        one of their hometowns.

           Andrew begins pointing to every country that has pins/bullets.
                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        You got 170+ from England, 1 Czech, 
                        33 Italians, 13 Bulgarians, 2 Thai,
                        3 Romanians, 1 Hungarian, 1 Korean, 
                        5 Salvadoran, 18 Ukrainians, 22 
                        Poles, 3 Latvian, 7 Danes, 2 Dutch, 
                        2 Estonians, 1 Fijian, 1 Hungarian, 
                        1 Kazakh, 4 Slovaks, 2 Australians, 
                        and 10 Spaniards....And the names 
                        are engraved on the bullets.
                                (long beat)
                        I’ll get my ass beat for being anti-
                        American, but I guess I’m willing 
                        to suffer for my art.  Maybe not.

           He turns. Gestures towards several huge piles of sketchbooks.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think for my second submission 
                        I’m gonna go with my architecture 
                        portfolio.  It’s the first pile of 
                        stacks, third from the top.

                                 MRS. BENSON
                        Everyone loves your building 
                        schematics.  Definitely consider 
                        them for your portfolio when it 
                        comes time for college apps, too.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Vanessa and Will eat lunch opposite one another.

                                 VANESSA
                        You drink soy milk, William?

                                 WILL
                        It’s Will.  No ‘yum,’ just Will.

           She takes his milk carton, drinks some, then reads the label.

                                 VANESSA
                        So are you and Heather going to the
                        Ball or are you too jaded for that?

                                 WILL
                        We’re taking a break.

                                 VANESSA
                        Since when?

                                 WILL
                        Since yesterday.  Long weekends 
                        give people too much time to think.
                                 VANESSA
                        Wow...that’s deep. 

                                 WILL
                        I bet there’s a lot of three-day 
                        weekend breakups.  Some sorta spike 
                        in high school break-ups over three-
                        day weekends.  Like emergency rooms 
                        during Christmas or whatever.

                                 VANESSA
                        Full moons.

                                 WILL
                        Like emergency rooms during full 
                        moons or whatever.

           Will takes his milk back. Follows her sip with his.

                                 WILL
                        Heather’s dad was a receiver in the 
                        NFL for a few years, so she’s got 
                        this princess attitude cuz of it.

                                 VANESSA
                        ...Heather’s dad is Robert Church?

                                 WILL
                        You know who he is?

                                 VANESSA
                        Of course I do.  He never met a 
                        pass he couldn’t drop.

                                 WILL
                        That’s funny...Do you know who 
                        Meredith Bachman is?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Heather didn’t like that we hang 
                        out, but we go surfing before 
                        school on Wednesdays.  In the a.m.

                                 VANESSA
                        That’s cool.

                                 WILL
                        You wanna come with us tomorrow?

                                 VANESSA
                        Um...I don’t really know how to 
                        surf.
                                 WILL
                        Well neither does Meredith.
                                (beat, small smile)
                        That’s not why I keep her around.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Andrew and Lynda sit in a tree, way, way above the ground.

                                 LYNDA
                        How’s Hildreth treating you?

                                 ANDREW
                        Lynda...it’s kind of emasculating 
                        when you keep asking me about the 
                        kid who steals my lunch money.

                                 LYNDA
                        He steals your lunch money?

                                 ANDREW
                        No.  He’s making progress, though.

                                 LYNDA
                        I only ask cuz I’m your friend.

                                 ANDREW
                        Have you ever considered the fact 
                        that standing up to someone isn’t 
                        all about physical confrontation?

                                 LYNDA
                        Well maybe it should be.

                                 ANDREW
                        Maybe it should.  But by ignoring 
                        it, that is standing up for myself.  
                        If I ignore him and he doesn’t stop 
                        it’ll suck, but I’ll also feel like 
                        the better man.

                                 LYNDA
                        And that helps you sleep at night?

                                 ANDREW
                        Y’know what?  It does.

                                 LYNDA
                        For now, maybe.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Grady joins Darla for lunch.
                                 DARLA
                        Can I get a status report?

                                 GRADY
                        All in confidentiality?

                                 DARLA
                        As always.

                                 GRADY
                        Meghan’s eight, she’s enjoying 
                        eight...Andrew’s getting picked on 
                        a lot...and Miss Sweet Valley High 
                        is very much her mother’s daughter.

                                 DARLA
                        And how are we doing?

                                 GRADY
                        I’m a’right.

                                 DARLA
                        Are you?

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Vanessa takes books out of her locker. Jocelyn waits on her. 

           Andrew walks by and lightly punches his sister on the butt.

                                 VANESSA
                        Hey, baby.

           Andrew continues down the hall, and Rob Hildreth crosses his path. 

                                 HILDRETH
                        Where’s Will Herzog when ya need 
                        him?  Kinda like Superman, right?

           He knocks Andrew’s hat off, and as Andrew bends over to pick it 
           up, Hildreth punches the textbooks out of his hands.  

           STUDENTS notice and chuckle. Vanessa offers her books to Jocelyn.

                                 VANESSA
                        Hold these for a second?

           Hands now free, she nonchalantly opens the French horn case that 
           lies on the ground next to her. 

           She takes the shiny horn over to Hildreth, now at his locker.

                                 VANESSA
                        Turn around.
           Hildreth turns, and Vanessa bashes him in the face.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Back with Grady and Darla.

                                 DARLA
                        What did you and Caitlin do last 
                        night?

                                 GRADY
                        Drove around.  Had some ice cream.

                                 DARLA
                        Who paid?

                                 GRADY
                        I did.

                                 DARLA
                        Good boy...Did you kiss her?

                                 GRADY
                        Darla, it’s not like that.

                                 DARLA
                        I see...So did you kiss her?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        Would you tell me if you did?

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Burt Ehman on the phone. Vanessa sits across from him, pissed.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           As Grady washes dishes, he speaks on the phone with Burt.

                                 GRADY
                        The thing is, Vanessa’s mom’s in 
                        New York finalizing some divorce 
                        proceedings.  She left last week, 
                        and she’s actually gonna be gone 
                        for a few months.  I’m Vanessa’s 
                        brother-in-law, so I’m acting as 
                        their guardian for now.  My wife’s 
                        in New York for moral support.

                                 BURT
                        I see.  ‘In loco parentis.’
                                 GRADY
                        Right.

                                 BURT
                        It means ‘In place of a parent.’

                                 GRADY
                                (echoing Darla re: Granta)
                        I know what it means, thank you.
                                (beat, not amused)
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your 
                        name.  Gideon, was it?

                                 BURT
                        Burt.

                                 GRADY
                        I’ll be down there shortly, Gideon.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Grady and Vanessa sit opposite Burt Ehman.

                                 BURT
                        I have five neutral students who 
                        swear she tried to kill him.  
                        Literally attempted murder.  Then I 
                        have her friends who claim she 
                        wasn’t even there, so someone on 
                        her side is clearly lying.

                                 GRADY
                        Clearly.  She has to be punished.

                                 BURT
                        Right.  Now Rob’s parents will take 
                        a step back if she’s appropriately 
                        disciplined, and I did do her the 
                        favor of drafting an apology.

           He slides a document across the desk. Vanessa reads, then signs.

                                 GRADY
                        I wanna thank you, Gideon, for --

                                 BURT
                        -- Burt.

                                 GRADY
                        Burt.  I wanna thank you, Burt.
                                (beat)
                        Thank you.

           Vanessa slides it back. Burt scans. It reads, “Eat My Cock.”
           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           A bowl of Lucky Charms and pink milk. Grady loads the last cereal 
           bits onto his spoon. 

           He eats them, and nothing but charms float on the milk. He then 
           feeds Meghan the charms for the rest of the scene.

                                 ANDREW
                        There’s only one honorable thing to 
                        do at this point: I gotta confess.

                                 GRADY
                        To Lynda?

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m thinking I can cushion the blow-
                        slash-impress her the night of the 
                        Ball when she sees I’m in the art 
                        show.  They’re the same night.

                                 GRADY
                        Ohhhhh, the old switcharoo.

                                 ANDREW
                        Exactly.  The old switcharoo.

                                 GRADY
                        Sounds like a plan.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Except...

                                 ANDREW
                        Except what?

                                 MEGHAN
                        Well...you don’t know how to dance.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Faint MUSIC plays. Darla fills a glass with water, then drinks. 
           She notices something through the window and stops to watch.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Four socks slowly moving back and forth, in time with the music. 
           Andrew and Grady speak quietly and seriously, like lovers.

                                 ANDREW
                        What if she tries to kiss me?
                                 GRADY
                        Just close your eyes and hope for 
                        the best.  That’s what I do.  And 
                        less tongue is better than more.

                                 ANDREW
                        I should get a pen.

                                 GRADY
                        Andrew, there’s a lot more cool 
                        shit you can do with a girl other 
                        than making out and dancing.

                                 ANDREW
                        Like what?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno; hugging, holding hands... 
                        Okay, this is important: What’s the 
                        sexiest thing you can ask a woman?

                                 ANDREW
                                (eternally long beat)
                        If she’ll lick your asshole?

                                 GRADY
                        Besides that.

                                 ANDREW
                        I have no idea.  What’s the sexiest 
                        thing you can ask a woman?

                                 GRADY
                        ...Her opinion.

                                 ANDREW
                        ...That’s corny.

                                 GRADY
                        It is.  Don’t tell Vanessa.

           They dance for a while in silence. Then...

                                 GRADY
                        Y’know...I think you’re displaying 
                        all the signs and symptoms of 
                        unrequited love.

                                 ANDREW
                        Great.  That was quick.

                                 GRADY
                        ...Love usually is.

           They continue in silence as the music PLAYS.
           After some time, a couple of tears well up in Andrew’s eyes. 

           Grady can’t see this.

                                 ANDREW
                        Grady?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah?

                                 ANDREW
                                (long beat)
                        You left your cocaine in mom’s car.
                                (another beat)
                        Probably not the best place for it.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY 

           Sun, sand and surf. As far as the eye can see. 

           Vanessa, Will, and an obese MEREDITH BACHMAN lie on their boards 
           as they float on the water.

           LATER

           Will surfs. Vanessa and Meredith sit on towels and watch.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Y’know the thing about that kid? 
                        He’s nice.  It’s a lost art.  He’s 
                        just really nice to people.

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s a Republican.

                                 MEREDITH
                        He didn’t like Bush.

                                 VANESSA
                        Either did Nancy Reagan.  It’s not 
                        exactly a litmus test.

                                 MEREDITH
                        It’s a start.

                                 VANESSA
                        For what?

                                 MEREDITH
                        ...You know why he and Heather 
                        broke up, right?  I mean I know you 
                        two have been talking a lot lately.
                                 VANESSA
                        Did he say that?

                                 MEREDITH
                        He doesn’t have to.

                                 VANESSA
                        Wait a second.  Are you say that 
                        they broke up cuz of me?

                                 MEREDITH
                        Um...no.  I’m saying they broke up 
                        cuz of me.

                                 VANESSA
                        Wait, what?

                                 MEREDITH
                        Heather never understood why he 
                        wanted to spend so much time with a 
                        fat girl.  If he hung out with 
                        Ayesha Rehman or someone like that, 
                        at least she coulda reveled in the 
                        drama of having some decent 
                        competition.  But the fact that I’m 
                        ugly meant she had no right to get 
                        pissed, which only ended up making 
                        her seriously pissed.

                                 VANESSA
                        You’re not ugly, Meredith.

           Meredith smiles, albeit a painful one.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I know you mean well, Vanessa, but
                        when ugly people have to hear 
                        beautiful people try and tell them 
                        that they’re not ugly, it makes 
                        them feel even uglier.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Grady and Darla make dinner. A phone RINGS. 

           Darla runs out of the kitchen (thinking it’s Single Dad). RING...

           Upon her return...

                                 GRADY
                        What was that about?

                                 DARLA
                        Nothing.
                                 GRADY
                        What could be so important to have 
                        you sprint to the phone like that?

                                 DARLA
                        Nothing.  Aunt Liz called for you, 
                        by the way.

                                 GRADY
                        Aunt Liz called?

                                 DARLA
                        Caitlin did, too.  What’s going on 
                        with you guys?

                                 GRADY
                        ...Nothing.

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

           Andrew and Lynda fire paint balls at splattered targets.

                                 LYNDA
                        What?

                                 ANDREW
                        I didn’t write the personal ad.  I 
                        just wanted to impress you.
                                (beat, no response)
                        It’s your turn to say something.

                                 LYNDA
                        Andrew...it’s one thing to have no 
                        backbone.  It’s another thing to be 
                        totally full of shit.

           She hands him her gun and leaves. Andrew watches. 

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           Grady and Caitlin sit on a rowboat and fish.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Let’s play a game.  Tell me
                        something I don’t know about you.

                                 GRADY
                        Like what?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well first of all, white elephant-
                        wise, how’d you end up in rehab?
                                 GRADY
                        I dunno.  I had a lotta problems in 
                        high school.  Got a full ride to 
                        Columbia, failed out of Columbia, 
                        lied my way into great jobs, self-
                        destructed my way out of them.  
                        Then I bumbled around a bit.  Petty 
                        crime, not so petty crime...I’m 
                        definitely an addict, even if I 
                        don’t act all coked up like one, 
                        but I actually went to address the 
                        underlying psychosis or whatever.  
                        And I didn’t want to go to some 
                        rich-kid-rehab where they sing 
                        Kumbaya and play kickball at one 
                        o’clock, so I voluntarily went to 
                        this place Phoenix House that’s 
                        basically a get-out-of-jail-free 
                        card for mandated felons.  It was a 
                        tough scene.  I did ninety days 
                        before jetting cuz they wouldn’t 
                        let me see a psychiatrist until I 
                        was half-way out the door.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What about your relationships?  
                        Friends, family, girlfriend...

                                 GRADY
                        I have like three friends.  And the 
                        last time I was in a relationship I 
                        was pretty awful, so...

                                 CAITLIN
                        How did it end?

                                 GRADY
                        ...It just sorta died one day. 
                                (beat)
                        Caitlin, I really like you.  But 
                        don’t get any ideas about me one 
                        day turning into Mr. Right.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well no offense, but your life is 
                        kinda empty right now.  But it is a 
                        blank slate, and I’m jealous of 
                        that.  And regardless of what they 
                        might say otherwise, most girls our 
                        age would settle for Mr. Right Now.

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah, well fortunately for them I
                        don’t qualify as Mr. Right or Mr.
                        Right Now.
                                 CAITLIN
                        I know you don’t.  You’re Mr. Not
                        Right Now.

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           They sit barefoot on the edge of a bridge that overlooks the lake.

                                 GRADY
                        A’right, your turn.  Something I 
                        don’t know about you.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Okay, well...um...okay.  There are
                        fifteen different animals in the
                        Animal Crackers cookie zoo.  
                        There’s a lion, monkey, elephant, 
                        gorilla, tiger, giraffe...cougar, 
                        kangaroo, seal, sheep, zebra, 
                        camel, hippopotamus...and bison.

                                 GRADY
                        No ducks?

                                 CAITLIN
                        There are also two bears.  One is
                        walking, the other one is sitting.

                                 GRADY
                        I can see why they gave you tenure.
                        Though telling me about Animal
                        Crackers is telling me something I
                        don’t know, as opposed to telling
                        me something I don’t know about 
                        you.  Right?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well I’m not too good at this game 
                        ...So what do your parents do?

                                 GRADY
                        Well...my father left when I was 
                        little.  He got re-married and I 
                        think he lives in Colorado now.  My 
                        mom had diabetes, and she died when 
                        I was in junior high, so my Aunt 
                        Liz looks after me.  Her and Darla.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh.

                                 GRADY
                        Oh.
                                 CAITLIN
                        I didn’t mean it like that.

                                 GRADY
                        No one does...I guess that’s why 
                        the drugs started.  Daddy jets, 
                        Mommy dies, wah-wah, piss-moan.  
                        But then when other shit happened, 
                        it got worse.  Quickly, too. 

                                 CAITLIN
                        ...My dad worked at home.  Dentist.  
                        My mom was a teacher, too, so she 
                        obviously worked outside the home.  
                        And I guess when I was around ten 
                        or eleven she began to think he 
                        might be cheating on her.  So one
                        day, when he was at home and she 
                        was at school, she sent him flowers 
                        with a card that said ‘I love you.’  
                        That’s it.  Just ‘I love you.’     
                        Unfortunately, when she got home 
                        that night, the flowers were 
                        nowhere to be found.  And he never 
                        said anything about them.  And 
                        that’s when she knew.

                                 GRADY
                        Wow.  You are good at this game.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Well I’ve had a lot of practice.  
                        The men in my life always seem to 
                        come equipped with more than one 
                        set of eyes.

           Caitlin stands, preparing to jump in the lake. Grady gets up, too.

                                 GRADY
                        You ready?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Yeah...Wait.

           She casually takes his hand in hers, fingers interlocking and all.

                                 GRADY
                        Jumping into a lake in February. 
                        This is the kinda thing I’d be 
                        missing if I were in New York right 
                        now.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You’d be missing a lot of things if 
                        you were in New York right now.
           She jumps, sort of pulling Grady with her, as he wasn’t ready.

           INT. DARLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           9:07. Grady speaks with Watson. She strokes the Baby in his crib.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. WATSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                 WATSON
                        In other news, a little birdie told 
                        me that you’ve made a new friend.

                                 GRADY
                        That bird’s a sweetie-pants, right?

                                 WATSON
                        I dunno, it depends.  To which bird 
                        are you referring?

                                 GRADY
                        ...Spending time with a girl isn’t 
                        in violation of anything.

                                 WATSON
                        It should be. 

                                 GRADY
                        Well it hasn’t gotten me in any 
                        trouble.

                                 WATSON
                        ...It will.

           She hangs up. Grady contemplates. After awhile, Darla appears. 

           Grady waits for her to speak. For some time, she doesn’t. Then...

                                 DARLA
                        In loco parentis?

           Caught off-guard, Grady waits for a long time as well.

                                 GRADY
                        It means ‘In place of a parent.’

           Again, they face off in a battle of dramatic pauses.

                                 DARLA
                        I’m not so sure that this is where 
                        you wanna be.  Maybe you should 
                        take a look at that.
           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Andrew stands amidst his ocean of artwork, which, save the ping-
           pong table and floor, covers every square inch of the basement. 

           He studies the room for a while, then walks over to some paint 
           cans and removes a lid. It’s jet black.

           He grabs a brush. Carries the paint over to a watercolor. 

           Andrew dips the brush. Methodically paints an “X” through it. 

           He does the same with another painting.

           After a moment spent studying the two “X’s”, he launches a major 
           offensive against the entire collection, going through his paint 
           reserves and heaving colors with the aid of anything he can find. 

           Andrew fills a glass with paint, shatters the mess against one 
           piece, throws an entire gallon can at another, etc.

           After destroying most everything, he comes to a happy painting of 
           his and Grady’s crab. Rather than destroying it, he finds a new 
           brush and makes a tiny adjustment. 

           A moment. Grady then reveals himself. 

                                 GRADY
                        Andrew...I’m sorry.

                                 ANDREW
                        ...No you’re not.

           Grady slowly shakes his head.

                                 GRADY
                        I know.

           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andrew goes through Grady’s things and finds a box of note cards. 

           He leafs through them, picks one, then seats himself at the desk.

           EXT. CAITLIN’S ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Caitlin’s on the phone with Grady.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Y’know I told my mom about you?

           INTERCUT WITH:
           EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Grady sits on the roof of his car and takes in the view.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        I told her I met the guy who wrote 
                        the Granta story.  She’s the one 
                        who originally got me into it.

                                 GRADY
                        So what did she say?

                                 CAITLIN
                        She said I should keep my distance.

                                 GRADY
                        Nice.  Now all I need is a scar 
                        under my eye and I’ll be pretty 
                        much irresistible.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Grady...if ya wanna be a writer and 
                        you’re nineteen, that’s great.  But 
                        when you’re twenty-seven it stops 
                        being a ‘When I grow up’ kinda 
                        thing.  You look up one day and 
                        your peers are achieving those 
                        goals.  So you get to this point in 
                        life where what you are...it’s what 
                        you’re gonna be.

                                 GRADY
                        ...I don’t think we should hang out
                        anymore.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Who says we’re hanging out?

                                 GRADY
                        I don’t mean hanging out-hanging 
                        out.  I mean hanging out period. 

                                 CAITLIN
                        Listen...I’m not gonna get all 
                        melodramatic with you before you 
                        hightail it outta here to Vancouver 
                        or Montana or wherever you end up.  
                        But I care about you, okay?  I 
                        think I have since before we ever 
                        met.  And yeah, if you were more 
                        stable, you might be the kind of 
                        guy I...play a little footsie with.

                                 GRADY
                        Thanks.
                                 CAITLIN
                        Thanks.

                                 GRADY
                        Well whaddaya want me to say?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Nothing, I was just hoping someone
                        with your verbal skill set would
                        have something a little more...
                        poignant to offer than that.

                                 GRADY
                        ...I don’t think we should hang out 
                        anymore.

           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andrew writes Lynda’s card. 

           He finishes, strikes a match, then lights a candle. 

           Finally, he drips wax on the envelope. It dries.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The next day. Vanessa and Will sit back-to-back and toss rocks at 
           their respective soda can targets.

                                 WILL
                        Y’know, I’m not going either, so...

                                 VANESSA
                        Oh, I’m going, I’m just grounded.

                                 WILL
                        How are you gonna swing that?

                                 VANESSA
                        I dunno.  But I love Valentine’s 
                        Day; I’m not missing it.

                                 WILL
                        Huh.  You don’t seem like the type.

                                 VANESSA
                        No, actually it’s New Year’s that
                        gets me down.  Valentine’s Day, 
                        like half the people are miserable 
                        anyway, but on New Year’s, a) it 
                        seems like everyone has someone, 
                        and b) it’s a new year, which just 
                        stinks in principle, obviously.
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Vanessa and Will walk further into the woods. 

           LATER

           They sit on the edge of a creek and collect water samples.

           The pair employ eye droppers, slides, and microscopes as they 
           study tiny organisms and such.

                                 WILL
                        Do you believe in fate?  Or in God?

                                 VANESSA
                        Um...I guess.  I mean given the 
                        proper context, yeah, who doesn’t?

                                 WILL
                        Okay, so then assuming there’s both 
                        a heaven and hell, what’s your idea
                        of a personal hell?

                                 VANESSA
                        I dunno, a DH in the National 
                        League?  Why, what’s yours?

                                 WILL
                        To spend all eternity in the Louvre 
                        with Caravaggio’s Amor Victorious
                        -- but with a blindfold on.

                                 VANESSA
                        So hell would be -- at least as you
                        conceive it -- hell would be you, 
                        in a museum, blindfolded.

                                 WILL
                        With a painting.

                                 VANESSA
                        With a painting.  That’s it.  No
                        fire and flames, no reptile/snake 
                        action, no masturbating babies, 
                        none of that.  Just...

                                 WILL
                        Well there’s other things, I mean
                        ...being trapped in a library with 
                        four million copies of The Da Vinci 
                        Code?
                                 VANESSA
                        You hate The Da Vinci Code?  That’s 
                        awesome; I hate it, too.

           Will studies her as she peers into her microscope.

                                 WILL
                        It’s Heather’s favorite.

                                 VANESSA
                        What does a kid who cuts class to 
                        play with microscopes see in a girl 
                        like that?  Why did you like her?

                                 WILL
                        Proximity...Proximity and chance.  
                        That’s how you end up with people.

           A moment. Will peers into his microscope, and she watches him.

           INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Grady drives around. After awhile, he stops at a red light.

           He looks to his left and sees a cemetery.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Andrew walks down the hall. Lynda spots him and jogs to catch up.

                                 LYNDA
                        Hey.  Listen, I’m sorry I took off 
                        like that.  Well...I’m not, but --

                                 ANDREW
                        -- We’re both wearing black.  Is 
                        that by design?

                                 LYNDA
                        You think too much.

           They stand there awhile. Lynda walks away. Andrew watches. Then...

                                 ANDREW
                        Lynda.

           She turns. Andrew thumbs through a book, finds the card he wrote. 

           He approaches and offers it to a confused Lynda.
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Vanessa plays with matches. Burns leaves, etc. Grady approaches.

                                 GRADY
                        Listen.  I had lunch with Mom, and 
                        I think she’s worried about you.  
                        Not worried-worried, but like...
                        Vanessa, why are you so angry?

                                 VANESSA
                        ...Have you ever heard the phrase 
                        ‘Beauty is an accident’?

                                 GRADY
                        Yeah, I’ve heard it.  I mean...I’ve
                        never heard it, but I’m familiar.

                                 VANESSA
                        Guys only like me for how I look.

                                 GRADY
                        That’s self-indulgent.  It’s also 
                        bullshit; there’s plenty of great 
                        guys out there.

                                 VANESSA
                        I agree, but it’s not even about 
                        that...Nobody’s ever gonna like me 
                        for how I make them feel.

                                 GRADY
                        ...You’re probably right.
                                (beat, echoing Watson)
                        But you might wanna take a chance 
                        on life.  Love, too.

                                 VANESSA
                        Oh, really?  And if I don’t?

                                 GRADY
                        If you don’t...love might decide to 
                        take its chances with you.

           Vanessa gets up, then hands Grady her matches.

                                 VANESSA
                        Here.  Do something productive with 
                        these.

           She walks away.

           Grady looks at the matchbook cover. It features a red heart.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Meghan and Caitlin read. Grady appears.

                                 GRADY
                        Meggie, can I talk to Ms. Fountain 
                        in private?

                                 MEGHAN
                        No, we’re about to finish my book.
                                (beat, feeling the heat)
                        But it’s Nancy Drew.  You love 
                        Nancy Drew.

                                 GRADY
                                (irritated)
                        Nancy Drew is the biggest prude in 
                        the history of young-adult fiction, 
                        a’right?  That’s all you need to 
                        know; now go.

                                 MEGHAN
                        But she’s about to crack the case!

                                 GRADY
                        Meghan.  If the girl dated Ned
                        Nickerson from 1930 until 1979
                        without ever going past first base,
                        she can wait fucking two minutes 
                        for me and Ms. Fountain to have a 
                        fight.

           Meghan sighs and closes the book.

           She approaches Grady, smacks him in the butt with it, gives it up. 

           She leaves as Grady sees the cover: The Secret of the Old Clock.

                                 GRADY
                        Hey.

           Meghan turns around. Grady taps the clock on the book’s cover.

                                 GRADY
                        The minute hand on the clock points
                        to where the minister’s body is 
                        buried.  Bess and George figure it
                        out and tell Hannah Gruen, Hannah 
                        Gruen tells Nancy, and Nancy pins 
                        it on the farmhand...He used a 
                        pitchfork, I think.  I don’t 
                        remember.

           Meghan squints her eyes, then leaves the room.
                                 CAITLIN
                        Are you gonna see Andrew’s stuff 
                        tonight?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno, I think I might head over 
                        to the batting cages.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What’s with this family and sports?

                                 GRADY
                        Cuz sports aren’t about thinking; 
                        they’re about action and reaction.  
                        You can disappear in the moment and 
                        just...live.  And they need that.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Y’know, you think you’re so unique, 
                        but you’re no different than anyone 
                        else.  And that’s not a bad thing, 
                        it’s just...you’re not special.

                                 GRADY
                        I never said I was.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You implied it.  That’s worse.

                                 GRADY
                        Caitlin, are you aware of the fact 
                        that my best friend in this world 
                        is an eight-year-old girl?  All we 
                        have to talk about is makeup and 
                        skateboarding.  And y’know what?  
                        There’s only so much I know about 
                        fucking skateboarding!

                                 CAITLIN
                        Y’know...there’s a reason why you 
                        haven’t had a girlfriend in four 
                        years.

                                 GRADY
                        Four-and-a-half years.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Whatever.  I just wanted to be your 
                        friend.  I would never think of you 
                        that way.

                                 GRADY
                        Four-and-a-half...years.
           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Grady, ready to make a change, sits across from an OLD WOMAN.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        What are you in for?

                                 GRADY
                        Me?  I dunno...chronic truancy?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Truancy?

                                 GRADY
                        And despair.  Don’t forget despair.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Grady and DR. LEE do their best imitation of Grady and Dr. Rosen.

                                 GRADY
                        The only reason they finally gave 
                        me some face time with the doctor 
                        was cuz my shit was packed.  And 
                        while my requests were probably 
                        denied due in large part to the 
                        fact that I wasn’t exactly a model 
                        citizen what with the quote-unquote 
                        urinal fiasco and such...I also 
                        think some of that behavior has to 
                        do with my general sorta...fucked 
                        up-edness.  It’s a vicious cycle.

                                 DR. LEE
                        You mean a self-fulfilling 
                        prophecy?

                                 GRADY
                                (right on his heels)
                        That too.

                                 DR. LEE
                        What do you want out of life?

                                 GRADY
                                (long beat, changing gears)
                        It’s my impression that when you go 
                        for analysis, it’s not this thing 
                        where the doctor tells you what’s 
                        wrong with you and what to do.  
                        It’s more them asking questions so 
                        you can draw your own conclusions 
                        and find your own answers.
                                 DR. LEE
                        That’s fair.

                                 GRADY
                        Well...I’m starting to figure out 
                        that these people I’ve spent nine 
                        years with, for five-six days a 
                        week, they’re basically my de facto 
                        family.  That void has been filled.  
                        But the question is, I may not want 
                        to use because I don’t want to hurt 
                        them, but what’s going to keep me 
                        from using?  It’s always been a two-
                        part question.  And the discovery 
                        is that I think Caitlin was healing 
                        some of the wounds left by Diane.

                                 DR. LEE
                        But what makes her so special?

                                 GRADY
                        ...She likes what she sees.

           Dr. Lee holds on him. Forever. And ever. Repeating...

                                 DR. LEE
                        What do you want out of life?

                                 GRADY
                                (long beat)
                        Hope.

           INT. VANESSA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Vanessa, under the covers. The clock reads 7:02. 

           A rhythmic knock on her door. It opens. Andrew’s hand appears. 

           It offers a sharp, deliberate, military-style “point” sign, as if 
           they’re proceeding with caution down a hallway, ready to ambush 
           some unseen enemy. He follows it with a similarly sharp “OK” sign.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Vanessa heads for Darla’s SUV and climbs into the back space.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A loud Grady, Andrew, and Meghan carry on. 

           Darla stands in her doorway as she puts on an earring.
           Her cell phone RINGS. (It’s Single Dad.) The kids are still loud.

                                 DARLA
                        Hello?...Oh hi...I’m great; how are 
                        you?  I didn’t expect you to call 
                        ...I dunno; I just didn’t.

           Darla does that whole bit where you talk on the phone and smile, 
           all the while holding eye contact with whomever you’re with. 

           In the middle of smiling and chatting, and while holding the eye 
           contact with the kids, she nonchalantly swings her door shut.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Darla and the kids are on school grounds, behind another car. 

           The lead car moves, and our gang sees a speed bump.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Grady drives fast over the bump.

                                 DARLA
                        I’m not your playmate, sweetie, I’m
                        your mother.

                                 ANDREW
                        C’mon, mom.  Live a little.

           Darla slowly progresses forward, then stops and waits.

                                 ANDREW
                        What’s wrong?

           Darla puts the car in reverse and backs up about twenty feet. 

           She then floors it and nails the speed bump.

           This comes much to the delight of her kids. Vanessa, however, goes 
           flying against the tailgate and cups her nose in pain.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           On his way to the art exhibits, Andrew walks down an empty hall. 

           Caitlin appears at the other end, behind him.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Hey!

           Andrew turns around. They slowly walk towards one another.
                                 CAITLIN
                        You look nice.

           She straightens his tie and smoothes his blazer.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Is uh...is Grady here?

                                 ANDREW
                        No, he’s probably listening to The 
                        Sound of Silence right about now.  
                        Maybe Morrissey.  Why, were you...

                                 CAITLIN
                        No.  I was just hoping for a sign.

                                 ANDREW
                        Well I’ll be sure to tell him that.

           She ruffles his hair, then walks away.

                                 ANDREW
                        Ms. Fountain?

           She turns around.

                                 ANDREW
                        Happy Valentine’s Day.

                                 CAITLIN
                        ...Happy Valentine’s Day, Andrew.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Vanessa’s nose bleeds. She stuffs it with toilet paper.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The Ball is in full swing. 

           IN ONE CORNER

           Jocelyn and other GIRLS dance with one another, sans dates. 

           Vanessa arrives and pokes Jocelyn, whose jaw drops.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           An open medicine cabinet. A hand reaches for a small bottle and 
           turns it. We see a mouthwash label. 
           The hand takes the bottle and twists it open. After a swig is 
           taken, the bottle is placed back. The hand closes the cabinet.

           Will’s reflection in the mirror. He swishes, rinses, then stares.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Grady has a chair pulled up to the ping-pong table as he eyes the 
           blank page on a typewriter. He writes: 

                                 GRADY
                        The most inspired choice a man can
                        make is to wander the path towards 
                        a woman’s heart.
                                (beat, then resumes)
                        Unfortunately, much time has passed 
                        since I have last been out for a 
                        walk.

           Grady evaluates. He removes the page and starts anew. 

           The words appear fast, letter-by-letter, resulting in levity.

                                 GRADY
                        Why, oh why, have not the Chinese
                        ever invented a sandwich?  
                        Thousands of years of innovation 
                        and progress, and not one of those 
                        Ming dynasty dickfucks could think 
                        to slap some meat between some 
                        bread?  Every culture I know of has 
                        a sandwich of one kind or another, 
                        and all these people can do is chop 
                        everything into bite-sized pieces.
                                (beat, then resumes)
                        Damn, wouldn’t a General Tso 
                        sandwich hit the spot, if it used a 
                        whole breast of chicken, and was 
                        put on some tasty bread?  But no, I 
                        won’t be having that tonight, 
                        because some aforementioned Ming 
                        dynasty dickfuck thought it more 
                        important to polish jade all day 
                        instead of inventing a sandwich.  
                        No wonder they’re all a bunch of 
                        communists.  Sandwich = Democracy.

           Unsatisfied, he once again removes the page and starts over.

                                 GRADY
                        A kiss on the cheek from the right 
                        girl will make you reconsider
                        everything you hold to be true and
                        certain.
           Grady mulls it over. Satisfied, he hits “Enter.”

           INT. ART ROOM - NIGHT

           Andrew and Mrs. Benson. The latter appears on the verge of tears.

                                 MRS. BENSON
                        It’s all my fault; I am so sorry, 
                        Andrew.  They already decided by 
                        the time I got here.  I couldn’t --  

                                 ANDREW
                        What happened?  I mean...

                                 MRS. BENSON
                        I left a note for Mr. Kahn that 
                        your book was third from the top on 
                        the first stack, but he used your 
                        second book.  Andrew, I’m sorry; 
                        everyone knows Joelle isn’t half 
                        the artist you are.  Your building 
                        schematics would have won; I know.

           INT. LYNDA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lynda flips channels, but after awhile, turns the TV off.

           She eyes her backpack. Gets up, rifles through it, finds Andrew’s 
           card: “Miss Lynda Carr.” She breaks the seal, studies the print. 

           She opens the card. It says, quite simply, “Nine o’clock.”

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Andrew sits against some lockers, head in hands.

           Someone approaches. Andrew looks up to see Rob Hildreth.

                                 HILDRETH
                        Are you crying?

           Long silence. 

                                 HILDRETH
                        I uh...I saw your stuff.  You did a 
                        really great job, dude.  Seriously.  
                        It took balls to go out on a limb 
                        and do something like that.

           Hildreth extends his hand. Andrew takes it, and they shake.
           EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

           As he did on Page 1 (minus the cocaine), Grady the shortstop works 
           his skillful back and forth magic as he disappears in the moment.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The crowd dances. 

           Will appears in street clothes. He scans the gym for Vanessa. 

           He spots her, then cuts through the crowd. 

           He taps her on the back and she turns around.

                                 WILL
                        Let’s dance.

                                 VANESSA
                        ...Together?

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Lynda, also in street clothes, pulls up on her bike. 

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Now everyone’s slow dancing. Vanessa and Will, too. 

           With their heads side-to-side so they can’t see one another...

                                 WILL
                        Listen...I have a thing for you, 
                        okay?  I know you’re not the type 
                        who’d be crazy about the idea of a 
                        guy who just split up with someone, 
                        but whatever.  I think you’re this 
                        really tenacious, brilliant girl, 
                        and I’m only mean to you cuz I 
                        don’t think you have any idea how 
                        hard normal girls have it.

                                 VANESSA
                        Are you wearing Abercrombie?  It’s 
                        kinda bourgeois, no?

                                 WILL
                        Shut up.  I spent like a half-hour 
                        memorizing this; I don’t wanna lose 
                        my train of thought.  
                                      (MORE)
                                      WILL (CONT'D)
                        Um...I think it’s ironic that 
                        society values you for your 
                        external beauty, when you’re a 
                        model for what a girl should be 
                        like internally.  You’re 
                        incredible.  Crotchety as hell, but 
                        incredible.

                                 VANESSA
                        Y’know, all this like...emo shit?  
                        I need you be cold and dismissive.  
                        Girls like that.  Treat us like 
                        crap and we’ll love you forever.  
                        ...That’s how it goes, Will.

           He pulls back. They stare. He then leans in and kisses her lips.

                                 WILL
                        I like it when you call me William.

           INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Lynda checks out the art show.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Andrew makes his way to the nearest exit.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Vanessa and Will, still slow dancing.

           INT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Back to Lynda, checking out exhibits. 

           She comes to one and stops in her tracks.

           She turns around and looks at the opposite wall.

           She turns back to the first wall, and sees a ton of neatly framed, 
           black-and-white pencil selections from Andrew’s sketchbook.

           They are all portraits of her.

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Andrew exits through doors that lead to green fields, then walks 
           through the darkness.
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lynda accosts STUDENT #3.

                                 LYNDA
                        Have you seen Andrew Keiling?

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Lynda walks out the doors.

           She peers through the darkness, then spots Andrew in the distance. 

           She hurriedly walks after him.

           As Lynda closes the gap, Andrew feels a presence and turns. 

           Lynda slows down, walks the last ten yards, then hugs him upon her 
           arrival. They continue their hug as music PLAYS in the distance.

           Their hug morphs into slow dancing. 

           They pull back a bit, and Lynda moves in for a kiss. 

           They make out, then hug some more.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Vanessa and Will, also making out.

           EXT. DUCK POND - NIGHT

           A pensive Caitlin sits at her and Grady’s duck pond.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Grady stares at the burning fireplace.

           EXT. CEMETERY (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Grady and the frame, flowers on glass. He sets down the fasteners 
           with a coin, then finally flips the frame over. 

           The background is done in pink petals, while the foreground, a 
           heart, is done in red ones.

           The headstone reads, “Elizabeth Herman 1953-1991.” 

           Underneath the dates it reads, “Daughter of Two, Mother of One.”
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

           A weak Diane in bed. Monitors and machines blink and flash. 

           Grady watches over her as she drifts in and out of consciousness.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. DUCK POND (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Page 31: Grady’s all contemplative as he feeds some ducks. We now 
           pick back up again with Vanessa’s speech/Diane’s yearbook entry. 

                                 DIANE (V.O.)
                        What can I say to someone who I 
                        have both despised with every ounce 
                        of my being, but have also loved 
                        more fully than I have ever known 
                        or thought possible?  There has 
                        always been some indescribable pull 
                        that has drawn me to you, despite 
                        the fighting, despite the hurt, 
                        despite the tears.  And regardless 
                        of everything, we share undeniable, 
                        intense emotions.  They are 
                        powerful and volatile, sentimental 
                        and strong.  And they are for one 
                        another.  Two people can feel 
                        everything for someone else, larger 
                        than themselves.  I have told you 
                        before, and will tell you again.  I 
                        Love You.  (Grady, I think I do.)  
                        We have both almost ruined one 
                        another, but we have also had some 
                        absolutely amazing moments.  You 
                        fascinate me: your smile, your 
                        voice, your hands, your lips.  I 
                        think I made a promise to myself 
                        never to fall in love in high 
                        school.  Too late, I suppose.  
                        Because these feelings cannot be 
                        denied.  We both know, however, 
                        that others will come along, and 
                        our feelings will undoubtedly 
                        shift.  But know this: In my heart 
                        there will always be this warm 
                        place no one else’s anything could 
                        ever touch.  It’s filled with 
                        incredible words and wonderfuls.  
                        You fascinate me, captivate me, 
                        mesmerize me.  With a part of 
                        myself I never knew I had, I feel 
                        this flame and fire for you.

                        And you frustrate me and make me 
                        break and bring me to sobs, but I 
                        don’t care.  I don’t care.  I have 
                        thought it over, analyzed my 
                        faults, rejected it all.  And yet, 
                        time and time again, I take one 
                        look into your eyes, and yes, I am 
                        in love.  Again.  Maybe you’ll look 
                        back at this and laugh.  Why?  
                        Well, why not?  But maybe, just 
                        maybe, you’ll save some tiny, 
                        miniscule spot in your heart and 
                        memory for me.
                                (beat)
                        Maybe.  I love you, always.  Diane.

           A few moments pass. Grady leans in and gently kisses her lips.

                                 DIANE
                        Talk about the kiss of death, huh?
                                (long beat)
                        I cheated on you.  With the art 
                        director from the Zac Posen go-see.
                                (beat)
                        I’m so sorry...I love you, Grady.

                                 GRADY
                        ...Of course you do.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Darla, Andrew, and Meghan exit the SUV and make their way inside. 

           Vanessa waits, then does the same.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Grady, in front of the toilet -- just like he stood after his face-
           off with Diane on Page 27. 

           He fingers the bag, and for a long time. He examines it up close.

           Grady then drops in the bag, flushes, and watches it go down. 

           It disappears. He stares at the still, clear water.

           INT. MEGHAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Meghan in pajamas. Grady sits behind her, making French braids.

                                 GRADY
                        So when am I gonna meet Cary 
                        Volkman?
                                 MEGHAN
                        He’s gonna come over and play on 
                        Tuesday.  That’s when I go back.

                                 GRADY
                        Cool...Meghan, how are you doing 
                        with being out here and all?

                                 MEGHAN
                        I like it.  I miss Daddy, though.

                                 GRADY
                        I know.  I miss mine, too.

           INT. GRADY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Grady plays with a phone. Darla pops in.

                                 DARLA
                        Who are you calling?

                                 GRADY
                        No one.  I’m just dialing the phone 
                        numbers of girls from high school.  
                        360-8093, 584-2016, 724-5974...

                                 DARLA
                        Are you pranking their parents?

                                 GRADY
                        No, I’m just listening to the sound 
                        it makes when you dial.  The tones.

                                 DARLA
                        I used to do that sometimes.

                                 GRADY
                        You did?

                                 DARLA
                        Yeah...I used to do a lot of 
                        things.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Again, Grady at the fireplace. Wine box on lap, he reads letters. 

           After awhile, he gets up and feeds them to the fire, one by one.

           Next, he throws in his candles, then watches them melt.

           Finally, he adds the box, then watches it burn.
           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Grady turns on the lights. 

           He looks around, then finds a hose of sorts.

           He opens the car’s gas flap, unscrews the cap, inserts the hose.

           INT. MEGHAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Grady sits on the side of Meghan’s bed. He shakes her awake.

                                 GRADY
                        Andrew has that paint.  That white 
                        paint?  Where did you move it?

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Grady rummages around the garage. A sleepy Meghan enters.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Grady, what are you doing?

                                 GRADY
                        I’m going to Ms. Fountain’s house.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Why?

                                 GRADY
                        She’s looking for a sign.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Does Mommy know?
                                (beat, no answer)
                        I’m coming with you.

                                 GRADY
                        Go to bed, Meghan.

                                 MEGHAN
                        I’m coming or I’m telling Mom.

           Grady saunters over and lowers his face down to hers.

                                 GRADY
                        What are you trying to say?

                                 MEGHAN
                        ...I think I just said it.
                                 GRADY
                        Sweetie, I’m not letting you come.

                                 MEGHAN
                        Why not?

                                 GRADY
                        Because it’s the right thing to do.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Focused and on a mission, Grady drives.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           On the street in front of Caitlin’s house, Grady lies on his side.

           He uses a brush to paint a large white line.

           LATER

           He paints in red.

           LATER

           It’s been a couple of hours now. The painting continues.

           LATER

           Grady oh-so-carefully pours liquid over the white lines.

           LATER

           He surveys his work, then pulls a phone out of his pocket. 

           INT. CAITLIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The phone RINGS. From under the covers, Caitlin’s arm appears.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Out of Grady’s pocket comes the book of matches Vanessa gave him. 

           He rips them all from the cover and strikes them up.

           Grady crouches by the white outline that he covered with gasoline.

           He drops the matches on the white. 

           Whoompfh!  Flames rise up and travel all along the line.
           INT. CAITLIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Caitlin, phone in hand, walks to the window.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Caitlin sees two enormous red hearts outlined in white, both of 
           which are similarly outlined in flames.

           The second heart’s flames come full circle just as she realizes 
           what’s she’s looking at.

           Grady is nowhere to be seen.

           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Grady drives. After a bit, he pops in a CD. Morrissey and The 
           Smith’s “Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want” PLAYS.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Morning coffee.

                                 GRADY
                        I just think it’s time...Aunt Liz, 
                        y’know?  I’m all she has.  She’s 
                        all I have.

                                 DARLA
                        Do you really believe that?

                                 GRADY
                        No.

                                 DARLA
                        ...I sure hope not.

           INT. ANDREW’S ROOM - DAY

           Andrew holds a deer skull. Grady sits next to him.

                                 GRADY
                        When I ditched Phoenix House I had 
                        to walk along these train tracks to 
                        get to the closest station.  There 
                        were all these deer bones, so...I 
                        really don’t know what to say.
                                 ANDREW
                        Me neither.

                                 GRADY
                        Well...we’ll figure something out.

                                 ANDREW
                        We always do.

           INT. VANESSA’S ROOM - DAY

           Grady hands Vanessa a silver heart pin that says “Love.”

                                 GRADY
                        What’s more important than blood?

                                 VANESSA
                        ...Love.
                                (beat)
                        I gotta admit, I was hoping you 
                        were gonna pull out a Birkin bag.

                                 GRADY
                        It’s not real silver.  Sorry.

                                 VANESSA
                        You should be.

           She looks at it for quite awhile, then pins it on his shirt.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Grady and Meghan camp out for the night in a tent. 

           Meghan holds one of Diane’s old t-shirts. She puts it to her face.

                                 MEGHAN
                        It smells like her.
                                (beat)
                        Grady...does it ever go away?

                                 GRADY
                        Does what ever go away?

                                 MEGHAN
                        The pain.

           He holds on her, then slowly nods his head, indicating a “Yes.”

                                 GRADY
                        No.

           They sit in silence. She kisses his forehead.
           EXT./INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Darla drives Grady to LAX, a matching bookend to their first meet.

           After awhile, he wisely clicks on his seatbelt.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Grady, his bags, and a small fishbowl with his and Andrew’s crab.

                                 DARLA
                        Call me as soon as you land.  Have 
                        Aunt Liz call, too.
                                (beat)
                        I love you, Grady.

           He pauses before the moment of truth, then finally delivers.

                                 GRADY
                        I love you too, Darla...Good luck 
                        on your date.  Love is an illusion, 
                        right?

                                 DARLA
                        We’ll see.  Any advice?

                                 GRADY
                        ...Gingerbread.

                                 DARLA
                        You’re my oldest baby.  You know
                        that, right?

           Grady puts down his things. They hug.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Caitlin pushes papers. Andrew appears at the door and approaches.

           She looks at him, then returns to her work. 

           Andrew retrieves a card and places it on the desk. 

           She looks over at it and breathes deeply. Andrew then leans across 
           the desk and kisses her on the cheek for one long, awkward second.

           Caitlin freezes. Andrew pulls away and resumes his position.

           Caitlin doesn’t look at him, and she doesn’t move for quite a bit. 

           Finally, she does look up.
                                 ANDREW
                        Grady said that when he gets some 
                        money together, he would give me 
                        fifty dollars if I gave you a kiss 
                        on the cheek for him...Um...I said 
                        I would never do it for less than a 
                        hundred, and he said ‘deal.’

           EXT. DUCK POND - DAY

           Caitlin walks over to a boulder. 

           Once there, she climbs aboard, then examines Grady’s card.

           The envelope reads, “Ms. Caitlin Fountain.” 

           She breaks the wax seal, opens, reads, then looks across the pond.

           She reads once more. 

           Black calligraphy says something that we can’t see. 

           Again, she looks out across the pond. 

           A small smile.

           EXT. LAX (BENCH) - DAY

           Grady, joined by an OLD MAN, sits on the same bench from Page 8.

                                 OLD MAN
                        What’s in New York for you?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno.  Home, I guess.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I lived in New York for a while.  
                        Chelsea, Hoboken, Murray Hill... 
                        One thing I realized is that New 
                        York isn’t really anyone’s home.  
                        It’s a port city.  Always will be.

           The Old Man offers a subtle smile.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Home, you see...it’s where the 
                        heart is.

           A nod towards the pen Grady’s been fiddling with.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Looks like a Dear Jane letter.
                                 GRADY
                        Oh, no.  I wanna write a book.  I 
                        literally just started a few days 
                        ago, so...maybe in a couple years.

                                 OLD MAN
                        What’s it gonna be about?

                                 GRADY
                        I dunno.  Love, death...life.
                                (beat)
                        I was thinking about calling it  
                        The Amazing Adventures of the 
                        Heterosexual Makeup Artist.

                                 OLD MAN
                        The Amazing Adventures...

                                 GRADY
                        The Amazing Adventures of the 
                        Heterosexual Makeup Artist.  Maybe 
                        about like a twenty-something who’s 
                        a makeup artist, and all his little 
                        dating adventures with girls.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Art imitating life, is it?

                                 GRADY
                        Nah.  And it’s just one idea.  I 
                        don’t know what I’ll write about or 
                        what to call it, but those things 
                        tend to sort themselves out.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Well good luck.

                                 GRADY
                                (long beat, wry smile)
                        I don’t need it.

                                                       FADE OUT.

                                      THE END
