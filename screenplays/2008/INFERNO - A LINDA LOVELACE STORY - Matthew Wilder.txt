                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 When I was a little girl, my 
                                 grammaw used to say, the whole 
                                 world is made up of angels. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 She said everything you ever see, 
                                 no matter how bad it seems, it’s 
                                 all made up of little angels in- 
                                 side it. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 The man on the corner. The trash 
                                 outside your house. The teacher 
                                 that nobody liked and the snake 
                                 in the grass—-every bit of it, ‘s 
                                 all made up of little angels. So 
                                 tiny...ya can’t even see ‘em. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
           EXT. OPEL CADET – DAY 

           We are looking through the windshield of a 1970 Opel Cadet, a dun-colored car that 
           looks a bit like a boxy version of a Dodge Dart. There’s no one there for a long  
           beat; and then LINDA BOREMAN gets in, 24, pretty, brown-haired. She sits at the  
           steering wheel, thinks for a moment, then starts it up. We move with her as she  
           drives past the identical manicured lawns of what we now call a  
           “gated community.” 

           LINDA smiles out the window as she sees the people in her community.  
           An old lady walks along the sidewalk, her elbow held by a handsome  
           young hippie dude with long hair. The mailman chats with a black  
           woman in an orange cocktail dress. A Jehovah’s Witness team in  
           identical shirts and ties talks to a group of little kids. 

           The wind ruffles the trees as a little-league team struggles to  
           make a comeback. A man and woman hold hands on a park bench. He  
           snuggles his head on her shoulder, as if seeking comfort. 

           The sun breaks through the clouds. Two little Mexican girls skip  
           arm in arm, singing a song we can’t hear. LINDA’s smile is broad  
           now. 

                                 But my grammaw didn’t live in the 
                                 world I live in. She didn’t see 
                                 the things I see. ‘Cause she didn’t  
                                 have to. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 When I was a little girl I 
                                 always believed what grammaw 
                                 said in my heart of hearts.  
                                 You could find a particle of 
                                 good in anything. And any human 
                                 heart. 
           Somehow, a miracle: a hummingbird flutters right next to LINDA’s windshield. It  
           keeps pace with her. It keeps fluttering right outside the window. 

           LINDA’S FACE LIGHTS UP AND IS FILLED WITH JOY AS— 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I used to believe that every- 
                                 thing in the world was made 
                                 up of angels but I don’t any 
                                 more. Now I don’t know how to 
                                 tell you this in a way that’ll 
                                 make any sense, but... 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 ...everything changed for me 
                                 on that day. The way I saw me, 
                                 and the world, and everything 
                                 in it...it all changed that one 
                                 day. And I couldn’t for the life 
                                 of me tell you why. 
           WE SEE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET A LARGE BLACK VAN- 

           AND WE ALMOST HEAR THE TWO MEXICAN GIRLS SCREAMING AS THEY JUMP BACK...AND THE BLACK 
           VAN CROSSES THE STOP SIGN— 

           AND COMES BARRELING RIGHT AT THE CAMERA— 

           THE VAN SMASHES INTO LINDA’S OPAL CADET-- 

           INSIDE THE CADET WE GO SPINNING ROUND AND ROUND, 360 DEGREES, TWICE,  
           AS LINDA’S EYES FILL WITH FEAR— 

           AND WE HEAR A SICKENING SMASH AS THE CADET CAREENS INTO A LIGHT-POST. 

           EXT. LIGHT-POST – DAY 

           FAST FAST FAST DOLLY IN/ZOOM IN on the Opal Cadet. Smoke pours out of the  
           hood and the windshield is ENTIRELY SHATTERED AND SMEARED WITH BLOOD. Inside,  
           coughing, LINDA’s face has been mashed into hamburger. Her eye is grotesquely  
           contused and some of her teeth are jutting outof a slash across her lower lip,  
           as if they were coming out of her chin. She coughs, sounding as if she were  
           about to throw up. 

           Somehow she manages to get the dented driver’s-side door open. 

           Coughing, she bends over and looks the asphalt. She coughs and gags  
           at the same time. 

           Four teeth fall out of her mouth onto the pavement. 

           INT. HOSPITAL – DAY 

           Long pan up LINDA’s body, from her toes to her head, as she lies in  
           a hospital bed, covered with snakelike tubes, ventilators everywhere,  
           monitors...a woman attacked by machines. Especially surveillance devices. 

           EXT. LAWN – DAY 

           The lawn in front of LINDA’s house. Perfectly manicured. MR. DUFFY,  
           the old duffer across the street, is cutting the grass. A little  
           Asian girl rides on training wheels. 

           REVERSE ANGLE – LINDA THROUGH WINDOW 

           We see LINDA looking through her front-room window, sitting in a  
           CAA 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 An’ I’ll tell you somethin’ else 
                                 I never told anybody before. I had 
                                 a little fantasy...a daydream in 
                                 my mind when I sat at that window 
                                 an’ I hadda look at everybody 
                                 goin’ on with their lives... 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I had a thing I saw in my mind. 
                                 And it’s terrible, and I shouldn’t 
                                 say this, but I saw this picture 
                                 in my mind every day...an some- 
                                 how it seemed right... 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 It somehow got me through it, 
                                 thinkin’ a this one thing... 
                                 and I thought about it, every 
                                 single day... 

                                         I N F E R N O 

                           A   L I N D A   L O V E L A C E   S T O R Y

           chair, her foot up in a cast, in a wheelchair. Her face is still  
           banged up but not nearly as bad as it was. 

           SLOW ZOOM IN ON LINDA, her face impassive...looking, looking... 
           as everyday life goes on... 

           REVERSE ANGLE – THE LAWN 

           SLOW ZOOM IN from LINDA’s point of view on the lawn...the lawn  
           across the street...MR. DUFFY’s sprinklers go on...the birds fly  
           into the trees... 

           In a moment, LINDA’s lawn, the lawn across the street, the trees  
           and the houses— 

           --BURST INTO FLAME— 

           --and FIREBALLS REACH OUT TOWARD THE CAMERA— 

           --as these words zoom toward the viewer: 

           --and the awesome and terrifying sound of the opening of MOZART’S  
           40TH SYMPHONY fills the speakers of the theatre... 

           THE FORTIETH CONTINUES DURING THE FOLLOWING MONTAGE 

           INT. VFW HALL – DAY 

           As the FORTIETH goes on swooping, we slowly push in toward a mass of families  
           square-dancing at a VFW Hall. As we push in, we SLOWLY ZOOM  
           IN toward a sixtyish UNCLE square-dancing with his family...and, on every  
           turn, lightly pawing his beautiful young black-haired niece... 

                                 People say to me, Linda, there’s 
           CAA 

                                 no such thing as a hell. That’s 
                                 a made-up thing in books, and 
                                 it doesn’t exist. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 They don’t believe that it’s 
                                 real, but I’m here to tell you 
                                 that there is a hell. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 There is a hell and there are 
                                 devils and they have pitchforks 
                                 and boiling oil and there is a 
                                 lake of fire. All these things 
                                 are real, an’ I can testify it. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 ‘Cause I rode through a lake of 
                                 fire. I been there and I have 
                                 seen things I couldn’t tell you 
                                 --things I can’t even tell my- 
                                 self. 
           INT. GRADE SCHOOL – DAY 

           Push in on a classroom full of third-grade children. Slow zoom in as  
           we move in on a LITTLE BROWNHAIRED GIRL. A question is asked and with  
           a face full of happiness she raises her hand, then stands up as we  
           LAND ON HER FACE. 

           INT. HALLWAY – DAY 

           FAST FAST PUSH IN on a long hallway filled with small children’s  
           coats hung up on pegs. We carom around a corner and into a children’s  
           bathroom where the LITTLE GIRL is sitting up on a sink. The TEACHER, looking  
           very sad, kneels on the floor at her feet, his head on her knees, his hand  
           kneading her back. The GIRL bites her lip as we slowly ZOOM IN...as we land  
           we see that tears are flowing... 

           INT. GRADUATION – DAY 

           A BLOND GIRL hugs her enormous GRANDMA on graduation day. She smiles through  
           tears in her cap and gown...slow zoom in on her face. 

           EXT. FILLING STATION – DAY 

           In the middle of nowhere, a POLICE CAR zips past a filling station. There’s an  
           old ad for a Bob Hope special from like 1961 on a mini- 
           micro-billboard next to the cans of 10W40. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 All that time I didn’t even have 
                                 myself to hang onto. All I had 
                                 was my friendship with Jesus 
                                 Christ. And that was enough. 

           INT. FILLING STATION – DAY 

           Mozart’s Fortieth SWELLS as we BOOM DOWN FROM ABOVE on a dirty desk where the  
           CAA

                                 What I need for you to know is 
                                 this: Hell isn’t a place. It’s 
                                 not somewhere you go when you 
                                 die. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 ...You got to stand watch all 
                                 the time, every minute of the day, 
                                 to make sure you don’t wind up 
                                 inside it. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 ‘Cause I was there, I went right 
                                 through it and I know: it’s 
                                 right there, it’s everywhere  
                                 around us...right this second.

                                 No he isn’t. He’s just kinda 
                                 slow.

                                 Face up to the fact that Tim’s 
                                 a dumbass. It’s no reflection 
                                 on you. 
           hideous FILLING-STATION OWNER is fucking the BLOND GRADUATE...only from his  
           movements it looks more like he’s killing her... 

           INT. BARRACUDA – DAY 

           Inside a yellow 1972 Barracuda, LINDA sits silently next to CHUCK, a studly, 
           mustachioed guy who wears sunglasses at midnight. 

           ...slow PUSH IN ON LINDA’s face as the lights of the nighttime  
           streets flicker over her. 

           Mozart’s 40th segues into the Guess Who’s “These Eyes” as we see 

           TITLE CARD 

           EXT. LAWN – DAY 

           LINDA’s lawn. The wafting keyboard line of “These Eyes” washes  
           over images of LINDA and her friends in bikinis and little fold- 
           out beach chairs on LINDA’s lawn. 

           LINDA is tall and leggy and you can hardly see any scars. She has  
           big reflective sunglasses on. Her two best friends, BECKY and DONNA,  
           are also bikini-clad and sunglasses-wearing, and we pan over them as  
           they pass a Tupperware jug of Tang around and smoke a jay. “These  
           Eyes” gets louder. 
           CAA 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Just pass that on, willya? Fuck!

                                         LINDA 
                                 Where’s your guy? 

                                         BECKY 
                                 [inhaling] Awwww. Don’t talk 
                                 about Timmy any more ‘cause  
                                 you’re bringin’ me down. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Where’s your guy?  

                                         DONNA 
                                 What guy? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 The guy you said was gonna 
                                 take me to the Orange Palm 
                                 and buy me a Mustang and  
                                 whatnot. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Oh, Chuck? 

                                         BECKY 
                                 You’ll know it when Chuck’s here. 

                                         DONNA 
                                 He likes ta make an entrance. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I swear to God, you two are 
                                 like Heckle and Jeckle! Maybe 
                                 you oughta lay off the weed 
                                 for a minute. 

                                         DONNA 
                                 Don’ even say that. I looked 
                                 forward to this shit all week. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Trust us, Lind. This guy’s your 
                                 friggin’ ticket otta town, man. 
                                 He’s got the whole thing licked. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What whole thing? 
           BECKY and DONNA look at each other and giggle. 

           They burst into giggles again. 

           More goddam giggling. 

           BECKY takes off her shades and makes a goofy face at DONNA. 

                                         BECKY 
           CAA 

                                 I forgot what the fuck I was 
                                 talkin’ about! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Now is that a Linda Boreman 
                                 that I see before me? 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Hi Chuck. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 That would be me. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So... 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 ...What’s up, buttercup? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Doin’ all right. Yer friends 
                                 a Becky an’ Donna? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Oh I guess they’re pals a mine. 
                                 An’ ya know what I say. Any 
                                 Palomino is a pal a mine-o. 
           The two of them burst into belly laughs. 

           And then it happens. It comes scre-e-e-e-eaming up the nice gated-community street. 

           A yellow (and black-striped) 1970 Barracuda, mean-looking muscle car, tearassing  
           right up to LINDA’s driveway and ending with a second screeeeeech. And suddenly  
           These Eyes” gets really LOUD. Right at the best part (“Now the hurtin’s on  
           me, yeah/’Cause I’ll never be free, yeah”). PUSH IN ON LINDA’S EYES AS SHE  
           SEES THE DRIVER’S DOOR OPEN. 

           The driver’s-side door opens. Out comes a pair of spitshined Frye  
           boots. 

           We go up a pair of immaculate coulda-been-cut-with-a-razor Levis to  
           a brown leather jacket housing a black button-down shirt that houses  
           a weightlifter chest. On top of it all is a plush moustache, a  
           lantern jaw, and a pair of reflective sunglasses—-much harder-looking  
           than LINDA’s. This is CHUCK TRAYNOR, 35, a man among men, easy in  
           his own skin, yet somehow always managing to land in a physical  
           attitude that would look just right for a Miller High Life ad. 

           He stands towering above LINDA’s little chaise longue. 

           He extends a hand. 

           BECKY and DONNA bust out in shrieky giggles like CHUCK was all four Beatles  
           rolled into one. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I tell ya what Linda. Maybe you 
                                 wanna put some clothes on, we 
                                 could take a spin in this old 
           CAA 

                                 horse an’ see what the town has 
                                 to offer. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I could do that. I got banged 
                                 up in a car accident, I ain’t 
                                 seen much of a good time lately. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Well we gonna rectify that mat- 
                                 ter right quick. Ladies-—hate to 
                                 be rude. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 No, go on! We got our own fun 
                                 right here. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Okay, let’s hold it a sec, I’m 
                                 gettin’ all ahead a myself. 
                                 Lemme go back to the beginning. 
           LINDA takes off her sunglasses. 

           Another burst of goddam giggles. 

           OVERHEAD – WIDE – CHUCKMOBILE IN THE DRIVEWAY 

           As LINDA and CHUCK walk toward the Chuckmobile, we freeze frame  
           for a moment— 

           FREEZE FRAME – BRIGHT-FACED GIRL 

           A sunshiny brown-haired six-year-old LINDA, also in freeze  
           frame, smiles off camera. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] Now if you’d a seen me 
                                 when I was younger, you’d never 
                                 think I’d get messed up in the 
                                 things I did. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] I mean, I was a pretty 
                                 well-brought-up kid for the 
                                 most part. 
           We unfreeze and pull back to reveal a THIRD-GRADE CLASSROOM  
           where LINDA’S MOM and DAD are beaming as LITTLE LINDA 
           shows off a tray of winning butterscotch cupcakes in a  
           third-grade contest. 

           INT. SHOPPING MALL CIRCA 1962 – DAY 

           FAST PUSH IN from across a crowded shopping-center thorough- 
           fare to LINDA’S DAD talking to an ELDERLY RUSSIAN LADY who 
           seems utterly confused. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] My dad was an ex-Ana- 
           CAA 

                                 heim cop who retired young 
                                 and became a security guard. 

                                         DAD 
                                 Lady, I frankly don’t care 
                                 where you parked it. We don’t 
                                 offer that kinda service here. 
                                 Maybe at Lathrop’s they gotta 
                                 golf cart’ll take you around 
                                 to look, but this ain’t that 
                                 kinda place— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] The first year on the 
                                 job my dad was a pretty well- 
                                 adjusted happy camper but— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] –then he took to drink- 
                                 ing and he and my mom kinda 
                                 stopped talking. 

                                         DAD 
                                 God, fucking, dammit, FUCK! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] It was a funny thing— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] –the more he got hen- 
                                 pecked by my mom, and never 
                                 stood up to her...the more 
                                 he drank, and the angrier 
                                 he got at night. 
           INT. BASKETBALL COURT – DAY 

           FAST FAST FAST PUSH IN on DAD with an ARM AROUND LINDA as  
           she holds a basketball and beams. The other girls on 
           the team flank her.

           A TEENAGE LINDA cowers in her bed. 

           INT. LINDA’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT 

           The kitchen lights are on. DAD is in the house, clearly  
           soused off his ass. We can hear him strewing through  
           shit, pushing around pots and pans, digging through 
           the knife and spatula drawer. 

           INT. LINDA’S BEDROOM – NIGHT 

           LINDA turns out the light and pretends to be asleep. 

           INT. LINDA’S HOUSE – DAY 

           A beautiful Saturday morning. A radiant LINDA, in a skimpy 
           CAA 

                                         MOM 
                                 Linda, what the hell is this? 

                                         MORE ACTION! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What? It’s a magazine, Ma. 
                                 It’s what I read at the beau- 
                                 ty shop.

                                         LINDA 
                                 Wh—-I’d. I don’t know what  
                                 you’re talking about. 

                                         MOM 
                                 Is that what’s goin’ on up here? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [long stunned beat] Excuse me? 

                                         MOM

                                 the Brannigan kid is starting 
                                 up again. All over again. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I...why do you do this? 

                                         MOM 
                                 Why do I do it? Well, Lind.  
                                 I’ll tell ya— 

                                         MOM 
           tank top and teeny shorts, pulls a Shasta out of the  
           fridge, pets her dog Shnookums, and shimmies up the stairs 
           to the tune of that lounge-Muzak sixties favorite, “Music 
           to Watch Girls By.”  

           INT. LINDA’S BEDROOM – DAY 

           LINDA’s MOM vacuums LINDA’s room. She discovers something 
           nestled behind LINDA’s bed. 

           LINDA ambles her way into the bedroom just at the moment 
           MOM is waggling a Hollywood gossip mag in her face. 

           We see the cover: TROY DONAHUE – UNWED AND READY FOR 

           Pearl Harbor-style, MOM wallops LINDA in the face—-one-two, 
           then a third time, hard, leaving LINDA blushing and raw- 
           faced. 

                                 Stick out your hand.

                                         MOM 
                                 You touch shit and that’s 
                                 whatcha get. 

                                         MOM 
                                 JUST REMEMBER. I ALWAYS GOT AN 
                                 EYE ON YOU-- 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] But see, here’s the 
                                 thing. I don’t wantcha to 
                                 think it was all bad times. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] After high school I 
                                 owned a little flower shop 
                                 in town ‘cause the owner 
                                 retired. And I wasn’t too bad 
                                 at it. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] But here’s the funny 
                                 part, and maybe this has 
                                 something to do with what 
                                 happened to me: I had a  
                                 real problem with boys.  
                                 Not gettin’ ‘em, not that 
                                 at all. 

                                 The problem was...once I 
                                 had ‘em. 
           LINDA is holding back tears with all her might, but she 
           still proffers her hand. Seemingly a master of the quick 
           attack, MOM whips a tiny Bic lighter out of her pocket 
           and burns LINDA on the palm—-just enough for her to 
           withdraw her hand. 

           LINDA finally does burst into tears and runs out of the 
           room—-and we follow her, from the front, as she runs down 
           the stairs to safety— 

           Freeze frame. 

           EXT. FLORIST’S SHOP – DAY 

           LINDA poses with a SEMI-CRIPPLED OLD LADY—-they each hold up 
           a Van Gogh sunflower. Pull back to reveal a store full of 
           people, Opening Day banners, and MOM and DAD in front of 
           LINDA taking a picture with an old Polaroid camera. 

           INT. LOVER’S LANE – NIGHT 

           Teenage LINDA is parked with NOAH, 18, respectably handsome, 
           slightly-more-sensitive-than-a-letter-sweater-kind-of-guy. 
           “I’m Henry VIII, I Am” plays on the radio. 

           NOAH is so choked up with admiration his voice comes out as a  
           CAA 

                                         NOAH 
                                 Aw, Lind. I been diggin’  
                                 you for so long. Member 
                                 when I sat next to you in 
                                 American Issues? You just 
                                 smelled like a cucumber. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Aw, yeah, I remember that. 
                                 Heheh. Cucumber. 

                                         NOAH 
                                 You’d write comments on my 
                                 paper and stuff, an’ I just 
                                 wanted to touch you. 

                                         LINDA  
                                 Seriously? 

                                         NOAH 
                                 Aw, hell yeah. You just had 
                                 that cool hair that’d flip down 
                                 when you were writin’ a test. 
                                 I always wanted to just touch 
                                 it. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 For real? 

                                         NOAH 
                                 Aw yeah man. I been into you 
                                 for, like, months. 

                                         NOAH 
                                 I always thought it was so 
                                 cool you stuck up for that 
                                 fat chick Deeann. Everybody 
                                 was all pickin’ on her but 
                                 you were real sweet to her. 

                                         NOAH 
                                 You’re a good person, Linda. 
                                 I totally respect you. 
           near-whisper. 

           LINDA smiles; seemingly with some effort. 

           NOAH touches her hair. LINDA responds, leans into the touch 
           slightly. 

           LINDA looks at NOAH, waiting for something that doesn’t seem 
           on its way. 

           We PUSH IN ON THEIR FIRST KISS. NOAH’s kiss is worshipful, 
           respectful, but somehow holds something back. 

           LINDA PUSHES BACK INTO THE KISS, almost overwhelming NOAH, 
           who comes out of the clench. 

           NOAH, emboldened, unbuttons LINDA’s chaste butterscotch  
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] Y’see—-now, I see— 
                                 I shoulda been considerate 
                                 with those nice boys I grew 
                                 up with. But for whatever 
                                 reason, I felt I had this 
                                 hankerin’ for something... 
                                 Some’m different. I dunno. 

                                 Harder. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] So anyway. Linda 
                                 Boreman. An’ Chuck Traynor. 
                                 Day Number One. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 Now you gotta understand, okay, 
                                 I grew up in the suburbs, but I 
                                 was like a country girl.

           sweater. Beneath it lies a bra that evokes images of field-hockey practice.  
           NOAH paws her breasts—-or rather, doesn’t paw, exactly, but treats LINDA’s  
           breasts as sacred gems to be handled with care. 

           As NOAH’s hands dip down to caress the insides of LINDA’s 
           sun-kissed thighs, we see LINDA’S EYES again as ANOTHER 
           NOAH KISS fills the screen. 

           INT. HOUSE – DAY 

           CHUCK sips some coffee as LINDA switches from her bikini to a rather bland  
           sundress. She keeps the door open. He sees a little swatch of something till  
           she kicks the door closed gently. CHUCK decorously  
           looks out the window and sips his coffee as “These Eyes” segues  
           into the Guess Who’s “No Sugar Tonight.” 

           INT. HEAD SHOP – DAY 

           In this hippiefied head shop, CHUCK has LINDA try on a “Nehru jacket” (the 
           kind of Indian artifact you might see George Harrison wearing  
           in the “Magical Mystery Tour” era). She laughs hysterically as this  
           foreign garment covers her whole chest like a burger-joint smock. 

           INT. STEVO’S STEAK JOINT – NIGHT 

           CHUCK has MARLON, the headwaiter, pour his very best selection of  
           box wine. Football is playing on the tube and there’s a lot of  
           wood paneling. LINDA is gobsmacked. 

                                 Chuck just had to put on the 
                                 dog a little bit and I was 
                                 blown away. I went out with 
                                 boys that had paper routes and 
                                 worked at a taco stand. This? 
                                 It was crazy. I felt like the 
                                 Queen of England. 
           CAA 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Good night, Pumpkin Lips. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Pumpkin Lips? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 That’s what I call all my 
                                 friends. Only if I really  
                                 like ‘em. 
           EXT. LINDA’S HOUSE – NIGHT 

           LINDA and CHUCK stand at the door. 

           CHUCK steals a little peck and walks away fast. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 That one’s just a loaner.  
                                 You’ll get more later. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Is that a fact? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [walking away] Yup. Tomorrow 
                                 I wantcha to meet my friend 
                                 Juan Jose. He works in con- 
                                 struction. Otherwise known as 
                                 Pumpkin Lips. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You have a good night now, weirdo. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You know I fully intend to. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 All that night...I thought about 
                                 nothin’ but Chuck, until I fell  
                                 asleep. But it took a minute 
                                 till he really won me over. Till 
                                 I knew I was sunk, I was done for. 
           CHUCK’s Barracuda is fired up. 

           And with a scre-e-e-e-e-ech, he’s off. 

           OVERHEAD – LINDA’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 

           LINDA tucking herself into bed. Her hands go underneath the covers.  
           She touches herself. She stares up at the ceiling. 

           INT. LA CHINOISE – NIGHT 

           This is a tacky little Orange County Chinese restaurant that  
           probably should’ve fallen over dead in 1966. There is almost 
           no one left in the red leather banquettes at this hour, and 
           the Chinese waiters and cooks are old as the hills.

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So dig this, Lind. I got a 
                                 bright idea here, got me a 
                                 friend that works at ABC in 
                                 New York he’s gonna help me 
                                 get in the door on this. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Okay. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So here’s the thing. It’s  
                                 like a “Candid Camera” thing. 
                                 Only you go up to all the 
                                 little goody-two-shoes girls 
                                 ya got all over—-all the ones 
                                 that’d never do anything 
                                 wrong? So then what you do is 
                                 the host takes ‘em to like a 
                                 real nice fine-dining place an’ 
                                 gets ‘em all liquored up? An’ 
                                 then once they get a little 
                                 lit, you do like a truth-or- 
                                 dare—-they gotta do something 
                                 in public they’d never ever do—- 
                                 ya see where I’m goin’ here? 
                                 Oh hello there ma’m! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I’ll take a egg foo yung anna 
                                 white rice, wash it down with

                                 a white rice.

           An ANCIENT CHINESE WAITRESS has just hobbled up. 

           Quick look to CHUCK. 

           Push in/dolly around CHUCK leaning in on the ANCIENT CHINESE  
           WOMAN.

                                         LINDA 
                                 It’s—-no. It’s okay. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 It’s not okay. The lady wants  
                                 fried rice, that’s what makes 
                                 the meal the meal, and that’s 
                                 what we’re gonna get. Lemme 
                                 see the manager.

                                 have a white rice— 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Linda, I know what you want. I 
                                 know exactly what you want in

                                 Listen, my friend Linda here ast 
                                 for a plate a fried rice an’ was 
                                 told you don’t have it. Now surely

                                 heard of.

                                 Oh, uh—-my apologies—but it is 
                                 late and—-I’m afraid we’re all out 
                                 of fried rice. For today.

                                         MANNY 
                                 Uh-huh. Sorry about that. 

                                         CHUCK 
           In a huff, the ANCIENT CHINESE LADY disappears. 

           Suddenly CHUCK is shaking the hand of MANNY, the fortyish, 
           slightly more Americanized Chinese-American manager. 

                                 Well listen. You tell that cook 
                                 in there to come out here and 
                                 I’m gonna give him a lesson in 
                                 how to make fried rice. From

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Do NOT make me raise my voice to 
                                 you sir now GET that cook out

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Anyway. Heck was I sayin’. Yeah. 
                                 So this idea. It’s like “Candid 
                                 Camera.” But ya take girls, like 
                                 rich girls? Like a Ali McGraw type. 

                                         CHEF 
                                 Whatchew want? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 What do I want? It’s not a 
                                 question of what I want, it’s 
                                 what this young woman wants, 
                                 which is a simple dish of 
                                 fried rice. 

                                         CHEF 
                                 Ain’ got no maw fry rice. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Well I tell you what. We got us 
                                 two options here. One is you 
                                 can get back in the kitchen an’ 
                                 whip the lady up a plate of 
                                 fried rice, or number two is 
                                 you got my bad cracker ass in

                                 you lemme know—-how’s it gonna 
                                 be? 

                                         CHEF 
                                 I tell you awreddy. We ain’t got n— 
           Suddenly CHUCK is up in MANNY’s face with a wagging finger,  
           and more— 

           MANNY scuttles off. LINDA is breathtaken, in one sense or 
           another, and CHUCK calmly returns to his subject. 

           MANNY returns with the Chinese CHEF, who is big, powerful, 
           and not happy about this fried-rice business. 

           CHUCK pauses, and theatrically scratches his ear. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [up on his feet in a flash] I DON’ 
                                 WANNA HEAR ONE MORE GOT DAMN WORD

                                 COOK THE FUCKIN’ THING MYSELF.

                                 HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 We getcha your rice in a minute. 
                                 Anyway, like I was sayin’—-I 
                                 gotta whole buncha get-rich-quick

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] Now I have to tell you 
                                 this, even though you’ll think 
                                 that I’m not a good person, but 
                                 ...right at that moment, right 
                                 there...I fell in love. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] And then we got hitched. 
                                 It was Chuck’s idea, just like 
                                 that. He said “Let’s do it,” 
                                 and six hours later, it was done. 
           A Sergio Leone moment: 

           LINDA watches the CHEF and MANNY to see what their reaction is. 

           CHUCK stares down the CHEF, unwilling to budge or blink. 

           MANNY looks at LINDA, looks at CHUCK. 

           Humiliated, the CHEF breaks down, huffs off to the kitchen, 
           and in a wide shot, we hear the sudden hissssss! of sizzling 
           fried rice. 

           MANNY walks away, depressed. 

           CHUCK sits back down and gets right back to it. 

           LINDA is looking at CHUCK in a different way than she has  
           ever looked at anyone up to this point in the movie. As if 
           she were seeing something in CHUCK even he didn’t know about 
           himself.

                                 your prayers. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 ...Hey, Lind. I got our song 
                                 right here. Five months from 
                                 now you’re gonna be sayin’,  
                                 “Hey! They’re playin’ our song.” 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 We’d check in, make sure there  
                                 was enough wine, if there wasn’t 
                                 we went to 7-11, and then we’d 
                                 go to the movies in the daytime... 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 Chuck liked to do...certain things 
                                 to me...stuff I know my mom 
                                 thought was dirty and evil. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 Sometimes Chuck’d say to me, 
                                 “Let yourself go,” and I would, 
                                 and I’d enjoy it. But it always 
                                 felt somehow like...I dunno, 
                                 even though I was married...I 
                                 was doin’ somethin’ wrong. 
           We MOVE with them toward the wall, where CHUCK steers LINDA  
           Like a small animal, and where a giant proud black woman  
           with an Afro strides topless atop a panther...and toward the juke- 
           box. 

           PUSH IN FAST as CHUCK punches some buttons, and the whole dark, rock-lined,  
           wood-paneled joint lights up with the sound of the Bee Gees’ “Fanny Be Tender.” 

           EXT. BREEM – DAY 

           The Breem is playing “Soldier Blue.” Big poster of Candice Bergen  
           out in front. LINDA and CHUCK exit the place with a box of Jujubes;  
           they look kinda high. The ecstasy of “Fanny Be Tender” continues 
           through this. 

           INT. CHUCK’S APARTMENT – DAY 

           PAN OFF the TV, where Arte Johnson is getting frisky on the Dick  
           Cavett show, to the bed, where CHUCK and LINDA are surrounded by  
           burger-joint bags. They’re making out...and CHUCK’s mouth pauses  
           at her stomach...then moves further southward...we PUSH IN TIGHT  
           on LINDA’s face... 

           OVERHEAD – CHUCK AND LINDA 

           CHUCK goes down on LINDA. She seems to be caught somewhere  
           between pleasure and panic. 

           INT. PAT’S COCKTAILS – NIGHT 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 We didn’t talk much about him 
                                 an’ me, but we’d hang out an’ 
                                 Chuck’d tell me all the ways 
                                 he was gonna make a million 
                                 dollars. He was like a little 
                                 kid. And I just loved to be 
                                 with him and listen. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I was havin’ fun and I was so 
                                 happy to be out in the world. 
                                 Then, one afternoon, everything  
                                 got turned on its ear. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Hey Britt, you got those re- 
                                 ceipts we needed for Jay? 
           Delirious dolly move in on LINDA and CHUCK at one table 
           among a ton of country-fried-rock fans in a vaguely 
           Confederate-flag-oriented bar in the sticks. CHUCK is filling 
           LINDA’s glass with beer from a pitcher and letting the 
           ideas fly fast and furious. 

           EXT. 7-11 – DAY 

           LINDA leaves the place holding a bag of Red Vines. She walks  
           down the street to the Vegas Inn... 

           INT. VEGAS INN – DAY 

           LINDA enters, pulls aside BRITTANY, the new girl. 

                                         BRITTANY 
                                 Oh. No, I didn’t dig ‘em up 
                                 yet. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Okay, ‘cause like we really 
                                 need ‘em. 

           LINDA steps to the bar, looking for someone, or something. CHUCK, probably.  
           As Merle Haggard’s “The Night the Bottle Let Me Down”  
           arises from the jukebox, MISTI steps away from the bar with a tray  
           of drinks. As she leaves behind-the-bar and enters the Main Floor  
           of the place, she sheds her yellow t shirt. And is topless. 

           PAN AROUND with LINDA’s gaze. All the chicks in the joint are  
           topless. Walking around, serving drinks, chatting with the  
           customers. 

           LINDA instinctively pulls back, into herself. And looks over at the  
           pool table. 

           There, BRAESHA, one of the night girls, is splayed out on the pool table. An  
           old GOLFER-looking dude is fucking her on the pool table. And then a big, fuzzy, 
           unwholesome-looking BIKER leans on the side of the pool table and paws  
           sloppily at her breasts. 

           PUSH IN ON LINDA’S FACE and finally in on HER EYES.  
           CAA 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Get in. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [panting, not making any sense] 
           We see what she sees: the two men on BRAESHA on the pool table in  
           a kind of herky-jerky slow motion. The low rumbling of an animal  
           and the dark braying of an aboriginal instrument-—a didjeridoo. 

           EXT. VEGAS INN – DAY 

           FAST FAST FAST PUSH IN from across the street as LINDA TEARS out  
           of the bar and leans, her back against the wall, hyperventilating, having a  
           panic attack. And at just this moment the Chuckmobile comes scree-ee- 
           eeching up. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 C’mon, get in! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 What’s wrong? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 In there...awww...it’s so freaky, 
                                 I’m gonna throw up. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 What the fuck? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 The girls. All the girls were 
                                 topless, Chuck! I mean what 
                                 the hell.

                                 And Braesha. Braesha was on 
                                 the table...the pool table, 
                                 and two guys were ballin’ her. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Two guys was ballin’ Braesha 
                                 at once? 
           INT. CAR – DAY 

           CHUCK peels out of the parking spot outside the Vegas Inn. 

           CHUCK laughs, indulgently.

           EXT. BURGERSAURUS REX – DAY 

           LINDA and CHUCK drive through this Southern California burger shack, which  
           kind of looks like it was designed by FRED FLINTSTONE. Cute  
           hippie chicks in pelts serve you burgers out of...I guess that’s supposed  
           to be a Prehistoric Cave? 

                                 Now didja call your mother like

           CHUCK pulls out of the drive-through. 

           EXT. CHUCK’S APARTMENT – DAY 

           CHUCK and LINDA are holding some very complicated bags of burgers  
           and fries and whatnot, probably some picalilly relish. LINDA has the  
           tray of Cokes. 

           As LINDA looks up from her shoes at this, the screen door closes  
           right in her face. 

           INT. CHUCK’S APARTMENT – DAY 

           CHUCK takes off his shoes, gets a little Rod Stewart on, and  
           prepares for a mid-afternoon feast.

           She reels backwards, crying.

                                 does is he makes you speak the 
                                 truth. Like with these burgers.

           She just stares at him, blankly, as if waiting for him to go on. 

           She starts walking away but he violently pulls her back. 

           She stares at her shoes and sulks. CHUCK giggles. 

           CHUCK starts chuckling.  

           He smacks her on the ass, hard.

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Well well. I think we learned some- 
                                 thing about ourselves today. 

                                         CHUCK 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Say listen, homes. You’re gonna be 
                                 my #1 phone answerer at Traynor’s 
                                 Gentlemen’s Club. And that’s final. 

                                 [still trembling] It sure is not... 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 And I’m gonna tell you one more 
                                 time. You’re gonna be Chuck Tray- 
                                 nor’s madam. 

                                         LINDA 
           LINDA has her first real, big orgasm on CHUCK’s knee. It leaves her...tremendously 
           embarrassed. And overwhelmed, as if drowning. 

           She sits up. It is now clear that CHUCK has left a giant 
           stain on the front of his pants. He, too, has come without 
           anticipating it. He tries to cover up this “weakness” with 
           a return to tough-guy-ism. 

           Shocked and embarrassed, LINDA curls up on the floor next to CHUCK’s 
           La-Z-Boy. She appears to be trying to cover up every part of herself, completely 
           confused, exposed, shredded...mortified. CHUCK is 
           already changing pants. 

           LINDA is rummaging on the floor to find where she had left a deviled egg. A pissed-off 
           CHUCK, in his underwear, grabs it from her hands and hurls it against an ugly off-white 
           wall. 

                                 And I’ll tell you for the umpteenth 
                                 time that I am not. That whole business. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You gonna answer them phones and do 
                                 what I pay you to do. 

                                         LINDA 
           CAA 

                                 No! 

           CHUCK appears to be stalemated. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Okay. FINE. That’s just jim fuckin’ 
                                 dandy. Then ya know what. I’m gonna 
                                 give you another job. ‘Cause I’ll 
                                 be goddammed you live here and  
                                 don’t earn your keep.  

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Just keep it up, lady. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You can’t make me do what I don’t 
                                 wanna do. 
           She looks back at him, scared. 

           He slams the bedroom door and LINDA shudders. 

           In a tiny voice, LINDA speaks, almost to herself. 

           Voom! The bedroom door flies open. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 What? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Nothing. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 What the fuck did you just say? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Nothing, I just— 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Ya gonna DISRESPECT ME. Huh. In 
                                 my OWN HOUSE, YOU are gonna dis- 
                                 respect me. YOU GONNA WALK IN HERE 
                                 AND DISRESPECT ME! I gotchew outta 
                                 that house, I OWN YOU, completely. 
                                 Don’t you EVER DISRESPECT A MAN like 
                                 that again. C’mere. 
           CHUCK comes running back out into the living room. 

           Some rage button is tripped. 

           In a sudden flurry, CHUCK starts KICKING HER with his glossy  
           sharp-toed Frey Boots. LINDA curls into a fetal ball on the floor  
           as the KICKING GOES ON. These are swift, hard, sharp kicks—-all over. 

           \ 

           ‘ 

           CHUCK picks up the beaten, kicked, crying LINDA and takes her  
           INTO THE HALLWAY. He lays her down on the stairs. In a  
           heartbeat, with absolutely no preparation, CHUCK turns from 
           savage violence to strange tenderness. 
           CAA 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Now let’s take a look at what we 
                                 got here. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Now looky here. Looky here. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You got all marked up here an’ 
                                 all over there. What about this 
                                 one? Is that a tender one? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 It is. Well let me kiss that. Let 
                                 me kiss the bruise. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Does that feel good? 
           He opens her shirt, revealing lots of kick-bruises to the  
           breastbone, and the breasts. Also, some purple bruises on her  
           hip and a lot—-a lot—-on her back. 

           Sinuously, his fingers trace the bruises. This makes LINDA moan. 

           LINDA, somehow defiantly, nods. 

           He bends down to kiss. 

           Shamefaced, LINDA nods. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 How ‘bout this—-does this feel good? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Zat feel good when I blow like this? 
           He touches, light, feather-touches, all over the bruises and welts. 

           He blows ever so lightly, like a little zephyr, over the bruises. 
                                         CHUCK 
                                 And then when I touch ‘em too? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Lookit that. You got ‘em on your 
                                 booby too. On the soft part. Right 
                                 there. And there. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 It hurts. Doesn’t it? 
           He pushes hard on them, and each time LINDA cries out. 

           In a similar light, teasing way, CHUCK runs his fingers over her panties. 

           CHUCK and LINDA look at each other. They are both astonished 
           and baffled. Then: 

           CHUCK mashes his mouth violently against LINDA’s and before she or  
           we fully gather what’s going on, in seconds, he’s mounting her on  
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] At that time in my 
                                 life...these are the things 
                                 I knew about Chuck Traynor. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] Chuck grew up as an 
                                 army brat, an’ he spent part 
                                 of his childhood in South Ko- 
                                 rea. 
           the stairs, rubbing her violently against the stair. 

           They are fucking, and CHUCK is on top, not caring whether he’s  
           grinding LINDA into the stairs like the whole thing was a cheese  
           grater. Quickly he lets out a yelping orgasm...and LINDA comes too.  
           Her arms flap like fish around CHUCK’s back, but he’s done his  
           business; he gets up to move on. 

           OVERHEAD – WIDE 

           We see LINDA remain on the floor, covered in bruises, half naked, panting in the 
           aftermath of an experience she completely does not understand. She is terrified, 
           embarrassed and utterly confused.  
           The Bee Gees song from the Vegas Inn is heard playing on somebody’s  
           radio in another apartment. 

           INT. – IN BED THAT NIGHT 

           LINDA and CHUCK stare up at the ceiling. The Bee Gees go on 
           playing. Both of them stare at the ceiling in bewilderment 
           and fright, aware that they are now on a rollercoaster ride 
           neither one quite understands.

           A quick, zinging montage of the façade of a very posh 
           Rancho Cucamonga house circa 1970—-complete with real 
           pink flamingoes, a kind of prehistoric koi pond, “lush” 
           birds of paradise, and a little fat Mexican lady who 
           serves tea to the white people in the backyard. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] And you might think  
                                 that his dad was some kinda 
                                 bully in a uniform that beat 
                                 his kid...but I never saw 
                                 that. I don’t think that was 
                                 true. 

           INT. CHUCK’S DAD’S HOUSE – DAY 

           LINDA sits with MR. TRAYNOR, a sort of pudgy Chuck McCann 
           type in a loud-ish seventies leisure suit, who is talking 
           a mile a minute, and MRS. TRAYNOR, a kind of face-lifted, 
           CAA 

                                         MR. TRAYNOR 
                                 ‘Cause at the end a the day, 
                                 I know what people are after 
                                 in terms of basic home pro-

                                 they’re after. 

                                         MRS. TRAYNOR 
                                 That’s exactly right, Chris. 
                                 We always said that. 
           bewigged Carol Channing type who smiles and nods at every- 
           thing her husband says. CHUCK sits down and pours some Mr. 
           Pibb for one and all.

                                 Keep it cool, Chuckles. We’ll 
                                 get there in the Lord’s time, 
                                 kiddo.

                                 these people bust my balls, 
                                 Lind? Guys, come outside. I 
                                 got some’m for ya. Picked it 
                                 up in Tahoe.

                                 [v.o.] I didn’t see one bad

                                 one. They’d show me Chuck’s

                                 with love. I’ll tell ya what, 
                                 though, there was one thing 
                                 at the end a that day that  
                                 always struck me as really 
                                 weird: 
           IN THE FRONT OF THE LIVING ROOM – A FEW MOMENTS LATER 

           Slow zoom in on the front driveway, where CHUCK pulls out 
           of the front seat a pair of FUZZY DICE in the form of 
           PILLOWS for MR. and MRS. TRAYNOR. LINDA hands off the dice

           INT. CHUCKMOBILE – DAY 

           CHUCK sits at the steering wheel, fuming. They are about 
           to leave MR. and MRS. TRAYNOR’s house. He’s not turning the 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 C’mon, sweets. Let’s go. It’s 
                                 gonna get cold by the time we  
                                 get back. [beat] And the heat 
                                 ain’t workin’ so great. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I KNOW it’s not. Awright? [beat] 
                                 Fuck! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What is it, hon? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I just. 

                                 Nice fucking people. 

                                 Y’know? NICE.  

                                 They just. 

                                 “Fucking nice fucking people.” 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Do you know what I’m sayin’? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Fuck it. 
           key in the ignition.  

           LINDA rubs his extremely manly neck. 

           He turns to her, almost pleadingly. 

           LINDA, baffled, shakes her head no. 

           He puts the key in, kicks it up, peels out. Wide shot of  
           the Chuckmobile peelin’ out.   

           INT. MOTEL – DAY 

           PUSH IN from outside, where a bunch of Mexican-Indian kids 
           are playing on the world’s shittiest, rustiest swingset, 
           to INSIDE, where LINDA is putting on makeup and watching 
           “Soul Train,” and then PUSH IN FURTHER to the bedroom... 
           where CHUCK is lying on the floor. Convulsing. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] One last thing I found 
                                 out about Chuck. He had really 
                                 bad diabetes...and he’d go into 
                                 seizures if he didn’t get his 
                                 medicine... 

           LINDA runs in, hoists him up, CRADLES HIS FACE IN HER HANDS. 
           It’s still twitching as we go into a FREEZE FRAME. 

           CLOSE – NEEDLE 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] He showed me how to 
                                 shoot him up if I hadda save 
                                 his life.   

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] And that’s all I knew 
                                 about Chuck the day we pulled 
                                 up at the Saharan Motel. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [sighing] Awright. So you 
                                 said you don’t wanna help 
                                 me at my business—-fine. I 
                                 got no beef with that. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Thank you. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 But I think it’s only fair 
                                 an’ right that you do some 
                                 other work. And so I hooked

                                 asking too much? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I guess not. 

                                         CHUCK

           Filling up with insulin. 

           EXT. SAHARAN MOTEL – DAY 

           Outside this skanky Hollywood motel, the Chuckmobile  
           pulls up. LINDA and CHUCK sit sipping Cokes from a bur- 
           ger joint. LINDA is still in at least half a daze. 

           CHUCK and LINDA walk to Room #17. 

           Once we go inside, dark, primitive, aboriginal sounds 
           are heard. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY 

           The room is full of paunchy, gray, fiftyish business- 
           men in Johnny Carson brand sportcoats. We dart around the room with 
           LINDA’s eyes. They have eighteen-year-old Scotch and smoke Carlton 
           cigarettes. The curtains are drawn and the whole place is freaky dark, 
           like a vampire’s pad. CHUCK is  
           palpably made tense by these guys—-who don’t look or act like much more 
           than clerks at the local Bank of America. But then, CHUCK doesn’t live in 
           a suit-and-tie world.

                                 make it.

                                 at you. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Linda. These are some a my 
                                 very good friends. These

                                 Hi everybody. 

                                         MR. BAKER 
                                 Linda, Charles tells us you’re 
                                 a girl with an open mind. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Shit yes among other things! 

                                         MR. BAKER 
                                 Chuck said you like to come 
                                 down low. Is that right that 
                                 you like to come down low?

                                 a good time. 
           LINDA is backed up against the curtains. She looks at the door just as 
           CHUCK locks it behind him. 

           All the guys say hi back. The dudes in the back start inching forward. 

           CHUCK cracks his own bad self up. The guys smile in the way that bankers 
           do with a customer they dislike. 

           LINDA completely does not understand. 

           A lurid chuckle swells through the place. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [gaining confidence] I am... 
                                 one that likes to let her 
                                 hair down.

                                 with good friends.

                                         LINDA 
                                 Oh, thank ya no, I don’t drink. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Gentlemen, will you excuse me 
                                 a minute. 
           The cynical laughter that fills the room! 

           LINDA heads to the bathroom. CHUCK, nodding at the fellows, follows after 
           her. 

           INT. BATHROOM – DAY 

           LINDA locks the bathroom door behind them. We perceive something LINDA 
           does not—-a split second of CHUCK getting  
           his CHUCK on. Then: 

                                         LINDA 
                                 All right. So dig. After we

                                 about? 
           A long silence, with LINDA’s wide eyes. 

           CHUCK grabs her cheeks and smooshes them together, making a big, ugly 
           goldfish-like pooched-out mouth.

           CHUCK shoves her against the wall, choking off her breath with one 
           powerful right arm.

           CHUCK senses something slipping, some kind of backslide, then instantly 
           ramps it up to eighty miles an hour:

           Suddenly realizing, and accepting the lack of options, LINDA bursts into 
           tears.

           LINDA is now in a state of tears so great she can almost not speak. 

           She bows down at his feet, putting her hands on his legs. 

           Through her tears, LINDA, stunned, mouths the word, Hooker? 

                                         CHUCK

           LINDA is in a hyperventilating, weeping panic. 

           CHUCK takes off, slamming the door. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY 

           CHUCK takes a long pull off some of the men’s eighteen-year-old Scotch, 
           and really, nobody’s too happy about that. 

           CHUCK is clearly a little insecure around these rinky- 
           dink Burbank versions of what are to him the businessmen 
           who run the world—-the men in neckties he sees on a  
           Monopoly board.

                                 business. No I mean it. But 
                                 you understand. You understand, 
                                 don’t you?

                                 Business is business and that 
                                 is that. And you know: the job 
                                 becomes the man, am I right? 

                                         MR. RIEHLE 
                                 So how’s Lindy-Loo doin’ in there? 

                                         CHUCK 
           The response is not overwhelming. CHUCK sidles up to MR. RIEHLE. 

           He pours some more booze. This really doesn’t go over well. 

           MR. RIEHLE doesn’t get it, is waiting for more information. 

           Suddenly embarrassed at his revealingness, CHUCK reverts to 
           full CHUCK mode. 

                                 [to the entire room] Nothin’ to  
                                 fear, gents—-little case a 
                                 stage fright. She’ll be out in 
                                 two shakes of a lamb. 

           He pulls really hard on that vintage Scotch. After a moment, the bathroom 
           door opens. The moment has the strange quality of a virgin walking up the 
           aisle to a wedding ceremony. LINDA walks out bare naked, but in a 
           completely asexual way, like a frightened child walking to a bath. 
           CAA 

                                         MR. CHESTER 
                                 Hello, Linda.

                                 [staring at floor] Hello. 
           The gentlemen all look strangely astonished, as if CHUCK provided them 
           with something special they didn’t anticipate. CHUCK, not understanding, 
           but sensing the excitement, smiles in pride. 

           MR. RIEHLE stands next to LINDA, fondling her right breast as listlessly 
           as if it were a kumquat at the Farmers Market.

                                 I only thought a one thing. 
           DUSEL and CHESTER glances at the others, and before you know it, there is 
           much of clanking of beltbuckles, and suddenly there are five middle-aged, 
           extremely out-of-shape men standing bare naked in the middle of the room. 
           CHUCK looks absurdly out-of-place, so dressed for a Marlboro Man ad is he. 

           CLOSE – LINDA ON THE BED 

           VERY TIGHT on LINDA’s face as she is helped up on the bed and laid out in 
           an upright, all-fours position. Various torsos of the middle-aged man pass 
           in front of her face as she looks toward the mirror. 

           REVERSE – LINDA LOOKING AT HERSELF IN THE MIRROR 

           LINDA sees herself in the bedroom mirror as the various paunchy dudes file 
           past, reaching for a glass of Scotch or a condom. 

           The aboriginal, primitive sounds morph into an abstract, Philip Glass-like 
           minimalist music. 

           INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM – DAY 

           From the GIRL LINDA’s point of view, a MIDDLE-AGED MAN in a bad suit is 
           sitting on her bed as she watches a commercial for buttermilk pancakes on 
           TV. Her point of view shifts around as she tries to see around his portly 
           form.

                                 I thought about my uncle, his 
                                 name was Dudley Clayton, and 
                                 I remember him sittin’ on my 
                                 bed when I was a kid, and there 
                                 was this ad on TV I always  
                                 useta like. And I remember 
                                 he was in the way, he was just 
                                 in the way, and I could smell 
                                 this cheap shitty cologne he 
                                 useta get for ninety-nine cents, 
                                 it was like Aqua Velva but a  
                                 million times worse. And I  
                                 could never get that smell out 
                                 of my room.

           As MR. BAKER gets on the bed to mount LINDA from behind, we see in slow 
           motion an unnamed man pinching LINDA’s face...mooshing it in strange ways 
           like an ape playing with a dead animal...toying with the face in a way 
           that seems totally devoid of sexual interest, just curious...and the 
           aboriginal sounds recur.

           LINDA takes a mouthful of Lavoris and spits it out. 

           OVERHEAD – LINDA IN THE BATHROOM 

           LINDA throws up into the bathroom sink. 

           INT. SHOWER – NIGHT 

           LINDA has just taken a long, hot shower. Her skin is so red it might have 
           gone on for an hour. There is a long pause before LINDA speaks. 

           LINDA starts to cry. 

           LINDA’s crying keeps her from going on.

                                 [extending hand] Hello.

                                 exactly a thoroughbred but 
                                 she’s a goddam decent work- 
                                 horse. 
           LINDA cries as she slides down to the floor of the shower. 

           SLAM TO: 

           INT. OFFICE – DAY 

           CHICLET is a cute girl of about 20 or 22, about 4’11” with a long mane of 
           curly hair. She talks on the phone behind a cruddy old desk with her feet, 
           in flip-flops, up on the desk. CHUCK ushers LINDA into CHICLET’s executive 
           suite, one hand possessively on the back of her neck. 

           CHICLET hangs up the phone and is ready for business. Somehow a teenage 
           hippie chick has turned hardened mogul in a short span of time. 

           CHICLET lets out a weird guffaw, too large for her body. 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Yeah? This another one a your 
                                 chicks you’re trickin’ out ta 
                                 the freaky-deaky crowd? 
           CAA 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Ya got that right sister! This

                                 the Hundred Neediest Cases! 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Haw ha! RIGHTeous! 
           CHICLET has another bellowing laugh at LINDA’s expense and extends a hand 
           to high-five CHUCK, Black Panther style. 

           INT. SUPERMARKET – DAY 

           A rinky-dink, small-towny supermarket. Leftover produce and D-grade 
           breakfast cereal. LINDA pushes a cart and CHUCK hovers behind. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] Pretty soon, almost all 
                                 the traces a the old Chuck I 
                                 knew? They were long gone. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Can’t you pick that shit up? 
                                 Girl, you must be half nigger,

                                 that. You Hoover down that shit 
                                 like they was givin’ it away. 
                                 Shit makes your breath stink 
                                 anyhow. You smell half the

                                 from. Got DAMN, girl, I just 
                                 remembered, I told ya pick up 
                                 some 10-40 motor oil. An’ ya 
                                 didn’t do it, didja? 

                                         CHUCK 
           LINDA nods yes. 

                                 Well at least ya got that straight. 
                                 I gotta write the shit down fif- 
                                 teen times before ya remember it 
                                 once. Ya get the wrong weight 
                                 in there it fucks up the whole... 
                                 calibration. An’ ya know some’m 
                                 else, ya can lay off that pan- 
                                 cake makeup you’re puttin’ on 
                                 all the time. Look like a goddam 
                                 three-dollar whore. Or a corpse. 
                                 Ya look like your own goddam 
           CAA 

                                 grandmother layin’ in the coffin. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Oh, now, don’t be startin’ that 
                                 shit. Where’s the goddam corn 
                                 chips at. 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Now remember. Tie the lace up 
                                 very tightly. That’s all that 
                                 matters, all he cares about is, 
                                 Is the lace tied up tightly? 
                                 So just do that. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Is...he gonna hurt me? 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Just do the lace up real tight 
                                 hon and you’ll be just fine. 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 I’ll pick ya up in half an hour. 

                                         ERNEST 
                                 You’re Linda? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [lifeless, wooden] Hey Mister. 

                                         ERNEST 
                                 Oh. Hello. 
           LINDA starts to get teary. 

           INT. DODGE DUSTER – DAY 

           LINDA sits in the car with CHICLET, who hands her a plastic dry-cleaning 
           bag full of clothes. 

           CHICLET starts up the car in a hurrying, get-out-of-the-car way. 

           EXT. DOOR – DAY 

           LINDA rings a bell at a dirty door at the end of the fleatbittenest 
           apartments in town. 

           The door opens. ERNEST, the most thoroughly generic-looking sixty-year-old 
           man in Anaheim County, answers. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY 

           On the living-room table, a Life magazine features a beaming Joe Namath. 
           Grandma-like candy in a dish. The Pittsburgh Steelers on TV with the sound 
           turned down. LINDA sits in an absurd, forties-style Shirley Temple little-
           girl costume. 

           Eventually, ERNEST enters the room in an undershirt and work pants. 

           He sits next to her on the couch. 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I’m eleven years old, Mister. 

                                         ERNEST 
                                 Oh. [pause] No! Is that right? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Mm-hmm. I’m just eleven years 
                                 old, Mister. 

                                         ERNEST 
                                 Ohhhhhhh. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I never...I haven’t had a 
                                 man touch my boobies before. 

                                         ERNEST 
                                 Ohhhhhh...really? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 No, never. 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Now dig, hon, this is gonna be 
                                 quick, Albert’s into two chicks, 
                                 so we don’t gotta be here long. 
                                 All we do is kinda make like 
                                 we’re foolin’ around with each 
                                 other, I get your bra off and 
                                 I start squeezin’ you a little 
                                 bit, an’ then I’ll make like I’m 
                                 goin’ down on you an’ he’ll get 
                                 off by then. He’s a quick one. 

                                         CHICLET 
                                 Awright let’s go. Catch ya on 
                                 the flip, Chuckie. 
           A pause. LINDA has clearly forgotten her lines. 

           ERNEST scrunches a bit closer to her. 

           FROM OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR 

           Two small Mexican kids play kickball. Through a crack in the door we can 
           see ERNEST crowding LINDA. His arm wraps around her neck like an ape’s. He 
           paws her breasts, not violently, but thickly, cloddishly. LINDA stares 
           straight ahead, fixing her focus on the TV. 

           CLOSE – TV 

           The referee steps forward, his arms shooting out from his sides. 

           INT. DODGE DUSTER – DAY 

           CHUCK is driving. CHICLET is in the passenger seat, LINDA in the back. 
           CHICLET clears her throat and spits out the window. 

           LINDA nods briskly.

                                 All right girls. You want 
                                 some iced tea?

           EXT. APARTMENT – DAY 

           This apartment complex looks like some kind of decayed forties village for 
           oldsters. CHICLET gives a hearty rap at the door, and ALBERT, an obese, 
           seventyish Jewish-tailor type, answers the door. 

           INT. APARTMENT – DAY 

           LINDA, CHICLET and ALBERT stand stiffly in ALBERT’s living room—-which is 
           approximately as morguelike and grandma-esque as ERNEST’s. 

           ALBERT and CHICLET look at LINDA. 

                                         LINDA

                                 need help. My boyfriend. He 
                                 beats me. He beats me and he 
                                 rapes me and if I don’t go 
                                 on jobs, like this one, he 
                                 puts a gun to my head. A  
                                 real gun and he has it in his 
                                 glovebox and I need help.

           LINDA doesn’t know how to respond to this. 

           ALBERT, LINDA and CHICLET look at each other.

           ALBERT and CHICLET look at each other. 

           CLOSE – PHONE 

           LINDA’s hands pick up the phone, she starts dialing—

                                         CHICLET 
           ALBERT’s hands cut off the call. Pan up to ALBERT’s and LINDA’s faces. The 
           low rumble of Pink Floyd’s “One of These Days” begins. 

           LINDA looks to CHICLET. CHICLET throws up her hands, like, What the hell 
           am I gonna do! 

           LINDA goes to dial—-CHICLET touches her on the shoulder. 

           EXT. APARTMENTS – DAY 

           “One of These Days” picks up in tempo as we PUSH IN FAST/ZOOM IN on LINDA 
           and CHICLET exiting the apartment complex onto the street. 

           LINDA sees the street where the Duster just was. 

           LINDA looks at CHICLET. CHICLET looks around for signs of the Duster. 

           LINDA WALKS INTO THE STREET. WE MOVE WITH HER (STEADICAM) as she crosses 
           the spot where the car just was. 

           She crosses the street. She gets up onto the sidewalk on the other side of 
           the street. 

           We hear the chugging of a car as LINDA KEEPS WALKING. 

           The chugging gets louder as LINDA KEEPS WALKING. 

           Suddenly offscreen we hear: 

                                 CHUCK SHE’S GETTIN’ AWAY! 
                                 MOVE YOUR ASSSS, MAN, SHE’S

                                 HOLD IT RIGHT THERE PARDNER. 
           LINDA BREAKS INTO A RUN. 

           WE STAY CLOSE ON HER AS SHE IS HURTLING DOWN THE STREET. 

           SUDDDENLY CHUCK BREAKS INTO FRAME AND CLAMPS AN ARM ON HERS.

                                         CHUCK

                                 today. C’mon.

           It takes a second for LINDA to actually acquiesce, stop, and surrender to 
           CHUCK’s grip. 

           LINDA rebels against his grip, and he JERKS HER, almost to the ground. 

           She stands still, defiantly staring into space. 

           LINDA looks over at the car. WHIP-PAN WITH LINDA’S LOOK TO THE DODGE 
           DUSTER where CHICLET is sitting in the passenger’s seat with her feet up 
           eating Red Vines. 

           INT. DODGE DUSTER – DAY 

           The car is moving down the street. PAN FROM CHUCK and CHICLET IN THE FRONT 
           SEAT... 

                                 I never understood why Chiclet 
                                 ratted me out that day. Some- 
                                 times I think she hated Chuck 
                                 worse than I did. But that’s 
                                 how people are. They see an 
                                 opportunity like that? They 
                                 can’t resist it. 

           ...to LINDA alone in the back. 

           MONTAGE – “WICHITA LINEMAN” 

           To the tune of Glen Campbell’s version of Jimmy Webb’s “Wichita Lineman,” 
           we see the following: 

           EXT. FRONT DOOR – DAY 

           PUSH IN FAST as LINDA and CHUCK enter the front door. 

           CLOSE – BED 

           CHUCK’s suede jacket is slammed on the bed. 

           CLOSE – FEET 

           CHUCK kicks off a pair of cheap dress shoes. 

           CHUCK pulls on the spitshined Frye boots.

                                 I started getting Percodan, 
                                 ‘cause Chuck was kickin’ me 
                                 up so much. He was leavin’ 
                                 marks...

                                 story. But the Percodan worked. 
                                 I felt better.

                                 kinda escape route...an’ then 
                                 one day I heard this weird bump. 
           The Frye boots do a horrific dance of death as they kick the tar out of 
           LINDA’s ribs, hands, sides. 

           CLOSE – PILLS 

           We see a giant prescription for PERCODAN for LINDA BOREMAN. Two horse 
           pills come out of the jar into LINDA’s hands. 

           CLOSE – LIPS 

           Swallowing the Percodan. 

           INT. CHUCKMOBILE – DAY 

           CHICLET drives the car. CHUCK sings along with a song in the passenger’s 
           seat. LINDA is in the back seat, all zombied out. 

           INT. APARTMENT – DAY 

           LINDA walks around, in a particularly depressing style of 
           hooker garb, looking for her handbag.  

           LINDA hears something. 

           She goes slowly stalking down the hallway of her and CHUCK’s apartment. 

           She sees a light in the bathroom. 

           As LINDA rounds the corner we see CHUCK on the floor. 
           Rolling. Contorting. Slightly purple-faced. In the throes 
           of a diabetic seizure. 

           LINDA bends down and picks up CHUCK’s face. He is speechless. 
           Wide-eyed, because clearly he can see death right next to 
           him. 

           LINDA LOOKS IN HIS EYES. 

           She looks down the hallway. We can see sunlight glinting 
           through the screen door that leads OUT. An extremely slow 
           push down this hallway, to freedom.

                                 I actually heard Christ’s voice 
                                 speakin’ to me. And He wouldn’t 
                                 let me let that man die.

                                 Ready for the usual, Leonard? 
           LINDA looks in CHUCK’s eyes again. He is helpless. Needy. 
           Without a voice. 

           Hold on this for a moment. Then: 

           EXTREMELY TIGHT INSERT 

           A syringe goes into CHUCK’s diabetes medicine. 

           EVEN TIGHTER INSERT 

           The syringe goes into CHUCK’s skin. Freeze frame. 

           INT. CHUCKMOBILE – DAY 

           Apparently about two seconds later, LINDA is being dropped 
           off at a job by CHUCK, who, unlike Lazarus, doesn’t seem 
           overly fazed by being raised from the dead. 

           EXT. SHITTY HOUSE – DAY 

           In the hellhole of Garden Grove, California, LINDA knocks at a door. Her 
           face is as blank and impassive as we’ve ever seen it. 

           Cre-e-e-eak! The door opens. LEONARD, 400 pounds and on crutches, opens 
           the door, as if it were a big imposition. 

                                         LEONARD 
                                 If you say so, Lind.

           INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT 

           CHUCK is sacked out on the couch in his underwear with a giant bag of 
           Funyuns. LINDA sits next to him, prim, zombified, tensely upright. 

                                         CHUCK

                                 [falling asleep] What’d they  
                                 want? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 They wanted to know if I could 
                                 do a double. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [yawning more] Pretty fuckin’ 
                                 late for that. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Yeah, but they sounded like  
                                 they were really up for it. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Well, shit. [beat] If you can 
                                 hit ‘em up for an extra twenty, 
                                 ya gotta do it. There’s no pas- 
                                 sin’ that up. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Yeah. That’s what I thought. 

           A long silence. The sound of Johnny Carson being kissed by a pygmy 
           chimpanzee. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Then I’m gonna just go over 
                                 there then. 

           CHUCK doesn’t even acquiesce. LINDA leaves the frame.  

           OVERHEAD – BARRACUDA 

           From on high we see LINDA pull the Barracuda out of the driveway. We re-
           enter the sinister pulse of Pink Floyd’s “One of These Days.” 

           EXT. FREEWAY – NIGHT 

           LINDA pulls onto the freeway. LINDA’s eyes reflected in the light in the 
           rear-view mirror. 

           ANOTHER EXCHANGE – NIGHT 

           LINDA moving onto the 5 Freeway. Clearly terrified out of her mind, she 
           lights up a Newport—-something she never, ever does. 

           EXT. MOM AND DAD’S – NIGHT 

           LINDA pulls up. 
           CAA 

                                         MOM 
                                 [opening the door] Jesus, what 
                                 the hell you bangin’ like that for? 
           LINDA bangs on the front door. 

           INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT 

           We have our first real glance of MOM and DAD together. MOM is hard, 
           clearly a lifelong hard worker, and DAD is a gentler, softer-spoken man. 
           They both must have been near forty when they had LINDA. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You’re not listening to me. He’s like 
                                 ...an animal. He’s...the things  
                                 he’s done to me, I can’t even 
                                 describe it. There are so many 
                                 things I can’t even tell you 
                                 all the things ‘cause I’d be so 
                                 ashamed to even say it in fronta 
                                 you. He has a gun. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He has a gun in the glovebox and 
                                 he’s always tellin’ me he’s gonna 
                                 use it on me if I don’t do what 
                                 he says. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He hits me. He pounds me right 
                                 in the face if I don’t do what 
                                 he says or I don’t do it right. 
                                 I think he broke my nose once. 
                                 And he kicks, he has these steel- 
                                 toe boots and he kicks me and 
                                 kicks me so hard sometimes I 
                                 pass out. One time I had blood 
                                 in my stool once after he was 
                                 kickin’ at me all night. And... 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I don’t wanna say this but...he 
                                 makes me have sex with other peo- 
                                 ple...and he made me have sex 
                                 with women... 
           A pause. MOM shrugs, like, I don’t get it. 

           MOM and DAD share a secret look. 

           LINDA fights it and fights it and fights it but tears well up. 

           LINDA can’t go on. 

                                         MOM 
                                 All right, okay. We get it. 
                                 Now listen. I been around 
                                 a lotta couples in my 
                                 life. All right? And I’ve seen 
           CAA 

                                 a lotta bad arguments and people 
                                 gettin’ into a lot of violent 
                                 stuff and punchin’ each other— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 But this isn’t like that— 

                                         MOM 
                                 [overlapping] And it’s all he 
                                 said she said and everybody’s 
                                 got their point a view. I’m 
                                 sure Chuck’d have a different 
                                 version a things if he was the 
                                 one sittin’ here. But I know 
                                 you gotta be patient, and you 
                                 gotta work things out between 
                                 y— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 THIS IS NOT LIKE THAT, HE BEATS 
                                 ME AND HE RAPES ME, HE KICKS ME 
                                 TILL I THROW UP. [beat] DON’T 
                                 YOU UNDERSTAND. 

                                         DAD 
                                 [cutting in] All right—-look. 
                                 We’re not gonna get anywhere 
                                 like this. What’s important right 
                                 now is Linda, you take a load 
                                 off, I’m gonna make you some hot 
                                 chocolate and you sit downstairs 
                                 in the rec room and you relax. 
                                 And we’re not gonna do anything 
                                 right now. 

                                         DAD 
                                 Now you just go downstairs and 
                                 rest and take a load off your 
                                 mind, you don’t worry about any- 
                                 thing. We talk to the pastor 
                                 tomorrow, we talk to a counse- 
                                 lor. But tonight we’re not gonna 
                                 do anything but go easy. Awright? 
           MOM almost glares at DAD—-almost, but not quite a glare. 

           LINDA sniffles, nods, walks downstairs. 

           INT. REC ROOM – NIGHT 

           LINDA is in a nightgown—-something from her teenage days. She’s curled up 
           on the couch with “Laugh-In” on the TV. She looks upstairs. 

           MOM and DAD are on the phone. DAD leans around the corner and looks down 
           at LINDA with love, giving her an A-okay signal. 

           A MOMENT LATER 

           LINDA has turned the lamp in the rec room off and is watching the news. A 
           ring comes at the doorbell. 
           CAA 

           Heavy organ music, as in “Last Year at Marienbad,” starts churning as MOM 
           and DAD walk down the hallway to the front door, out of frame. 

           They return with CHUCK, walking down into the rec room. 

           Like a dog spotting an uneaten steak, CHUCK sidles right up to LINDA and 
           “tenderly” wraps an arm around her. 

           LINDA stiffens, going into shock. 

                                         DAD 
                                 Honey...we made a promise to 
                                 Chuck...the day he took you 
                                 down the aisle and made you 
                                 his wife. We said we’d never 
                                 interfere in his affairs.  
                                 And you know I’m good to my 
                                 word, I’d never come between 
                                 a man and his wife. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I’m gonna treat Linda like she’s 
                                 never been treated in her life. 
                                 Starting tonight. Honey, you 
                                 ain’t never been treated like 
                                 this before. 

                                         MOM 
                                 Honey...I wish you woulda just 
                                 brought Chuck by the house more. 
                                 Ya didn’t have to be embarrassed. 
                                 I woulda given you our blessing. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Ya hear that, hon? Ain’t gonna 
                                 be no more stories. No more 
                                 makin’ up things, no more tel- 
                                 lin’ stories outta school. It’s 
                                 gonna be nothin’ but roses an’ 
                                 champagne between us from now 
                                 on—-izzat right, Mrs. Boreman? 

                                         MOM 
                                 I just love both a you kids. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You think I’m gonna hit you? 
           LINDA starts to shudder as the arm tightens and CHUCK kisses her on the 
           top of the head. 

           A tear falls down LINDA’s cheek. 

           INT. CHUCKMOBILE – NIGHT 

           The Barracuda comes to a halt right in front of CHUCK’s apartment. LINDA 
           sits in a state of panicky fright. CHUCK eats out of a box of candy. 

           LINDA dares to look in CHUCK’s direction. 

                                         CHUCK 
           CAA 

                                 I’m not gonna hit you. Honest 
                                 Injun. An’ I want you to know 
                                 some’m. 

           CHUCK reaches to articulate something. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I just...Y’know? Honestly? I’m 
                                 hurt. I mean I am a little put 
                                 out about this. 

                                 I do and I do to provide for you. 
                                 I put food on the table. I keep 
                                 you in the shit you want. And I... 

                                 I know how to keep a woman happy. 
                                 An’ I do that. I do. 

                                 So I just want you to know that I 
                                 am disappointed. I’m not angry. I’m 
                                 disappointed. 

                                 So I’m not gonna punish you. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You’re gonna punish yourself. 
                                 Pull down your pants. 
           CHUCK pours the candy from the box into his mouth. 

           Silence and stillness. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Do not make me say that again. 

                                         CHUCK 
           LINDA pulls down her pants, revealing a pair of sad, teenage-looking 
           underpants that she obviously put on at MOM’s. 

           We can see the side of the candy box: RED HOTS. 

                                 Now you’re gonna take a handful  
                                 a these an’ push ‘em up inside ya.

                                 It was really pissin’ Chuck off 
                                 that no matter how much business 
                                 we did in L.A., we could never 
                                 get ahead. Couldn’t even get an 
                                 apartment with central air. So 
                                 some guy he knew told Chuck he 
                                 had a groovy business opportunity 
                                 in New York City...so we drove 
                                 out there. He wouldn’t tell me what 
                                 we were goin’ there for, so you 
                                 can imagine: I expected the worst. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [v.o.] On the way out there, we 
                                 made a little pit stop in New 
                                 Mexico. 
           LINDA looks out into space. She looks at CHUCK. She looks at the candy 
           box. She looks into space. A long pause. Then: 

           EXTREME CLOSEUP 

           LINDA shakes five Red Hots into the palm of her hand. Hold a long beat, 
           then:

           EXT. CHUCKMOBILE – DAY 

           WE PUSH IN (as if from a passing car) on LINDA in the passenger’s seat, 
           looking older, with her hair done up in curly ringlets. Her expression is 
           more weary than zombified. The Moody Blues plays on the 8-track. 

           EXT. LARRY’S HOUSE OF BIG MAN TALL MAN – DAY 

           The Chuckmobile pulls up to this retail outlet in the middle of New 
           Mexico. The medium-rare-steak mountains of the state loom larger around 
           this men’s shop in the middle of nowhere. Lots of huge picture windows, 
           and inside two balding SALESCLERKS shooting the shit. WHIP-PAN OVER to 
           CHUCK and LINDA in the car. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Awright. Now go in there, get me 
                                 some nice stuff in a 33 large, not 
                                 a 32 and not a 34, make it a 33 
                                 and make sure it’s got some room 
                                 in the neck. And don’t pay nothin’ 
                                 for it. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I said don’t pay no money for it, 
                                 just give ‘em up a piece a ass 
                                 when they ask for it.

                                 Now I cannot tell you exactly how 
                                 or why this happened, but something 
                                 happened in that moment, some’m just 
                                 clicked. And as hard as things got, 
                                 I think I’m still alive right now 
                                 because a that exact moment right 
                                 then. 
           LINDA looks at him. A long look. We can’t tell quite what’s in it.  

           Then she opens the door to go. 

           As she walks the long walk to Larry’s House of Big Man Tall Man... 

           INT. LARRY’S HOUSE OF BIG MAN TALL MAN – DAY 

           Jingle goes the door as LINDA walks in and walks up to the CLERKS. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Heyyyyyyy, good morning. Um, I wan-

                                         CHUCK 
           A beat. The two exchange a glance together, this time not “Va-voom,” but 
           “What a fucking nitwit.” 

           Beat. 

           EXT. CHUCKMOBILE – DAY 

           CHUCK is looking through the glass. He sees the CLERKS erupt in laughter. 
           LINDA, “shamefaced,” walks out of the joint. 

                                 Jee-ziss fuckin’ Christ!

           LINDA gets back in the car. 

           CHUCK fires up the car and takes off.

           Grindhouses triple-billing “The French Connection” with “Hit Man” and 
           “Goodbye Uncle Tom.” Toxic cheese steaks and bus exhaust. We slowly zoom 
           in on a WINDOW in an anonymous office building towering above the Forty-
           Deuce slime... 

           INT. OFFICE – DAY 

           Dolly around CHUCK and LINDA, who sit before THE MAN. CHUCK 
           has his hand around the back of LINDA’s neck in his usual 
           position. This chap is an Italian-American of possibly forty years, with 
           what looks like a jet-black toupee sitting atop an otherwise gray-haired 
           head. Gold chains and Carlton in hand. The MAN is smooshed behind a desk 
           piled with three years’ worth of papers. Most of them look like unpaid 
           bills. 

           CHUCK erupts in a giant “Pffft!” at the MAN’s “delicate” language.

                                 lacking in the adult-film au- 
                                 dience, and that is women. They 
                                 will not come to see the stuff 
                                 for love or money. And there is 
                                 one kind of picture that I know 
                                 women like, and I intend to 
                                 make an adult film in that genre.

           The MAN pauses, glaring at CHUCK. 

           LINDA erupts in giggles and touches CHUCK on the sleeve.

                                 “romantic.” But I would certainly 
                                 say comedy. Linda, do you know 
                                 a picture called “The Philadel-

           CHUCK looks up, ready to explode. 

                                 Mr. Damiano, I think we all 
                                 got off on the wrong foot here. I  
                                 think you might not know who this

                                 Chuck Traynor knows one thing 
                                 it’s talent. He knows what I’m

                                 knows how to use it. So knowin’ 
                                 my husband as good as I do I 
                                 gotta tell you, ya gotta take 
                                 it on faith that this man knows 
                                 what I can and can’t do. 

                                 So all you gotta do...sir... 
                                 is show him a little respect. 

                                         DAMIANO 
                                 Of course. Absolutely. Chuck. 
                                 Let’s step back a beat or two. 
                                 Please, take a seat. 

                                         DAMIANO 
                                 Now here’s the scoop. You got 
                                 some’m special here in Linda. 

                                         DAMIANO 
                                 I’m not sayin’ she’s the best 
                                 lookin’ chick in this city.  
                                 I’m not sayin’ she can act  
                                 her way out of a paper bag. 
                                 I’m not even sayin’ I’d go 
                                 so far as to ball her myself. 
                                 But what I am sayin’ is she’s 
                                 got a special somethin’—-a 
                                 kinda fresh quality, an’... 
                                 a desire to please. That’s 
                                 what my buyers want. An’ what 
                                 I’m sayin’ is, we can exploit 
                                 the living shit out of that. 
           DAMIANO, the man at the desk, stubs out his Carlton. 

           DAMIANO is wide-eyed. Suddenly he understands all. 

           CHUCK sits down again, a pacified child. 

           He looks to LINDA, sending her secret signals in a secret language that he 
           knows just what she’s up to. 

           CHUCK smiles at LINDA like he just got a whole birthday cake 
           all to himself.

                                 That guy’s name was Gerard Dami- 
                                 ano, and I have to tell you some- 
                                 thing: as much as I hate the adult 
                                 film business, Gerry Damiano was 
                                 the nicest person other than my 
                                 high-school friends I ever met 
                                 up to that point. 
           INT. SCREENING ROOM – DAY 

           On a sheet on a wall, Katherine Hepburn can’t believe her luck—-she’s 
           squeezed right between a wisecracking Cary Grant and a gulping-gee-whiz 
           Jimmy Stewart. 

           In the house, GERRY pushes on LINDA a bag of grindhouse popcorn. She never 
           looks up from the screen as she digs her fingers into it, so entranced is 
           she by the movie...

                                 tually treated me with a lot of 
                                 respect.

                                 Now I wanna tell you something you 
                                 probably won’t believe, if you 
                                 know anything about me. The two 
                                 weeks that followed were the ni- 
                                 cest two weeks of my life up to 
                                 that point. It wasn’t perfect... 
                                 but it was like a little vacation 
                                 from all the pain Chuck caused me.

                                 Awright, now Linda, the fellas 
                                 ast me to do a little screen 
                                 test, but don’t get nervous or 
                                 anything—-it’s just a formality. 

                                         CHUCK 
           KATE, CARY and JIMMY walk away from the camera arm in arm in  
           arm… 

           INT. STUDIO – DAY 

           Inside this little studio, GERRY, a glowering CHUCK, and several UNDERPAID 
           PA’s stand behind the camera. On the other side, LINDA, in a starched, 
           actually fairly expensive-looking nurse’s uniform, stands, tiny light 
           stands pointed at her. 

           Title card:  

                                 So DON’T fuck it up. 
           CAA 

           GERRY tries to contain shooting CHUCK a look. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 So here’s what I want you to do. 
                                 Just...sing a song. A nice 
                                 song that you like, somethin’ 
                                 you feel comfortable with. 

                                 And while you’re doin’ it... 
                                 take off the nurse’s uniform. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Take it off? 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Yup.  Till you’re naked as a 
                                 jaybird, dear. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 So... I can do any song? 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Anything that feels good. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Can I do a song from “West 
                                 Side Story”? 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Love “West Side Story”!  

                                         GERRY 
                                 [to P.A.] Leonard Bernstein.  
                                 [to LINDA] Go right ahead, ho- 
                                 ney. 
           LINDA hesitates. She doesn’t even look at CHUCK—-just at the others...who 
           are clearly uninterested, just there to do their job. 

           GERRY turns to a homely FORTYISH P.A. CHICK. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I can do this real good. I 
                                 learned it in high school. 

                                         LINDA 
           SIXTEEN MILLIMETER LINDA 

           We see, as in a rough, scratchy print shown in a porno theatre in 1972, 
           LINDA in her nurse’s uniform. The sound is similarly boxy and ugly as in 
           an old porno. 

           LINDA’s post-Percodan, zombie ways evaporate suddenly as the memory of 
           Leonard Bernstein’s score overtakes her. 

           LINDA tap...tap...tap...taps her foot to get the beat. Suddenly out of 
           nowhere she begins. Her performance is not “good.” But it has spirit. 

                                 I feel pretty! 
           CAA 

                                 Oh so pretty!

                                 I feel charming! 
                                 Oh so charming! 
                                 It’s alarming! How charming! 
                                   I feeeeeeel! 

                                         LINDA

                                 SUCH a pretty face. 
                                 SUCH a pretty smile. 
                                 SUCH a preeeeeeetty meeeeee. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I feel stunning. 
                                 And entrancing! 
                                 Feel like running! And dan-

                                   loved...

                                 That was terrific. Was that 
                                 terrific, guys? 
           LINDA starts swaying to the tune. 

           LINDA starts stripping off the nurse’s garments. She kicks off her shoes 
           first, and starts peeling off her stockings. 

           LINDA starts taking off the smock... 

           She peels off the bra. 

           She takes off her panties.  

           INT. STUDIO – DAY 

           CHUCK is unsmiling. GERRY and his CREW are stunned. In what way, not so 
           clear. Finally, GERRY claps his hands once. 

           All of a sudden, as if on cue, the P.A.s start clapping, “rush the stage,” 
           put their arms around LINDA and tell her how beautiful and talented she 
           is. Meanwhile, GERRY taps CHUCK on the sleeve and hails him over. 
           CAA 

                                         GERRY 
                                 You trained her? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Aw yessir. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Ya did good, Chuck. 

                                 Y’know...there’s something 
                                 about Linda. She seems really 
                                 ...depressed. In a way I  
                                 find...extremely hot. Y’know 
                                 what I mean? 

           CHUCK has absolutely no idea. But he sure knows when his 
           ass is being kissed, and he pumps GERRY’s hand like he’s 
           running for office. 
                                         CHUCK 
                                 Ger...you are for sure a man 
                                 that can see the future! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So I’m tellin’ ya, that laun- 
                                 dromat’s like six miles outta 
                                 town. So right when we wrap 
                                 you gotta put an egg in your 
                                 shoe and beat it. 
           GERRY walks into the fray of congratulaters. Something new we’ve never 
           seen on CHUCK: a smile of surprise and pride. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY 

           GERRY and CREW sit in a motel room that’s done up, if you want to use that 
           expression, as a doctor’s office.  

           GERRY is sitting back in his director’s chair like he was Orson Welles, 
           pontificating about the difference between “erotica” and “pornography” to 
           some not-great HIPPIE CHICK he’s trying to bang. 

           HARRY REEMS, the male lead, is doing card tricks for a big-breasted nurse 
           type named CAROL CONNORS. HARRY is a slightly schlemiely, poor man’s 
           Elliott Gould type, but oddly rugged and handsome, and clearly the light 
           source of humor, resilience and good energy in this world. 

           In the back, in the dark, CHUCK is talking a mile a minute in LINDA’s ear. 
           He seems a bit tense, and is constantly flicking his gaze around, checking 
           out the lay of the land. He has his hand on LINDA’s neck.

                                 Hey Linda. Lind. Check this 
                                 out. Mrs. Schmeckelstein 
                                 goes to the gynecologist. 
                                 She’s about 75 years old. 
                                 This young doctor is doing 
                                 the exam...

                                 ...and he’s looking around 
                                 an’ poking and prodding, and 
                                 finally Mrs. Schmeckelstein 
                                 looks up at him and says, 
                                 “Young man—-could I maybe ask 
                                 a kvestion?” He says, “Cer- 
                                 tainly ma’m!” She goes, “So 
                                 tell me...your mother. She 
                                 knows from this you make a

           THE SET – A FEW MOMENTS LATER 

           LINDA is sitting on a table next to HARRY, who is playing with a 
           stethoscope. GERRY is consumed with Technical Issues. 

           HARRY fiddles with the reflective-circle on his forehead and pretends to 
           be fiddling with Mrs. Schmeckelstein’s parts. 

           LINDA cracks up laughing. 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Which reminds me. Pirate walks 
                                 into a bar with a steering wheel 
                                 sticking out of his ass. Bar- 
                                 tender goes, “Hey, Pirate—-you 
                                 know you got a steering wheel 
                                 stickin’ outta your ass?” Pirate 
                                 goes, “Arrrr, I know! It’s drivin’ 
                                 me nuts!” 
           CAA 

                                         GERRY 
           LINDA absolutely busts a gut laughing. GERRY returns to the matter at 
           hand. 

                                 Reems—=you wanna lay off the Shec- 
                                 ky Greene for a minute and maybe  
                                 we can make a picture? 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Awright! Elia Kazan over here! 
                                 Let’s do it! Let’s go for the 
                                 gold, people. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Okay. So this is the scene 
                                 right after you tell Harry 
                                 you can’t have an orgasm. 
                                 Now I wanna play to your 
                                 strengths. I was think- 
                                 in’...maybe you might...find 
                                 this funny! 

                                         GERRY 
                                 I mean...you’re good at laugh- 
                                 ing, right? Doesn’t that come 
                                 easy to you? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 ……………………………………..No. 

                                 Nuh-uh, I’m not a real good 
                                 laugher. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Oh. [pause] Um, what if... 
                                 you’re real scared. You find 
                                 the whole thing terrifying. 
           GERRY looks to HARRY to confirm that he’s leading LINDA in the right 
           direction. 

           LINDA looks off camera to CHUCK. He has his arms folded over his chest 
           and is glaring at her. 

           GERRY is crestfallen. 

           LINDA looks at CHUCK. His gaze is hard and expressionless and he is 
           conceding nothing one way or another. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [far-off] ...That’s better... 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Hey, I got it.  

                                         HARRY 
                                 What if you cry. 
           HARRY very quickly shoots a very serious you-get-me? look at GERRY, then 
           focuses right back on LINDA. 
           CAA 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Wouldn’t that be funny? [beat] 
                                 I think that’d be so funny if 
                                 you just thought this was like 
                                 the saddest thing in the world 
                                 --you got your little ding-a-

                                 discover you’re the biggest 
                                 gobbler since the butterball

                                 I think that’d be so funny. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 That’s good. You like that, Linda? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I can do that. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Awright, let’s give it a shot.

                                 Where? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [still weeping] You’ll laugh... 

                                         HARRY 
                                 No, no, Miss Lovelace! I wouldn’t 
                                 laugh! 

                                         LINDA 
           Silence in the room. 

           LINDA laughs, eases the tension. 

           The crew chuckles and mutters over this. 

           EXTREME CLOSEUP ON LINDA 

           LINDA looks at CHUCK (who is off camera). A long look. 

           Then: 

           SIXTEEN MILLIMETRE LINDA AND HARRY 

           In the grainy, slightly degraded image of a worn-out print of “Deep 
           Throat,” we see LINDA sitting next to “Doctor” HARRY...and she bursts 
           into tears. These are not the pretend tears of a virgin in a sex farce. 
           They are real, Linda Boreman tears. She goes on crying for a moment 
           before she can begin; HARRY is clearly disturbed. Then she carries on, 
           reading GERRY’s scripted lines. 

                                 I get excited... 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 ...here!... 
           The sobs almost prevent her from pointing at her throat. 

           HARRY busts out laughing. Which causes LINDA to cry more. 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Oh, Miss Lovelace, let me have 
                                 a look at this. Open your 
                                 mouth. 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Wider. Wider. Ahhh. Ahhh! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Ahh, ahh...ah, ahhh... 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [still sobbing] Uhhh. Uhhhh. 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Oh! Well, there it is! You 
                                 little bugger! There it is! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What? 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Your clitoris! It’s deep down 
                                 in the bottom of your throat! 

                                         HARRY 
                                 [o.c.] Now, now, Miss Lovelace! 
                                 Having your clitoris deep down 
                                 in your throat is better than 
                                 having no clitoris at all! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 That’s easy for you to say! 
                                 What if your balls were in 
                                 your ears? 

                                         HARRY 
           She does. 

           LINDA bursts into even deeper, chestier sobs now. We see her for a 
           moment GLANCE OFF CAMERA... 

           CLOSE – CHUCK 

           We see CHUCK standing far behind camera, arms folded, scowling. 

           TWO-SHOT OF LINDA AND HARRY 

                                 [pretending to think] Well  
           CAA 

                                 then...I could hear myself 
                                 coming! 

           LINDA sobs harder. 

                                         HARRY 
                                 Oh, Miss Lovelace, now we 
                                 have the problem solved, now 
                                 all we have to do is find a 
                                 solution! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Like what?

                                 Like...like deep throat! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Deep what? 

                                         HARRY

                                 ken a penis all the way down 
                                 into the bottom of your throat? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 No...I tried but I choked!

           GERRY leans in to clap both of the “kids” on the shoulder. 

           This spells silence. Kills the room. 

           PUSH IN FAST ON GERRY DAMIANO WHO LOOKS RIGHT— 

           THEN WHIP-PAN TO THE CREW— 

           --who rush the set to congratulate LINDA. 

           A loud round of only semi-forced laughter. 

           Now the whole CREW—-well, almost all of them—join in.

           HARRY gives LINDA noogies. CAROL CONNORS sits in HARRY’s lap, singing. 

           PUSH IN ON CHUCK. Alone. Standing on the sidelines. Even the teenage 
           PA’s are giving LINDA a peace-love-brotherhood handshake. No one’s 
           saying a word to him.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT 

           LINDA and CHUCK’s motel room. A sad affair. A clown grimaces on the 
           wall. Elsewhere, a topless black woman looks strident in an oil 
           painting. LINDA primps, probably for a party. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Do I not get you everything

           INT. DEEP THROAT SET – NIGHT 

           Everybody but CHUCK and LINDA is smoking weed, sipping shitty white box 
           wine, and GERRY is relaxing with a cigar. CAROL CONNORS and a skinny PA 
           GUY are playing the bongos. Suddenly you can hear CHUCK from the other 
           room. 

           There are thumps. It might be furniture moving. There are screams. There 
           is a sound of begging.  

           There is a sound of slapping and a sound of whimpering. We pan slowly 
           across the face of HARRY REEMS...and GERARD DAMIANO...and CAROL 
           CONNORS...and all the CREW... 

           They are wistful. They are silent. They are hearing everything. And 
           nobody lifts a finger to do anything. 
           And suddenly everyone, even boss-man DAMIANO, is staring at his shoes. 

           DEEP THROAT SET – THE NEXT MORNING 

           Everyone is fast at work. But nobody is laughing or telling jokes. The 
           mood is deadly grim. Even HARRY isn’t up to his old hijinx. The climax 
           of all this arrives when CHUCK enters 
           the room, trying to spellbind the crew with the Traynor 
           charm. 

           A feeble whoop-di-do response. CHUCK starts stalking the joint like he’s 
           Roger Corman or something, inspecting the work of the Little People. He 
           comes up on an EXTREMELY CUTE HIPPIE-CHICK PROPS GIRL, who is replacing 
           an ashtray. 

                                 Hey babe. Remember I said,

                                         CHUCK

                                         PROPS

                                 by Sunday night. 

                                         CHUCK

                                         GERRY 
                                 Chuck, y’know what? I’m run- 
                                 nin’ outta coffin nails—you 
                                 think you could go down to 
                                 that joint Cartwright’s and 
                                 pick me up a carton? 

           GERRY hands CHUCK a wad of bills. It’s much too much for a carton of 
           cigarettes. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 And here. 

                                         GERRY 
                                 Pick yourself up a carton. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I don’t want your money, Ger. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I’m happy to fetch your god- 
                                 dam cigarettes. And hey! [to

           He piles on a few more. 

           CHUCK stares evenly at GERRY. 

           He hands the cash back. 

           The following is double feeble: 
           CAA 

                                         ONE AND ALL 
                                 Ayyyyyyyy. Nice one! Thanks, Chuck.

                                 This’ll just take a second. 
           CHUCK takes off, making a secret hand signal to LINDA. She nods, 
           dutifully. A MAKEUP GIRL is covering up the bruises on LINDA’s legs. 
           They’re enormous. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Yeah. [beat] I fell down. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I do that a lot. I’m klutzy. 
                                 [beat] I come from a klutzy 
                                 family. [beat] My mom falls 
                                 down. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Runs in the family I guess. 
                                 [beat] Say, ya know I wouldn’ 
                                 mind goin’ back to Nate’s

                                         MAKEUP GIRL 
                                 [no change of expression] Yup. 
                                 We’re leavin’ at six. Make  
                                 sure to be ready.

                                 And that was the end of that—- 
                                 no party at the end, no shaking 
                                 hands—-just like being done 
                                 with a john. We were drivin’ 
                                 back from Florida to New York 
                                 an’ Chuck was havin’ a hard time 
                                 with his “businesses”... 

                                         CHUCK 
           A long pause. Somebody is hammering in the background. 

           A long pause. LINDA lights a Newport. 

           LINDA nods. 

           MAKEUP GIRL looks LINDA in the eye to make sure she gets it. 
           Then goes right back to the bruises. 

           EXT. STUCKEY’S – DAY 

           LINDA sits in the Chuckmobile as CHUCK talks on a pay phone. He’s 
           agitated, looks pissed off. 

                                 [on phone] Oh yeah? Well tell her 
                                 just ‘cause I’m outta town 
                                 don’t mean this becomes her party. 
           CAA 

                                 See, this is MY setup. This is 
                                 MY action. Is this comin’ through  
                                 to you, Dwayne? Am I makin’ myself perfectly 
                                 fuckin’ clear here? 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 Somehow, Chuck found a girl in 
                                 Pittsburgh who got me a job do- 
                                 ing deep throat...for forty dol- 
                                 lars. He started talkin’ that 
                                 stuff up the minute we left the 
                                 set. He sure hated Damiano and 
                                 everybody that worked on “Throat,” 
                                 but he knew he had some’m here 
                                 that was worth somethin’. 
           INT. HOTEL – DAY 

           In a posh hotel, LINDA and CHUCK walk toward the elevator.  

           LINDA touches the elevator button and the door opens. She looks at CHUCK 
           and we TURN AROUND with her look: a glaring, scowling CHUCK, pointing at 
           his watch, as if to say, Chop chop. 
                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 An’ all he could figure out to 
                                 get for it was forty bucks. 

           The door closes on LINDA. 

           CLOSE ON CHUCK’S EYES as he watches the elevator lights: the elevator 
           climbs...six, seven, eight... 

           INT. HALLWAY – DAY 

           LINDA gets off the elevator. She looks at her watch: 1:10. 

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER – AT A WINDOW 

           LINDA looks out onto the driveway of the hotel. No sign of the 
           Chuckmobile. She looks at her watch: 1:20. 

           She punches the elevator button. 

           INT. LOBBY – DAY 

           LINDA gets off the elevator. Looks around the lobby, left, right—-no 
           CHUCK. 

           She walks out into the bright light of the front driveway. 

           EXT. HOTEL – DAY 

           She walks down into the parking garage. 

           There, a 1968 Cadillac sedan is waiting. 

           Inside are BECKY, her friend from the beginning of the story, and 
           BECKY’s husband RICK. Quickly, LINDA hustles into the car—-FAST PUSH IN 
           as the passenger’s side door closes in our face. 

           INT. CADILLAC – DAY 
           CAA 

           Speeding down the freeway at what feels like 100 mph.

                                         BECKY

                                 on? We saw some a those movies.

                                 if you were in your right mind. 
                                 He had to have drugged you or 
                                 somethin’. Right? 

                                 Rick. You wanna turn left here. 
                                 No. Immediate left. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Hello? 

                                         CHUCK

                                 [pause] Mmmmm nope, not a thing. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Izzat a fact? 

                                         BECKY 
                                 No, Chuck, I ain’t heard nothin’. 
           CLOSE – TV SET 

           SARAH MILES is walking down a sandy beach holding a parasol in David 
           Lean’s “Ryan’s Daughter.” Maurice Jarre’s heartbreaking “Rosie’s Theme” 
           is heard. WHIP-PAN AROUND to reveal— 

           CLOSE – LINDA ON THE COUCH 

           watching the movie, Dr. Pepper in hand. She is clearly a bit choked up. 
           RICK and BECKY putter about in the kitchen nook nearby. The phone rings. 
           Slow zoom in on BECKY as she picks up. 

           Long pause. 

           LINDA turns around, suddenly understands everything, then walks right up 
           to BECKY. She makes no-no-no hand gestures. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Oh. [beat] Well allrighty then. 
                                 [beat] You just let me know in 
                                 case you hear of her. We had a

                                 You got it, Chuck.

                                 Beck. I am not going back there. 
           Click. BECKY hangs up. LINDA’s face is harder and colder 
           than we have ever seen it—-she looks as if she is about 
           to fly into a rage. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Hon. I know. I’m not suggesting

           LINDA plants herself down at the kitchen table, swills down her Dr. 
           Pepper, sullen. Nods. 

           INT. RICK’S HOUSE – NIGHT 

           LINDA is sleeping in the “guest bedroom.” This whole place is a nasty-
           ass biker pad with biker memorabilia everywhere, porny calendars with 
           half-naked women, racist cartoons on the wall, the whole nine.  
           WHIP-PAN OVER to BECKY’s chair, where she is sitting reading Irving 
           Wallace’s “The Seven Minutes” in paperback while the phone rings. 
           Quickly, so as not to wake LINDA, BECKY picks it up. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [scratchy connection; possibly 
                                 drunk or high?] Listen, bitch...

                                 I learned one thing in this life 
                                 and that’s nobody’s perfect. Even 
                                 the people you think they’ve 
                                 got nothing but godliness in ‘em 
                                 ...they’re not perfect either. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 Only one person ever was perfect 
                                 an’ that was Jesus Christ. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I’ll get it. 
           BECKY hangs up the phone. 

           EXTREME WIDE 

           BECKY sitting in the living room, realizing what is happening. She 
           struggles not to hyperventilate. We see LINDA in the “guest room,” 
           sleeping peacefully. 

           INT. RICK’S HOUSE – DAY 

           It’s the following morning. A sleepy LINDA is walking around in pajamas, 
           from the bathroom to the hallway leading to the living room... 

           LINDA walks into RICK and BECKY’s bedroom. Lots of pictures of them, 
           their family... 

           ...and on the nightstand is a lamp, some matches, a few crumpled packs 
           of cigarettes... 

           ...and a mirror with a few crumbs of cocaine on it, a little hash 
           pipe...some amyl nitrate...a LOT of rubbers... 

           ...and a tiny super-8 projector. 

           LINDA pulls the curtains in the room. 

           She turns on the projector: an image flickers of a dazed, drugged-
           looking LINDA standing in a room in bikini bra and panties. 

           A large, hairy, muscular man enters frame. LINDA looks frightened. He 
           reaches over and PULLS THE BIKINI TOP OFF. 

           PUSH IN ON LINDA, breathing loud and fast—-then SWERVE OVER TO PUSH INTO 
           THE PROJECTOR LIGHT— 

           INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY 

           LINDA sits looking at a Family Circus cartoon, eating oatmeal. In the 
           other room, RICK and BECKY are watching football. THE PHONE RINGS. 

           Pink Floyd’s “One of These Days” starts up again. LINDA picks up. 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Gunderson residence? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [on phone] Look out the window. 

           LINDA parts the curtains. ZOOM IN on a dirty, shitty-looking gray van. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You see that? I got Juan Jose 
                                 and Duwayne out there. They 
                                 got a couple a machine guns. 
                                 You don’t walk out that door 
                                 in about five seconds, they’ll 
                                 come in there and wipe that 
                                 fuckin’ place out. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 And I tell you what else. I 
                                 got bombs. 

                                         LINDA 
           We see what LINDA sees: a dimly perceptible CHUCK in the passenger’s 
           side...and a driver who looks like any dopy, half-bored kid. 

           Something is passing over LINDA...a trance... 

                                 You got...bombs? 
                                         CHUCK 
                                 That’s right. I got fuckin’ 
                                 bombs. I blow that place to 
                                 kingdom come. You just fuckin’ 
                                 test me, sister, you think I 
                                 won’t. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You got...machine guns...and 
                                 bombs?... 
           LINDA goes deeper into the trance... 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 That’s right, girl. You heard 
                                 me, girl. I turn that place 
                                 into Vietnam you don’t come 
                                 bookin’ out that door in about 
                                 five seconds. Now go. 

                                         RICK 
                                 [ingesting cheese popcorn] 
                                 What’s goin’ on. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He’s got bombs. 
           LINDA gently hangs up the phone and walks, in a steady, deliberate gait, 
           up to BECKY and RICK. 

           A pause. BECKY looks up. LINDA is fogged over, elsewhere. 
           CAA 

                                         BECKY 
                                 What? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Chuck. He’s got bombs and ma- 
                                 chine guns and he’s gonna blow 
                                 the whole place up. 

                                         RICK 
                                 Linda. [beat] What the fuck are 
                                 you talking about? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Right there—-he’s outside-—in the 
                                 van! He’s got machine guns and 
                                 bombs. He’ll blow you up. You 
                                 guys aren’t safe. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Linda—-will you relax? Chuck doesn’t 
                                 have “bombs”— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He has bombs. And machine guns. 
                                 He’ll kill you guys. I love you 
                                 guys ‘cause you stuck up for me. 
                                 You’re not safe. I gotta protect 
                                 you ‘cause you’re not safe. 

                                         BECKY 
                                 Linda would you—

                                 I gotta protect you guys ‘cause 
                                 you’re not safe. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Git in there, girl. 
           LINDA turns on her heels and heads purposefully for the door. 

           EXT. STREET – DAY 

           FAST PUSH IN as LINDA exits BECKY and RICK’s house and walks toward the 
           gray van. 

           As if by magic, the side door of the van opens. We hear a voice. 

           LINDA steps inside. The van door closes, engulfing her in darkness. 

           INT. BACK OF THE VAN – DAY 

           LINDA looks at CHUCK. CHUCK looks at LINDA.  

           They both seem glad to be back together. 

           CHUCK leans in as if he’s going to give her a kiss. Then, 
           after about three quarters of a second of a head move: 
           CAA 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Sit yer fat ass down back 
                                 there. [turning aside] On 
                                 the floor. 

                                         DOCTOR 
                                 Miss Boreman, I understand we 
                                 live an age of free love and 
                                 experimentation and so on. But 
                                 as a physician I have to tell 
                                 you...[embarrassed] I don’t know 
                                 how to put this in a delicate 
                                 way... 

                                         DOCTOR 
                                 [half a stage whisper] When you 
                                 have...anal sex...it’s necessary 
                                 for you to use lubricant. This 
                                 kind of violent penetration... 
                                 while it might be pleasurable 
                                 for you in the moment...is going 
                                 to damage the mucous membrane in 
                                 your rectum. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [fully zombied out] Oh. I under- 
                                 stand. That was a mistake. So I 
                                 made a mistake. 

                                         DOCTOR 
                                 Well. I don’t know if I’d say 
                                 a “mistake”— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I won’t ever do that again, pro- 
                                 mise. [vacantly raising hand for 
                                 an oath] Scout’s honor. 
           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE – DAY 

           LINDA sits across a desk from a DOCTOR in a white, sterile, 
           refrigerator-like office. 

           We see LINDA. She seems to have reverted to her old, zombified, post-
           Percodan self. 

           As if in a farce, CHUCK comes barreling through the door right at that 
           second. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Awright Doc! You guys had yer pri- 
                                 vate time. Now it’s Chuck Time. 
                                 Let’s get down to talkin’ turkey. 
                                 Lind, get that shirt off. 

           LINDA mindlessly peels off her blouse, revealing herself to be braless. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Now, Doc, come on over here   
                                 and let’s kick the tires for 
           CAA 

                                 a second. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So what yer telling me is that 
                                 for $475 I can pop ‘em up like 
                                 this— 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 --like sort of a Cadillac-fin 
                                 shape? 

                                         DOCTOR 
                                 I’d say that shape’s a little 
                                 severe. More of a perky—-kind 
                                 of a snub-nose sort of thing. 
                                 [leaning in to CHUCK] Does that 
                                 make sense? 
           CHUCK and the DOCTOR square off on either side of LINDA’s torso. LINDA 
           stares into space. 

           CHUCK holds and molds LINDA’s left breast. 

           The DOCTOR holds and molds LINDA’s right breast at the same time. 

           INT. KITCHEN – DAY 

           A topless, shoeless LINDA, with new Cadillac-fin post-surgery breasts 
           pointing up to heaven, wearing an absurd, dirty apron, makes CHUCK some 
           scrambled eggs while he sits at the table chewing sausage links and 
           reading Screw magazine. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Now go easy, don’t kill me  
                                 with that butter an’ shit!

                                 And then, friends, what happened? 

                                 A miracle happened. 

                                         CHUCK

                                 Okay? So positive energy, high

           CHUCK, dressed for nighttime action, stops LINDA as they 
           go to the door. Clearly they are about to go to a posh party. 

           He looks down at her—-longingly. He seems to want to  
           caress her and then he does, smoothing a tangle of her 
           brown curls off her cheek. He seems about to kiss her. 
           Instead, he summons something up inside himself. 

           Some trigger in LINDA is hit. She goes backwards.

                                 Oh Mr. Davis! I’d love to do it! 
                                 Please can I do it, Chuck? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [sippin’ on that fine Scotch] 
                                 Fuckin’ A right yer gonna do it. 
                                 That’s the road to the— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [trying to shut up this layer of 
                                 conversation] –-brand name, right. 
                                 Oh, Mr. Davis, I’d be so honored! 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 Number two, I’d like to invite 
                                 you to the home of a very good 
                                 friend of mine...Mr. Hugh Hefner. 
           LINDA squeals with joy. 

           He hands them two invites.  

           EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION – NIGHT 

           The limos and the Bentleys roll up. The valet parkers are eyeball-
           scorching Bunnies. 

           INT. PARTY – NIGHT 

           The luxe et volupte of the Playboy Mansion. Top-shelf champagne and 
           five-star cuisine. And many women, Bunnies and mere hangers-on, who 
           represent the most beautiful element of that slightly boho, sort of 
           Laurel Canyon, slightly coky/porno chic look of the period. 

           Chuckles all around as clompity-clomp high heel shoes are heard coming 
           down a heavenly flight of stairs. 

                                         HEFNER FLUNKY 
           CAA 

                                 Ladies and gentlemen, I give you 
                                 tonight’s guest of honor, Miss 
                                 Linda Lovelace.

                                 And her personal advisor, Chuck 
                                 Traynor. 

                                         HEFNER FLUNKY 
                                 Personal manager, Chuck Traynor! 

                                         HEF 
                                 Well! If that isn’t a little 
                                 Linda Lovelace I see before me! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Mr. Hefner! 

                                         HEF 
                                 You know you’ve done a great thing 
                                 for this business, Linda. And you 
                                 too, uh— 

                                         HEFNER FLUNKY 
                                 Chuck. 

                                         HEF 
                                 Chuck, right! You brought some 
                                 good nature and fun to the erotic 
                                 film. You made it possible for 
                                 Middle America to enjoy their  
                                 sexuality again—-and maybe try 
                                 something new! 

                                         AMBITIOUS FEMALE EDITOR 
                                 Y’know Hef, we get letters every 
                                 week from people out there saying 
                                 they tried deep throat for the 
                                 first time—-and they love it! 

                                         HEF 
           CHUCK whispers in FLUNKY’s ear. 

           More whispering. 

           Applause all around. 

           LINDA comes down the stairs and talks to stars she’s never heard of. She 
           basks in the spotlight. CHUCK is only semi-digging it: he’s scoping the 
           room for emotionally battered hot chicks. 

           Then, a sound is heard: the heraldic opening of Black Sabbath’s “Spiral 
           Architect.” 

           And down a spiral staircase walks The Man, the Man of Men, in his grape-
           colored velvet bathrobe, chewing a pipe, tiny glass bottle of Pepsi in 
           hand. 

           It’s HEF. Surrounded by two white girls with frizzy Afros. 

                                 Now isn’t that terrific, Lind? 
           CAA 

                                 Doesn’t that make you feel like 
                                 you’re actually doing a service? 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Say Hef! 

           Now here’s an oddity: for the first time in the movie, CHUCK is actually 
           nervous, humble, and altogether servile. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I know ya got a lotta big ballers 
                                 to greet at the Mansion here to- 
                                 night, but I’d love to peel ya 
                                 aside for ten seconds! 

                                         HEF 
                                 Shoot, Chuck. 

                                         BOBO 
                                 I like amyl a lot more than 
                                 downs. ‘Cause when I was a kid 
                                 Mother Superior tole me I had a 
                                 depressive personality. So I 
                                 need that liftoff. It makes my 
                                 clit so hard, it feels like a 
                                 pretzel kind of, y’know? 

                                         CHUCK 
           CHUCK pulls HEFNER aside. And everyone is stunned at the chutzpah. 
           Stunned that it worked! 

           THE PARTY – A WHILE LATER 

           LINDA is looking dazed and somewhat...embarrassed? BOBO, a beautiful, 
           tall, curly-haired girl, 24, is talking LINDA’s ear off. 

           Suddenly CHUCK is making three a crowd: he gets right in LINDA and 
           BOBO’s conversation. And he’s wicked nervous. 

                                 Lind. Okay? Ya need to 
                                 get yer ass out on the 
                                 courtyard in fifteen minutes. 
                                 Lind, you don’t fuck this one 
                                 up, y’know what we’re gonna 
                                 get? GRAY CARD. Y’know what  
                                 that is? 

                                         BOBO 
                                 [nodding solicitously] Lifetime 
                                 pass. Yeah, you want that, Lind. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 What are we doing? 

                                         CHUCK  
                                 Not important, just BE THERE, 
                                 COURTYARD, FIFTEEN minutes. 

           EXT. COURTYARD – NIGHT 

           Rich revelers with champagne flutes file up. 
           CAA 

           There is a bed outdoors with film lights trained upon it. 

           CHUCK walks up, hand on the back of LINDA’s neck, and walks her to the 
           bed. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Just kinda kneel face down 
                                 and get your tushy up to the 
                                 crowd.

                                 Miss Linda Lovelace with us 
                                 tonight. 

                                         HEF 
                                 And according to her husband 
                                 Chuck Traynor here...Linda has 
                                 a predilection we haven’t seen 
                                 even in her exotic movies! So 
                                 tonight you are gonna see a  
                                 match between….Miss Deep Throat

                                         FRITZ 
                                 Woof. 

                                         BOBO 
           HEF enters to much hubbubbery. 

           Applause. 

           Enter TWO BUNNIES walking FRITZ, a German Shepherd on a leash. 

           All laugh, start buzzing about the once-in-a-lifetime event they’re 
           about to see. LINDA goes into shock. 

           BOBO, the girl from before, comes up with champagne flute in hand and 
           whispers in LINDA’s ear. 

                                 Hey Lind! Y’know, to make sure 
                                 Fritz’ll get up there...just 
                                 stay real still. If ya wiggle 
                                 around they get freaked out, 
                                 ya gotta be still as a rock, ‘kay? 

                                         BOBO 
                                 Good luck! 
           LINDA looks up, dazed. 

           WIDE – FROM ABOVE 

           HEF is at the center, the master of ceremonies.

           CAA 

                                 Here we go ladies and gentlemen, 
                                 and may the best man—-or rather 
                                 woman—-or perhaps pooch—-win. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Come on. Come on, baby! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You want it. You wanna get 
                                 up there, baby! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 You know you want that sweet 
                                 coochie, Fritz! Get up! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Come on, sweetheart! Come on! 
                                 Get up there!

                                 All right. This was an experi- 
                                 ment. Fritz had a little tummy 
                                 cold all week, so this might 
                                 not have been the best time. 
                                 Another day, friends! 

                                         CHUCK 
           CLOSE – FRITZ 

           He is standing there, wagging his tail, tongue out. 

           FROM FRITZ’S POINT OF VIEW 

           LINDA, kneeling on the bed, her rump in the air. 

           LINDA waggles her rump. 

           FRITZ turns his head cockeyed. 

           LINDA waggles her rump some more. 

           WIDER 

           There is widespread disappointment and consternation among the partiers. 

           FRITZ BARKS, really loud, then backs off four steps. Laughs all around. 

           LINDA LOOKS ALL AROUND AT THE LAUGHING FACES. 

           HEF steps in. 

           Lots of “Awww!” as people quickly file back to the prosciutto-and-
           champagne receiving line. CHUCK gets right in there quick. 

                                 [more hurt than angry] Couldn’t 
           CAA 

                                 even get Fritz. God dammit, Lind! 

                                         HEF 
                                 Hey, you gave it a good shot. 
                                 You’ve got a lotta heart. 

                                         HEF 
                                 HEY. Linda. I just want you to 
                                 know. 

                                 I don’t in any way blame you for 
                                 this.

                                 Looks like I was pretty far down 
                                 and out with all these fancy 
                                 people, doesn’t it? But I got my 
                                 revenge, the very next day. 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 Man, that is some crazy shit, 
                                 that deep throat! It blows my 
                                 mind! I think about that shit 
                                 all the time! 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 Say, Lind...I’d be interested 
                                 in practicin’ that deep throat 
                                 myself. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Oh. [shutting down] Well. I’d 
                                 be happy to go down on ya, Sam. 
                                 If it’s all right with Altovise. 
           He stomps off. HEF helps LINDA up, puts her back together. 

           LINDA goes to go, but HEF stops her. 

           OVERHEAD – PENTHOUSE BEDROOM SUITE 

           From above we see CHUCK making out with a naked ALTOVISE and SAMMY 
           making out with a naked LINDA in a big circular swinger bed. 

           CLOSE – LINDA BLOWING HARRY REEMS 

           We see the famous “money shot” from “Deep Throat” in which NURSE LINDA 
           is going down on HARRY REEMS. Only, for our purposes, all the naughty 
           bits are blacked out with a GIANT RED BOX on the screen. 

           Suddenly gongs are gonging and rockets are bursting midair as LINDA gets 
           HARRY off. 

           WHIP-PAN AROUND TO –  

           SAMMY DAVIS’ PENTHOUSE SUITE – LIVING ROOM 

           where SAMMY, ALTOVISE, CHUCK and LINDA are watching. 

           SAMMY wraps an arm around LINDA. 
           CAA 

           ALTOVISE, watching the film, disgustedly raises a hand and makes a 
           “Tsssss!” noise. 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 No, now see...I was thinkin’ not 
                                 so much a being the throatee... 
                                 and more of being the throater. 

                                 Ya copy me? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Chuck would love that. 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 Mmm……………really? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Love it. 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 Cool! Let’s get some music on. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Hey, what’s up, Samuel. You 
                                 gonna give me a shoeshine? 

                                         SAMMY 
                                 No, Charles, I’m gonna do you 
                                 one better. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
           The wheels are turning in LINDA’s head. 

           SAMMY gets up. Puts on “The Candyman Can.” 

           He comes over and kneels down at CHUCK’s feet. 

           SAMMY takes that in, hatefully, for a second. 

           SAMMY unzips CHUCK’s fly. And buries his head in his lap. We see the top 
           of his head doing deep-throat motions. 

           CHUCK looks in horror and humiliation to LINDA. 

           LINDA shrugs, as if to say, “Oh well!” 

           ALTOVISE goes back into her knitting. 

           The “Love Theme from Deep Throat” on the TV mixes with “The Candyman” as 
           we go PUSHING IN ON CHUCK, over SAMMY’S BOBBING SHOULDERS, to reveal 
           CHUCK’s face. He is getting his cock sucked by an Afro-American male 
           with ten million dollars more than he has. 

           INT. SCI-FI SET – DAY 

           LINDA stands next to a sort of ROBOT-SLASH-COMPUTER that looks as if it 
           were made of old, chewed-on Legos. It has a little sine-wave where its 
           voice should be that wiggles, like the opening titles of “The Outer 
           Limits.” 

                                 Right around this time Chuck put 
           CAA 

                                 together a movie called “Deep 
                                 Throat Part Two.” Now with a  
                                 title like that alone, you’d 
                                 think it’d do some business, 
                                 but it never got released. Why? 
                                 ‘Cause the screenwriter’s name 
                                 was Chuck Traynor.

           The robot wiggles its “arms.” 

           CUT TO: 

           As in a ripped-up print, we move to a sequence a few beats later, where 
           the COMPUTER is atop LINDA (still, for some reason, in her “Deep Throat 
           I” nurse’s uniform), fucking her. 

           SMASH TO: 

           A POSTER  

           that reads RONNY SUMMER IS MR. LAS VEGAS! 

           The face on the poster belongs to a sixtyish homosexual wearing a black 
           turtleneck and, for Christ’s sake, an ankh. He is more overripe in his 
           queerness than Jack Cassidy petting a cat in “The Eiger Sanction.”

                                 started to open. [beat] The door out. 
           INT. RESTAURANT – DAY 

           In this Vegas hotel restaurant, LINDA and CHUCK have breakfast with the 
           great RONNY SUMMER. RONNY focuses all of his attention on LINDA—-kindly, 
           patiently, warmly, gently. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 What I’m saying is, “Linda in 
                                 ’76!” is gonna be a whole new 
                                 Linda Lovelace. Not the scarlet 
                                 woman we all know from the 
                                 movies. A corn-fed, fresh-fa- 
                                 ced American girl—-which is  
                                 what you are! Now I know you 
                                 can sing like an angel, and 
           CAA 

                                 I know you can dance too—- 
                                 better than the old shuffle- 
                                 ball-flap. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 So we’re gonna use that. We’re 
                                 gonna mold it. We’re gonna 
                                 make it so Ed Dweier and all the 
                                 local critics are gonna come 
                                 in here and say, “I never thought 
                                 I’d say it, but that Linda Love- 
                                 lace is gol-darn good.” 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 That was one thing I loved—-loved. 

                                 Well, two things. Ronny was kind 
                                 of a homo type. So Chuck couldn’t 
                                 bribe him with my body. 

                                 And two, Ronny would never—-never 
                                 ever, under any circumstances— 
                                 swear. He just couldn’t stand ris- 
                                 que language around him. 

                                         RONNY 
           LINDA giggles. She knows what this means. CHUCK doesn’t. Ha ha. 

           As RONNY keeps talking, and LINDA keeps nodding, and CHUCK keeps 
           scowling, we hear LINDA’s voice. 

                                 [resuming] We’re gonna try it out 
                                 here, work out the kinks for a 
                                 few months, then it’s Broadway 
                                 here we come, baby. I guarantee 
                                 it! [Burgess Meredith voice] So 
                                 whaddaya say, kiddo? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [overjoyed] I’m in! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 We’ll think about it.

                                 Between the bath towels and the

           INT. THE CHUCK AND LINDA PAD – DAY 

           Malibu. Glass walls overlooking the beach. CHUCK’s designer’s slightly 
           white-trash version of the mod décor we saw at the first Hollywood 
           party. Telltale crumbles of cocaine here and there.

                                 the man is a straight-up fag.

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Can’t trust a fag, man. Seri- 
                                 ously. You don’t know what 
                                 they’re thinkin’. I mean, I 
                                 know, he’s all respected in 
                                 his chosen profession and what- 
                                 not. But I just don’t trust it. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 Try this. “Red leather, yellow 
                                 leather, good blood, bad blood.”

                                 I form the syllables with my 
                                 mouth. “Red...leather...yellow

           RONNY sits at a table with LINDA. We go circling 360 degrees around the 
           table as RONNY does his My Fair Lady routine on LINDA. In the 
           background, out of focus, CHUCK has arms folded. 

           LINDA giggles.

                                         RONNY 
                                 Se-pul-chre. [beat] It means a 
                                 tomb. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 [out of focus] Uh, Linda? I’ll 
                                 be in the coffee shop when yer 
                                 done with all this bullshit. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 Again: 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 The more Ronny put the focus on 
                                 me, the less Chuck mattered to 
                                 anybody. And he knew he couldn’t 
                                 mark me up or all the money for 
                                 the show would be kaput. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 I’ve never had a girl like you. 
                                 So incredibly...open. And real. It’s 
                                 really quite extraordinary. You’re 
                                 just a gem. Gem in the rough. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 So why’d they turn the power off, 
                                 John? [beat] I paid that shit six 
                                 months in advance already. [sudden 
                                 bug-out] WHY, WHY, I’ll tell ya 
                                 why, ‘cause you’re NOT DOIN’ YOUR 
                                 JOB, JOHN. [beat] ‘Cause. [beat] 
                                 I got a lotta THINGS to do here. 
                                 [beat] THINGS. Like overseein’ 
                                 the show. [beat] Shit, man, I gotta 
                                 have eyes in the backa my head? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Hel-LO? Oh! Ya don’t say! Ya 
                                 DON’T SAY! 
           A loud clanging of the doors in the background. RONNY forces himself not 
           to notice this. 

           INT. RESTAURANT – DAY 

           RONNY sits with LINDA at a table, no CHUCK in sight. 

           INT. MALIBU HOME – DAY 

           LINDA does stretching exercises while CHUCK is on the phone. 

           ANOTHER PHONE LINE RINGS. LINDA picks up while CHUCK paces in the 
           background, drinking a bodybuilder shake.  
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Then we’ll have to see about 
                                 that then! [flirtatious] A- 
                                 won’t we? Eeehee! Eheeeheeheha! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Lind. [beat] LIND. [beat] We 
                                 need corn beef ‘n’ cabbage. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 [to CHUCK] Have Shelley do it. 
                                 [on phone] Uh-huh. You like 
                                 those other steps. Y’know, I 
                                 do too, and I’ll tell ya why— 

                                         RONNY 
                                 Here we go, friends. From ze 
                                 top. Monsieur Martine, ya wanna 
                                 take it? 
           Then something comes out of her: a long, fluted, a-hi-hi-ha laugh of the 
           kind you might hear from Fay Wray or some other “delicate,” “genteel” 
           film beauty of the thirties. CHUCK picks up a barbell and starts 
           bicepping himself. 

           INT. REHEARSAL ROOM – DAY 

           LINDA and COMPANY stand in front of a BIG AMERICAN FLAG with LINDA’s 
           face on it—-red red lips. Banners everywhere read “Linda in ’76!” 

           CHUCK, either furiously enraged or coked out of his gourd, is pacing 
           about pointlessly in the rehearsal room, which is choked with STAGE 
           MANAGERS, CHOREOGRAPHER’S ASSISTANTS, BACKERS who wish they could smoke 
           a cigar in here, and LOW-PAID FLUNKIES. Not to mention CHORUS—-a team of 
           extremely buff gay male dancers in red-white-and-blue costume. 

           MARTINE, the Filipino music director, sits at the piano. 

                                         MARTINE 
                                 A-five-six-seven-eight.

                                   kicks! 
                                 She certainly will get in her 
                                   licks! 
                                 Vote LINDA IN ’76! 
           The dance begins. LINDA stands in the center, unveiling herself in a 
           red-white-and-blue swimsuit. 

                                 No more Watergate and no more war! 
                                 No more high prices when you go

                                         LINDA 
                                 Hel-lo everybody! I’m Linda 
                                 Lovelace! And I’m so glad you

                                 I swore I wouldn’t say anything 
                                 dirty. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 Cut! Hold it. 

                                         RONNY 
           The CHORUS stomps around LINDA, humming “Hum, hum, hum, hum,” as if in a 
           Battle Hymn of the Republic style. 

           RONNY steps up. 

                                 Remember, Lind, I said this be- 
                                 fore. I SAID THIS FOUR TIMES 
                                 ALREADY AT LEAST: start with your back turned 
                                 and then turn out on “Hello  
                                 everybody.” 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Okay you got it.

                                 Five-six-seven-eight.

                                         LINDA 
           CHUCK is pacing furiously at this point. He goes to light up a cigarette 
           and then a LITTLE ASIAN ASSISTANT STAGE MANAGER says no-no-no. 

           LINDA whips around. 

                                 Hello everybody! I’m Linda Love- 
                                 lace! And I’m so glad you could

                                 their feet— 
           Everybody, in fear, stops. 

           He wraps a meaty arm around LINDA. 

           He grabs the ankle of one of the CHORUS MEMBERS, who clearly trembles in 
           fright. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 I mean, what the fuck is this

                                 It’s meant for MEN who want to 
                                 see a fine woman doin’ what...

           A VERY BRAVE STAGE MANAGER’S ASSISTANT comes up to stop this party right 
           now but CHUCK gets IN HIS FACE. 

                                         CHUCK

                                 your nieces and nephews— 
           ASSISTANT steps out of frame. 

           LINDA stares at her shoes. Then walks clean away from 
           CHUCK, all the way to the back of the room, where, in  
           time-honored star fashion, she holds her head in anguish as 
           TWO TEENAGE PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS tend to her misery. 

           A gasp and words of horror ripple through the room. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 --I’m comin’ after your mom an’

                                 you think I won’t do it ta you too?

           BACKER #3 pipes up at last.

                                 takes. YOU JUST TRY ME, FELLAS. 

           TWO BLACK SECURITY GUARDS ARE IN THE ROOM AND ON CHUCK’S SHOULDERS 
           before he’s finished his last sentence. 

                                         CHUCK

           CHUCK is hurled out on the street. He stands there for a second, getting 
           his Marlboro Man on again. 

           After a moment, he walks to a pay phone.

           PUSH IN FAST ON THE COUCH where LINDA is crying. RONNY SUMMERS has his 
           arm around her. She’s drinking a Dixie cup of water. 

           SLOW MOTION: RONNY SUMMERS VERY TENDERLY KISSES LINDA ON THE FOREHEAD. 

           EXT. PAY PHONE – DAY 

           CHUCK rolling calls. 

           CHUCK SMASHES SMASHES SMASHES THE RECEIVER INTO THE PAY PHONE. 

           He puts in another handful of change. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY 

           LINDA lies with her head in RONNY’s lap. For a long while. We look at 
           her staring off. 

                                 Friends: the day finally came.

           LINDA sits up. She kisses RONNY on the forehead. He closes his eyes with 
           a smile. She walks out of his hotel room. 

           EXT. HOTEL LOBBY – DAY 

           LINDA walks through the hotel lobby.

           LINDA is naked as a jaybird. But for the first time, not frightened, or 
           ashamed, just herself. She steps into the bathtub and the water zooms up 
           to her neck. 

           She takes a big giant purple glass swirly thing that looks like a 
           Faberge egg and pours it into the tub. Instant bubbles!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT 

           A long pause. LINDA thinks. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT 

           FARTHER OFF  

           We are several paces further back. CHUCK shrinks within the frame. 
                                         CHUCK 
                                 Dammit-—Linda—-do not hang up on

           STILL FARTHER OFF 

           CHUCK shrinks further within the frame. 

                                 I need this. Okay? I worked hard 
                                 for you. HARD. And I’ll be god-

           INT. HOTEL ROOM – NIGHT 

           An extremely long pause, then. 

           Quietly, thoughtfully...LINDA hangs up the phone. 

           EXTREME WIDE – CHUCK’S MOTEL ROOM 

           CHUCK is alone, holding a phone with no one on the other end. Suddenly 
           he looks small, and pale, and weak, and, strangely, quite old. 

           LINDA’S HOTEL ROOM – A SHORT TIME LATER 

           LINDA is crying her eyes out. It’s as if the whole previous story of her 
           life were pouring out of her. RONNY SUMMERS is holding her head, looking 
           at her tenderly. 

           Finally, she breaks out of her sobbing to speak to RONNY. 

                                 Do you...could you just... 
                                 could you love me? [sobbing] 
                                 Just for a little while? 
                                 I just...I know, it’s not 
                                 your way but...could you... 
                                 just, like, pretend? To love  
                                 me? For a little while?

                                 It was...like a dream. The money 
                                 came back, for a different show, 
                                 with no Chuck Traynor attached. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
           RONNY SUMMERS is overcome with emotion.  

           He pulls LINDA’s mouth into his—-and kisses her. As if devouring her. 

           EXT. CHEZ BEBERT – DAY 

           Outside this beautiful restaurant, right around the corner from Gertrude 
           Stein’s home in Paris, LINDA and RONNY and MANY OTHER GLOSSY BROADWAY 
           PEOPLE sit with glasses of red wine, laughing about an old story. 

           INT. HOTEL – NIGHT 

           SUMMERS pulls the sheet off the bed. Inside is a blushing, naked LINDA. 
           A fully clothed SUMMERS attacks a giggling LINDA, mashing his mouth into 
           hers. 

                                 And Ronny and I...we had the most 
                                 beautiful summer. It was almost like 
                                 it had made up for everything that 
                                 happened.

           EXT. CAFÉ – NIGHT 

           RONNY PRESSES HIS MOUTH INTO LINDA’s. You can see a softness in her 
           face, a giving-in, that is new. 

                                 And I know Ron was old and all, 
                                 but he was passionate! I never 
                                 had anybody love me like that. 
                                 Never. It was...it just was like  
                                 I was dreaming. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I had never felt love like that. 
                                 Someone who loved everything about 
                                 me. I just felt so warm and at peace. 
                                 I was in so much joy right then. 

                                         LINDA

                                 It’s called Hajijian. And no.  
                                 Or yes. I dunno. Let’s get this 
                                 show on first. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Hey, sweet. You think my Aunt Dar- 
                                 lene could come see this? She lives 
                                 in Missouri. It would mean so much 
                                 to her to show her all the nice 
                                 places we go to in Vegas. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 [brushing hair] Swell. Now we got 
                                 old Aunt Darlene comin’ in, gotta 
                                 take her to the steakhouse too. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Aw, it’d be nice. Oh, I forgot to 
                                 tell you. I need a couple bucks— 
                                 a little “advance” on next time’s 
                                 paycheck. 
           She pulls out of the kiss, looks into RONNY’s eyes. He touches her face, 
           very delicately—-reverently. 

           INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT 

           RONNY and LINDA’s apartment looks out on the Strip in Las Vegas. RONNY 
           is getting done up in a tux while LINDA sips a chic, Linda Ronstadt-like 
           rose and reads Cosmo. 

           RONNY is in the bathroom, sneaking a teeny little line of blow. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 Oh, for the love of Pete. What is it

           RONNY rubs a touch more on his gums.

                                 I KNEW IT. I knew I’d get into

                                 Mr. Summers” and things are gonna 
                                 be THE WAY I WANT ‘EM TO BE!

                                 Starting right now. Things are 
                                 gonna be JUST like I like it. 
                                 Take that fuckin’ dress off. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Wh...?

                                         LINDA 
                                 Wh----I------wh----- 

                                         LINDA 
                                 WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I 
                                 AM? HUH? YOU TELL ME. YOU TELL

                                 YOU’RE NOTHING! YOU’RE NOBODY.

                                         LINDA 
                                 ANSWER ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU! 
                                 WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I AM? 
           RONNY picks up an expensive bibelot off the coffee table and aims it 
           like a baseball. 

           Suddenly, LINDA goes berserk. 

           SHE PUSHES RONNY OVER THE COFFEE TABLE, which SHATTERS, onto the floor. 

           She gets over him and starts wailing and POUNDING ON HIM. 

           RONNY is stunned, bloody, helpless, looks like a senile old man or a 
           frightened baby. LINDA picks the receiver up from the phone. 

                                         RONNY 
                                 I—nn—nn—no—no—--- 

                                         LINDA 
                                 ANSWER ME! WHO AM I! WHO THE  
                                 FUCK DO YOU THINK I AM! WHO! 
                                 THE FUCK! DO YOU THINK! I AM! 
           LINDA IS POUNDING RONNY’S FACE WITH THE RECEIVER— 
           CAA 

           With a deafeningly loud bzzzzzzz, LINDA leaves the receiver on the 
           floor. SUMMERS is battered and near unconscious. She stands up. 

           She starts hyperventilating. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Huhhhhhh...oh my God...oh my 
                                 God... 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Ohhhhhhh...what’s happening? 
                                 What’s happening to me? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Excuse me—excuse me—can you 
                                 help me— 

                                         LINDA 
                                 PLEASE CAN YOU HELP ME. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 HELP! HELP ME! 
           SHE RACES TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR. 

           INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT 

           FAST FAST FAST PUSH DOWN THE HALLWAY as LINDA RUNS TOWARD US, 
           hyperventilating, crying, panicky— 

           She stops at one of the doors and POUNDS AND POUNDS AND POUNDS ON IT. 

           It is a tiny, terrified MEXICAN MAID. She slams the door shut. 

           LINDA runs further down the hallway. Pounds on another door. 

           The door opens. LINDA is bloody, wild-eyed, hyperventilating. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Please please please please 
                                 can you help me can you help 
                                 me? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Help me...please help me... 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Help me...can you help me 
                                 please... 
           The MIDWESTERN COUPLE inside start crying and shut the door FAST. 

           LINDA runs down the hallway... 

           INT. LOBBY – NIGHT 

           LINDA wanders through the lobby of the Beverly Wilshire, bloody-faced, 
           hyperventilating, “hysterical”... 

           EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD – NIGHT 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He’p me...he’p me...please  
                                 help me... 

                                         LINDA 
                                 PLEASE HELP ME! 

                                    DECEMBER 15, 1980 
                                       9:43 pm 
           ...and onto the street, where she goes stumbling... 

           Suddenly a shriek: 

           A CAR SCREECHES AS IT ALMOST RUNS HER OVER. Arms out, LINDA goes up onto 
           the hood. It stops and SMASH CUT TO – 

           TITLE CARD: 

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER – DAY 

           Behind LINDA is a series of posters reading “Inferno: The Linda Lovelace 
           Story.” Pictures of an anguished, soulful LINDA. 

           At the podium, LINDA has glasses, is dressed in a frumpy manner, and 
           looks much older than four years later. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 And so I must say that I get 
                                 up in the morning and I say 
                                 Thank God that we have a Pre- 
                                 sident Reagan gettin’ sworn 
                                 into office. Because I’ve met 
                                 with his people and I know 
                                 that they know pornography is 
                                 as evil and hurtful as I know 
                                 it is. We need to put a stop 
                                 to this industry at the begin- 
                                 ning of the eighties...so by 
                                 the time this millennium ends, 
                                 pornography will be like a bad 
                                 dream we barely remember. 

                                 I escaped my inferno for one 
                                 reason and one reason only—- 
                                 because of my love of Jesus 
                                 Christ My Lord and Personal  
                                 Saviour. 

                                         LINDA 
                                 He is my best friend...maybe 
                                 the only true friend I ever 
                                 had. I hope He can be your 
                                 best friend too. Thank you. 
           Who’s that guy laughing in one of the back rows? 

           A scattering of applause. Some hands are raised. 
           CAA 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Yes, you. 

                                         COLLEGE FEMINIST 
                                 Linda, I read your book. And I 
                                 just wonder: do you realize that 
                                 in telling the story in the way 
                                 you do, you’re going to do no- 
                                 thing but excite the Chuck Tray- 
                                 nors of the world? Do you under- 
                                 stand that they view your story 
                                 as pornography? 

                                         SEXY DECONSTRUCTIONIST 
                                 I have to just add one thing too: 
                                 don’t you view yourself—-as a  
                                 character in the book “Inferno”— 
                                 as always already co-signing and 
                                 enabling everything Chuck ever 
                                 did to you? I mean, are you so 
                                 naïve as to think that there’s 
                                 such a think as genuine innocence? 

                                         RADICAL SEPARATIST 
                                 That’s very true. I also have to 
                                 ask you: do you think Chuck Tray- 
                                 nor—-or Ronny Summers, or whoever 
                                 else hurt you and victimized you—- 
                                 do you think they’re really so 
                                 different from any other men? 
                                 Don’t you think your story, rather 
                                 than being scary and bizarre, is 
                                 really the story of how men are? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I... 

                                 You know, people come up to me some 
                                 times at these things and they use 
                                 big words that I don’t know. And I 
                                 don’t know how to answer their 
                                 questions. And I’m sorry for that, 
                                 I am. I should’ve learned and I 
                                 should’ve studied and that’s my 
                                 fault. But all I can say is this. 

                                 My grammaw told me one basic thing 
                                 when I was a girl and that’s never 
                                 lie. And I promise you, I promise 
                                 all the people in America, I have 
                                 never lied to you. And I never 
                                 would tell a lie. 

                                 And everything I’ve told you is true. 

                                 And... 
           A scattering of “Yeah!” and “That’s right!” 

           LINDA is trapped. 
           CAA 

                                 And I don’t know what else to say 
                                 about that. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I left the business and I didn’t 
                                 look back. I didn’t have a pot to 
                                 piss in and I still don’t. But I’ll 
                                 tell you, I feel a lot of peace. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I’ve had to do a lot of things I 
                                 didn’t like to do. And it’s hard 
                                 sometimes to remember the good 
                                 times and the money and the people 
                                 I met. But I’m proud to be where I 
                                 am. 

                                         LINDA VOICEOVER 
                                 I met my man Edward at a local bar 
                                 and we became good friends. That’s 
                                 how I think of us, good friends. 
                                 And he takes care of me now. 
           LINDA and her PUBLISHER look out at the crowd. They’re not buying it. 
           Or, maybe, not getting it. 

           Awkwardly, with a squeak of the microphone, LINDA gets down from the 
           podium. And leaves. 

           Suddenly the speakers of the theatre are filled with the tender sound of 
           ERIK SATIE’S “GYMNOPEDIE #2.” An end-of-life music, a song of rest and 
           peace and accounts settled and grudges let go. And an inner fulfillment. 

           MONTAGE – LINDA 1980 

           EXT. SUPERMARKET – DAY 

           A heavier, still curly-haired, glasses-wearing LINDA pushes a cart. 
           There are small children in it. It doesn’t look like a nice supermarket. 
           LINDA blends into the masses of moms with carts. 

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING – DAY 

           Track along hallway down to an open office door. Inside, LINDA pours a 
           garbage can into a bigger garbage can on wheels. 

           EXT. HOUSE – NIGHT 

           LINDA stands outside her house, looking at HER KIDS and the NEIGHBOR 
           KIDS running on the yard. In a moment, her husband, ED, comes out and 
           puts an arm around her. He’s a doughy fellow with a handlebar moustache 
           and coke-bottle glasses. It’s clear he loves her very much. 

           INT. BED – NIGHT 

           LINDA turns out the light. ED is already asleep. We are very close to 
           her face. She is still awake.

                                 Oh, and I forgot one thing: I did 
                                 see Chuck, just one more time, 
                                 right before I got out of the bu- 
                                 siness. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 ...Linda? 

                                         LINDA 
                                 Chuck. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Hey! How ya doin’ girl! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 All right. This is Mr. Solo- 
                                 mon.  

                                         SOLOMON 
                                 Hello. 
           INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT 

           LINDA is entering a posh Vegas restaurant with SOLOMON, a rich banker 
           dude with gray hair, though a youngish face. They are moving toward 
           their table. 

           LINDA stops. She puts a hand on SOLOMON’s arm. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Hey! I’d like you to meet my 
                                 good friend...Marilyn Chambers! 

                                         MARILYN 
                                 Hello! 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 You may’ve seen Marilyn in that 
                                 movie “Beyond the Green Door,” 
                                 she was dynamite! We’re in town 
                                 ‘cause we got some deals takin’ 
                                 off. So how you doin’? You look 
                                 all right! 

                                         LINDA 
                                 I’m good. We’re just...gonna 
                                 have some supper— 
           MARILYN, a sunny, nurse-like blonde, smiles, puts down her champagne 
           flute. 

                                         CHUCK 
                                 Well, don’t let me bother yall 
                                 none, you enjoy your dinner, 
                                 the shrimp scampi is terrific! 
                                 Great to meet ya, sir, and Linda, 
                                 take care! 

           CHUCK and LINDA have one last look at each other. If these 
           two other people weren’t here, they might say more.

                                 Okay. B’bye.

                                 But that’s all behind me now. 
                                 I just feel glad that my 
                                 friendship with Christ is so 
                                 strong, I know he is what got 
                                 me out of my bondage. And I 
                                 have trouble sleeping some 
                                 nights, but then I close my 
                                 eyes... 
           LINDA and SOLOMON walk away. 

           As they walk, LINDA notices CHUCK unconsciously putting his hand around 
           MARILYN’s neck—-in the same possessive gesture he always used with her.

           LINDA, awake, looking out. 

           She does.

           We pan up to a supernally bright, starry night sky. 

                                 ...and I think I’m safe now, I’m 
                                 safe at last, an’ nothin’ is bad, 
                                 an’ everythin’ is good as far as
