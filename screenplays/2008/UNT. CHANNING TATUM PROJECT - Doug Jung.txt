           FADE IN:

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           CLOSE ON ETHAN BURROWS (late 20’s). Face contorted. Sucking 
           wind through gritted teeth. Sweat soaking his hair. Running, 
           flat out-- Like his, or someone else’s life, depends on it...

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE on Ethan’s feet, taking stairs two, three at a time...

           INT. OLD APARTMENT - DAY

           BAM! Door to a rundown apartment is kicked open. Ethan stands 
           on the other side, a GUN DRAWN and an LAPD badge hanging off 
           his neck. His eyes are wide, almost frantic as he tries to 
           control his breathing. 

           Silence except for the SOUND OF DAYTIME TV coming from 
           somewhere deeper in the apartment.

           Ethan enters, cautiously hugging grimy walls. He passes a 
           bedroom door, slightly ajar. 

           Inside, a FIGURE, tangled in a sheet, lying on a dirty 
           mattress on the floor. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan, silently swings the door wide. Keeps a gun trained on 
           the bed as he approaches, carefully stepping over a few used 
           syringes. A butane lighter. Bent spoon. 

           He reaches down and pulls the sheet back revealing-- A NAKED 
           GIRL, maybe old enough to drive. Blonde. All-American. Her 
           face is blue. Lifeless, doll like eyes stare up at Ethan. 
           Track marks line her arm. Her ankle is tied to a radiator. 

           A dark look crosses over Ethan’s face as he gently pulls the 
           sheet over the Girl’s body. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan, gun trained ahead, moves slowly towards the sound of 
           the TV. He rounds the corner to the living room area where--

           A TV propped on an old table BLARES in front of a ratty 
           couch. Then, BOOM! BOOM! GUNSHOTS rip chunks out of the wall 
           inches from Ethan’s head! Ethan falls back.  

           FRANCIS BAKA (20’s), El Salvadorian. Full sleeve tattoos. 
           Baka emerges from the kitchen. Shoots wildly as he bolts for 
           an open window and out onto a fire escape. 
           Ethan recovers and gives chase. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRS - SAME

           Running up the stairs, not quite as fast as Ethan, is VINCENT 
           RESPARO (40’s). Every second of his time as a cop seems 
           etched on his face. He pauses at the SOUND OF GUNFIRE. Pulls 
           his gun and a walkie-talkie.

                                 VINCENT
                        Ethan! 

           Vincent continues up the stairs--

           EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan bounds down the rickety fire escape. Sees Baka kick the 
           glass in of an apartment on the second floor and enter.

           INT. 2ND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan leaps into the apartment. An ELDERLY WOMAN SCREAMS 
           CURSES. Ethan ignores her as he bolts for the front door. 

           INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Dark from the lack of windows. Ethan’s eyes adjust in time to 
           see BAKA at the end of the hall.

           BOOM! BOOM! Two more wild shots narrowly miss Ethan. One 
           dings a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, sending white gas EVERYWHERE. 

           Ethan emerges through the fog to see another APARTMENT DOOR 
           kicked open.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           BAKA makes a precarious leap down from the second story 
           window onto a rusted garbage dumpster. Lands with a LOUD 
           CLANG and bolts down the street. 

           Ethan appears in the same window. Makes the same leap, less 
           gracefully. Bounces off the dumpster, landing painfully onto 
           the asphalt. Pain is just more fuel for his anger. 

           BAKA bursts out of the alley. Barrels through the sidewalk 
           PEDESTRIANS. ETHAN follows, HOLLERING for people to move.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BAKA, turns and sends WILD SHOTS behind 
           him. SCREAMS and SHOUTS as PEOPLE react in panic! 

           A LATINO MAN is hit in the leg and crumbles. Blood pumping 
           freely. Ethan doesn’t stop, so focused on getting Baka.
           EXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           ETHAN rounds a corner onto another street. 

           BAKA across the street, waiting to ambush-- BOOM!BOOM!BOOM! 
           CLICK. Empty! 

           WINDOW behind ETHAN SHATTERS. He RETURNS TWO WILD SHOTS OF 
           HIS OWN. But Baka books into the alley--

           INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           ETHAN bounds into the alley. Sees the back door to a 
           dilapidated building swung open. 

           INT. DILAPIDATED BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside, a half-stripped out building. Most recent use looks 
           to have been a crack den. Graffiti on the walls. 

           ETHAN enters. Moves past broken sheetrock and exposed beams. 
           Sees Baka climb over a pile of rubble blocking a stairwell.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Vincent rounds the corner to the dilapidated building. Scans 
           up and down the street. An OLD MAN points up to the building. 

           EXT. DILAPIDATED BUILDING / ROOFTOP - DAY

           Clear view of the LA skyline. Baka stands at one end, gauging 
           the distance to the nearest building-- Not even close. 

           Ethan emerges from the stairwell door. Baka turns and sees 
           him. Drops his knife and raises his hands again.

           Ethan approaches Baka with a dark look in his eyes. 

                                 BAKA
                        Okay! Okay! I give up, man! I 
                        surrender! Miranda my ass!

           Ethan grabs Baka by the back of the neck. SLAMS his head into 
           his knee. Baka collapses. Looks up at Ethan with shock and 
           fear in his eyes.

           Ethan grabs his leg. Starts dragging him to the edge of the 
           building. Baka’s hands rake the gravel as he’s pulled closer 
           to the edge. His YELLING IN SPANISH goes unanswered. Then-- 

           ETHAN THROWS HIM OFF THE ROOF. 
           EXT. DILAPIDATED BUILDING - SAME

           Vincent speaks into his walkie as he approaches the building--

                                 VINCENT
                        Nora-Sixteen--Nora-sixteen! I need 
                        two units at Los Angeles and Union--

           CRASH! Baka’s body PLUMMETS down like a meteor into a parked 
           car right in front of VINCENT. He falls back, shielding 
           himself from the shower of GLASS and BLOOD! 

           Vincent cranes his head skyward. He sees ETHAN looking down 
           from ten stories up. 

           EXT. ROOF - SAME

           Ethan stands overlooking the LOS ANGELES skyline. Brown haze 
           hanging low, almost close enough to envelope him.

                                 SHRINK’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Do you wish you had made the 
                        arrest? 

           INT. SHRINK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           CLOSE ON ETHAN AGAIN. This time, sitting in a corporate 
           looking SHRINK’S OFFICE. His face is an impassive blank. A 
           PEN CLICK echoes like a gunshot in the silence.

                                 ETHAN
                        What do you mean? 

                                 SHRINK’S VOICE
                        I mean, you’re a police officer. 
                        You arrest people. That’s the 
                        criteria with which you measure 
                        success. It’s how you know you’re 
                        good at your job, isn’t it? 

                                 ETHAN
                        That girl was missing for three 
                        weeks. We only found her because we 
                        got lucky with a CI. Francis Baka, 
                        entrepreneur that he is, made her a 
                        junkie, then turned her out for 
                        anyone willing to pay. He tripped. 
                        He fell. And now he’s never going 
                        to do it again.

                                 SHRINK’S VOICE
                        It doesn’t matter how?
                                 ETHAN
                        Not to me. That’s what makes me 
                        good at my job. 

           More silent evaluation. Another PEN CLICK. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE/SHRINK (V.O.)
                        Okay... We’ve got a minute. 
                        Anything else you want to add? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah. You have a shitty job. 

           Ethan stands up and clears OUT OF FRAME.

           TITLES. 

           INT. ETHAN’S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MORNING

           Ethan finishes brushing his teeth. Takes a look at himself, 
           then tugs on a dress shirt. 

           INT. ETHAN’S APARTMENT / BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A bachelor’s home. Messy, but not without charm. Hanging 
           crooked on a wall are framed photos: Ethan’s Academy Class. 
           Ethan and Vincent on a fishing trip... A CHILD’S DRAWING of a 
           stick figure holding a badge... Several photos of ETHAN as a 
           boy with his Mother...

           Ethan comes out of the bathroom dressed in an off-the-rack 
           suit, no tie. Amidst the tangle of bed sheets is a BEAUTIFUL 
           GIRL, asleep. Her clothes hang off a chair.  

           Ethan starts out of the room without waking her.

                                 GIRL
                        What? No breakfast in bed? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I have to go to work.

                                 GIRL
                        I was kidding. You mind if--

                                 ETHAN
                        Stay as long as you want. 

                                 GIRL
                        Thanks. Um... I hate to ask but--

                                 ETHAN
                        Ethan.
                                 GIRL
                        Right. I’m--

                                 ETHAN
                        Towels are in the closet.

           Ethan heads out with an evasive smile. 

           EXT. VINCENT’S HOUSE - MORNING

           A modest ranch house in the Valley.

           INT. VINCENT’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Ethan enters the front door without knocking. Inside, sitting 
           on the floor is STEPHANIE RESPARO (7), Vincent’s daughter. 
           Dressed in a fairy outfit. She lights up when she sees Ethan. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        ETHAN! 

           She bounds into Ethan’s leg. Grabbing it. Ethan leans down 
           and kisses her on the forehead. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, sweetie. Your Dad home?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yes, but come with me first!

           She takes Ethan’s hand and pulls him over to a small table 
           set-up in the living room. 

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        You sit there.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh. Okay. Let me see...

           Ethan gently squeezes into a child-sized chair. Knees up by 
           his ears. Stephanie slides a small tea-cup in front of him.

           BETH RESPARO (late 30’s), enters from the kitchen carrying a 
           coffee mug and the LA Times.  

                                 BETH
                        Thought I heard someone. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, Beth. 

                                 BETH
                        You want coffee?
           Ethan holds up the tiny tea-cup. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m good. 

                                 BETH
                        Nervous?

           Ethan plays it off with a shrug. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Is Vince ready? 

                                 BETH
                        He’s getting out of the shower.

                                 ETHAN
                        Beth... Whatever happens today, I  
                        want you to know that I tried to 
                        keep Vince out of it. I would never 
                        put you or Stephie--

                                 BETH
                        Ethan. Please. He wasn’t going to 
                        let you go at it alone. 

           Beth offers Ethan a tight smile. There’s definite stakes 
           involved here. Vincent emerges from the hall, half dressed, 
           hair still wet. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Hey. How’d it go with the shrink 
                        yesterday? 

                                 ETHAN
                        The same:  Do you have rage 
                        fantasies? Are you plagued with 
                        guilt? Do you masturbate more than 
                        twice a day?

                                 VINCENT
                        So it went alright?

                                 ETHAN
                        What does it matter? It’s all about 
                        today, right? 

                                 VINCENT
                             (re: Ethan’s suit)
                        Where’s your tie? 

                                 ETHANNT
                        I forgot it. I don’t think I need 
                        one.
                                 VINCENT
                        You do need one. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t need one of yours. 

           Vincent disappears back into the hall. 

                                 LAPD OFFICIAL (V.O.)
                        In review of case number 433-122D. 
                        Officer Ethan Burrows...

           EXT. PARKER CENTER - DAY

           The monolithic headquarters of the LAPD nestled in the high 
           rises of downtown... 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Digital level readers bouncing on A LARGE REEL TO REEL tape 
           recorder. FOUR LAPD OFFICIALS, business suits and glasses, 
           sit in a row on one side of a long conference table. 
           MICROPHONES are positioned in front of them. 

           At the far end of the table is SGT. MICHAEL BRODY (40’s). 
           Unassuming. Almost paternal. 

           Ethan and Vincent sit on the opposite side. ETHAN wears a 
           GREEN TIE WITH SHAMROCKS. He and Vincent sit listening 
           intently next to a DEPARTMENT REP. 

                                 LAPD OFFICIAL
                        After reviewing the internal 
                        investigation we’re ruling that the 
                        death of Francis Baka was an 
                        accident. 

           Vincent and Ethan suppress their relief. 

                                 LAPD OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
                        We are recommending that your  
                        suspension be lifted effective 
                        immediately. Detective Resparo, you 
                        are no longer bound to 
                        administrative duties.  

           EXT. PARKER CENTER / HALLWAY - LATER

           Ethan and Vincent emerge with their DEPARTMENT REP. 

                                 DEPARTMENT REP
                        Congratulations. 
           Ethan and Vincent shake with the Department Rep as he heads 
           off. They both stand silent for a moment.

                                 ETHAN
                        Christ. For a second I thought they 
                        were going to go the other way.

           Ethan lets out a deep breath. He turns to Vincent who lets 
           out a deep breath as well. They share a smile. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m going to call Beth. 

           Ethan motions to the Men’s Room. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ll meet you downstairs.

           INT. REST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan at the urinal. We HEAR the DOOR SWING open. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Must have been the tie.

           Ethan turns to see Brody behind standing by the sink. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Jesus. Brody. I know we’ve been 
                        tight these last few weeks... The 
                        home visits. The wire taps. The 
                        tails... But can’t we all agree, 
                        even Internal Affairs, that at 
                        least this should be sacred ground? 

                                 BRODY
                        You should thank your partner. He 
                        really went to bat for you. Put his 
                        reputation, his pension on the 
                        line. The great Vincent Resparo’s 
                        word goes a long way.

           Ethan zips up turns around. 

                                 ETHAN
                        How about the truth? 

                                 BRODY
                        The truth? Like that Baka was so 
                        distraught over the evil of his 
                        ways that he jumped? Or that he 
                        miscalculated his 100 yard jump to 
                        freedom to the next roof? 
                                 ETHAN
                        Drugs. Who knows what they do to 
                        your thinking? 

           Ethan goes to wash his hands. 

                                 BRODY
                        Contrary to what you may have seen 
                        on TV, I’m not in IAD because I got 
                        my eye on a fucking corner office. 
                        Between me and you on “sacred 
                        ground,” I could give a shit about 
                        someone like Baka.

                                 ETHAN
                        So why then? The gun and badge not 
                        the pussy magnet you had hoped? 
                        Figured you’d take it out on the 
                        rest of us?

                                 BRODY
                        I just don’t like seeing good cops 
                        become bad cops.

           Ethan catches Brody’s eyes in the mirror. He’s being sincere. 

                                 BRODY (CONT’D)
                        If you are being straight, fucking 
                        fantastic. But if you’re not, the 
                        one thing I know for a fact, is 
                        that sooner or later those lies 
                        catch up to you and everyone you 
                        bring into them. Take care, Ethan. 

           Brody exits leaving Ethan alone. He turns off the water and 
           takes a look at himself in the mirror. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A modern building. Glass to floor windows. Nice, but with a 
           plastic, hollow feel to it. On the TV, an ANNOYING COMMERCIAL 
           BLARES on the TV.

           BYUNG-HO MOON (30’s), sharp but world weary eyes, stands in 
           front of the TV, flicking through channels-- All trash. Moon 
           shakes his head in disgust before turning the TV off.

           A CELL PHONE RINGS. Moon moves over to a small table by the 
           front door where his cell sits. Moon checks the TEXT message, 
           then pockets the cell, a set of keys and a pack of 
           cigarettes.

           He plucks a small PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFUL KOREAN WOMAN from a 
           mirror over the table and puts it into his wallet.
           EXT. THE PRINCE - NIGHT

           Located in the bowels of an old hotel. Moon leads two other 
           Koreans, SUK-JOON and JIE-HO, towards the door. 

           (*NOTE: Korean dialogue subtitled and indicated with “< >”.)

                                 MOON
                        <You’re sure he’s here?>

                                 SUK-JOON
                        <The bartender said he’s been here 
                        for an hour, at least.>

           INT. THE PRINCE - NIGHT

           Odd kitsch-mix of English pub decor. Red booths and dime-
           store portraits of English dignitaries juxtapose with the 
           clientele-- Everyone from YUPPIE COUPLES to HIPSTERS. 

           Moon, Suk-Joon and Jie-Ho head past the bar to the back room.  
           A booth full of KOREANS, mostly in their 20’s sit at a table 
           littered with booze and overflowing ashtrays. Their BANTER 
           and LAUGHTER stop as Moon approaches.

           Moon grabs a hair-gelled Korean punk, PETER LIM, and YANKS 
           him out of his seat and across the table. 

           INT. PRINCE / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Moon shoves Peter into the bathroom. Suk-Joon and Jie-Ho 
           stand guard outside. Moon pulls a small baggie of CRYSTALS 
           from his coat.

                                 MOON
                        <I had promised 95% purity. This is 
                        less than 80%. Are you trying to 
                        make me look like a fucking clown?>

                                 PETER
                        <Hyung... I told you. Sometimes he 
                        doesn’t have the best quality shit.  
                        I thought some was better than 
                        nothing-->

           Moon punches him in the stomach. Peter falls. Moon unleashes 
           a TORRENT OF KICKS and PUNCHES. 

                                 MOON
                        <Get up.>

           Peter slowly stands. 
                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                        <When I was your age, this kind of 
                        disrespect would not be tolerated.>

           Moon is almost shaking with rage. Peter wipes the blood from 
           his mouth, avoiding eye contact. Then--

           He STARTS TO LAUGH. The kind that gets harder the more you 
           try and stop it. Like a kid in class... 

                                 PETER
                             (through laughter)
                        <You--- You sound like my father!>

           Moon’s face slackens. Then in a FLASH, he sticks a KNIFE INTO 
           PETER’S THROAT. For a second it just sits there, embedded in 
           his artery. Peter touches it. Like it’s a new pimple.

           When he pulls it out, blood sprays out, hitting the far wall. 
           Peter crumbles. Blood pumps out of his neck onto the floor. 
           Moon picks up the knife and exits.

           EXT. DIRT LOT - NIGHT

           On a hill in East L.A. Downtown looms in the background. Moon 
           sits on the hood of the car, smoking a cigarette and wiping 
           the blood from his hands with a rag.

                                 SUK-JOON
                        <Do you think killing him was a 
                        good idea?>

                                 MOON
                        <Doesn’t matter. By this time 
                        tomorrow we’ll be home.>

                                 JIE-HO
                        <If he shows.>

                                 MOON
                        <He will show. Whatever else he is, 
                        President Shin is a man of 
                        etiquette.>

           Moon looks around at the garbage strewn lot. Empty beer 
           bottles. Fast food containers. Cigarette butts. 

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                        <I don’t think I can take much more 
                        of this place. These fat, lazy 
                        people. What a shit hole.>

           Moon takes a final drag of his cigarette and flicks it. 
           INT. PARKER CENTER / HALLWAY- NIGHT

           Ethan down the hall with a file box of personals. Fields a 
           few handshakes and congratulatory slaps on the back 
           accompanied with throwaway comments like, “Fuck IAD,” 
           “Killa,” “Nice going,” etc...

           It’s clear that Ethan enjoys the attention and how the others 
           view him. 

           We PICK-UP Vincent, staring at Ethan from across the room, 
           not amused by Ethan’s “hero” welcome. 

           INT. ETHAN AND VINCENT’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Small office shared by Ethan and Vincent. Vincent’s side is 
           an explosion of memorabilia collected through his career. 

           Ethan enters to find Vincent waiting by the door, face grim. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s over now, I’m just going to 
                        say this once: Don’t ever put me in 
                        that position again.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re the only one who knows what 
                        happened on that roof. End result, 
                        some asshole like Baka’s dead, I 
                        couldn’t care less. But it better 
                        not be because of that--

           Vincent points out to the bullpen. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        The bullshit back slapping and 
                        secret handshakes. It better not be 
                        because you like the way they think 
                        of you.

                                 ETHAN
                        They’re just letting me know they 
                        got my back.
                                 VINCENT
                        What? You think that if the hearing 
                        went the other way, they’d be 
                        signing a petition saying how good 
                        of a cop you are?

                                 ETHAN
                        I am good cop. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Ethan, those assholes don’t give a 
                        shit about you! You’re fucking 
                        dinner conversation... What they 
                        tell TV writers to look cool. Don’t 
                        listen to them!

                                 ETHAN
                        Way I see it, there’s one less 
                        piece of shit breathing the same 
                        air as us. Whatever the reason, I’m 
                        fine with it.  

                                 VINCENT
                        But just know every time you do 
                        something questionable, it’s not 
                        only me and you under the lamp. 
                        You’re putting Beth and Stephie 
                        under with us. Next time you put us 
                        in that position, I will do what 
                        ever it takes to keep them out of 
                        it.

           There’s a momentary stand-off. Ethan fumes like a scolded 
           teenager. Vincent stands firm.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Uh... Sorry to interrupt...

           REVEAL the WATCH COMMANDER standing in the doorway.

                                 WATCH COMMANDER
                        I heard you guys were back on. I 
                        got something. If you want it...

                                 VINCENT
                        ‘Course we fucking want it. 

           EXT. KOREA TOWN - NIGHT

           A police helicopter traces a spotlight in a tight circle. 
           EXT. THE PRINCE BAR- NIGHT

           Now a crime scene. Lights are turned on. Various FIRST 
           RESPONSE PERSONNEL moving in and out of the bar.

           Ethan and Vincent walk in tense silence towards the building. 
           Ethan still fuming.

                                 VINCENT
                        Jesus. Now you’re just not going to 
                        talk to me? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m talking.

                                 VINCENT
                        No, you’re acting like I just broke 
                        up with you.

           Vincent stops. Turns to Ethan. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You know how many guys I’ve seen 
                        who think they’re Super-Fucking-
                        Fly? Go through a door, swinging 
                        their dicks, only to get shot. Or 
                        get busted down by IAD? That’s not 
                        going to be you. I taught you 
                        better than that. 

           Ethan nods slowly.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Now, you will stop acting like a 
                        sulky bitch? We gotta go fight 
                        crime.

           Vincent slaps Ethan hard on the back with a smile, breaking 
           the tension. Ethan finally cracks a grin as well. 

           INT. KAROAKE BAR / BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ethan and Vincent kneel over Peter’s dead body. Ethan 
           examines the stab wound in his neck.

                                 ETHAN
                        Right into the artery. I’d say he 
                        lasted 90 seconds. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Good to be out of the office, huh?

           Vincent turns to UNIFORMED OFFICER RAMIREZ (30’s). 
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        How are we doing with witnesses? 

           INT. THE PRINCE - MAIN ROOM

           The VARIOUS PATRONS we saw earlier. All sitting at tables 
           being interviewed by UNIFORMED OFFICERS.  Ethan and Vincent 
           walk with RAMIREZ who motions to the Koreans from PETER LIM’s 
           booth, huddled together at a table. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        One of the girls said the victim’s 
                        name was Peter Lim. We’re running 
                        it now.

                                 VINCENT
                        Anyone see the killer? 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Asian. Five-ten or eleven. Rolled 
                        in with two other Koreans. No one 
                        knew his name. 

           Ethan does a double take at the table. One of the Korean 
           guys, TONY (20’s), is angling his face away from Ethan. We 
           recognize him from Peter Lim’s table. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I know that skinny prick. 
                             (approaching)
                        Tony Lee! The only Korean I know 
                        with a Wop name. Last time I saw 
                        you, you were crawling the walls at 
                        St. John’s rehab. Old habits dying 
                        hard, Tony? 

           Tony rolls his eyes. Knows his night just got worse.

                                 TONY
                        No, sir, Officer. I’m clean. 

           Ethan grabs the back of his collar and pulls him out and 
           leads him to an empty booth in the corner.

                                 ETHAN
                        Girl in the back said that it’s 
                        your boy applying the red lacquer 
                        to the bathroom floor. 

                                 TONY
                        I don’t know those skanks. 
                                 ETHAN
                        Empty your pockets. 
                             (off Tony’s silence)
                        If you’re really clean--

           Tony shifts uncomfortably in his chair. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I swear to God, Tony, I find out 
                        you’re even carrying fucking 
                        Tylenol, I’m going to violate you 
                        back on strike three. No more of 
                        this pussy county shit. You’re 
                        Federal. Mandatory minimums. 
                        Lompoc. 

                                 TONY
                        And if I give you something? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Depends what that is.

                                 TONY
                        The guy who killed Peter. His name 
                        is “Moon.” At least that’s what we 
                        called him. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (unimpressed)
                        Fuck you, Tony. Empty your pockets.

                                 TONY
                        Hold up! I know where you can find 
                        him! He asked Peter to find him a 
                        place for some kind of meeting. 
                        Place on Temple called Diamond.

                                 VINCENT
                        When?

                                 TONY
                        Tomorrow night. 

           Ethan looks at Vincent who nods. They start walking away.

                                 ETHAN
                        Was that so hard?

                                 TONY
                             (under his breath)
                        Don’t want to get my ass thrown off 
                        a roof, too. 

           Ethan stops and turns, anger rising.
                                 ETHAN
                        What the fuck did you say, Tony? 

           Tony covers his head as Ethan steps towards him. Vincent 
           steps in and pulls Ethan back. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Okay. Alright. Easy. 

           Tony still cowers even after Ethan’s pulled away. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           A freshly washed SILVER BMW 750 sits parked by the elevator. 
           Two suited Koreans, a DRIVER AND A BODYGUARD, stand by the 
           front fender. A third stands by the back. This is--

           JAE PARK (29). Neatly cut hair. Well fitted suit. Park moves 
           with a compact economy. There is an exacting precision in his 
           expectations and actions. 

           Park moves over to the Driver and straightens his slightly 
           slacking composure. There is a real look of disgust in his 
           eyes as he does so.  

           The ELEVATOR PINGS on arrival. Out steps PRESIDENT SHIN (65). 
           Could be a CEO. 

           Park is Shin’s chief protector and his commitment is absolute 
           as demonstrated by his deep, deferential bow to Shin. He 
           opens the back door of the BMW.

           INT. SHIN’S BMW - CONTINUOUS

           Park takes a seat next to Shin. As the other two get in. The 
           Driver turns the key and RAP BLASTS from the radio. 

           Park slaps the back of the Driver’s head hard as the Driver 
           turns the radio off with a mumbled APOLOGY IN KOREAN. 

                                 PARK
                             (subtitled in Korean)
                        <Sorry, Boss. It won’t happen 
                        again.>

           SOOTHING CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the car. 

           EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT

           The BMW pulls out from a high rise on the Wilshire Corridor.
           INT. SHIN’S BMW - LATER

           Shin and Park riding in silence. Park is scanning the road 
           even from the back seat, ever vigilant. Shin takes in the 
           view: Signs in Spanish. Seedy looking liquor stores.

                                 SHIN
                        <When is our flight?>

                                 PARK
                        <In a few hours.
                             (a beat)
                        Is this meeting necessary?>

                                 SHIN
                        <He made a request through the 
                        others. We will take the meeting on 
                        the way to the airport.>

                                 PARK
                        <I don’t trust him.>

                                 SHIN
                        <He can’t do us any harm here.> 

           Shin takes note of Park’s grim intensity.

                                 SHIN (CONT’D)
                        <When we get home, I want you to 
                        take a week in Macau. On me. You 
                        need to relax. Have some fun.>

                                 PARK
                             (dead pan)
                        <I have fun.>

           Shin grins, shaking his head. 

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Shin’s BMW pulls into a dark, garbage strewn alleyway behind 
           a strip mall. Comes to stop by Jie-Ho and Suk-Joon. Park gets 
           out first and opens the door for his boss. 

           Customary bows of respect are exchanged. Jie-Ho and Suk-
           Joon’s bows are not very deep. Park takes note of the slight. 

                                 GANGSTER#1
                        <President Moon is waiting 
                        downstairs.>

           Suk-Joon frisks Park. Unarmed. Jie-Ho reaches for Shin--  
           In the blink of an eye, Park grabs Jie-Ho’s hand and with a 
           quick jab to the throat, sends him down, CHOKING.  

           The other’s react, including Shin’s DRIVER and other BODY 
           GUARD. YELLING and SHOVING. Before things explode--

                                 SHIN
                        <Stop this juvenile shit!>

           Shin looks at Park, who reluctantly lets go of Jie-Ho. Suk-
           Joon opens the heavy metal door. Shin, Park and the Other 
           Bodyguard step inside.

           The Driver stays by the car in the alley. 

           INT. DIAMOND / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           President Shin, Park and the others are led down a long 
           hallway. TECHNO-MUSIC BLARES. 

           They pass a doorway leading to a smoke-filled club-- Lights 
           and KOREAN CLUBBERS-- to another staircase.

           INT. DIAMOND / RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Large, dark space. Walls lined with supplies and cases of 
           liquor. In the middle of the room is a long table. Placed on 
           it are plates of sliced fruit and booze. 

           Moon leans on the edge of the table smoking. As President 
           Shin and the others are lead downstairs, he straightens and 
           crushes his cigarette. 

           Moon meets Shin with a bow. Shin returns, but not as deep. He 
           is the oldest. He is deferred to. 

                                 MOON
                        <President Shin.>

           EXT. KOREA TOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Vincent’s car parked across from the strip mall. He and Ethan 
           head towards the busy parking lot and THRONG of KOREAN 
           CLUBBERS waiting to get inside. Vincent and Ethan push their 
           way through the crowded parking lot. 

           INT. DIAMOND / BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Shin and Moon sitting across from one another at the table. 
           Park and the other BODYGUARD stand behind Shin. Jie-Ho and 
           Suk-Joon hang back by the door. 
                                 MOON
                        <Of course, the stories are 
                        legendary. How you and the older 
                        Presidents, Chung, Hahn, Bo, drove 
                        the Yakuza, then the Triads out of 
                        Korea. Of all those great 
                        Presidents, now you are the last.>

           Moon is careful and deferential to the older man. Park is 
           tense, Moon’s display of reverence breeding suspicion in him.

                                 SHIN
                        <What do you want, Moon?>

                                 MOON
                        <It has been three years since I 
                        was asked to leave.>

                                 SHIN
                        <You were bringing too much 
                        attention.>

                                 MOON
                        <And I left, without hesitation. 
                        Without question. My time here has 
                        been humbling, but not 
                        unproductive. I have many contacts 
                        that might interest you and the 
                        other Presidents.>

                                 SHIN
                        <We are doing well with our normal 
                        businesses. The girls. The bars. 
                        There is a balance. These “other 
                        interests”... They will bring 
                        attention. The other Presidents 
                        know my position.>

                                 MOON
                        <I was hoping to change your mind.>

                                 SHIN
                             (standing)
                        <We have a plane to catch.>

                                 MOON
                        <Of course, President Shin.>

           Moon stands. Steps back from his chair and bows in a 
           traditional gesture of respect to Shin. As he heads for the 
           door, he gives SUK-JOON and JIE-HO the slightest look. 

           PARK catches it. Grabs Shin as MOON’S MEN pull out guns-- 
           EXT. DIAMOND / FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Ethan and Vincent contend with hostile shouts as they talk 
           with TWO KOREAN DOORMEN.  Negotiations seem difficult since 
           the Doormen don’t speak English. 

           INT. DIAMOND / DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           GUN SHOTS ERUPT over the BLARE OF MUSIC. Like a tidal wave, 
           panic builds as the CLUBBERS stampede towards the front door.

           EXT. DIAMOND / FRONT DOOR - SAME

           The Doormen, Ethan and Vincent all react to the TIDAL WAVE of 
           PEOPLE coming at the front door. 

           Another muffled round of GUNSHOTS. Vincent and Ethan FIGHT 
           their way in against the tide of fleeing CLUBBERS.

           INT. DIAMOND BASEMENT - SAME

           Shin’s OTHER BODYGUARD is riddled with bullets, COUGHING 
           BLOOD in his last breaths.

           PARK kicks over the table. Pushes Shin back and under the 
           banquet tables. Cracks off the leg of a chair--

           SUK-JOON slaps a new clip in. Walks towards the table 
           shooting. Playing. Like they were fish in a barrel. 

           PARK suddenly shoots up from around the table. Drives the 
           broken table leg into Suk-Joon’s thigh like a stake. SUK-JOON 
           SCREAMS. Park pulls it free and--

           THUNK! Drives it into his neck!

           JIE-HO turns, shocked at the sight of Suk-Joon, trying to 
           pull the wood from his neck. He fires clumsily. 

           PARK slides under the line of fire, kicks Jie-Ho’s legs out 
           from under him--

           THE GUN CLATTERS to the floor. Park and Jie-Ho wrestle to the 
           ground-- Punching-kicking-thrashing--

           PARK gains some leverage. He grabs Jie-Ho’s head with both 
           hands and TWISTS--

           JIE-HO’s eyes bulge as his neck twists unnaturally. His hand 
           desperately searches and finds the GUN on the floor--

           PARK STRAINS, TWISTING as hard as he can--
           JIE-HO wobbly points the gun at PRESIDENT SHIN, trapped under 
           the banquet--

           THIS IS A RACE. Can Park kill this guy before he shoots Shin?

           BOOM!!! CRACK!!! 

           First sound is the GUNSHOT into Shin’s head. Second is the 
           Other Shooter’s NECK BREAKING, a millisecond too late. 

           Park kicks the limp body off of him. Scrambles to Shin...

           INT. DIAMOND - NIGHT

           A chaotic STAMPEDE of PEOPLE streaming for the doors. Ethan 
           is separated from Vincent as they push their way in. 

           Ethan fights his way past the bottle neck of the foyer 
           towards the more open dance floor/lounge area. All KOREAN 
           FACES. Hard to tell who from what. Ethan sees--

           MOON emerge from the back. Moving quickly but calmly through 
           the chaos-- Too calmly. Ethan beelines for Moon.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey!

           Ethan throws Moon him up against the wall. Moon reacts 
           surprised, but makes a subtle move towards the inside of his 
           coat. 

           Ethan grabs his arm, but Moon quickly backhands Ethan with 
           his other hand. Ethan’s head is snapped back, but he doesn’t 
           lose his grip. He then starts to mercilessly punch Moon. 

           VINCENT appears at the other end of the room. From his POV, 
           it appears that Ethan has lost control again. Vincent rushes 
           over and shoves Ethan off. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Jesus Christ, Ethan! This is what 
                        I’m talking abou--

           A FLASH of METAL. Moon pulls a knife and flicks it across 
           Vincent’s neck. Whole thing happens in the blink of an eye.

           Almost like a delayed reaction, Vincent reaches up and 
           touches his neck, seeing blood on his fingers. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (shocked)
                        Vince?
           Moon’s already running for the door as Vincent crumbles, 
           blood oozing from the razor thin cut along his jugular. Ethan 
           grabs him. Tries to stop the bleeding. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Vince! Somebody! 

           Vincent’s eyes stare up at Ethan, fighting to the last second 
           as he tries to say something to Ethan before he dies.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - SAME

           SHIN’S DRIVER stands nervously by the idling BMW. Moon 
           appears from the door and before the Driver can react, Moon 
           shoots him in the chest. 

           MOON gets into the BMW and SMOKES the TIRES in reverse. 

           ETHAN emerges from the back door a second later. Sees the 
           DEAD DRIVER on the ground and the BMW jamming backwards--

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Moon’s escape out of the alley is blocked by a line of CARS 
           waiting at a red light on the perpendicular street. MOON GUNS 
           THE BMW and--

           SLAMS into a TAXI blocking his way!

           The TAXI DRIVER’S HEAD SMASHES into the side window on impact 
           as the BMW PLOWS the TAXI SIDEWAYS across the street, then 
           ROARS forward, disappearing down the street.

           INT. DIAMOND / BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           MORE COPS head downstairs. Pure carnage. Blood on the walls 
           and floor. Bodies. Spent casings... 

           PARK sits on the floor, cradling President Shin’s body.

           INT. DIAMOND - LATER

           UNIFORMED COPS arrive and storm inside the empty club. Music 
           videos still eerily running on the SCREENS...  

           ETHAN sits next to Vincent’s body, face ashen with shock.

           INT. PARKER CENTER / OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Two way mirror looks into an interview room. Ethan and 
           CAPTAIN MANNING (50) watch as ALAN KIM (30’s, Korean-
           American), glasses, talks to Park. Or tries to. Park remains 
           motionless and silent.
                                 MANNING
                        You okay?

                                 ETHAN
                        No. 

           Alan seems to almost be pleading with Park, but he remains 
           eerily still.

           INT. PARKER CENTER / OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

           Ethan, Manning and Alan. Park still in the interview room in 
           the exact same position. Alan hands Manning faxed pages:  Mug 
           shots of PARK and SHIN with accompanying criminal records, 
           all in Korean. 

                                 ALAN
                        His name’s Jae Park. Korean 
                        national. He’s “Jopok”. Korean 
                        Organized Crime. I’m guessing this 
                        is his boss. They call them 
                        “Presidents.”

           Alan holds up the photo of SHIN’S BODY.

                                 MANNING
                        What was he, some kind of regional 
                        boss or something? 

                                 ALAN
                        Probably. Jopok isn’t structured 
                        like Yakuza or the Triads. They 
                        tend to run in independent groups. 
                        Each one has their own President.

                                 ETHAN
                        What about the guy who killed 
                        Vincent? Moon?

                                 ALAN
                        We sent a description and the tag, 
                        “Moon” to Seoul Police. 
                             (with a shrug)
                        But... 

                                 MANNING
                        What about this guy?

                                 ALAN
                        Well, technically, he hasn’t broken 
                        any laws, except for the fact that 
                        he’s an illegal alien. We’re going 
                        to deport him. Send him back to 
                        Seoul and let them deal with him. 
           Ethan grabs the file. Rushes out.

                                 MANNING
                        Ethan! Burrows! 
                             (getting up)
                        Shit...

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan enters the room. Park barely looks up at him.

                                 ETHAN
                        WHO IS HE?

           Park remains silent. Ethan opens the file folder. Pulls out a 
           small stack of CRIME SCENE POLAROIDS FROM DIAMOND. Ethan 
           drops them one by one onto the table in front of Park-- 
           Bloody images of dead bodies... 

           Park remains unmoving until a POLAROID OF SHIN’S BODY lands 
           in front of him. His eyes deceive him as they flicker down.

           Ethan sees Park’s reaction. Picks up the PHOTO OF SHIN. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        He meant something to you, didn’t 
                        he? Who did this? Where can I find 
                        him?  

           Park’s face goes blank again. Ethan ERUPTS. Throws the table 
           out of the way. Shoves Park backwards in his chair. Park hits 
           the floor hard. 

           Ethan moves over him. CRAMS the POLAROID into his face.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        TELL ME!

           Manning and Alan rush in and pull Ethan off. Park stands and 
           brushes off his pants. For a moment, Ethan and Park’s eyes 
           meet. A kind of simpatico evident despite what just occurred. 

           INT. VINCENT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ethan standing across from Beth. She’s crying. Ethan looks 
           unsure of what else to say.

                                 BETH
                        Do-- Do they know where he is?

                                 ETHAN
                        They’re looking. They’ll find him.

           Beth looks up at Ethan. His assurances seem hallow.
           INT. VINCENT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan heads through the dark family room towards the door. A 
           small face peeks out from the dark of the hallway.

                                 STEPHIE
                        Ethan? 

           Ethan looks at the small girl. Can’t offer any words, just 
           heads out.

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT - EARLY MORNING

           Ethan walking down the hall. He’s met by Manning.

                                 MANNING
                        They found Moon’s car at Burbank 
                        airport. It was abandoned on the 
                        tarmac. There was a flight log for 
                        a private jet going to Seoul. We 
                        notified Korean authorities just 
                        now, but...

                                 ETHAN
                        But what? 

                                 MANNING
                        His plane landed two hours ago. 

           Ethan’s rocked back on his heels.

                                 ETHAN
                        He got away...

           Manning tries to find some words of comfort, but can’t.

           INT. PARKER CENTER / ETHAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Ethan sits across from Vincent’s desk. Ethan’s eyes move over 
           Vincent’s belongings-- Coffee mug. Family photo. Two-year old 
           bank calendar. Innocuous items each now loaded with meaning.

           Through the glass, he sees the hustle and bustle of the 
           bullpen. Just another day for those outside...

           INT. ETHAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ethan sitting in the dark, jacket still on, staring off into 
           space. He’s been there for a while.  A rhythmic CLICK-CLACK 
           noise... Ethan absentmindedly works the slide on his gun 
           while staring off into space.  

           A KNOCK on the door snaps him out of his trance. He answers 
           to find Beth there. She pushes her way in.
                                 ETHAN
                        Beth. What--

                                 BETH
                        The one who killed Vince-- They 
                        told me that he got away.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah... 

                                 BETH
                        What are you going to do about it? 

                                 ETHAN
                        There’s nothing I can do. He’s in 
                        Korea. 

                                 BETH
                        He was looking out for you when he 
                        was killed, wasn’t he?
                             (off Ethan’s silence)
                        I always said that one day you were 
                        going to get him killed.

           Ethan looks away from Beth’s unwavering eyes. 

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        He’s always looked out for you. Now 
                        it’s time you do the same.
                             (Ethan looks back up)
                        You find him, Ethan. Find him and 
                        you kill him. 

           Ethan reacts with some surprise, then nods in agreement. 

           INT. ETHAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Ethan at his desk. Fresh determination on his face. PARK’S 
           TOPSHEET sits on his desk. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (on the phone)
                        Yeah, yeah... That’s right. Park. 
                        He’s being handed over to Federal 
                        Marshals. I just need to know 
                        travel dates, details, for the 
                        report... Go ahead... Two-zero-nine-
                        zero? 

           Ethan starts to tap the keys on his computer, pulling up a 
           travel website. 
           INT. PARKER CENTER - DAY

           Brody walks through the halls approaching Ethan and Vincent’s 
           dark office.

                                 MANNING (O.S.)
                        He’s not in.

                                 BRODY
                        I wanted to tell him that I was-- 
                        Detective Resparo. Everyone 
                        respected him.

           Manning nods as an acknowledgement.

                                 MANNING
                        Burrows took a leave. 

                                 BRODY
                        Know how to get in touch with him? 

                                 MANNING
                        No. But I think that’s the point. 

                                 BRODY
                        Mind if I leave a note?

           Manning shrugs then heads off. Brody approaches Ethan’s desk. 
           Grabs a pen then sees PARK’S TOPSHEET among the desk clutter.

           Brody gets curious. He accidentally nudges the Ethan’s 
           computer mouse. The screen “awakens.” Brody CLICKS on the 
           browser history-- A TRAVEL WEBSITE pops up. A purchase 
           record. CLOSE ON WORDS: “Korean Airlines” and “Flt#2090.”  

           Realization dawns on Brody as he grabs the phone.  

           EXT. ETHAN’S CAR - DAY

           Ethan at the trunk. He unzips a small suitcase. Pulls his 
           holstered GUN and places it inside the suitcase.

           As he SLAMS the trunk closed and heads off with his luggage, 
           we see that his car is parked under a sign READING: “SECT C8, 
           LAX LONG TERM PARKING.”

           INT. KAL JET - LATER

           A line of COACH CLASS PASSENGERS moving through business 
           class. Ethan among them, baseball cap pulled down low. He 
           glances over at:

           PARK, sitting between two FEDERAL MARSHALS. Ethan moves past 
           them, unnoticed. 
           EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - NIGHT

           A massive JET ENGINE SCREAMS to life. The Jet taxi’s 
           revealing a KOREAN AIR LINES logo on the body... As the JET 
           RAMPS UP...

           EXT. SEOUL - NIGHT

           WIDE AERIAL of the city. 

           A wide expanse of buildings, both futuristically modern and 
           culturally traditional bisected into north and south by the 
           HAN RIVER. At night it cuts through the city lights like an 
           ominous black snake.

           EIGHT MASSIVE MOUNTAIN RANGES act as natural fortress walls 
           around a city all-too familiar with foreign invaders.

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        <We are a people of war...>

           INT. SPA / HALLWAY- NIGHT

           Moon, dressed in a neat suit, walks down a long hallway. 
           Rich, textured wood lines the wall and ceiling. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        <The Khitans. The Manchu. The 
                        Japanese. Throughout history we 
                        have been invaded. Oppressed. Told 
                        we are nothing.>

           INT. SPA / LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           TWO ATTENDANTS, in tan suits and white gloves, bow deeply to 
           Moon as he enters. One slides Moon’s jacket off. The other 
           places it on a hanger. Moon begins to undress. 

           INT. SPA - LATER

           A large room filled with steam. How large is hard to tell 
           because of the steam, sometimes obscuring, other times 
           revealing. There is an ostentatious amount of marble and 
           brass, like someone’s grotesque version of Versailles. 

           PRESIDENT YUNE (early 40’s), sits on a small stool, wrapped 
           in a plush towel. Yune has a focused look of ruthless 
           ambition. Right now, his focus is on MOON, sitting across 
           from him, rigidly and proper, also in a robe. 

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <This sense of helplessness. 
                        Injustice. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT'D)
                        And our own impotence to act is so 
                        ingrained in us it has a name: 
                        Han.>

           Behind Yune and Moon, bizarre displays of physical behavior 
           are taking place. NAKED WOMEN come and go. Not all Koreans. A 
           few Russians. Several other KOREAN GANGSTERS are visible. A 
           FAT ONE is being massaged. THREE OTHER MEN stand over a GIRL. 
           LOUD SLAPS of FLESH ON FLESH and MANIACAL LAUGHTER. 

           Moon looks uninterested, possibly even offended at being 
           here, but keeps his mouth shut.

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT’D)
                        <This was the problem with the old 
                        Presidents. Always playing the 
                        victim. Always observing the 
                        rules.>

           Moon’s eyes shift to the FAT GANGSTER, so drunk he can barely 
           walk, as he stumbles past, hugging the walls.

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT’D)
                        <Shin was the worst. Is that what 
                        happens when you grow old? Your 
                        mind goes soft along with your 
                        dick? Let’s make a pact, Moon. You 
                        kill me if I get that way. And I 
                        will do the same for you.>

           There’s an odd menace to the joke. President Yune pours So-
           Jul into a small cup. As is custom, Moon takes the cup by 
           both hands as he does so. They toast and drink. 

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT’D)
                        <You have done us a great service, 
                        Moon. We were happy that you were 
                        willing to help us in our efforts. 
                        Now we can change things. Now we 
                        will have a new future where we 
                        control things.>

                                 MOON
                        <As it should be, President Yune.> 

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <Aside from Shin’s interests, we 
                        are allowing you to oversee our new 
                        enterprises. What we’ll bring will 
                        change everything.>

           A flash of HESITATION flickers across Moon’s face. 
                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT’D)
                             (sharply)
                        <Is that not a sufficient honor?>

                                 MOON
                             (deferential)
                        <Of course, President Yune. More 
                        than I deserve.>

           Yune motions over his shoulder. The other Presidents are some 
           of the men involved with the freak show behind him. Moon 
           hides his disgust. 

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <The others had to be convinced, 
                        but I know you are the right 
                        person.>

                                 MOON
                        <Thank you, President Yune.>

           A MAN approaches through the steam. Fully dressed in a boldly 
           MISMATCHED SUIT, slicked back hair. KI-YUN.

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <Ki-Yun will see you out.>

           Moon stands. Offers Yune a deep bow, despite himself. 

           EXT. SPA - NIGHT

           Ki-Yun walks with Moon. There is a strange casualness about 
           Ki-Yun that seems disconnected, like any true sociopath. 

                                 KI-YUN
                        <You don’t like that place.>
                             (off Moon’s silence)
                        <I don’t like it either. It’s as 
                        filthy as it is clean. Everyone was 
                        impressed with your work.>

                                 MOON
                        <Let’s not engage in cheap ass-
                        kissing. I know I was asked to kill 
                        Shin so the Presidents would not be 
                        blamed if I failed.>

                                 KI-YUN
                        <Yes. It’s true. But regardless of 
                        the reason, now Jopok rules dictate 
                        that you are entitled to Shin’s old 
                        businesses and the job of managing 
                        new interests.>
                                 MOON
                             (under his breath)
                        <What an honor...>

           They approach a car. FOUR MEN get out. 

                                 KI-YUN
                        <These men are here to help you get 
                        started. You know Lee, of course.>

           The driver, LEE (30’s), bows deeply to Moon. Moon almost 
           seems glad to see him.

                                 LEE
                        <Hyung. It is good to see you.>

           Moon turns to Ki-Yun.

                                 KI-YUN
                        <Do well. Do well and they will 
                        make you a President. Do well and 
                        they will not send me after you.>

           Ki-Yun bows, not deeply, and leaves. Moon watches him go.

                                 MOON
                        <Lee. There is something else I 
                        want you to do for me.>

           INT. SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY / BULLPEN - NIGHT

           A large bullpen. TWENTY IDENTICAL DESKS, from the chairs down 
           to the lamps to the staplers, are lined up in neat rows. This 
           precision is oddly off-set by strange items-- An overgrown 
           house plant. An ugly couch.  

           Positioned in the front of the room is a BULLETIN BOARD. 
           SEVERAL PHOTOS of FUGITIVES are taped to it, including a 
           MUGSHOT OF MOON. 

           Sitting at a desk is SENIOR INSPECTOR CHANG (40’s). He has 
           the demure manner of a man who values caution and thought 
           over risk. The boeoks on his desk include English titles. 
           Mysteries like Chandler to travel books about New York and 
           Texas. An ASTHMA INHALER sits on his desk. 

           Next to Chang is INSPECTOR HO (40’s). A cigarette dangles 
           from his mouth as he flips through a binder clipped packet of 
           info with MOON’S MUGSHOT on the cover. 

                                 HO
                        <What a waste of time. Moon is 
                        hardly worth the effort.>
                                 CHANG
                        <He killed a police officer.>

                                 HO
                        <Not one of us.>

                                 CHANG
                        <That shouldn’t matter.>

                                 HO
                        <But it does. Look at this.>

           Ho tosses the info packet on the desk.

                                 HO (CONT’D)
                        <This information is years old. 
                        They’re not serious about catching 
                        Moon. This is all for show. They’re 
                        just trying to keep the American 
                        Police happy.>

                                 CHANG
                        <Maybe this is our chance to really 
                        take care of Jopok.>

                                 HO
                        <Wouldn’t that be something? I can 
                        see the headlines: “Hero Cops Undo 
                        Organized Crime Despite Unconcern 
                        of Public and Government.”> 

           Ho LAUGHS at his own joke. Chang even smirks despite himself.

           There is a sudden sweep of commotion. Everyone stands at 
           attention, almost like the military, as SUPERINTENDENT KIM 
           (late 40’s), FULL POLICE UNIFORM, enters the bullpen. Eyes 
           follow as he approaches Chang’s desk. 

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <Inspector Chang. Come with me.>

                                 CHANG
                        <Yes, sir.>

           Chang quickly slips his feet out of well worn leather sandals 
           and into his shoes. Ho watches as Chang shuffles off. 

                                 HO
                             (to the next desk)
                        <Look at that. Chang got an 
                        assignment.>
           INT. SUPERINTENDENT KIM’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Office almost more a living room in decor. Carpeting and 
           couches and a large black lacquered coffee table. 

           CHANG sits rigidly with Kim and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICIALS, all 
           in uniform. All the other men are smoking heavily. Chang 
           STIFLES a COUGH.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <We have been contacted by the Los 
                        Angeles Police. One of their 
                        officers is arriving into Seoul 
                        today.>

           Kim hands Chang a FAX. ETHAN’S POLICE PHOTO is visible.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM (CONT’D)
                        <I want you to intercept him at the 
                        airport and send him back.>

                                 CHANG
                        <Send him back? Why?>

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <The call was from their Internal 
                        Affairs Division. He has a history 
                        of improper conduct. Violence. 
                        Brutality.>

                                 CHANG
                        <I am sorry, sir. I still do not-->

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <His partner was killed by Moon. 
                        They believe he may be here looking 
                        for some kind of retribution. You 
                        speak the best English. Deal with 
                        this efficiently.>

           Chang STIFLES ANOTHER COUGH from the smoke.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM (CONT’D)
                        <If you are up to it.>

           Chang stands and respectfully bows. 

           EXT. SMPA / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Chang exits the Superintendent’s office. He COUGHS and HACKS 
           VIOLENTLY before he takes a hit off his inhaler. 
           INT. INCHEON AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Gleaming glass and steel. Passengers disembark from gates. 
           Along the broad corridor, we see PARK escorted by the two 
           FEDERAL MARSHALS. 

           ETHAN follows from a distance. 

           INT. INCHEON AIRPORT / CUSTOMS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan watches as Park and the Federal Marshals are cleared 
           through Customs. 

           Ethan approaches the small kiosk and hands over his passport. 
           The CUSTOMS AGENT taps on the computer. Then dials a number 
           on the phone. Rapid fire KOREAN. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Is there a problem? 

           Customs Agent ignore him. More rapid fire KOREAN. Goes on for 
           a bit before the Agent hangs up.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Is there a problem?

                                 CHANG (O.S.)
                        Detective Burrows.

           Ethan turns to see CHANG with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS.

                                 CHANG (CONT’D)
                             (with credentials)
                        Please. You come with us. 

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Ethan sits by Chang’s desk alone. He catches overt looks from 
           the KOREAN COPS. Ethan notes the INHALER on Chang’s desk and 
           the sandals stowed underneath. Chang returns with forms. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Where are you with finding Moon?

                                 CHANG
                        He is a priority for the unit. 

           Ethan looks around at the relative quiet of the bullpen. 
           Chang ZIPS a form into a typewriter and starts pecking keys.

                                 ETHAN
                        Listen, this Park guy--

           Chang motions to a file with PARK’S MUGSHOT stapled on it.
                                 CHANG
                        He is simply an enforcer. Not of 
                        interest. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, but he knows the world. Moon 
                        killed Park’s boss. He wants to 
                        find him too. Use him. 

                                 CHANG
                        Park was released a short time ago. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (disbelief)
                        What?

                                 CHANG
                        We had no reason to hold him.

                                 ETHAN
                        He was involved in a multiple 
                        homicide.

                                 CHANG
                        In Los Angeles. We do not have the 
                        same... Flexibility here. We cannot 
                        hold him without a formal charge. 

           A UNIFORMED OFFICER approaches Chang carrying ETHAN’S GUN.

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER
                        <Inspector, we found this in his 
                        suitcase.>

                                 ETHAN
                        I have documentation for that.

           Chang takes the gun and rests it on his desk.

                                 CHANG
                        Seoul National Police does not 
                        recognize that authorization and 
                        possessing illegal firearms are a 
                        capital offense in South Korea. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m a police officer!

                                 CHANG
                        Not here. We will return your gun 
                        to you when you board your plane 
                        back to Los Angeles.
                                 ETHAN
                        What the fuck kind of cops are you?

                                 CHANG
                        We are professional. We do not bend 
                        or break rules. I have your travel 
                        order ready. We are putting you on 
                        a plane back to Los Angeles. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Inspector--

                                 CHANG
                        We spoke with your Internal Affairs 
                        Department. An Officer of your... 
                        Reputation... Your presence here 
                        would be disruptive. 
                             (re: the form)
                        I will have this signed and we will 
                        leave for the airport. 

           Chang motions to the UNIFORMED OFFICER to watch Ethan as he 
           heads off. 

           Ethan flips through Park’s file. Forms in Korean. A few 
           photos. One catches his attention. Ethan deftly pockets it. 
           Turns to the UNIFORMED OFFICER. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey? You have a bathroom? 

           The UNIFORM clearly doesn’t speak English.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Men’s room. You know, take a leak?

           The Uniform looks almost military in his discipline. Ethan 
           pulls his LAPD Badge. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Don’t be a prick. I’m one 
                        of you.

           Sight of the badge seems to soften the Uniform. 

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Chang returns to his desk. Finds the Uniform and Ethan gone. 

           INT. SMPA / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Chang emerges into the hall. Spots the UNIFORMED OFFICER 
           standing outside the MEN’S ROOM DOOR. 
                                 CHANG
                        <What are you doing?>

           Chang rushes past into--

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Sink is RUNNING. But otherwise empty. Chang moves to the open 
           window-- A risky drop to an adjacent roof. Chang considers 
           chasing, but thinks better of it.

           EXT. SEOUL STREET - NIGHT

           Ethan moves briskly down the street, bumped and jostled by 
           the WAVES OF PEOPLE, all moving briskly, purposefully, and 
           staring straight ahead.  Ethan is the only CAUCASIAN face in 
           the tide of PEOPLE. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Ethan at the ticket booth trying to communicate with the TOLL 
           WORKER. He holds something up to the glass.  

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m trying to get here. Do you know 
                        this place?

           The TOLL WORKER never looks up from his manga. Just points to 
           a SIGN written entirely in KOREAN. 

           INT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           Ethan at the counter talking to the OLD LADY behind the 
           COUNTER. She YAMMERS ON AND ON in RAPID FIRE KOREAN, 
           punctuating her talking with BELLY LAUGHS. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t understand a thing you’re 
                        saying.
                             (as she continues on)
                        Okay. Thank you! Take care! Thanks!

           The OLD LADY keeps talking even as Ethan backs out the door.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           Ethan stands at a busy corner. Flags down a TAXI.

                                 ETHAN
                        You speak English? 

           The CABDRIVER YELLS something hostile and pulls away.

                                                              TIME CUT:
           THE NEXT TAXI

           Slows up next to Ethan. Cabbie takes a look and pulls away. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Racial profiling motherfucker...

                                                              TIME CUT:

           THE NEXT TAXI

           Ethan steps off the curb and stands in front of it. It 
           SCREECHES to a HALT inches from hitting him. Ethan climbs 
           inside. Holds out a wad of US money.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I need to go here. I don’t care how 
                        long it takes. You understand?

           Ethan shows the driver the photo he took from Chang’s desk: A 
           SURVEILLANCE SHOT of PARK holding a car door open for 
           PRESIDENT SHIN. Behind them is a door marked with a GLOWING 
           CIRCLE LOGO. 

           INT. TAXI - LATER

           Taxi moves through a labyrinth of small side streets. 
           Buildings are a mishmash of MODERN SKYSCRAPERS and SMALLER 
           OLDER APARTMENTS giving it a chaotic feel. The taxi stops in 
           front of the doorway marked with the GLOWING CIRCLE LOGO.  

           Ethan hands a thick wad of bills to the Cabbie.

                                 CABBIE
                             (heavy accent)
                        Thank you.

           Ethan looks relieved to hear the language.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re welcome. 

           EXT. DOORWAY - DAY

           Ethan settles into a dark doorway of an apartment building 
           across the street. He YAWNS, the events of the past day 
           catching up to him. His eyelids grow heavy. 

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - DAY

           All the Detectives stand lined up at attention by their 
           desks. More military in feel and attitude than American 
           Police. Chang is front and center, head hung low in deference 
           and shame. 
           Superintendent Kim paces in front with barely contained 
           anger. For Chang, the silence is worse than violence.

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <You will find the American you 
                        lost while the rest of us do the 
                        hard work and deal with Moon. I 
                        don’t want to see your face until 
                        you have him. Do you understand?>

                                 CHANG
                        <Yes, sir.>

           The Lieutenant motions to TWO OTHER DETECTIVES. They move 
           Chang’s desk out from the row of desks to an out of the way 
           corner. It’s public humiliation for Chang. 

           EXT. DOORWAY - NIGHT

           A THUMPING NOISE. Ethan opens his eyes. VINCENT stands over 
           him. Part of his head is missing from Moon’s gunshot.

           Ethan JERKS back, snapping fully awake. Sees that it’s not 
           VINCENT at all, but an OLD WOMAN shooing him off her doorway. 
           Ethan stands.

           Across the street, a small line has formed outside CIRCLE. 
           The door now manned by a suited BOUNCER. Ethan perks up when 
           he sees PARK approach the Bouncer. He’s immediately let in.

           INT. CIRCLE - MOMENTS LATER

           High decibel music. Decor is futuristic-luxury. A well 
           dressed crowd packed into the small space. Park weaves his 
           way through to a velvet roped door. 

           EXT. CIRCLE / BACK DOOR- SAME

           Ethan walks around the rear of the building. A KITCHEN WORKER 
           dumps trash into a bin. Ethan sneaks in. 

           INT. CIRCLE / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan moves quickly through the busy kitchen...

           INT. CIRCLE / BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A large, windowless room decorated with a U-shaped couch and 
           a huge plasma mounted on the wall. FOUR KOREAN GANGSTERS 
           (20’s) dressed in t-shirts and suits sit with beers and food. 
           From their manner, they seem more like management not guests.

           They watch a Korean “American Idol”-esque show. A catchy pop-
           song is being sung. 
                                 GANGSTER#1
                        <This song is a mistake.> 

                                 GANGSTER#2
                        <It’s catchy.>

                                 GANGSTER#3
                        <I agree.>

                                 GANGSTER#1
                        <He should sing a ballad. Prove he 
                        has depth. Soul.>

           The other two nod in agreement. The fourth Gangster is OH. 
           The oldest. He eats with LONG METAL CHOPSTICKS. 

           He puts them down as the door swings open and Park enters. 
           The gangsters seem surprised. They also seem afraid of him.

                                 OH
                        Hyung..?

           Oh quickly stands and BARKS at the others. 

                                 OH (CONT’D)
                        <Turn this off, Get some more food 
                        and beer. Hyung, sit.>

           The others clear a space and pour a glass of beer for Park.

                                 OH (CONT’D)
                        <We heard what happened. President 
                        Shin... We couldn’t believe it.>

           Park nods. The loss is felt by Oh but in a different way.

                                 PARK
                        <We need to find Moon.>

           Oh’s reaction is hard to read. He’s fidgety. Agitated.

                                 OH
                        <There’s a lot of police attention 
                        right now. Is fighting with Moon 
                        going to help us?>

                                 PARK
                        <We have an obligation.>

                                 OH
                        <Your obligation was to keep the 
                        old man alive.>
           There’s a noticeable shift in atmosphere. Tense. Park’s eyes 
           shift over to the other three. They seem coiled. 

                                 PARK
                        <Has Moon been here already?>

           Oh looks away from Park. 

                                 OH
                        <You shouldn’t have come back.>

           GANGSTER#1 NEXT TO PARK whips out a piece of LEAD PIPE (taped 
           at the end) and swings it straight at PARK, but he catches 
           the hand and drives his elbow down on it, breaking it with a 
           SICKENING CRACK!

           PARK FLIPS the table to put something between he and the 
           others, sending plates and glasses SHATTERING--

           INT. CIRCLE HALLWAY - SAME

           Ethan moves down a long hall with several closed doors. One 
           door opens and TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN GIRLS EMERGE moving into 
           another room. Ethan catches a look as the door closes: 

           Someone’s perverted Shangri-La: More Girls. Older Men sitting 
           around a couch smoking. Drinking. Watching. 

           The sound of BREAKING GLASS gets Ethan’s attention. 

           INT. CIRCLE / PRIVATE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           PARK is rushed simultaneously by the THREE REMAINING GANSTERS-
           - Park catches GANGSTER#2 with a punch, then GRABS him by the 
           hair and DRIVES his KNEE UP, SHATTERING Gangster#2’s NOSE 
           into a bloody pulp. Park turns and--

           GANGSTER#3 DRIVES his foot into Park’s chest with a kick. 
           Park FLIES backwards, crashing into a credenza, knocking 
           bottles of liquor CRASHING to the ground. 

           PARK falls, momentarily stunned. He looks up and finds 
           himself facing OH, holding a SUSHI KNIFE and GANGSTER#3 who 
           holds the piece of pipe. 

           OH and GANGSTER#3 slowly back Park towards the door. Just as 
           they’re about to rush him, the door flies open--

           ETHAN enters next to Park. Takes half a second to read the 
           room and RUSHES Gangster#3, ducking under the piece of pipe--

           PARK AND OH
           Park takes a straight up boxing stance with Oh. Almost looks 
           old fashioned. Oh smirks, then rushes Park with his knife, 
           SLASHING at him. PARK sidesteps the knife, then SHOOTS A JAB-
           JAB-HOOK combo that drops Oh to the floor with a bloody nose.

           ETHAN AND GANGSTER#3

           Ethan DRIVES the Gangster back hard! SLAMMING him back into 
           the couch. They fall HARD. Ethan manages to get his arm under 
           GANGSTER#3’s neck. Gets him in a choke hold--

           PARK AND OH 

           Oh LUNGES wildly at Park. Park backs up, then catches Oh’s 
           arm and SLAMS A FIST right into Oh’s KIDNEY. Oh falls again, 
           coughing blood. Park then picks up a piece of lead pipe and 
           SLAMS him across the head with a loud CRACK. 

           ETHAN AND GANGSTER#3 

           GANGSTER#3 GASPS for breath as Ethan clamps down harder on 
           his choke hold. GANGSTER#3 THRASHES like a beached whale. 
           Swings wildly and THUD! Hits Ethan in the side of the head. 
           Ethan GRIMACES but tries to ride out the PIPE SHOTS. They get 
           weaker and weaker until GANGSTER#3 finally goes limp. 

           Ethan stands up and sees Park facing him with the pipe.

                                 PARK
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh. Now you speak English. 

                                 PARK
                        You came from Los Angeles. Why? To 
                        find Moon? 

                                 ETHAN
                        To find you first. Figured you 
                        wanted him as bad as I did.
                             (re: the room)
                        Who are these guys? 

                                 PARK
                        They worked for Shin. Like me.

                                 ETHAN
                        These were your friends? Great.

           Ethan grabs the semi-conscious Oh and searches his pockets. 
           He finds a set of keys. He then grabs Oh by the arm and 
           starts to drag him out of the room. Park follows, intrigued. 
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           Ethan half-drags Oh outside. A line of cars are parked in the 
           dark alley. Ethan moves down the line, pressing the ALARM 
           REMOTE on Oh’s keys until his car reveals itself with 
           FLASHING BRAKE LIGHTS and TWO CHIRPS. 

           Ethan cuffs Oh to the back bumper of the car. Oh PROTESTS in 
           KOREAN, until Ethan uses his head to SMASH OPEN the plastic 
           brake light casing.

                                 ETHAN
                        If all of you worked for Shin, why 
                        were they trying to kill you? 

                                 PARK
                        They blame me for his death.  

                                 ETHAN
                        You guys are pretty fucking 
                        sentimental, aren’t you? 

                                 PARK
                        By Jopok rules, Moon is now 
                        entitled to take over Shin’s 
                        interests. They did not want to 
                        work for Moon.

                                 ETHAN
                        Moon’s one guy. 

           Ethan pulls the brake light wiring out. Breaks the bulb and 
           shoves it into Oh’s mouth. He HOLDS up the CAR ALARM REMOTE. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Ask him why they didn’t fight Moon.

           Park translates into Korean. Oh’s look of utter contempt 
           needs no translation. 

           Ethan then hits the CAR REMOTE. TWO-CHIRPS, then the LIGHTS 
           FLASH. It also sends a CURRENT JOLTING INTO OH’S MOUTH. OH 
           SPASMS and SCREAMS in PAIN.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Ask him again. 

           Park starts but Oh MUMBLES A CURSE at him. Ethan hits the 
           button again-- TWO CHIRPS-- BRAKE LIGHTS-- OH’S HEAD 
           VIOLENTLY SHAKES BACK as HIS JAW CLENCHES. He spits out 
           something bloody on the asphalt: A piece of his tongue. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        He’ll tell you now.
           Park has an exchange in KOREAN with Oh. Oh’s speech is 
           slurred. He translates back--

                                 PARK
                        He says that Moon was not alone... 

           Something that Oh says angers Park. Park SLAMS him with a 
           fist, cracking his nose. He YELLS something in KOREAN. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What? 

                                 PARK
                        He says that Moon has protection 
                        from the other Presidents.

           Park YELLS at Oh in rapid fire Korean. Oh just shakes his 
           head. Park grabs the remote from Ethan. Oh stammers a reply. 

                                 PARK (CONT’D)
                        He says--- He says that Moon was 
                        asked by the other Presidents to 
                        kill Shin in Los Angeles. 

           Park seems disturbed. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Does he know where Moon is? 

           Park asks Oh, who mumbles something angrily. 

                                 PARK
                             (shaking his head)
                        I don’t think he is lying.

           Ethan nods. Pulls the wire from Oh’s mouth. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Let’s go.

           Oh starts talking again. In a taunting tone.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s he saying? 

                                 PARK
                        He says that Moon also told them 
                        how he killed your partner. How you 
                        were unable to stop it. 

           Oh stares at Ethan with a bloody smile and shakes his head. 
           Ethan moves over to the side of the car with the wire. He 
           returns a moment later.
                                 ETHAN
                        Let’s go.

           Ethan walks away, leaving Oh cuffed to the bumper. Park looks 
           at Oh, then catches up with Ethan.

                                 PARK
                             (a disappointed tone)
                        They’ll be more afraid of Moon than 
                        you. You won’t get far acting like 
                        a cop here.

           OH tugs on the handcuffs. He then notices the brake wire 
           snaked around the side of the car-- He inches over and sees 
           it SHOVED INTO THE GAS TANK. 

           ETHAN turns to Park. Then hits the ALARM REMOTE. Behind them, 
           BOOM! Oh’s car, along with Oh, EXPLODES in a PLUME OF BLACK 
           SMOKE AND FLAME!

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not a cop here.

           Park is JOLTED by the explosion. He looks back to Ethan, like 
           he’s crazy and with a little newfound respect.

           Ethan tosses Park the alarm remote.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get in my way. 

           Park watches as Ethan heads off alone. 

                                 PARK
                        Where are you going? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ll figure it out.

                                 PARK
                        Now you don’t need my help? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Help? I don’t speak the language, I 
                        don’t know the city and I’ve been 
                        here for less than 24 hours but 
                        we’re in exactly the same position. 
                        What the fuck do I need you for? 

                                 PARK
                        You won’t make it alone. I will 
                        help. But with one condition-- We 
                        don’t arrest Moon.
                                 ETHAN
                        Do I look like I’m here to arrest 
                        anybody? 

           Park nods at the dark look in Ethan’s eyes. Not just anger. 
           Something much deeper and disturbing.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           A large industrial warehouse located along the Han River. 
           Phosphorous lights cast everything in an eerie glow.

           Ethan and Park approach on foot.

                                 ETHAN
                        And why exactly does Moon get 
                        Shin’s interests? 

                                 PARK
                        If a President is challenged and 
                        loses, then the challenger takes 
                        over his businesses. It is to 
                        ensure against costly fights. 

                                 ETHAN
                        That why your boss was killed?

                                 PARK
                             (shaking his head)
                        You have to understand. That is 
                        usually a formal challenge. A way 
                        of settling a dispute. This.. The 
                        murder of a President-- It is 
                        usually not done. And to have the 
                        other Presidents order it... 

           Park shakes his head.

                                 ETHAN
                        And what’s this place?

                                 PARK
                        One of President Shin’s interests. 
                        They would receive black market 
                        pharmaceuticals here. From China. 
                        Latin America. The man who ran this 
                        business, Lau, was close to my 
                        boss. If Moon approached him, he 
                        would not consent. He will help us. 
           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Dark. Only a few shafts of light illuminate the way. Outlines 
           of crates and boxes stacked like a maze. Ethan and Park ease 
           through the dark. 

           A CAT’s EYES glow in the dark, before it scurries away.

                                 ETHAN
                        You smell that? 

           Park and Ethan round a corner into a larger, open area. The 
           only SOUNDS are LOUD DRIPPING and soft PURRING NOISES.

           Park moves to a circuit box. Throws the switch. LIGHTS. And 
           we see--

           THREE BODIES, dangling from chains and metal hooks from the 
           ceiling. Blood from each DRIPS into large pools. At least 
           THREE DOZEN STRAY CATS are licking from the pools before the 
           lights scare them off. 

           Ethan and Park take in the horrific scene for beat.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Which one was Lau? 

           Park points to a HANGING BODY, missing its head.

           INT. ELECTRONIC ARCADE - NIGHT

           Rows and rows of video gaming machines. Many of them 
           variations on card games. One of MOON’S MEN stands playing a 
           version of STRIP POKER where a model loses clothes. 

           Moon sits talking to the OWNER, a fat man with a goatee. 

                                 OWNER
                        <My arrangement with President Shin 
                        was long standing-- This kind of 
                        increase...>

                                 MOON
                        <Inflation. The Internet.>

                                 OWNER
                        <Yes. Yes. People are not as 
                        interested in this kind of thing. 
                        See, you understand business.>

                                 MOON
                        <No. I needed someone to explain it 
                        to me.>
           One of MOON’S MEN opens a brown bag. Out rolls Lau’s head. 

           INT. PARK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Spartan is an understatement. A simple couch. A lamp. A bench 
           press and barbell set. One plate in the sink. A well beaten 
           HEAVY BAG hangs in the living room where a TV should be.

           Ethan in the kitchen rummaging through cabinets. Each one is 
           filled with RAMEN NOODLES and bottles of water.

                                 ETHAN
                        You said Moon was exiled by the 
                        other Presidents.

                                 PARK
                        Three years ago. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why? 

                                 PARK
                        He was too ambitious. He fought 
                        with the old Presidents. Tried to 
                        take territories. He drew too much 
                        attention.

                                 ETHAN
                        What kind of attention?

                                 PARK
                        There has always been a balance in 
                        Seoul between Jopok and the police. 

                                 ETHAN
                        They’re bought off? 

                                 PARK
                        “Bought off?”

                                 ETHAN
                        You bribe them. 

                                 PARK
                        No. There are certain things that 
                        even the police know will always 
                        exist. Girls. Extortion. Gambling. 
                        Things like this. It is human 
                        nature. It cannot be stopped.

                                 ETHAN
                        So the police look the other way?
                                 PARK
                        In exchange, Jopok keep their 
                        interests quiet and limited. 
                        Certain activities the politicians 
                        and police would have to address. 
                        People-- Normal people-- They would 
                        demand it. It has always been this 
                        way. 

           Park moves to the freezer and opens the door. He pulls out 
           BAGS of FROZEN SQUID, FISH CAKES, KOREAN BUNS...

                                 PARK (CONT’D)
                        We will need some protection.

           Park then pulls out a few frost-bitten zip-lock bags of CASH.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Deep in the bowels of the place. Dim lighting. Ethan and Park 
           stand by a few parked cars. Ethan leans on a random car. Park 
           eyes him disapprovingly. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

           Park motions for Ethan to get off the car. 

                                 PARK
                        That is not your car. 

           Ethan gives Park a disbelieving look. Park holds his gaze. A 
           brief stare down. Ethan then straightens. Park relaxes, then 
           Ethan kicks a dent into the car. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Whoops. 

           Park simply shakes his head in disgust as a PAIR of 
           HEADLIGHTS approach from the garage ramp. A BLACK LEXUS 
           SQUEALS around the lot and pulls into the empty spot next to 
           Ethan and Park. 

           A KOREAN GUY WITH SPIKED HAIR and huge HEADPHONES gets out. 
           He gives Ethan a long up and down look. Not impressed. Then 
           to Park. Park hands him a wad of money. 

           SPIKED HAIR tosses Park his car keys without a word. 

           Park moves around to the trunk. Pops it and looks inside. He 
           SLAMS it shut and nods to Ethan.
           EXT. SEOUL STREET- NIGHT

           Park’s car pulls out of the underground garage into traffic. 
           From overhead, the streets knit together like a circuit 
           board, gleaming and new.

           EXT. HILL STREET - NIGHT

           Park’s car crests a hill overlooking a hellish neighborhood, 
           sitting like a stain amidst the modern buildings around it:

           JONGNO SAMGA DISTRICT. The Korean version of a barrio. A maze 
           of alley ways surrounded by small, dilapidated buildings. A 
           tangle of power and phone crisscross between roofs. Razor 
           wire stretches across rooftops and fences. Green phosphorous 
           lights cast the area in an ominous glow. Almost alien. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What is this place? 

                                 PARK
                        There are people down there who 
                        work for one of the Presidents. 
                        They will be able to tell us why 
                        Moon has been allowed back. But it 
                        is very dangerous in there. Not 
                        even police will go. We should be 
                        ready for anything.

           Park pops the trunk. Rummages around inside. He tosses Ethan 
           a long object. 

           Ethan catches it-- An ALUMINUM BASEBALL BAT. 

                                 ETHAN
                        This a joke? 

           Park pulls a steel pipe for himself and slams the trunk. 

                                 PARK
                        There are not many guns in Korea. 
                        Since our civil war, the government 
                        has made the penalties against it 
                        too high. Finding guns-- Reliable 
                        guns-- It is difficult. Expensive. 
                        Without time, impossible. 

           Ethan looks at the bat in disbelief. He follows Park down a 
           set of stairs descending into the dark neighborhood.

           EXT. JONGNO SAM-GA STREET - NIGHT

           Oddly silent. Blown out street lights. Overflowing garbage 
           cans. Ethan passes some kind of dead animal in the gutter.
           They stay in the shadows as Park motions up towards a squat, 
           soot-stained apartment building. A FAT GUARD sits vigil 
           outside.

           Ethan tenses with his bat, ready to rush at him, but Park 
           stops him--

           The CLICK-CLACK of small footsteps. From up the street, a 
           petite, pretty GIRL (20) WEARING A HELLO KITTY KNAPSACK walks 
           towards the apartment building. Seems to be no earthly reason 
           why she would be here. 

           Ethan and Park watch as the FAT GUARD allows in HELLO KITTY. 
           Ethan gives Park a “WTF?” look. Park shrugs in response.

                                 ETHAN
                             (low whisper)
                        This is how we’re going to do thi--

           Ethan turns. Park’s already gone. 

           EXT. SOOT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Park sneaks up behind FAT GUARD, who’s sitting in a chair. 
           Uses his pipe for a headlock. Fat Guard GASPS! Park seems 
           cooly confident until-- 

           FAT GUARD stands and HOISTS Park RIGHT OFF HIS FEET and 
           throws himself backward into the building-- 300lbs of Korean 
           blubber SLAMMING Park into concrete. Two, three, four times. 
           Park starts to slacken then-

           ETHAN appears, bat cocked. DING! A shot right off Fat Guard’s 
           skull. Fat Guard drops on top of Park.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why don’t you wait for me next 
                        time? 

           Park struggles to get out from underneath. 

                                 PARK
                        I don’t take orders from cops.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, that’s much more dignified.

           Ethan moves into the door.

           INT. SOOT BUILDING / HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Many closed doors. Flickering fluorescent overhead. The last 
           door has a sliding, speakeasy-type peephole in it.
           CLOSE ON PEEPHOLE. We HEAR A KNOCK. The peephole slides open. 
           THE DOOR GUARD’S FACE appears. BAM! The small end of ETHAN’S 
           BAT nails him right in the forehead. 

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The door is kicked open. Ethan and Park enter. It’s a plain 
           apartment. Furnished almost like a senior citizen’s home.

           Ethan and Park seem confused. They walk further inside, past 
           cheap furniture. Clothes hanging on a drying rack. Ethan 
           leads Park further down the hall into--

           INT. APARTMENT / BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bed. Night stand. Nothing out of the ordinary.

                                 ETHAN
                        Kill the lights.

                                 PARK
                        “Kill” them? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Turn them off. 

           Park flips the switch. Room goes dark. Then, from behind a 
           tall wardrobe chest, the FAINTEST HINT OF LIGHT.

           Ethan pushes against the wardrobe. Sees that it’s on some 
           kind of creaky pulley system that enables it to slide away, 
           revealing a CRUDE HOLE, about 4 feet high, BURROWED through 
           the concrete. The top of the ladder is visible.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Every house have one of these here?

           Park climbs down first.

           INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Dimly lit by bare bulb. Moldy, tiled walls. Various cables 
           run along the walls and ceiling. Ethan comes down off the 
           ladder next to Park.

           They follow the ECHO OF DISTANT VOICES. Park and Ethan stop 
           behind a stack of boxes. Up ahead--

           HELLO KITTY stands between two wardrobe racks placed against 
           either side of the tunnel. She strips off her clothes and 
           neatly hangs them on one. 
           She then turns to the other rack and pulls a clear plastic 
           RAIN COAT. She pulls it on, then dons a clear plastic shower 
           cap, a clear, full-face shield and flip-flops. 

           She’s then approached by TWO KOREAN-SPEAKING RUSSIAN THUGS. 

                                 RUSSIAN#1
                        <Everything.>

           Hello Kitty strips out of her thong. Russian#2 tosses it on 
           the wardrobe rack. They inspect her with the dispassion of a 
           vet checking for fleas.

                                 RUSSIAN#1 (CONT’D)
                             (holding a sushi knife)
                        <If we suspect you have stolen, we 
                        will cut you open to check, you 
                        understand?>
                             (off her nod)
                        <Go.>

           Hello Kitty walks past and out of sight. As she passes the 
           TWO THUGS exchange something in RUSSIAN. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (low)
                        Russian? 

                                 PARK
                        Yes. 

                                 ETHAN
                        They’re not armed either?

                                 PARK
                             (shaking his head)
                        This is not traditional Russian 
                        mafia. These are-- How do you say? 
                        Not with one boss?

                                 ETHAN
                        What do you mean? Like freelance?

                                 PARK
                        Yes. Freelance--  Usually hired by 
                        whichever President is willing to 
                        pay. 

           RUSSIAN THUG#2’s CELL RINGS. He answers and mutters something 
           as he walks towards Ethan and Park. He passes them and climbs 
           up the ladder, not seeing them pressed behind the boxes.

           RUSSIAN THUG#1
           Sits on a folding chair, smoking a cigarette and reading a 
           magazine. He notices a SHADOW cross over him. We see ETHAN 
           standing behind him, the bat COCKED over his shoulder. 
           RUSSIAN THUG#1 doesn’t give away that he knows until he 
           slowly reaches for the SUSHI KNIFE IN HIS LAP. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Don’t.

           His warning goes unheard. Russian Thug#1 barely touches the 
           knife before-- CRACK! Ethan’s unloads the bat on his head.

           Park motions Ethan towards another HOLE CUT INTO THE TUNNEL. 
           This one burrows through several meters of DIRT until it 
           punches through more concrete into--

           INT. ADJACENT BUILDING / STAIRWELL - SAME

           Ethan and Park step through to the stairwell of a different 
           building. From the dust and general condition, it appears to 
           be an abandoned building.

                                 ETHAN
                        Smart. From the street, place still 
                        looks abandoned.

           Ethan and Park follow the string of utility lights down a 
           flight into--

           INT. SUB-BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan and Park push open the door to a landing overlooking a 
           large basement room. A GENERATOR in the corner noisily feeds 
           a series of lights hanging over several rows of tables.

           HELLO KITTY, along with a dozen SIMILARLY DRESSED WOMEN, 
           stand at the tables CUTTING HEROIN with the efficiency of 
           Toyota’s assembly line. There’s even a diagram set-up in 
           front of the room with numbered instructions.

                                 ETHAN
                        I thought it was going to be a lot 
                        kinkier than this when she put on 
                        that outfit. 

           Park looks especially perplexed.

                                 PARK
                        This was never here before. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (heading back out)
                        They look like the help. We need 
                        management. 
           Park takes a last look at the operation before following.

           INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan and Park emerge from the hole and freeze. Waiting there 
           for them are--

           RUSSIAN THUG#2 and FOUR OTHER THUGS, both Korean and Russian. 
           They hold lengths of pipe and knives. 

           Park turns to scope a retreat down the other side of the 
           tunnel, only to see FIVE MORE THUGS cutting off that escape. 

           Ethan’s hands tense around his bat as he stares at the THUGS 
           IN FRONT (TIF). Park turns to face the THUGS IN REAR (TIR). 
           What becomes clear is that the Thugs will only be able to 
           fight one at a time because of the size of the tunnel:

           ETHAN

           Doesn’t wait for someone to say, “Go.” He lunges at Russian 
           Thug#2 who ducks Ethan’s first swing. Ethan dodges the 
           Russian’s knife by a millimeter... He catches the Russian off-
           balance and grabs the RUSSIAN, SLAMMING him into the WALL. 

           PARK 

           Waits for TIR#1 to attack with his knife. Park grabs him by 
           the arm and BRINGS HIS PIPE down, and CRUNCH! Compound 
           fracture! TIR#1 goes does SCREAMING. 

           ETHAN 

           Faces TIF#2, who holds a large SUSHI KNIFE and looks like he 
           has experience with it. Ethan uses the bat to block TWO 
           LIGHTNING FAST SWIPES, the blade CLANKING off the metal. 
           TIF#3 decides to help and rush in. Ethan steps in, grabs hold 
           of TIF#3 and THROWS him into TIF#2. In the close quarters, 
           TIF#2 accidentally STABS TIF#3. 

           With the two tangled together, Ethan SWINGS his bat around 
           and NAILS TIF#2 right in the head.

           PARK 

           Drops TIR#2 but loses his balance and falls when TIR#3 SWINGS 
           a BASEBALL BAT WILDLY! Park rolls as the bat CLANKS down on 
           cement where his head was. Park finds a fallen SUSHI knife on 
           the floor and THRUSTS UP, BURYING IT into TIR#3’s GROIN. 

           ETHAN
           Has pushed his way closer to the ladder as the last two TIF’s 
           give him a little more respect. Ethan breathes hard, holding 
           his bat like a bloody-stained sword in front of him.

           TIF#4 CURSES him in KOREAN then rushes him with a long 
           handled hammer. Ethan drops to a knee as TIF#4 charges and 
           SWINGS-- CRACK! SNAPS TIF#4 LEG at the KNEE, bending it at a 
           90 degree angle SIDEWAYS! 

           TIF#5 looks down at his co-Thugs, lying in their own blood, 
           either WHIMPERING or HOLLERING in pain. He turns and runs.

                                 ETHAN
                             (turning)
                        Park--

           Ethan turns to see Park running towards him. Behind him are 
           more THUGS appearing from the far end of the tunnel. 

           Ethan climbs up the ladder as fast as he can. At the top, he 
           reaches down and PULLS PARK UP. 

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan and Park sprint through the apartment. At the front 
           door, another THUG appears. Without breaking stride, Ethan 
           PUNCHES him with the fat end of the bat, SHATTERING TEETH!

           EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The DOOR FLIES OPEN, breaking the quiet night. They’re 
           breathing hard, not looking back as they SPRINT as fast as 
           they can up the street.

           Behind them we see FIVE OR SIX THUGS emerge from the door, 
           chasing. But soon--

           More THUGS start emerging from buildings as Ethan and Park 
           pass. They jump down off balconies, come out of shitty 
           apartment buildings--

           ETHAN and PARK

           Round the corner by a broken down building. A second later, 
           we see that the four or five chasing has now grown to a mob 
           of nineteen or twenty armed with knives, bats, pipes, etc... 

           EXT. HILL STREET - NIGHT

           Ethan crests the stairs first, sucking wind and sweating. 
           Park appears a second later, looking just as bad. 

                                 ETHAN
                        KEYS!
           Park throws Ethan the car keys. Ethan UNLOCKS the doors and 
           gets in, just as the THUGS appear at the top of the stairs, 
           right on PARK’S ASS! 

           One of them reaches out, about to GRAB Park, when--

           WHAM! Ethan SLAMS the car right into the THUG-- Sends him 
           FLYING into a TELEPHONE POLE. His back snaps, wrapping around 
           the pole the WRONG WAY, like a rag doll.  

           Ethan slows to let Park in--

           INT. PARK’S CAR - SAME

           Ethan sees the MOB OF THUGS descending like from a zombie 
           movie on the car. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Come on! Come on! 

           Just as the MOB catches up and starts pummeling the car. The 
           Driver’s side window SHATTERS and one of the THUGS claws at 
           Ethan’s face, grabbing his shirt. 

           Ethan GUNS THE ENGINE.

           EXT. HILL STREET - SAME

           The THUG’s feet drag along side Park’s speeding car, still 
           holding onto Ethan, until--

           Approaching headlights from the opposite lane. At the last 
           second, Ethan NUDGES the car over the yellow line.

           INT. PARK’S CAR - SAME

           PARK realizes what Ethan is doing. Starts screaming at the 
           THUG.

                                 PARK
                        <Let go!>

           The Thug looks up just in time for-- BOOM! The THUG is hit 
           HEAD ON by an on-coming car! His body actually SKIDS across 
           the asphalt for fifty yards, then rolls to a bloody heap for 
           another ten. 

           Park turns to Ethan, mouth slack in disbelief at the level of 
           brutality. Ethan’s eyes flicker over to Park, then back to 
           the road. 
           EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

           Park’s car, pulled over on a dark street. Park tries to wipe 
           some of the blood off his hood with old newspapers. Ethan 
           checks a huge, growing bruise on his back in a side mirror.

           Ethan and Park sit in the car. They both bristle as a POLICE 
           CAR goes SCREAMING PAST to some other emergency. 

                                 PARK
                        That was unusual. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Really? Which part?

                                 PARK
                        They were dealing with drugs.

                                 ETHAN
                        Forget it. It doesn’t get us any 
                        closer to Moon. 

                                 PARK
                        You don’t understand. Drugs are a 
                        business that Jopok will not 
                        conduct. It is part of the balance 
                        with police.

                                 ETHAN
                        Maybe the Russians were running it.

                                 PARK
                        The Russians are used just for 
                        small things. Girls mostly. They 
                        would not be allowed to deal drugs. 
                        Yakuza, Triads, the Arabs... All 
                        have tried to bring drugs here. The 
                        Presidents drove them all out.
                             (thinking for a beat)
                        There is someone we should talk to. 

           INT. SMPA / CHANG’S DESK - NIGHT

           Chang sits in the Siberia of his desk, working separately 
           from the other Detectives. He’s on the phone.

                                 CHANG
                        <If you hear of anything, please 
                        call me. Thank you.>

           Chang hangs up. Frustration etched on his face. He taps a 
           finger on the phone, trying to think of someone to call next.
           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Chang approaches Inspector Ho’s desk. Ho looks up from a bowl 
           of noodles.

                                 CHANG
                        <Where are you in finding Moon?>

                                 HO
                             (with a shrug)
                        <Nowhere.>

           Chang looks around the bullpen. A smattering of INSPECTORS, 
           none of whom seem to be working with any immediacy.

                                 CHANG
                        <Let me see what you have.>

           Ho slides over a PACKET of INFO on Moon. 

                                 HO
                        <Chang... Kim told you to stay off 
                        the Moon investigation. Are you a 
                        masochist?>

                                 CHANG
                        <It’s the same investigation.>

           Chang takes the packet and heads back to his isolated desk.

           EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

           Ethan looks up at a massive JUMBO-TRON affixed high on a 
           building. A SLEEK AD for SAMSUNG runs on a loop... 

           Park leads him into a small alley jammed with CARS. Porches. 
           BMW’s. Black Town Cars. Valet’s rush back and forth. Ethan 
           and Park weave through. Ethan takes notice of the cars. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Those are diplomatic plates.

                                 PARK
                        It is popular with people of high 
                        standing. Even politicians.

           Ethan’s curious as Park leads him into an unmarked building.

           INT. ROOM SALON ROOM - NIGHT

           Bare except for a large u-shaped couch surrounding a large 
           table. Ethan and Park sit across from each other in silence. 
                                 ETHAN
                        I was expecting more.

                                 PARK
                        No one comes for the furniture. 

           The door opens. Four drop-dead gorgeous, ROOM SALON GIRLS 
           enter. All are dressed in designer clothes. Nothing cheap or 
           tawdry about them. One carries a tray of GLASSES, WHISKY and 
           ICE. Two GIRLS bookend Ethan. The other two, Park.

                                 ETHAN
                        We really have time for this? 

           Park stops the GIRL as she pours WHISKEY and whispers 
           something in her ear. The GIRL abruptly stands and motions 
           for the other GIRLS to follow. As they leave--

                                 PARK
                             (hushed but urgent)
                        Do not say or do anything. 

           A moment later, the MAMMA-SAN (late 40’s) enters. Her beauty 
           may be fading, but she carries herself in a regal way.

           Park quickly stands and motions for Ethan to do the same.

                                 PARK (CONT’D)
                             (bowing deeply)
                        <Mamma-San. Thank you for seeing me 
                        without proper notice.>

           The Mamma-San steps over to Park and SLAPS him across the 
           face. Park takes it like a scolded school-boy. 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        <I heard you fucked up in Los 
                        Angeles. Let your boss get killed. 
                        Are you turning fag on me, Park?>

           Park shakes his head meekly. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What did she say?

           Mamma-San turns to Ethan and ERUPTS--

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        If I wanted you to know, I would 
                        have said it in fucking English. 

           Ethan leans back, not expecting such a ferocious answer.
                                 PARK
                        This is--

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        I don’t give a fuck. Sit down, shit-
                        head. 

           Mamma-San takes a seat at the head of the table. 

                                 PARK
                        I needed to ask you--

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        I don’t know where Moon is. He 
                        wouldn’t show his limp dick here. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why not? 

           Park rolls his eyes. Mamma-San turns and levels a long look 
           at Ethan, sizing him up. 

           She then reaches under her dress and pulls out a PROSTHETIC 
           LOWER LEG and puts it on the table. Then, from inside the leg 
           she pulls out a HUGE, OLD .45 and lays it on the table in 
           front of her.

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        Because unlike you, he knows that 
                        he doesn’t have the balls to talk 
                        to me. 
                             (to Park)
                        Who is this Fuck-Head?

                                 ETHAN
                        Moon killed my partner. 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        You saw this?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah. 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        And you could not stop it?  Un-
                        fucking-impressive. 

           Ethan leans forward, about to respond, but Park cuts him off.

                                 PARK
                        We went to Lau’s old place. In 
                        Jongno Sam-Ga. The Russians he 
                        employed... They were dealing with 
                        drugs.
           Mamma-San shifts uncomfortably. 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        It’s beginning.

                                 ETHAN
                        What’s beginning? 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        The old Presidents... They were not 
                        just concerned with their own well 
                        being. President Lee. Shin. The 
                        first President Kim... They kept 
                        the city in Harmony. Now there’s 
                        Yune. Toh. That asshole Kang. They 
                        don’t respect the balance that 
                        exists. They just want more and 
                        more and more. Killing Shin... It 
                        changes the kinds of business the 
                        Presidents will bring into Seoul. 
                        It starts with drugs, but it will 
                        grow and grow until our beautiful 
                        city is like any other fucking 
                        American hell-hole. You want Moon 
                        for personal reasons, but he has 
                        caused much more. Now everything 
                        changes.

                                 PARK
                        How do we find Moon? 

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        You don’t. If he was allowed back, 
                        you have no friends. Fuck-Face goes 
                        home and you get a job.

                                 ETHAN
                        Vince used to say that the best way 
                        to catch a thief is to wait until 
                        he buys something.

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        Did he learn everything from a 
                        fortune cookie?

                                 ETHAN
                        The point is that it’s never just 
                        about the money. What else does 
                        Moon want besides Shin’s interests?

           She just cocks her head to the side. Momentarily impressed.
                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        I heard that someone was calling 
                        around about a girl. It didn’t make 
                        sense to me until Fuck-Face spoke 
                        just now. What the fuck was her 
                        name? 

           Mamma-San snaps her fingers then speaks into her walkie. 

                                 MAMMA-SAN (CONT’D)
                        <Tell Aja to come in here.>

           AJA, a beautiful room salon girl in a silk dress enter, 
           looking mortally terrified of her boss. She bows nervously.

                                 MAMMA-SAN (CONT’D)
                        <There was a girl named Sun-Min. 
                        Worked the rounds at the room 
                        salons. You were friendly with 
                        her.>

                                 AJA
                        <Yes, for a while.>

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        <Did she have a boyfriend?>

                                 AJA
                        <Yes. A serious one.>

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        <What was his name?>

                                 AJA
                        <I don’t remember...>

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        <Was he Jopok?>

                                 AJA
                        <Yes... I think he was Moon.>

           Ethan reacts to the name.

                                 ETHAN
                        Ask what happened to her.

           Aja answers in Korean. Park translates for Ethan on the fly--

                                 PARK
                        She’s heard just rumors... Things 
                        went badly for her... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PARK (CONT'D)
                        She was fired from all the room 
                        salons when Moon was exiled...Last 
                        she heard, Sun-Min could not find 
                        work anywhere. She then ran into 
                        debt problems. When she could not 
                        pay, they made her work her debt 
                        off. There were rumors that she was 
                        working in Yongsan.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yongsan? 

                                 PARK
                        Red light district. 

           Mamma-San nods for Aja to leave. Aja looks relieved but as 
           she turns to leave, Mamma-San grabs her dress and pulls her 
           closer. She pinches the curve of Aja’s lower ass. More skin 
           than flab.

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        <Lose it in two days or I will cut 
                        it off.> 

           Aja’s eyes widen in terror. She backs out of the room bowing. 
           Park stands. This time Ethan quickly follows. 

                                 PARK
                             (bowing)
                        Thank you, Mamma-San. 

           Park looks over at Ethan. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (copying)
                        Yes. Thank you. 

           As they head for the door--

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        Park...

           A LOOK OF CONCERN crosses her face, but is quickly buried.

                                 MAMMA-SAN (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. Get the fuck out of here.

           INT. ROOM SALON / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan and Park exit the room. Both take a deep breath.

                                 ETHAN
                        She seemed really... Nice. 
           EXT. AIRPORT SHIPPING AREA - NIGHT

           Cargo and commercial JETS taxi along the tarmac. Moon and a 
           few of his men are led by a UNIFORMED CUSTOMS OFFICIAL to a 
           small loading dock area crammed with various crates, boxes, 
           etc...

           The CUSTOMS OFFICIAL points out a couple of crates marked 
           with CHINESE CHARACTERS. One of the Jopok uses a crow bar to 
           open it, REVEALING a row of neatly packed ASSAULT RIFLES.

                                 CUSTOM AGENT
                             (alarmed)
                        <You did not say-- Guns? You cannot 
                        do this! It is not the agreement we 
                        had!>

                                 MOON
                        <I know. But things are changing.>

           Moon doesn’t blink as one of his MEN pulls a PLASTIC BAG over 
           the OFFICIAL’s head and yanks it tight around his neck. The 
           OFFICIAL’S eyes bulge as he’s wrestled to the ground and 
           suffocated.

           Moon looks over at the guns, then at the OFFICIAL being 
           killed with an almost sad expression. 

           INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - NIGHT

           A long empty hall. Bland beige walls. Moon and his MEN moving 
           through. Causing havoc. MEN, half-dressed, naked, clutching 
           clothes, sprint out of the hall as Moon’s Men beat and kick 
           them. The WORKING GIRLS huddle in the corners.

           INT. YOUNG GANG HANG-OUT - DAY

           Young Gang Members stand in a circle, mouths agape. Standing 
           in the middle is Moon, shaking his hand out. He stands over 
           THE LEADER, lying on the ground dead with a screwdriver 
           sticking out of his eye.

           INT. MOON’S CAR - NIGHT

           Crossing over the Han River. City scape glowing in 
           background. Moon on his cell again, listening. He then YELLS 
           SOMETHING ANGRILY and SLAMS the cell into the dash, 
           splintering it.

           The DRIVER looks very nervous. 
           INT. FETISH BAR - NIGHT

           A dark bar lit with blue neon. A group of SALARY MEN sit at a 
           bar staring up. Overhead GIRLS dance and roll around on a 
           glass floor providing a unique view. One girl straddles 
           another while guzzling a huge JUG of water. 

           Moon is in the corner, talking with the MANAGER. Moon pulls a 
           bag filled with PACKETS OF DRUGS, ready to sell. The Manager 
           looks at Moon in disbelief. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Completely empty. Moon sits in a table alone. A few of his 
           men stand around the room for protection, but there is no 
           conversation. Moon looks around the room lifelessly, then 
           flips through a KOREAN MAGAZINE-- Lots of glossy ads. Luxury 
           goods, restaurant reviews, etc... Moon stops at:

           A REAL ESTATE AD: Computer generated photos of a hi-tech 
           luxury building. A GREAT LOOKING COUPLE sits having coffee in 
           a sleek modern kitchen, smiling. They toast wine glasses at 
           sunset on a balcony overlooking the city. Print underneath 
           read (subtitled from English).

                              SKY VILLAGE. LUXURY LIFESTYLE. 
                              PRE-SALE APARTMENTS AVAILABLE. 

           Moon lingers on the ad for a moment. Lee enters the front 
           door. Moon rips the ad out and stuffs it into his pocket as 
           Lee approaches.

                                 LEE
                        <We may have found something.>

           For the first time, Moon’s face brightens with expectation. 

                                 MOON
                        <Where?>

                                 LEE
                        <Potentially in Dongdaemun.>

           He downs the rest of his drink and stands. 

                                 MOON
                        <Get the car.>

                                 LEE
                             (hesitant)
                        <Do we have time for this? There 
                        are still many things to attend 
                        to.>
                                 MOON
                        <There is nothing else right now.>

           INT. CHANG’S DESK - NIGHT

           Chang sits at his desk, pouring over the pages of Moon’s 
           file. He takes a deep breath and rubs his eyes. 

           He starts to turn the page he’s on, then stops. He circles a 
           name on the page and walks over towards Ho’s desk.

                                 CHANG
                        <Were all of his known associates 
                        screened?>

                                 HO
                             (nodding)
                        <No one found anything. Most were 
                        either dead or already in jail.>

                                 CHANG
                        <What about the woman?>

           Chang shows Ho the circled name.

                                 HO
                        <She is just a prostitute.>

                                 CHANG
                        <It doesn’t seem odd that she’s the 
                        only woman on the list?> 

                                 HO
                             (with a shrug)
                        <They don’t allow women in Jopok.>

           Chang takes the packet with him back to his desk. He turns to 
           his computer and pecks out a name: “GONG SUN-MIN” 

           A moment of searching, then a MUG SHOT appears: SUN-MIN. The 
           same girl as in MOON’S WALLET PHOTO. Her beauty is only 
           slightly diminished, but her eyes are worn. Lifeless. 

           Chang sits up, refreshed with adrenaline. He scrolls down the 
           report...

           EXT. YONGSAN DISTRICT- NIGHT

           A narrow alleyway of storefronts. PROSTITUTES sit in large 
           glass windows on display for gawking TOURISTS and potential 
           CLIENTS. It’s more desperate than alluring. 

           Ethan waits as Park speaks with a GIRL in a window. He hands 
           her some cash before approaching Ethan. 
                                 PARK
                        She says that Sun-Min doesn’t work 
                        here anymore. Now she’s with a 
                        pimp. Works at a love hotel. 

                                 ETHAN
                        A what?

                                 PARK
                        A love hotel. It’s where--

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, I get it.

           INT. SMPA / CHANG’S DESK - SAME

           Chang on the phone... 

                                 CHANG
                        <Yes, this is Inspector Chang. You 
                        had cited a woman named Gong Sun-
                        Min several times over the past 
                        year for prostitution. Do you have 
                        a last known address? 
                             (a beat)
                        What kind of larger 
                        investigation..? Do you still have 
                        the pimp’s address?>

           Chang grabs a pen and scribbles on a pad.

           EXT. DONGDAEMUN STREET - NIGHT

           Heavy commercial area. Overcrowded with 70’s buildings. 
           Dozens of Barber Poles denote low-rent massage parlors. 

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           A small, dingy office. A man, RYU (40’s), greasy, Members 
           Only jacket, sits eating a cup of instant Ramen while 
           watching a small TV. 

           Moon and Lee appear in the doorway. 

                                 MOON
                        <I’m looking for a girl.>

                                 RYU
                        <You have to call.>

                                 MOON
                        <I’m looking for a specific girl.>
           Ryu looks annoyed. Picks up a flier with a NUDE WOMAN and a 
           phone number on it. 

                                 RYU
                        <We have all kinds. But you have to 
                        call.>

           Moon steps closer and turns off the TV. Lee shuts the door. 
           Ryu sets his noodles down. 

                                 RYU (CONT’D)
                        <What’s your problem?>

                                 MOON
                             (disgusted)
                        <Do you get to sleep with the girls 
                        you whore or do you have to pay 
                        like the other faggots?>

           Ryu turns and reaches for an aluminum baseball bat leaning 
           against the wall. Moon’s faster. Catches Ryu by the wrist.

           Lee sits on a couch flipping through a spiral notebook. 
           Meticulous hand writing covers each page.

           OFF SCREEN, all we hear is a dull THUD-THUD-THUD... Like 
           someone beating a rug clean.

                                 LEE
                        <I found her.> 

           Moon, breathing hard and sweating steps into frame. Lee shows 
           him an entry in the notebook.

           Moon pushes his hair back. Drops the BLOODY ALUMINUM BAT with 
           a CLANK as they leave.

           EXT. LOVE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Neon sign reading simply “Hotel” in Korean. A curtain veils 
           the doorway offering some discretion.

           INT. LOVE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Spartan. Park and Ethan stand by the front desk. The MANAGER 
           sports a bad perm.

                                 PARK
                        Sun-Min.

           Manager looks over at Ethan.
                                 MANAGER
                        If you’re her 11 o’clock, you’re 
                        early. She’s still upstairs.
                             (re: Ethan)
                        All the white-boys come for Sun-
                        Min.

                                 ETHAN
                        We’ll wait outside. 

           INT. FOOD STALL - NIGHT

           Plastic tented food stall on the curb. A COOK maniacally 
           chops up a flash fried octopus into a hug vat of boiling. 
           Ethan and Park sit at a table with a view of the Love Hotel.

           Ethan pokes at a bowl of red-boiling stew. He picks around 
           the unidentifiable items. Park SLURPS his noodles LOUDLY. 

                                 PARK
                        It’s good, huh? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh yeah.

                                 PARK
                        What was your partner’s name?

                                 ETHAN
                        Vincent. Resparo. 

                                 PARK
                        Was he like you?

                                 ETHAN
                        How’s that? 

           Park spins his finger around his temple, as in “crazy.”

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Used to be crazier.

                                 PARK
                        Is that how they pick partners? 

                                 ETHAN
                        No... Maybe. A few years ago, I was 
                        on suspension. I had... Uh... Hit 
                        one of my superior officers. 

                                 PARK
                        He helped you get out of trouble.
                                 ETHAN
                        Huh? No. It was Vincent. He was the 
                        one I hit. 

           Park seems perplexed. 

                                 PARK
                        So he made you his partner?

                                 ETHAN
                        He said he liked the way I thought. 
                        That was... Six or seven years ago.

                                 PARK
                        At the police station in Los 
                        Angeles, I heard them talking about 
                        you. They did not think I could 
                        understand. They said you were 
                        under investigation. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah. They thought I might have 
                        thrown a suspect off a building. 
                        But I was cleared.

                                 PARK
                        Did you? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Throw him off? Yeah. 

                                 PARK
                        You do not regret it? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Only thing I regret is that I only 
                        got to do it once. 

                                 PARK
                        We’re not so different. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah we are. See, you’re a low-life 
                        criminal piece of shit and I’m not. 

                                 PARK
                             (matter-of-factly)
                        No... You are just better at 
                        getting away with it. 

           Before Ethan can react, Park points past him, face 
           registering surprise. 
           EXT. LOVE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Moon and Lee stand looking up at the hotel. 

                                 MOON
                        <What was the number?>

                                 LEE
                        <Room 29.>

           Moon stares for a second longer before heading inside. It’s 
           understood that he goes in alone.

           INT. LOVE HOTEL / HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Hallway is lined with simple numbered doors. Moon walks past 
           number 20. Each step seems to make his face grow darker, his 
           anger building...

           He gets to room 29...

           INT. LOVE HOTEL / ROOM 29 - SAME

           Human skin writhing on scratchy sheets. A CONFUCIAN SYMBOL 
           TATTOO on a woman’s shoulder. SUN-MIN (28), lies on a bed, 
           her face an expressionless mask. A FAT BUSINESS MAN grinds on 
           top of her as he tries to kiss her neck.

           Sun-Min turns her face away, burying her disgust. She then 
           notices the door slightly ajar... Suddenly the Business Man’s 
           head is YANKED BACK. 

           MOON straddles the Fat Business Man’s back, using his own tie 
           to choke him to death. 

           Sun-Min watches, still expressionless, as Moon wrestles with 
           the thrashing Business Man. Knuckles white with effort. 
           Finally the Business Man goes limp-- Dead. 

           Moon turns to Sun-Min who self-consciously covers herself 
           with a sheet. 

                                 SUN-MIN
                        <You’re ashamed to see me like 
                        this.>

           Moon sits down next to her. 

                                 MOON
                        <Only because it’s my fault.>

           Moon reaches out and gently touches her face and nods. 
           EXT. LOVE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Ethan hovers near a storefront window. In the reflection he 
           sees Lee waiting for Moon. Park watches from Lee’s flank. 

           Moon and Sun-Min, freshly showered, exit the hotel. Moon 
           leads Sun-Min and Lee down an alley. 

           Park and Ethan follow from a distance. 

           INT. RYU’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Still. Lights on. A KNOCK on the door. After several more, 
           Chang pushes the door open. He sees the bloody bat on the 
           floor. Then Ryu’s body, head caved in.

           As Chang pulls his cell phone, he spots the spiral notebook 
           on the couch. Sees one of the last entries (subtitled in 
           Korean): “S.M. Hotel NamSam. Room #29 -- 10pm” 

           Chang checks his watch. Only 11:05. Sees RYU’S CELL on the 
           desk. Grabs it on his way out.

           EXT. ALLEY WAY - NIGHT

           Ethan and Park round a blind corner. Come to an intersection 
           of alleys with Moon nowhere in sight. 

           Park and Ethan split up. 

           EXT. LOVE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Chang approaching on the street. A small crowd has gathered 
           outside the front door. The Manager in hysterics. Chang 
           approaches. Flashes his badge.

                                 MANAGER
                        They killed him!

                                 CHANG
                        Killed who?

                                 MANAGER
                        A customer! He was with a girl!

                                 CHANG
                        Sun-Min?

           The Manager gives Chang a look-- How did he know that?

                                 CHANG (CONT’D)
                        Which way?

           The Manager points towards the dark alley. 
           EXT. LEFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan walks deeper and deeper into the back alley maze. AN 
           OLD LADY tosses out dirty kitchen water.

           EXT. RIGHT ALLEY - SAME

           Park follows a curving pathway. Catches a glimpse of Lee’s 
           coat. Picks up the pace to follow. 

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan steps out of the alley. Looks around. Girls in 
           storefronts. Right back where they started. Shit. 

           He turns and heads back in. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Park in a light run. Lee just up ahead in a small grungy 
           court yard. Park follows and enters when--

           A FIST comes shooting out of a doorway. Catches him in the 
           stomach. Park doubles over in pain. 

           Moon steps out from the doorway. Park looks up.

                                 MOON
                             (genuinely surprised)
                        <What--?>

           Moon kicks Park viciously across the face.

           As Moon goes to kick him again, Park deftly catches his leg. 
           But then Lee stomps on his back. Hard.

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                        <What are you doing here?>

           Park defiantly tries to stand, but comes under another storm 
           of feet and fists. He spits a wad of blood.

           INT. ALLEY INTERSECTION - SAME

           Chang in the dark maze straining to hear or see anything. 
           Proceeding in any direction would be a guess. 

           He pulls RYU’S CELL PHONE. 

           INT. ALLEY - SAME

           Ethan, another rat in the maze. Lost.
           INT. COURT YARD- SAME

           Moon and Lee are viciously punishing Park. Moon levels him 
           with a kick to the face.

           Lee pulls Park up and slams him up against a building. Park 
           struggles to stay conscious. 

           Lee pulls a butterfly knife and tosses it to Moon. A FLASH of 
           METAL as Moon whips open the blade. As he walks towards Park--

           SUN-MIN’S CELL PHONE starts to RING.

           INT. ALLEY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           Chang stands with Ryu’s cell phone open. On the screen we 
           see: “Calling: Sun-Min.” 

           Chang bolts towards the SOUND OF SUN-MIN’S RINGING CELL. 

           INT. ALLEY - SAME

           Ethan also reacts to the RINGING... 

           INT. RIGHT ALLEY - SAME

           Lee and Moon are both momentarily distracted by the RINGING 
           CELL. Sun-Min struggles to turn it off.  

           Park whips his head back. Cracks Lee’s nose with a head butt 
           and KICKS the knife from Moon’s hand.

           ETHAN appears in the alley-- Disbelief from Moon. Then he 
           does the math: Park and Ethan are working together.

           MOON grabs Sun-Min and bolts off down an alley. Ethan chases.

           LEE breaks free of Park and sprints down an adjacent alley. 
           Park gives chase. 

           CHANG rounds the corner into the courtyard, just in time to 
           see Ethan heading out.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Moon pulls Sun-Min out of the dark alley. Lights from shops 
           and restaurants turn night to day.

           Ethan quickly follows. Scans the ocean of PEOPLE. Across the 
           street, a glimpse of Sun-Min.

           Ethan rushes to follow. From out behind a parked bus--
           MOON grabs Ethan. Swings him around and SLAMS him against the 
           BUS. Moon uses momentum to toss Ethan into traffic--

           BOOM! Ethan SLAMS into an oncoming car. The WINDSHIELD 
           EXPLODES INWARDS as Ethan CRASHES half-way through it. 

           Ethan pulls himself out, ignoring the SHOCKED DRIVER and 
           limps off to chase. 

           EXT. SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Lined with food stalls. LEE bolts out of the alley. Breathing 
           hard. Grabs the end of a VENDOR’S BBQ PIT. Shoves it over 
           sending red hot coals in front of Park as he appears. 

           Sparks shower as Park runs through them. 

           Lee, seriously sucking air, barrels through a few 
           PEDESTRIANS... Park gaining... Lee turns to see how close... 
           Runs straight into the street... SCREECH OF RUBBER! A HORN 
           BLAST! Then--

           BAM! Lee gets hit full on by a passing Delivery Truck. 

           BYSTANDERS gather around his twisted body. 

           Park pushes his way through the crowd. Roughly starts to 
           frisk Lee’s body. Finds a MONEY CLIP and pockets it. 

           SIRENS WAIL CLOSE.

                                 STUDENT
                        <What are you doing? HEY! Thief!>

           Other BYSTANDERS start to yell, a few trying to hold onto 
           Park until the police arrive. Park YANKS free and runs.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           MOON pulling SUN-MIN through the dense crowd. The two get 
           separated by a group of DRUNK KOREAN ARMY GUYS. Moon points 
           to a subway station 20 meters away. Sun-Min nods in 
           understanding. As she pushes her way through the crowd--

           ETHAN suddenly appears behind her and grabs her.

                                 SUN-MIN
                        <BYUNG-HO!>

           Moon stops and turns. Sees ETHAN holding onto SUN-MIN. Moon 
           shoves his way back towards them.

           Ethan pushes Sun-Min away. He and Moon circle each other. The 
           CROWD encircles them, like it’s a drunken bar fight. Until--
           MOON pulls his knife. He lunges at Ethan, but Ethan is able 
           to grab his KNIFE hand.

           ETHAN is able to wrestle Moon to the ground, keeping his 
           knife hand at a distance. Moon LANDS THREE, FOUR, FIVE 
           punches! But Ethan HANGS ON, possessed with killing Moon. He 
           slips an elbow under Moon’s chin, securing him in a choke 
           hold--

           PEOPLE start to notice-- This is no drunken street fight.

           MOON struggles, gasping for breath. He STRUGGLES WILDLY, but 
           Ethan has too much leverage. His arms start to go slack when--

                                 ROOKIE PATROL COP
                        <POLICE! STOP!>

           The Cop looks young enough and scared enough that this might 
           be his first day. His gun shakes in his hands. PEOPLE start 
           to scatter at the sight of the gun, running for cover.

           Ethan’s momentarily distracted and--

           MOON THROWS his head back-- CRACK! Right in Ethan’s face! 
           Ethan is stunned. Falls backwards. 

           Moon tries to make a break for it in the confusion-- The 
           Patrol Cop sees the knife in his hand and FIRES! BOOM! 

           FULL BLOWN PANIC! PEOPLE scattering in every direction!

           Except SUN-MIN, who slumps to the ground clutching the bullet 
           hole in her neck. Moon runs to her. Her eyes are soft and 
           wide. She tries to say something to him, but only musters a  
           GURGLE OF BLOOD before she dies. 

           CHANG appears, pushing his way through the crowd. Spots the 
           ROOKIE, wide-eyed, swinging his gun nervously back and forth 
           between Ethan to Moon. 

                                 CHANG
                             (holding his badge high)
                        <OFFICER!>

           The Patrol Cop turns to look at Chang. Then past him. Chang 
           whips around on time to catch--

           PARK’S FIST come flying into his face. Chang’s head snaps 
           back and he falls to the ground. 

           ETHAN reacts, burying his shoulder and KNOCKING the Patrol 
           Cop FLAT ON HIS BACK.

           Ethan turns to see Sun-Min’s body on ground. Moon gone. 
                                 PARK
                             (grabbing Ethan)
                        No need to thank me.

           Ethan and Park disappear down into the nearby subway station.

           CHANG pulls himself up. Staggers over to Sun-Min’s body, 
           knowing that she’s dead. More PATROL COPS arrive. 

                                 PATROL COP#2
                        <Inspector?>

           He hands Chang his gun. And his inhaler. Chang angrily 
           snatches them back. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - LATER

           A train pulls up to a stop. Ethan leans out. Checks the empty 
           platform. He nods and Park emerges a moment later. 

           They walk in silence towards the exit, looking absolutely 
           spent, as the train pulls away behind them, Ethan does a 
           DOUBLE-TAKE. In the last train car--

           VINCENT, head still partially blown off, stares back through 
           the shrinking train window...

           INT. MOON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Moon going ballistic. Unhinged in rage as he trashes his 
           apartment. He picks up a chair, heaves it at the floor to 
           ceiling windows, spider-webbing it. 

           A couple of Moon’s MEN stand in the corners, not daring to 
           catch Moon’s eye.

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Through the glass door we see Chang in the Lieutenant’s 
           office, head bowed, taking another reaming from  
           superintendent Kim.  

           INT. SUPERINTENDENT KIM’S OFFICE - SAME

           Chang stands in front of superintendent Kim. 

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <Everyone is working around the 
                        clock! Dedicating themselves to 
                        finding Moon and you do this after 
                        you were given a different case! 
                        Now you cause us all public 
                        humiliation! Of all the cops here, 
                        Chang, you have the easiest job!>
           Chang’s anger starts to finally bubble.

                                 CHANG
                             (low)
                        <It’s the same job.>

                                 SUPERINTENDENT KIM
                        <What?>

                                 CHANG
                        <He’s looking for Moon too. He and 
                        Park! They are working together to 
                        find him and they’ve gotten closer 
                        than this whole squad!>

           Outside, faces turn towards the office, seeing a whole 
           different Chang. 

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT / BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Chang walks through the bullpen, passing Ho’s desk.

                                 HO
                             (rises, mouth agape)
                        <Jesus Christ, Chang...>

           Chang doesn’t even look at him. He takes a seat at his 
           isolated desk. After a moment, he stands and flips it over 
           with a CRASH, sending supplies skittering across the floor. 

           The room goes SILENT as he storms out.

           INT. PRESIDENT YUNE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           President Yune sits in a chair watching a 60 inch plasma. ON 
           THE TV is the NEWS: 

                                 ANCHOR
                        <-- During a bold, foot chase.>

           Footage changes to the shopping street where Chang, Moon, 
           Park and Ethan all converged. 

                                 ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        <Killed at the scene was Sun-Min 
                        Oh.>

           A MUGSHOT of SUN-MIN fills the screen. 

                                 ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        <Witnesses reported at least three 
                        other men involved in the incident.

                                 ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        Two were described as Korean, late 
                        20’s to early 30’s and the third 
                        possibly as an American.>

           President Yune hits “mute” and dials a number on his cell.

                                 YUNE
                        <Ki-Yun...>

           EXT. JONGNO SAM-GA RESTAURANT - LATER

           Far away from the gleaming steel and glass of modern Seoul. 
           Bunker-like post war buildings converted into endless dining 
           holes. Pig heads and fish in plastic tubs of dirty water 
           outside indicate the quality. 

           INT. JONGNO SAM-GA RESTAURANT - SAME

           Moon sits at a far table with Ki-Yun. 

                                 KI-YUN
                        <President Yune was watching the 
                        news tonight. It reminded him of 
                        the old days. When you used to look 
                        for this kind of attention.>

                                 MOON
                        <I didn’t know the American was 
                        here. Or that he was working with 
                        Park.>

                                 KI-YUN
                        <Yes. That was... Surprising. What 
                        will you do?>

           There’s a condescending tone to Ki-Yun’s voice. 

                                 MOON
                             (through tight lips)
                        <I will handle it.>

                                 KI-YUN
                        <President Yune would prefer that I 
                        helped. He thinks you may be too... 
                        Emotionally involved.>

           Ki-Yun stands to leave. Turns to Moon one last time.

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                             (can’t quite believe it)
                        <For a girl, eh?>

           Moon glares with impotent anger as Ki-Yun leaves. 
           INT. PARK’S CAR - MORNING

           Park and Ethan driving in silence as they head towards the 
           Han. Park suddenly checks his watch. 

                                 PARK
                        Is it Thursday? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I think so. Why?

           Park JERKS the steering wheel and cuts across three lanes to 
           exit to freeway.

           EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - MORNING

           Park’s car comes to a stop on a hill overlooking a beautiful 
           flower garden. 

                                 ETHAN
                        You think we’re really going to 
                        find Moon here? 

                                 PARK
                        I will need five minutes.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hurry up.

           Park gets out of the car and walks down a walking trail. 

           EXT. FLOWER GARDEN / FOUNTAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           MRS. SHIN, President Shin’s wife, (50), elegant but obviously 
           formidable, stands watching water lily’s in a fountain. 

           SEVERAL passing GROUND KEEPERS say hello to her warmly. This 
           is a place she comes to often. She’s surprised when she turns 
           to see Park standing behind her. 

                                 PARK
                        <Mrs. Shin. I owe you an apology.>

           EXT. PARK’S CAR - SAME

           Ethan impatiently checks his watch. He turns and sees Park 
           and Mrs. Shin. He watches as Park kneels down in front of 
           her, head bowed. Mrs. Shin starts slapping Park, screaming 
           something terrible at him before heading off in tears.

           Park returns to the car, ashen faced. Ethan looks at him with 
           something approaching empathy. 
                                 PARK
                        We need to go. 

           Park starts the car and SCREECHES away. 

           INT. PARK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Park and Ethan. Ethan at the kitchen sink, picking pebbles of 
           broken glass out of his elbow. 

                                 ETHAN
                        We should leave. They’ll be looking 
                        for both of us now.

           Park pushes the bookshelf aside. Pulls the rest of his cash 
           out from the hole in the floor. 

                                 PARK
                        I will be right back.

           Ethan nods as Park heads out the apartment. Ethan continues 
           to clean out his elbow. 

           A moment later, the front door silently swings open... Ethan 
           drops a bloody rag into the sink and turns, finding--

           KI-YUN and two of his GANGSTERS. Ki-Yun WHIPS Ethan across 
           the head with a piece of pipe with a dull THUD!  Ki-Yun steps 
           past him, searching the apartment for Park.

           Ethan falls to the ground. Blood oozes from his nose and from 
           a gash across his face. 

           In the blink of an eye, the TWO GANGSTERS are on him: Duct 
           tape is bound around his wrists and feet. A fat roll of CLOTH 
           crammed into his mouth. Then a body bag is unfurled and Ethan 
           is rolled into it. The abduction takes less than ten seconds.

           Ki-Yun returns with a shrug. Motions for them to go.

           INT. LOBBY - SAME

           Park stands off by the mailboxes. Checks his mail. Nothing 
           personal. Even so, he rips what’s there into pieces and 
           tosses them in the trash. He heads back but stops cold when--

           CHANG enters the lobby and presses the elevator call button. 

           Park shrinks back towards a back hallway as one of the 
           elevators arrives and Chang gets in. 
           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ki-Yun and his two Gangsters wait at the elevator banks, 
           carrying Ethan like an old rug. MUZAK plays in the 
           background.

           One of the elevators PINGS on arrival. The door opens. Ki-Yun 
           readies his steel pipe, but it’s EMPTY. They load Ethan 
           inside just as--

           PING! The other elevator arrives. Chang steps off, 
           obliviously passing Ki-Yun’s group and Ethan as the door 
           closes on them.  

           CHANG continues down the hall to Park’s apartment. He sees 
           the door ajar. He pulls his GUN, probably for the second time 
           in his career and takes a deep steadying breath.

           INT. PARK’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Chang steps inside, cautiously. Not a sound. He notices the 
           smear of blood on the floor in the kitchen. 

           EXT. FISH MARKET - NIGHT

           A massive warehouse. Inside, endless rows of STALLS hawking 
           every kind of sea creature known to man... 

           INT. FISH MARKET / CLEANING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ethan opens his eyes. BLOODY VINCENT, stands looking up at 
           him. Ethan jerks back, then realizes it’s really an OLD MAN 
           in a blood streaked YELLOW RAIN COAT. He cuts with heads off 
           fish with a long, rusty BONING KNIFE. He looks away from 
           Ethan with ambivalence.

           Ethan realizes he’s duct taped to a chair, in a large room 
           that’s covered with old, stained tiles. Nasty, rusted hooks 
           hang off racks overhead. The floor is streaked with blood. 
           FLIES SWARM on a pile of ROTTING FISH HEADS in the corner.

                                 KI-YUN
                             (entering)
                        This fish here is sold to the best 
                        restaurants in Seoul. 

           Ki-Yun picks up a rusty butcher knife, crusted with dried 
           fish scales and blood. Ethan fights it, but the smell and 
           fear get to him and he PUKES. 

           Ki-Yun jumps back as his vomit splashes on the floor.

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        If they only knew.
           Ki-Yun KICKS Ethan hard in the chest, sending him and the 
           chair backwards. Ethan’s face lands on the wet, bloody floor. 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        Did you think you could just come 
                        here and do whatever you like? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I just want Moon. 

                                 KI-YUN
                        It does not matter what you want.

           Ethan’s eyes flicker to the knife in Ki-Yun’s hands. 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I can’t kill you. The 
                        murder of an American cop would 
                        force the government to respond. It 
                        would be an international incident. 
                        But if we were in Los Angeles... 

           Ki-Yun drops a few photos by Ethan’s face:  Photos of BETH 
           and STEPHANIE getting out of their car, exiting a market, 
           etc... All recent pictures.

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        Go home. Before something bad 
                        happens.

           Ki-Yun stands, then walks over to a bucket filled with water 
           and pulls out a grapefruit sized, live, pulsating OCTOPUS, 
           it’s tentacles clinging to his hands. 

           Ki-Yun watches it with a detached amusement. He then takes it 
           and SLAMS it onto Ethan’s face.

           Ethan thrashes wildly as the tentacles snake around his face, 
           they pry their way into his mouth. After a moment, his entire 
           face is covered by the octopus as he GAGS from its effort to 
           CRAWL inside his mouth. 

           The Old Man turns to watch. 

           Ethan HOLLERS IN PAIN, THRASHING his head back and forth, 
           FRANTICALLY trying to dislodge this thing trying to creep 
           down his throat and suffocate him.  

           Ki-Yun leaves. As Ethan struggles with the octopus, THREE OF 
           HIS MEN enter and start mercilessly kicking and beating him 
           while he’s on the ground. 

           The Old Man turns back to beheading the fish. 
           EXT. SEOUL STREET - NIGHT

           A horrible street in a slummy section of town. Stray cats 
           roam over overflowing trash cans. 

           A MINI-VAN slows. The back door is opened and Ethan is thrown 
           out. He lands with a thump, bloodied, bruised and 
           traumatized. Ethan struggles to his feet...

           EXT. SIDESTREET - NIGHT

           Ethan leans up against a wall, throwing up. A MERCHANT exits 
           from a store weilding a broom. YAMMERS at ETHAN to get away. 
           Ethan staggers off. 

           EXT. SEOUL STREET - NIGHT

           Ethan rounds out of an alley to a downtown street. Trying to 
           get his bearings. Might as well be on Mars. A few 
           PROFESSIONAL-TYPES head his way. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey... English?

           The PROFESSIONAL-TYPES steer wide, like he was a rude bum. 
           Ethan slumps against a building, exhausted and defeated.

           He then looks up-- Bright light illuminates the dark sky. The 
           JUMBO-TRON running the SAMSUNG AD. Ethan heads towards it...

           INT. MAMMA-SAN’S ROOM SALON - NIGHT

           A ROOM SALON GIRL heads for the front door. She pulls a pack 
           of cigarettes. Suddenly, out of the shadows, Ethan reaches 
           out and grabs her. The ROOM SALON GIRL almost screams, until 
           Ethan falls face down in exhaustion.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. ROOM SALON / HALLWAY - DAY

           Park walking through the hallway. Mamma-San leads a group of 
           OLDER BUSINESS MEN towards a room. Her congenial smile drops 
           behind their backs as she levels a “Don’t fuck with me” look 
           at Park. Park nods reassuringly as he approaches a door.

           INT. ROOM SALON / OFFICE - SAME

           Richly decorated. Ethan lies unconscious on a couch. His eyes 
           flutter open. With a GROAN he sits up, unsure of where he is. 

           Ethan looks over at a beautiful desk. White lillies spill 
           from an antique vase. Sitting on the floor next to the desk 
           are THREE DIFFERENT PROSTHETIC LEGS.
           The DOOR OPENS and Park enters. 

                                 PARK
                        You’re not dead.

                                 ETHAN
                        Surprised?

                                 PARK
                        Yes. When Mamma-San called me, she 
                        sounded ready to kill you. 

                                 ETHAN
                        How long was I--?

                                 PARK
                        One day. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay... So we got some catching up 
                        to do.  

           Park holds up a PLANE TICKET.

                                 PARK
                        This was in your pocket. It is one 
                        way to Los Angeles. The Presidents 
                        expect you on it. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 PARK
                        Moon is protected. He is too 
                        strong. Maybe some other time when 
                        his guard is down, but not now.
                             (re: the ticket)
                        This is your only chance. They will 
                        kill you next time, no matter what 
                        the rules. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What is it with you and these 
                        fucking rules? Take a look around, 
                        Park! No one else gives a shit!

                                 PARK
                        Have you thought this through? If 
                        you kill Moon, you will not be able 
                        just to return to Los Angeles. You 
                        will be a criminal. A killer.

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s my problem. Move.
                                 PARK
                        No. Here it is my problem.

           Park stands firmly, blocking Ethan’s way. Ethan’s anger boils 
           over. Throws A HOOK, but Park CATCHES it in his hand.

           Park then twists Ethan’s arm back, PUNCHES him SHARP in the 
           KIDNEY. Ethan HOLLERS out in pain but WHIPS Park across the 
           jaw with an elbow. Park staggers backwards, spitting blood--

           Enraged, Ethan charges him like a bull and buries his 
           shoulder into Park’s stomach and DRIVES him straight back off 
           his feet, CRASHING THROUGH a DOOR INTO--

           INT. ROOM SALON - NIGHT

           Ethan and Park come crashing through the door. SIX ROOM SALON 
           GIRLS entertain a group of OLDER KOREAN BUSINESS MEN. 

           SCREAMS and YELLS erupt as Ethan and Park SLAM into the 
           table, KNOCKING over glasses, whiskey, etc..

           Park and Ethan wrestle and punch on the floor as the Girls 
           and Business Men scramble to get out of the way--

           BOOM! A GUNSHOT showers plaster down on them.

           MAMMA-SAN stands at the door way, holding her prosthetic leg 
           in one hand and a massive, old HANDGUN in the other. Her face 
           is contorted with rage.

                                 MAMMA-SAN
                        WHAT THE HOLY-FUCKING-SHIT!?! 

           INT. MAMMA-SAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Ethan and Park sitting on the couch, like errant schoolboys, 
           checking their bruises and cuts. Ethan breaks the silence.  

                                 ETHAN
                        You okay? 

                                 PARK
                        No. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Good.

           Ethan winces as he touches his swollen cheek. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        If we stop now... Everything that’s 
                        happened... It won’t mean anything.
           Park takes a deep breath. Nods in agreement. From outside the 
           door, they HEAR MAMMA-SAN going BALLISTIC on someone. Ethan 
           and Park both look nervous.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Is there like a back way out of 
                        here or something? 

           Park’s already looking...

           EXT. CHANG’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Huge complex of similar apartments catering to the working 
           class. Utilitarian in form and function. 

           INT. CHANG’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Chang gets off the elevator and starts down the hall carrying 
           a briefcase and plastic bag of take-out food...

           INT. CHANG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Chang hits the hall light. Removes his shoes at the door as 
           is Korean custom. In the dim light, we make out a small one-
           bedroom. Tidy, personal, but lonely. On a bookshelf is a 
           framed PHOTOGRAPH of CHANG’S WIFE. A traditional black ribbon 
           around the frame marks it as a memorial.

           Chang rests his badge, keys, inhaler and gun on the kitchen 
           counter and moves towards a lamp by the couch. It turns on 
           before he gets to it, revealing ETHAN. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Inspector. 

           Chang is startled. Immediately turns towards his gun. He 
           turns to see Park behind him, holding it. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        We just want to talk to you.

           Park tosses Chang his gun and inhaler,

           INT. CHANG’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Rain splatters against the window. Chang sits on the couch. 
           Ethan and Park still standing.

                                 CHANG
                        I don’t understand. How does this 
                        get Moon? 
                                 ETHAN
                        Everyone says how Jopok doesn’t 
                        like disruptions or attention. 
                        Let’s give them both. Let’s show 
                        them how expensive an investment 
                        Moon is. 

                                 CHANG
                        How?

                                 ETHAN
                             (motions to Park)
                        We’ll give you locations, but you 
                        have to make sure word gets out. In 
                        a public way.

           Chang shifts uncomfortably in his couch. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to agree with the 
                        way I’m doing this, but your city’s 
                        about to take a real bad turn. You 
                        can stop it.  

           Chang looks down at the inhaler on the coffee table, then 
           glances up to the photo of his dead wife. 

           EXT. STREET- LATER

           Ethan and Park walking down the street. 

                                 ETHAN
                        We’re going to need more than 
                        sticks to pull this off.

           Ethan looks at Park. 

                                 PARK
                             (reluctantly)
                        I have heard of someone... 

           EXT. HWANGHAK-DONG - DAY

           Massive outdoor flea market. Everything from textiles to 
           second hand restaurant equipment, electronics and clothes 
           sold in dilapidated storefronts and tents.

           Ethan and Park walk through the maze of people and vendors. 

           INT. APPLIANCE TENT - DAY

           Lined with broken electronic equipment stacked six feet high. 
           Ethan and Park stand across from an OLD WOMAN. She eyes both 
           suspiciously. Decides they’re okay. 
           The Old Woman snaps her fingers at a YOUNG BOY playing an old 
           electronic game on the floor. She motions them to follow him. 

           EXT. HWAGHAK-DONG - DAY

           Ethan and Park follow the Boy as he leads them through the 
           maze of tents and vendors...

           EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER

           An oasis of garbage somewhere in the city. Ringed by a tall 
           corrugated steel fence, it’s like an island unto itself.

           The Young Boy plays fetch with a MANGY DOG. 

           A group of HARD LOOKING MEN sit around a cluster of salvaged 
           chairs. One of them holds a beat-up looking SHOTGUN. 

           Ethan and Park stand in front of their boss, THE GUN DEALER, 
           wearing expensive designer sunglasses.

           He counts off a wad of cash. He pretends to consider the 
           amount. Then nods to Park and Ethan. 

                                 GUN DEALER
                        What kind of guns do you need? 

                                 ETHAN
                        What do you mean? 

                                 GUN DEALER
                        For what purpose? 

           Park and Ethan share a look. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                             (nodding)
                        Ah. I understand.

           The Dealer CLAPS his HANDS. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                             (to one of his workers)
                        <Bring the box! Quickly!>

           Two of his MEN slowly get up and disappear into a tin shack. 
           They emerge a few moments later with a GREEN BOX STAMPED “US 
           ARMY” and place it at the Dealer’s feet. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                        This is not the Chinese imitations 
                        you see at Kang’s or what the 
                        Russians sell. This is Military 
                        level. Completely untraceable.
           The Gun Dealer claps again. One of his MEN opens the box and 
           unfolds a dirty blanket. 

           INSIDE THE BOX are several old, rusted assault rifles. 

           The Dealer picks up a beat-up AK-47. Holds it out for Ethan. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                        Kalishnikov. 

           Ethan looks at Park, annoyed. Park tries to keep him from 
           insulting the Dealer and encourages him to take it. 

           Ethan takes the rifle. Some jerry-rigged welding is visible. 
           He tries to pull back the clearing handle... Stuck.  

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                             (snatching back the gun)
                        Here. Here. I will show you.

           Takes him three tries to clear the handle. He smiles. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                             (like it’s impressive)
                        Hmm?

           The Dealer then picks up a clip. Blows on it before slapping 
           it into the rifle. 

           The Dealer lets off a SHORT BURST into the yard. At nothing 
           in particular. His MEN CLAP as if he just hit a bulls-eye.

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                        Kalishnikov. Very accurate. 

           The Dealer turns to the YOUNG BOY playing fetch with the DOG. 

                                 GUN DEALER (CONT’D)
                        <Hey! Throw the ball out there.>

           The Boy looks down at the DOG with a ball in its mouth. The 
           Boy looks almost pleading at Park and Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        You don’t have to--

           The MAN with the shotgun GLARES at Ethan.

                                 GUN DEALER
                        <Throw it!>

           The Young Boy swallows hard. Takes the ball from the Dog. And 
           throws it into the yard. 
           The Dog BOUNDS off. The Dealer sights the AK-47. FIRES a 
           BURST. Misses the dog by a wide margin. 

           The Dog returns and drops the ball at the Boy’s feet, his 
           tail wagging.

           The DEALER MUMBLES angrily as he fiddles with the gun sight.

                                 DEALER
                        <Again. But farther.>

           The Boy looks horrified. Reluctantly picks up the ball. 
           Throws it as far as he can. 

           The DOG sprints off. The Dealer sights the gun again. But 
           this time, he waits... Waits until the Dog has the ball and 
           is heading back...

           The Boy looks at Park and Ethan with an open mouth as if to 
           say, “Not fair.”

           The Dog gets CLOSER. It’s almost on top of them when the 
           DEALER finally pulls the trigger-- CLICK-CLICK. Jammed.

           Again the Dog drops the ball. Tail wagging. Pissed, the 
           Dealer unjams the GUN. He snatches the ball from the Boy, 
           pushes him out of the way and rolls the ball not ten feet in 
           front of him. 

           He POINTS the gun at the DOG as it trots out to the ball. The 
           Boy looks away. 

                                 ETHAN
                        We need something a little less... 
                        Obvious.

           The Dealer lowers the Gun. The Boy lets out a deep breath.

                                 DEALER
                        I have the thing.

           The Dealer pulls a canvas bag from the box. He pulls out two 
           old handguns:

                                 DEALER (CONT’D)
                        From the Korea War. This one for 
                        the south. 

           The Dealer holds out an American M1911...

                                 DEALER (CONT’D)
                        And for the North. 

           ... and a nasty looking Russian TT-30.
           Ethan slides the rack and checks the chamber on each of the 
           guns. The Dealer hands him a single bullet. 

           Ethan sights something out in the yard. Pulls the trigger. 
           Gunshot CRACKS across the yard.

           A DIRTY BEER BOTTLE thirty yards away explodes.

           EXT. JONGNO SAM-GA NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Park’s car parked on the same hill overlooking the dark 
           neighborhood below...

           EXT. SOOT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Ethan and Park approach the FAT GUARD. Before the Fat Guard 
           can stand, Ethan has a gun pressed against his forehead.

           INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           FIFTEEN RUSSIAN AND KOREAN THUGS clog one end of the tunnel. 
           They all carry some kind of weapon (hammers, knives, pipes, 
           etc...) but none of them move. 

           We then see that they’re facing Park and Ethan. Both holding 
           guns at their side. 

           ONE THUG steps up and starts CURSING and POINTING at Ethan. 
           Ethan raises his gun and SHOOTS. BOOM! The Thug goes down. 

           The others look at each other, then start dropping their 
           weapons. Park pulls his cell phone. 

           EXT. SOOT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Park leads two other SQUAD CARS to the front of the 
           building...

           INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Chang leads THREE UNIFORMED COPS through the tunnel. All of 
           them look like they’ve stepped onto Mars.

           INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Chang and the Cops stand over looking the drug operation, 
           including HELLO KITTY and a few OTHER GIRLS in clear plastic 
           outfits. 

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - LATER

           Chang enters the bullpen. Several UNIFORM COPS lead HELLO 
           KITTY and few of the other GIRLS (now all dressed) into the 
           bullpen area for processing. 
           All work stops. All eyes follow Chang back to his desk. 
           Inspector Ho gets up and follows him. 

                                 HO
                        <What are you doing?>

                                 CHANG
                        <My job.>

           Chang pulls a few forms from a drawer and heads off.

           INT. VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

           Ethan and Park walk through the rows of machines to a back 
           door. Inside, is the FAT MANAGER eating from a Styrofoam 
           container. 

           Ethan takes the gun and sticks it into his temple as Park 
           makes demands in Korean. 

           The Fat Manager stands and leads them to a wall safe that he 
           opens revealing cash. 

           INT. VIDEO ARCADE - LATER

           Chang leads a COUPLE DIFFERENT UNIFORMS into the back room. 
           The Fat Teller is sprawled out on the floor, unconscious, 
           surrounded by the cash. 

           EXT. DIAMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Rows of brightly lit jewelry stores. Through the glass we see 
           TWO JOPOK in suits taking a collection envelope from the 
           owner. 

           We FOLLOW them as they get to their CAR, parked out front. 
           They pop the trunk and toss the envelop in. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The JOPOK CAR comes down the street when suddenly Park’s car 
           reverses out of an alley and blocks their way.  

           The Jopok react as Ethan gets out with his gun on them. One 
           of them produces a HANDGUN and starts shooting.

           Ethan and Park absolutely annihilate the JOPOK CAR with 
           bullets. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Now a crime scene. A COP wraps yellow crime scene tape around 
           the bullet riddled Jopok Car. The two JOPOK lie dead inside. 
           Chang arrives and ducks under the tape. He opens the trunk of 
           the car, revealing dozens if not hundreds of small envelopes. 
           Chang opens one-- Cash. All extortion money. 

           INT. MOON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Moon and his men watch the NEWS. Another ANCHOR. Another 
           story about a bust...

           INT. PRESIDENT YUNE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           President Yune watching the NEWS. Another ANCHOR. Another 
           story about a bust...

           INT. FOOD TENT - NIGHT

           Ethan and Park sit eating in a food tent. On the COOK’s SMALL 
           TV, the NEWS. Another story about a bust... 

           EXT. RIVER SIDE PARK - NIGHT

           Chang sits on a bench looking at the city image mirrored off 
           the Han River. Ethan and Park approach out of the dark.

                                 ETHAN
                        There he is. How’s it feel, killer?

           Chang can’t help but smile. 

                                 CHANG
                        I was wondering if you would come. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I think we got their attention. 
                        We’re going to reach out now. See 
                        if the other Presidents are ready 
                        to give up Moon.

                                 CHANG
                        Yes. Where should I be?

           Ethan and Park exchange a look. 

                                 ETHAN
                        No, Inspector. We won’t need you 
                        for that part.

           It dawns on Chang what they’re both after.

                                 CHANG
                        Ethan... You are police. You have a 
                        duty--
                                 ETHAN
                        To what? Arrest him? 

                                 CHANG
                        You are a good detective, Ethan--

                                 ETHAN
                        No. I’m not. And even if I were, it 
                        wouldn’t be enough. I know guys 
                        like Moon. Arresting them isn’t 
                        enough. 

                                 CHANG
                        So killing him will make it better?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.

                                 CHANG
                        For everyone or just for you?

           Ethan shakes his head, not listening. Starts to walk off.

                                 ETHAN
                        Go home, Inspector.

                                 CHANG
                             (forceful)
                        I cannot allow it. 

           Ethan stops and turns to Chang. Sees Chang’s unwavering look.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not asking your permission.

           Chang’s eyes move from Ethan’s to Park, where he sees the 
           same resolute determination. Ethan and Park head off. Chang 
           stands alone, looking out at the dark water.

           INT. PARK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Park drives in silence. Ethan stares out at the crowded city 
           streets. They roll past a busy intersection. Ethan sees 
           VINCENT, head bloodied, standing among the CROWD waiting to 
           cross the street.

           Ethan turns away, back to the front window... 

           INT. SKANKY ROOM SALON - NIGHT

           Low end room salon. GIRLS in heavy make-up, dressed scantily 
           in cheap negligees. Ki-Yun sits on a couch, drunk, propped up 
           between two girls...  
           EXT. SKANKY ROOM SALON - LATER

           Ki-Yun exits the room salon alone. He staggers a little to 
           his car, fumbling with his car keys. 

           He managers to UNLOCK THE CAR with the remote and pop open 
           the TRUNK. He suddenly spins, whipping a large KNIFE around 
           like he was totally sober--

           ETHAN stands behind him. Park steps out of the shadow with 
           his gun pointed at Ki-Yun’s head. Ki-Yun drops the knife.

                                 ETHAN
                        Everyday you protect Moon is going 
                        to cost you. Tell your bosses they 
                        can end this if they just give us 
                        Moon.

           Park lowers his gun as he and Ethan head off. 

           INT. CHANG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A BACH CONCERTO from a CD player. Chang sits on his couch, 
           staring at the photo of his dead wife. Papers are scattered 
           on the coffee table in front of him.

           Chang’s eyes roam down to the FAXED PHOTO of Ethan. Then to a 
           FAXED PHOTO of VINCENT’S BODY at the crime scene.  You can 
           see the conflict boiling inside of him... 

           INT. MOON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Moon sits smoking a cigarette, looking at the ripped out ad 
           for “SKY VILLAGE.” 

           Moon’s CELL RINGS. His eyes don’t leave the ad as he answers.

                                 MOON
                        <Yes... I understand... Yes... I 
                        will be there. Thank you.>

           Moon hangs up, face registering some kind of deep 
           disappointment. 

           He hen takes another long look at the ad, then stands, 
           letting it flutter to the ground. 

           EXT. NANSAM TOWER / PARKING LOT - DUSK

           White spire of the tower arches up over the city. Ethan and 
           Park sit on the car in peaceful silence, overlooking Seoul. 
           From this point, the city is beautiful. Sprawling. Majestic. 
           The calm before the storm.
                                 ETHAN
                        That woman. In the garden.

                                 PARK
                        President Shin’s wife. 

                                 ETHAN
                        She blames you. 

                                 PARK
                             (uncomfortable)
                        You would not understand. 

                                 ETHAN
                        For once, I think I do.

           Another quiet moment. Then, a BLACK CAR pulls into the lot. 
           It circles them once before stopping. Ki-Yun gets out. 

                                 KI-YUN
                        There will be a dinner in an hour 
                        between President Yune and Moon. At 
                        exactly 10:15, he will be riding 
                        the elevator down back to his car. 
                        That is the only time he will be 
                        alone and unprotected.

                                 ETHAN
                        What about out front?

                                 KI-YUN
                        Our men will be in the parking lot. 
                        They will cover Moon’s men and 
                        allow you to pass. 

           Ethan and Park nod. 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                             (to Ethan)
                        Then you leave and never come back.

           Ki-Yun hands Ethan a folded piece of paper. He turns to Park. 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        <And you will work for us.> 
                             (back to English)
                        You don’t know how dangerous you’ve 
                        made him. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why’s that? 
                                 KI-YUN
                        The girl. You took her away from 
                        him. 

           He wastes a second with one last look at Ethan and Park and 
           shakes his head before climbing back into his car.

           Ethan opens the slip of paper. An address written in English.

           EXT. NAMSAM TOWER / ROADWAY - DUSK

           Ethan and Park get in the car and pull out of the parking 
           lot, winding down the mountain road. 

           INT. CHANG’S CAR - SAME

           Chang sits in his parked car. Park and Ethan pass him in 
           their car, oblivious. He waits until they’re a respectable 
           distance away before following. 

           EXT. OLYMPIC BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Park’s car moves along traffic over the River. Chang follows 
           without drawing attention to himself.

           EXT. RED ONYX RESTAURANT / PARKING LOT- NIGHT

           MOON’s car pulls into the driveway. A VALET opens the rear 
           door and bows as Moon steps out. 

           YUNE’S MEN stand vigil around a few cars on one side of the 
           parking lot. They watch as Moon’s Men take a position on the 
           other side of the lot. 

           INT. RED ONYX RESTAURANT / ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Moon rides the elevator up. He looks at himself in the 
           reflection of the door. Expression on his face says that he’s 
           finally getting what he’s deserved.

           INT. CHANG’S CAR - SAME

           Chang pulls his car around a side street, across from the Red 
           Onyx. Chang strips off his coat and tugs on a KEVLAR VEST. A 
           MOSBERG SHOTGUN lies on the seat next to him.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Park’s car positioned across the street from the restaurant. 
           He and Ethan sit inside, waiting... 

           INT. RED ONYX RESTAURANT / HOSTESS TABLE

           The HOSTESS bows deeply to Moon as he steps off the elevator. 
                                 HOSTESS
                        <President Moon. It is our honor to 
                        have you as a guest.>

           Moon nods at her in a dismissive way. Fitting for a man of 
           his standing. She leads Moon down...

           A LONG HALLWAY

           Moon follows the Hostess. His Men peel off and take positions 
           along points in the hall. 

           The Hostess stops at a RICE PAPER SCREEN DOOR. She goes to 
           open it, but Moon stops her. He takes a little fidgety 
           moment, straightening his tie and shooting his cuffs out. He 
           then nods to the Hostess.

           She pulls open the screen. 

           INSIDE

           A large, low table covered with elaborately prepared and 
           presented Korean dishes. PRESIDENT YUNE rises and bows as 
           Moon enters. He motions to a chair across from him. Ki-Yun 
           sits behind them in a chair by the far wall. 

           EXT. PARK’S CAR - LATER

           Park stares at the parking lot. Ethan checks his watch. 

                                 ETHAN
                        We go in three minutes.

           Ethan checks the old M1911 in his hands and slides the rack. 
           It SNAPS back with a CLICK like new. 

           INT. CHANG’S CAR - SAME

           Chang shifts in his seat impatiently, still clutching the 
           SHOTGUN. He realizes he’s been squeezing the stock too hard 
           and lessens his grip. 

           INT. RED ONYX - SAME

           Moon calmly eats while President Yune speaks, his dishes 
           already being cleared.

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <Of course, as your business grows, 
                        we will expand your territories.>

           Moon slurps from a bowl of noodles LOUDLY. Rudely.
                                 PRESIDENT YUNE (CONT’D)
                        <Does this not seem satisfactory.>

                                 MOON
                        <No.>

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <What?>

           Moon throws the bowl down on the table. It skitters across, 
           broth splashing on Yune’s shirt. 

           KI-YUN stands from his chair, but Yune raises a hand and 
           stops him. 

                                 MOON
                        <Let’s cut through the bullshit, 
                        eh? The only reason you asked me to 
                        kill Shin in Los Angeles was so 
                        that none of you could be blamed if 
                        I failed. Then it would just be 
                        “crazy Moon.” “Unstable Moon.” The 
                        trouble-maker. The “Little 
                        President.”>

           Moon suddenly SWEEPS all the plates and bowls off the table 
           in front of him. 

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                        <Now, your drugs. The guns. You put 
                        me in charge of them so that if I 
                        were to get caught, it would only 
                        be my head!>

                                 PRESIDENT YUNE
                        <What do you want, Moon? More 
                        money? More territory? You want too 
                        much.>

                                 MOON
                        <No. I wanted very little.>

           Moon suddenly pulls a GUN from his coat and BLOWS the back of 
           Yune’s head off. Moon immediately turns to KI-YUN’s chair, 
           only to find it already empty. 

           Moon pulls a cell phone. 

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                             (into cell)
                        <Kill them all.>
           EXT. RED ONYX PARKING LOT - SAME

           One of MOON’S MEN closes a cell phone and nods. The others 
           quickly pull AUTOMATIC RIFLES from cars. They turn towards 
           YUNE’S MEN and OPEN FIRE. 

           SEVERAL OF YUNE’S MEN are cut down instantly. Others produce 
           guns of their own.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Ethan and Park approach the parking lot. They stop as GUNFIRE 
           ERUPTS. Across the street, MOON’S MEN exchange GUNFIRE with 
           YUNE’S MEN.

           ETHAN and PARK run towards the building, hoping to flank 
           around the shooting, until one of MOON’S MEN spots them-- 
           Ethan shoots him before he can open fire and--

           Within ten seconds, the parking lot becomes a WAR ZONE. A 
           three way cross-fire:  YUNE’S MEN closest to the restaurant 
           vs. MOON’S MEN on the FAR RIGHT SIDE and ETHAN AND PARK ON 
           THE FAR LEFT.

           INT. CHANG’S CAR - SAME

           Chang reacts to the GUNFIRE. He throws open the door and 
           grabs his INHALER. He then drops it back on the seat. He 
           grabs the Mosberg and heads out. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

           ETHAN AND PARK

           Shoot back from behind a car RIDDLED with bullets. Someone 
           from the Presidents’ side opens up with a MP5. Ethan and Park 
           cower as the car is shredded right in front of them! 

                                 ETHAN
                        WE HAVE TO MOVE! 

           Ethan gestures for Park to go right while he goes left. 

           MOON’S MEN 

           Slowly advance on the Presidents’ Men, using parked cars for 
           cover, shooting with wild abandon. One of Moon’s men is cut 
           down by automatic gunfire--

           YUNE’S MEN

           Several already lie dead. ONE kneels down behind a TOWNCAR 
           and reloads a MP5. BULLETS WHIZ OVERHEAD. Then he realizes 
           that one just passed through him. He slumps over.
           PARK

           Moves quickly from car to car, advancing on the restaurant, 
           Crouching, staying low-- He moves around a car to find--

           The BARREL OF A SHOTGUN right on top of his head. Another one 
           MOON’S MEN. A LOUD CLICK-CLACK then-- 

           BOOM! Park sees the man’s HEAD DISINTEGRATE in a bloody mist. 

           Park turns to see CHANG running across the street, covering 
           the parking lot with his Mosberg. 

           ETHAN 

           Moves fast and hard, weaving through the cars-- He flanks a 
           few of the PRESIDENTS’s MEN. They all turn, SHOOTING--

           ETHAN dives to asphalt behind a car. Broken glass rains down 
           on him. He sees shoes and ankles from underneath the car and 
           shoots, blowing holes in shins and feet, dropping the 
           SHOOTERS. Ethan springs up and turns to see--

           CHANG

           Aiming his shotgun at him from down an alley of parked cars. 
           A brief moment between the two-- Chang looks determined. 

           ETHAN

           Makes a choice-- Swings his gun up-- Chang steadies to shoot 
           but then-- ANOTHER MOON THUG steps between. Chang and Ethan 
           shoot simultaneously, killing him.

           CHANG

           Drops to one knee, shotgun still trained, but as the Thug 
           falls, Ethan’s already gone. 

           INT. RED ONYX RESTAURANT - SAME

           MOON cautiously moves out of the room. He slowly moves down 
           the hall, gun trained. Suddenly--

           KI-YUN comes crashing through another rice paper screen door 
           and TACKLES Moon. Moon’s gun CLATTERS away. 

           Ki-Yun recovers first. And KICKS Moon hard in ribs while he’s 
           down. Moon spits up blood but struggles to get to his feet. 

           Ki-Yun looks at Moon like a beetle trying to flip back 
           upright. As Moon gains his balance, Ki-Yun CRACKS him across 
           the face with a vicious punch. 
           Moon spits some teeth. But manages to pull himself up. He 
           slowly backs up as Ki-Yun pulls a KNIFE from his pocket. He 
           unfolds it... 

                                 KI-YUN
                        <All that time in America...>

           Moon is cornered. No place left to go. 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        <It must have clouded your brain. 
                        You could have risen above all of 
                        them.>

           There’s genuine disgust and astonishment on his face... 

                                 KI-YUN (CONT’D)
                        <But you threw it away... For a 
                        whore?>

           Ki-Yun stabs at Moon’s neck. Moon puts his hand up. The KNIFE 
           SLICES straight through. But is stuck there. Moon SWALLOWS 
           THE PAIN, but now he has Ki-Yun off-balance--

           Moon SLAMS Ki-Yun across the face with an elbow. Cracking his 
           jaw. AS Ki-Yun falls, Moon starts kicking him in the head-- 
           THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! Moon doesn’t stop until he’s 
           caved in Ki-Yun’s head. 

           HALLWAY

           Moon stumbles into the hall. Examines the knife in his hand. 

           PING! The ELEVATOR OPENS at the end of the hall, revealing 
           ETHAN AND PARK. Ethan raises his gun.

           SHOTS EXPLODE OVER HIS HEAD as Moon dives into--

           ANOTHER PRIVATE ROOM

           Moon frantically searches for his gun, checking under 
           chairs... He FINDS IT!  He also finds the HOSTESS, huddled 
           under the table. She stifles a SCREAM as Moon YANKS the knife 
           out of his hand.

           EXT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Ethan and Park moves cautiously forward into the hall. 

           MOON steps out of the room with the trembling HOSTESS in 
           front of him, the gun pressed against her neck. No need for 
           verbal threats.
           Park looks at Ethan. Starts to lower his gun, figuring that’s 
           what a cop would do. 

                                 ETHAN
                        No... 

           Moon cocks his head at Ethan, a little surprised. The HOSTESS 
           SHAKES, gulping in air. 

           Suddenly, BOOM!  Moon takes a shot at Park, hitting him in 
           the shoulder. As Park falls--

           BOOM! ETHAN shoots at MOON.

           Moon’s eyes go wide as the bullet RIPS into his ear lobe, 
           disintegrating it. 

           THE HOSTESS SCREAMS-- Moon shoves her forward at Ethan and 
           runs out the Emergency Door.

           Ethan looks down at Park, who motions for him to go.

           INT. RED ONYX / STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan bounds down the stairs, taking them two and three at a 
           time. From below, MOON takes a few wild shots, coming close 
           to Ethan’s head. 

           INT. RED ONYX RESTAURANT - SAME

           Chang enters from the elevator with his shotgun trained. The 
           HOSTESS lies in the hall, SHAKING and CRYING. Park is gone.

                                 CHANG
                        <Are you hurt?>

           The Hostess shakes her head, then points behind her.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Moon burst out of a back door amidst neatly aligned luxury 
           cars. A few VALETS run away from Moon, looking like a mad-man 
           with his blood soaked shirt and gun.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Moon runs past the boutique designer stores. Shoving his way 
           through the COSMOPOLITAN CROWD.

           Ethan emerges from up the street. Follows in the wake of 
           Moon’s commotion.
           EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

           Moon, breathing hard, turns off the main drag, onto a 
           smaller, darker street lined with older buildings. Like he’s 
           stepped down a level in social status. 

           He jerks his head towards the sound of POLICE SIRENS and RED 
           AND BLUE LIGHTS flashing up ahead. 

           Moon turns to a fence surrounding a construction site. Moon 
           starts to climb.

           INT. RED ONYX / STAIRWELL - SAME

           Chang cautiously moves down the stairs with his shotgun 
           trained. His breathing is shallow. Erratic. Chang takes a 
           moment to rest, trying to steady his breathing... But he 
           continues on.

           EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

           Ethan sprints down the street. Comes to the construction site 
           and sees a SMEAR OF BLOOD on the fence. He leaps onto the 
           fence and climbs it.

           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           The skeletal husk, steel beams and concrete of a massive high 
           rise. A few bare utility bulbs offer light. Ethan moves 
           through the dark, cautiously.

           BOOM! BOOM! Two shots out of the dark whizz by Ethan’s head. 
           Ethan shoots back blind. A moment later--

           He catches a glimpse of MOON, a dark blur, running through 
           the structure up ahead. Ethan shoots back wildly-- BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Ethan moves out into the surrounding dirt lot. Metal 
           dumpsters and construction equipment litter the lot. Ethan 
           moves around a metal dumpster--

           MOON’S THERE WAITING.

           Ethan reacts on instinct. Both FIRING as fast as possible at 
           each other. Ethan dives back to cover. When he pulls his head 
           around, he sees even bigger spots of MOON’S BLOOD and his 
           empty gun leading up a set of stairs--
           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Ethan moves up the stairs. Beams break up what little light 
           there is. Ethan moves low along the makeshift floor.

           MOON’S VOICE echoes through the building. Impossible to tell 
           where it comes from. 

                                 MOON (O.S.)
                        <We have something in common now. 
                        We have pain. Of losing someone 
                        close to you. But that’s not the 
                        part that hurts. The part that 
                        hurts is knowing... Really knowing, 
                        in here, that it was somehow your 
                        fault.>

           Ethan cautiously moves around a pile of a 1/2” METAL PIPING. 
           Suddenly, a WHIPPING NOISE--

           Ethan turns and CRACK! Catches a length of wood 2x4 across 
           the face. He crumbles, gun SKITTERING across the floor.

           Moon emerges from the shadows. Drops the 2x4 as he moves over 
           Ethan, stunned on the ground. 

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                             (Moon looks down at Ethan)
                        <I know you don’t know what I’m 
                        saying, but I feel like you 
                        understand.>

           Ethan looks up at Moon’s searching eyes. There’s something 
           unnerving in them. Not unlike Ethan’s.

                                 MOON (CONT’D)
                        <If we were normal people, maybe we 
                        would shake. Say, “Sorry.” Then go 
                        our separate ways. But we’re not 
                        normal. No matter how hard we work 
                        or try, we will never have normal 
                        lives. No matter how much we want 
                        them.>

           BOOM! A shot echoes across the site, exploding a bare light 
           bulb above Moon. 

           PARK appears at the edge of the stairwell, gun in hand. 

           MOON recedes back into the shadows. Momentarily disappearing. 

           ETHAN tries to get his bearings. Struggles to his feet.
                                 PARK
                        Ethan? 

           MOON appears, holding ETHAN’S GUN. Fires at Park, standing in 
           the wide open. Suddenly, there’s a sickening WHUMP NOISE...

           Moon looks down to see a long length of 1/2” METAL PIPE 
           skewered into his torso. His eyes follow the pipe up to--

           ETHAN holding the other end, almost like a spear. For a 
           moment, Ethan and Moon share a look... Something almost 
           familiar in each other’s eyes. 

           Moon then swings the GUN around towards Ethan. At the same 
           time, Ethan uses the pipe to push Moon off the edge of the 
           floor. Moon FIRES wildly as he falls, landing two stories 
           down with a dull THUD. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan and Park approach Moon’s body. His leg twisted at a 
           sick angle. Moon’s eyes slowly open. Focus on Ethan and Park, 
           then past them... 

           Moon’s mouth opens, his bloody lips curling into a huge smile 
           as he starts to LAUGH. Hysterically. He chokes out a few last 
           words in KOREAN, then his breath gives out he dies with a 
           sick smile.

           Ethan and Park stand over Moon’s body. No sign of pride, 
           relief or joy... Instead, they hover over the body like rock-
           throwing school boys who actually hit the bird.

                                 ETHAN
                        What did he say?

                                 PARK
                        He said, “I’m home.”

           Neither understands, but as they stand in silence over Moon’s 
           body, we PAN UP, revealing a HUGE SIGN: A computer generated 
           image of a modern luxury tower. Words in English and Korean: 

                                       SUN VILLAGE 
                                    LUXURY APARTMENTS

           WAILING POLICE SIRENS grow closer...

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

           A BOOM ECHOES across the dirt lot. 
           CHANG PUMPS his shotgun and BLOWS the hinges off a fence 
           door. He leads a small cavalry of SMPA OFFICERS across the 
           dirt lot. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

           Ethan and Park watch from a hilltop street overlooking the 
           construction site, now overrun with POLICE.  

                                 PARK
                        What now? 

           A long, long beat. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What else? We go home.

           Park nods, as if “home” has a meaning. The two don’t move, 
           just stand watching the frenzied activity below.  

           INT. SMPA / BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Chang, carrying his shotgun, enters the bullpen. The whole 
           room goes quiet. Chang self-consciously walks back towards 
           his desk, COPS bow respectfully as he passes. 

           Chang slows when he sees his desk, back in line with the 
           others. Chang takes a seat. He takes a moment to think, then 
           picks up his phone and DIALS.

                                 CHANG
                        I am looking for Sergeant Brody, 
                        please...

           EXT. SEOUL STREET - NIGHT

           Neon on buildings turning night to day. PEOPLE, walking, 
           shopping, laughing... 

           PARK stands on a street corner, watching the scene like 
           someone with nowhere to be.

           He then turns and starts across the street. A TRAFFIC COP 
           YELLS at him for walking against the light. 

           Park holds up his hands in mock surrender, then walks off the 
           other way, dissolving into the thick crowd of PEOPLE...

           INT. PARKER CENTER / HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

           We follow SGT. BRODY as he makes his way from the elevator 
           bank down the hall carrying a metal coffee mug.
           INT. BRODY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Brody enters turns on the lights. Startled to see ETHAN 
           sitting on one of the chairs. Ethan’s suitcase lies on the 
           ground next to him. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Get out your tape recorder. I’m 
                        going to tell you what happened on 
                        that roof. 

                                 BRODY
                        I know what happened. On that roof. 
                        And in Korea. Inspector Chang 
                        called. 

           Ethan nods. Resolved to his fate. He pulls his badge and 
           flips it to Brody.

                                 BRODY (CONT’D)
                        He said you were instrumental in 
                        bagging Moon. I told you before, I 
                        don’t give a shit about guys like 
                        Baka. Or Moon. I just don’t like 
                        seeing good cops go bad. 

           Brody holds the badge out back to Ethan. Ethan looks down at 
           it, then to Brody.

                                 ETHAN
                        Too late. 

           Ethan turns and heads out. 

           EXT. PARKER CENTER - MORNING

           Ethan sets out into the glorious Southern California sun. 
           Turns and heads down the street, never once looking back at 
           the building, dissolving into the thick crowd of MORNING 
           PEDESTRIANS. In the crowd, Ethan catches a glimpse of 
           VINCENT, wounds and blood gone. It’s just a fleeting glimpse, 
           before Ethan turns and continues down the street.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
