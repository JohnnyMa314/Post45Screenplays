           FADE IN:

           EXT. COASTAL CITY - DAY

           A cheesy 80s song like “Controversy” by Prince PLAYS as we 
           skim across the sea toward the beachfront hotels of a major 
           city. Miami? Honolulu? Monte Carlo?

           Then TWO ISRAELI F-16S THUNDER PAST, rattling the camera. The 
           jets bank over the city, dropping bombs. Paradise explodes. 

           SUPER: BEIRUT, LEBANON - 1985

           Welcome to Beirut. Once a thriving tourist destination, it’s 
           now a civil war-torn hell. Entire city blocks have been 
           reduced to rubble. Columns of smoke rise from the ruins.

           EXT. TARMAC, BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           TWO CIA GUYS, both in their 20s, stroll across the tarmac 
           carrying AK-47s as casually as some men carry briefcases.

                                 JOSH 
                        If you could be any character in 
                        “Star Wars,” who would it be?

                                 TOBY 
                        Han Solo, of course. Duh.

                                 JOSH
                        What? No way. I’m the pilot.

                                 TOBY
                        Dude, I already called it. You 
                        gotta be somebody else. Be Luke.

           The first one is wearing the classic spook uniform: short-
           sleeved dress shirt, sans tie, and aviator sunglasses. This 
           is JOSH MCKENNA. Despite his clean-cut appearance, Josh has 
           the flexible morals necessary to be a great spy.

           The other man is TOBY KOHLER, an ex-Marine who did two tours 
           in ‘Nam. He wears a “Rock’n with Dokken” T-shirt, camouflage 
           pants, and Ray Ban Wayfarers.

                                 JOSH 
                        Luke sucks. You be Luke.

                                 TOBY
                        Dude, you’re a brainiac. You speak 
                        like five languages. Be C-3PO.

           They walk up to a twin-engine Cessna where TWO GUYS are 
           loading a stack of crates into the back. 
           Josh and Toby climb in the cockpit as the loaders finish up.

           INT. CESSNA - CONTINUOUS

           While Josh powers up the engines, Toby turns on a boom box 
           and “Controversy” continues to PLAY. Josh taxis down the 
           runway toward a wall of bombed-out high-rises.

                                 TOBY 
                        I think you’re going the wrong way.

                                 JOSH 
                        Hang on, Chewie. We’re about to 
                        make the jump to light speed. 

           Josh jams the throttle forward. The Cessna races down the 
           runway. They’re never going to clear the buildings.

                                 TOBY
                        Dude, quit fucking around!

           Josh finally yanks back on the wheel, and the plane lifts off 
           in a steep climb. Josh banks the plane hard and the two men 
           SCREAM as they slip between the buildings SIDEWAYS.

           INT. BOMBED-OUT BUILDING - DAY

           TWO GUERILLAS track the Cessna with Strella shoulder-fired 
           missiles. As the plane BUZZES past, the guerillas FIRE.

           INT. CESSNA - FLYING OVER BEIRUT - DAY

           As the plane skims over the rooftops, Toby spots the 
           missile’s contrails CLOSING IN on them.

                                 TOBY 
                        Shit! SAMS! Four o’clock!

                                 JOSH
                        Hang on!

           Josh puts the Cessna in a hard turn. The first missile 
           STREAKS BY. The second SLAMS into the port engine and 
           EXPLODES. The wing disintegrates in a streak of fire.

           They’re losing altitude, fast. Josh struggles to steer them 
           toward an empty street. The remaining wing clips a telephone 
           pole and is SHEARED OFF. The fuselage hits the ground hard. 
           It skids down the street throwing up sheets of SPARKS.

           They’re speeding straight toward a burned-out tank sitting in 
           the middle of the road. Josh and Toby SCREAM.
           WHAM! The plane crumples and the crates in the back slam into 
           the bulkhead, EXPLODING in a CLOUD OF WHITE DUST.

           Coughing, Josh and Toby stumble out of the wreckage, COVERED 
           HEAD-TO-TOE IN WHITE POWDER. 

                                 JOSH
                        What is this shit?

                                 TOBY
                        You look like Casper the Ghost.

           Dozens of duct-taped packages are strewn along the ground. 
           Josh picks one up and examines it. It’s obviously cocaine. 
           Josh and Toby exchange an “oh shit” look and we FREEZE FRAME 
           on their powdered-white faces.

                                 JOSH (O.S.) 
                        I knew when I joined the CIA I was 
                        signing up to do America’s dirty 
                        work, but I had no idea how dirty 
                        it would get. 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. YALE UNIVERSITY - DAY

           It’s graduation. A distinguished-looking speaker delivers the 
           commencement address to a sea of students in caps and gowns.

           SUPER: THREE YEARS EARLIER

           INT./EXT. BELFRY, HARKNESS TOWER - DAY

           Josh sits in the belfry of the Gothic tower, smoking a joint. 
           He’s a whole lot softer than the guy we just saw in the plane 
           crash. He takes a deep drag off the joint, and holds it in.

           A man in a CHEAP SUIT, 40s, comes huffing up the steps. He 
           reaches the belfry and leans against the wall, sucking wind.

                                 CHEAP SUIT 
                        Josh McKenna? 

                                 JOSH
                        I’ve already been expelled and 
                        denied my degree. There’s nothing 
                        else you can do to me, so fuck off.

           Cheap Suit flops down next to him, trying to catch his 
           breath. He pulls out a note pad and flips it open. 
                                 CHEAP SUIT 
                        Let me see if I got my facts 
                        straight: your mother died when you 
                        were 6. Your father works for 
                        Chevron and raised you in Saudi 
                        Arabia, where you still have 
                        friends in the House of Saud. You 
                        speak fluent Arabic, and have a 
                        Class 2 pilot’s license.

                                 JOSH
                        What are you? Some kind of cop?

           Josh takes another hit, then offers the joint to Cheap Suit.

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        I’m with the Central Intelligence 
                        Agency. 

           Josh COUGHS on the smoke, LAUGHING.

                                 JOSH
                        Get the fuck out of here!

           Cheap Suit opens his briefcase and hands over several 
           editions of the Yale Herald. We glimpse a few headlines: 
           SCANDAL: STUDENT ELECTION RIGGED; ELECTION THIEF EXPELLED.

                                 CHEAP SUIT 
                        Stealing that student election was 
                        sneaky, underhanded, devious, and 
                        we loved it. We want you to join 
                        the agency.

           Josh looks at him. This guy is serious. Holy shit.

                                 JOSH
                        But I got caught.

                                 CHEAP SUIT 
                        We don’t want you to rig elections, 
                        we want to send you back to the 
                        Middle East. We just had 50 
                        Americans held hostage in Iran for 
                        over a year. Those bastards kicked 
                        us in the nuts, and the worst part 
                        is we didn’t see it coming until 
                        the fanatics were climbing the 
                        walls. You know why? Because 
                        President Peanuts gutted the 
                        agency. We didn’t even have one guy 
                        over there who could speak Arabic.
           During this speech Josh has filled a balloon with water from 
           a bottle. He ties the end of the balloon off.

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, Iranians are Persian, 
                        they speak Farsi, not Arabic. 
                           (to crowd below)
                        Bombs away, assholes.

           Josh drops the water balloon on the crowd below, LAUGHING.

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        See? You know this stuff. So what 
                        do you say, Josh? Can your country 
                        count on you?

           Off Josh’s stoned expression we CUT TO:

           MONTAGE

           A flurry of images zips by: Cabbage Patch dolls, break-
           dancing, Nancy Reagan says “Just say no,” leg-warmers, 
           Flashdance, “gag me with a spoon,” Return of the Jedi, 
           Michael Jackson’s Thriller, Magnum PI. 

           We end on a shot of Josh and a bunch of other recruits being 
           sworn in at CIA headquarters in Langley.

           SUPER: 1983

           EXT. GLEN COVE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Josh whips into the parking lot in a Porsche 911 convertible, 
           BLASTING Judas Priest’s “Breaking the Law.” He cuts off a 
           giant Cadillac, and SCREECHES into a parking space. He gets 
           out of the car carrying an open Heineken and a gym bag.

           EXT. TENNIS COURT, GLEN COVE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Josh and his dad, DONALD, play a heated match. Both men are 
           soaked with sweat. They talk between volleys, panting.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s the second graduation you’ve 
                        missed in the last year.

           Josh lunges across the court for the ball, but misses.

                                 DONALD
                        Game point. So you finished your 
                        training and now you’re all gung-ho 
                        to go overthrow some Third World 
                        governments, train some death 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        squads in Central America. I’m real 
                        proud of you.

           Donald’s an overbearing Ivy League WASP with a taste for 
           yachts and exotic cars. He’s also the superior player. 

                                 JOSH
                        Give me a break. It’s not like 
                        that. I’m going to be on the front 
                        lines of American foreign policy-

           Donald serves. Josh runs for it, returns. They go back and 
           forth for a minute, then Donald scores and wins. Josh CURSES.

                                 DONALD
                        Looking a little ragged there, 
                        kiddo.

           The two men towel off and gather up their stuff.

                                 DONALD
                        I talked to Dan in New York this 
                        morning. I cashed in some chits, 
                        and got him to up the offer. We’re 
                        willing to pay you triple what the 
                        CIA is. That’s serious money for-

                                 JOSH
                        We’ve been over this a thousand 
                        times. I hate the oil business. I’m 
                        not interested.

           Donald’s not used to being rejected out of hand. He EXPLODES.

                                 DONALD
                        You just don’t want to grow up! 
                        This is another one of your half-
                        assed adventures. Like the time you 
                        dropped out of school to wander the 
                        desert with the Goddamn bedouins-

                                 JOSH
                        It was an independent study 
                        project! I’m not doing this again. 
                        I just came to say goodbye. I’m 
                        shipping out tomorrow.

           Donald is taken aback.

                                 DONALD
                        Tomorrow? Where?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s classified.
                                 DONALD
                        Knock off the top secret bullshit. 
                        I’m your father Goddammit.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m going to Lebanon. To Beirut.

                                 DONALD
                        Jesus Christ! Do you have any idea 
                        what the hell’s going on over 
                        there? Sabra and Chatila? A 
                        thousand Palestinian refugees just 
                        got massacred because of us. The 
                        President signs a treaty to protect 
                        those people and two weeks later he 
                        violates it and pulls the Marines 
                        out? It looks like we winked at the 
                        Christians and okayed the attack!

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks, Dad. I just got out of a 
                        six hour briefing, and they forgot 
                        to mention that.

           Josh walks off toward the parking lot. Donald follows.

                                 DONALD
                        You think sending the Marines back 
                        to hand out candy to some Arab kids 
                        is going to fix this? Get real! You 
                        know how the Arab world works.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a civil war, Dad. That means 
                        they shoot at each other, not us.

           Josh shoves his racket and gym bag in the car.

                                 DONALD
                        Okay, bigshot. Fine. But when you 
                        get yourself in trouble, don’t come 
                        calling me to bail you out.

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t worry. I’m done making that 
                        mistake.

           Josh climbs in his car, revs the engine, and PEELS out.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Josh is packing his suitcase. In the background, news footage 
           of the Sabra and Chatila Massacre plays on TV. Dead women and 
           children lie in the streets of a shanty town.
                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Sure, Beirut was the worst shit-
                        hole in the world, but it was my 
                        first assignment and I couldn’t 
                        wait to get there.

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

           US Marines dive behind pallets of gear, DODGING SNIPER FIRE.

           EXT. BEACH, NEAR BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           The entire landing has ground to a halt. GUN SHOTS RING OUT 
           from the bombed-out high-rises overlooking the beach. 

           Josh, lugging two suitcases, hurries after a MARINE CAPTAIN. 

                                 MARINE CAPTAIN
                        Until we root out these snipers, we 
                        can’t unload a damn thing. That 
                        means I’ve got no jeeps, and you’ve 
                        got no ride.

           The Captain moves on, BARKING OUT orders, leaving Josh 
           standing there. Another shot ZIPS BY and he ducks for cover.

           INT./EXT. TAXI, BEIRUT - DAY

           Masked guerillas shoot it out in the streets. Duran Duran’s 
           ”Hungry Like the Wolf” PLAYS on the radio as the driver 
           calmly navigates through the daily violence that is Beirut. 

                                 JOSH
                        Is it always like this?

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        No, no. Usually it’s much worse. 
                        Today is not bad. 

           Josh peeks out the window: An RPG streaks by and BLOWS UP the 
           car in front of them. The cabbie calmly swerves around it.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        Be sure to see the Roman ruins in 
                        Baalbek. Very old. Beautiful.

           Josh looks back. A MAN ON FIRE stumbles from the car.

           EXT. US EMBASSY, BEIRUT - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The cab pulls up and Josh gets out. The Embassy’s an old pink 
           hotel overlooking the Mediterranean. This part of town’s been 
           hit hard by the fighting. Most of the buildings are pock-
           marked with bullet holes, and a few have even collapsed.
           INT. OFFICE, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh sits across from WADE JACKSON, a stern man in his 60s. 
           Throughout the scene, artillery EXPLODES close by, RATTLING 
           the building so hard that dust snows down from the ceiling.

                                 JACKSON
                        Now I spoke to Charlie in Near East 
                        the other day and he was singing 
                        your praises. He thinks you’re the 
                        Second Coming of Lawrence of Arabia 
                        or something.

           SUPER: WADE JACKSON - CIA STATION CHIEF, LEBANON

                                 JOSH
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 JACKSON
                        That’s not what I think, that’s 
                        what Charlie thinks, and if you ask  
                        me Charlie’s dumber than a fence 
                        post. Now. Any questions?

                                 JOSH
                        Is the President’s plan for us to 
                        distance ourselves from the 
                        Christian Phalange?

                                 JACKSON
                        What the hell for? The Christians 
                        are our dog in this fight, and 
                        we’re going to stand by them.

                                 JOSH
                        I thought we were trying to broker 
                        a fair settlement?

                                 JACKSON
                        That’s just what we say on TV. A 
                        fair settlement would be a disaster 
                        for America. We can’t let the 
                        Soviets get a toe in the door.

                                 JOSH
                        The Soviets? I’m sorry, sir. I 
                        don’t follow.

                                 JACKSON 
                        If we allow Lebanon to have a real 
                        democracy, the Muslims will align 
                        themselves with Syria, and Syria’s 
                        a Soviet client state. That’s why 
                        we have to back the Phalange, even 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACKSON  (CONT'D)
                        if they are maniacs. The Cold War’s 
                        a chess game between us and the 
                        Soviets. Lebanon’s a pawn, but an 
                        important one, and we’re not going 
                        to let her go without a fight. 

                                 JOSH
                        What happens when the Muslims 
                        realize we’re just jerking them 
                        around?

                                 JACKSON
                        Who’s asking the questions here? 
                        You or me? You know a lot about the 
                        Arabs, I’ll give you that, but you 
                        don’t know shit about the commies. 
                        These Third World hellholes are 
                        where the Cold War gets fought. A 
                        lot of innocent people get caught 
                        in the middle, but that’s just the 
                        way it is, so don’t go all bleeding 
                        heart on me. The other guys will 
                        help you get up to speed. If you’re 
                        as smart as everyone at Langley 
                        thinks, you’ll have your training 
                        wheels off in no time.

           INT. BULLPEN, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Two men, TOBY and BEAR, lead Josh to his desk. We recognize 
           Toby from the opening plane crash.

                                 TOBY
                        Toby Kohler. Welcome to the Root. 
                           (re: Bear)
                        This homo’s Dalton Ragsdale III.

           With his barrel chest, long hair, scraggly beard, and leather 
           jacket, Bear looks more like a member of the Hell’s Angels 
           than an ex-Navy SEAL. He ends every statement with a ROARING 
           LAUGH, whether it’s funny or not.

                                 BEAR
                        If you ever call me that, I’ll rip 
                        your arm off and beat you with it. 
                        Call me Bear, like the animal.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, Bear it is.

           The three arrive at a desk surrounded by towering stacks of 
           boxes. Josh is a little taken aback.
                                 TOBY
                           (re: boxes)
                        We haven’t had an Arabic speaker 
                        here in years, so we’re a little 
                        behind on the translating.

           Bear pulls some papers out of a box and hands them to Josh.

                                 TOBY
                        Hey, hey. Not so fast.

           Toby hands Josh a note with some Arabic writing on it.

                                 TOBY
                        This is hot intel, straight from 
                        the field. I need it translated 
                        ASAP.

                                 JOSH
                           (reading)
                        Milk, humus, cheese, flour, sugar.

           Bear ROARS with laughter.

                                 BEAR
                           (to Josh)
                        He paid a hundred bucks for that.

                                 TOBY
                        Man, fucking Abdul. I’m going to 
                        kick his scrawny little ass.

           Toby snatches the page away from Josh and storms off.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Small and spartan. Josh tries to watch Johnny Carson, but the 
           artillery fire outside is deafening. An EXPLOSION RATTLES the 
           place so hard it seems it’s going to collapse. Terrified, 
           Josh crawls out of the room on his hands and knees.

           INT. BATHROOM, JOSH’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           A mattress lays across the bathtub, covered with dust and 
           broken plaster. The mattress is shoved aside and Josh emerges 
           from the tub, still half-asleep.

           INT. BULLPEN, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh sits at his desk translating. He’s glassy-eyed and 
           bored. He glances up at the clock. It’s only 2 PM...
           INT. BAR, COMMODORE HOTEL - SUNSET

           Josh walks into the smoky room and scans the crowd.

                                 JOSH (V.O.) 
                        Every city has a place where people 
                        go to buy and sell information. In 
                        Beirut, it was the Commodore Hotel.

           JOSH’S POV: TEXT appears ON SCREEN labelling the crowd: ARMS 
           DEALER, SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE, BBC REPORTER, BOMB MAKER, etc.

           CROWD’S POV: Over Josh’s head the words “AMERICAN SPY” 
           appear. The patrons go back to their drinks, unimpressed.

           The song on the jukebox ends. ABC’s “The Look of Love” comes 
           on as an Arab woman with striking eyes walks in. Her utility 
           vest, cargo pants, and combat boots can’t hide her natural 
           beauty. This is NASEERAH AL-HASSAN. 

           She sits down at the bar and orders a Coke. Josh walks over 
           and takes a seat next to her. She’s examining a zoom lens; 
           the glass is chipped. She notices Josh.

                                 NASEERAH
                        500 dollar lens, ruined. That’s the 
                        second time this week.

           The bartender places a drink in front of her. Josh throws 
           down a five spot.

                                 JOSH
                        Then you won’t mind if I pay for 
                        your drink.
                           (to bartender)
                        Scotch and soda.
                           (to Naseerah)
                        Josh McKenna.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Naseerah Al-Hassan. You’re 
                        American.

                                 JOSH
                        Fresh off the boat.
                           (re: lens)
                        What happened?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Bullet fragment. 

                                 JOSH
                        Close call. You a photojournalist?
                                 NASEERAH
                        No, well, yes. I’m a reporter, but 
                        the photographer I normally work 
                        with got shot last week.

                                 JOSH
                        Really? I’m sorry.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Don’t be. His photos were terrible. 
                           (smiles)
                        Besides, he’ll live. So what brings 
                        you to Beirut?

                                 JOSH
                        The waters.
                           (off her look)
                        It’s a line from “Casablanca.” I 
                        work at the embassy. 

                                 NASEERAH
                        Ahhh, so you’re a spy.

           Josh is caught off guard by her directness. A large, weasely 
           MAN standing nearby overhears this and perks up. This is 
           MANUCHER GHORBANIFAR. We’ll meet him in a minute.

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing that glamorous. Just a 
                        political attaché.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Like I said, a spy.

           She grins mischievously. He LAUGHS and smiles back. She 
           finishes her drink and grabs her things.

                                 NASEERAH
                        It was nice chatting with you, 
                        Josh, but I have to run. Ciao.

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, what are you doing for dinner 
                        tomorrow night?

                                 NASEERAH
                        I don’t know. You trying to bed me 
                        or recruit me?

                                 JOSH
                        You’ll have to have dinner with me 
                        to find out.
           But the flirting is interrupted as Ghorbanifar steps in to 
           introduce himself. Wearing gold chains and a flashy suit, 
           he’s gregarious and friendly. Maybe a little too friendly.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        And I thought I knew everyone in 
                        Beirut. Manucher Ghorbanifar, at 
                        your service.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I’ll let you two get down to 
                        whatever it is you spooks do.
                           (whispering)
                        Be careful: He’s Iranian, but I 
                        hear he’s working for Israel.

                                 JOSH
                        So are you going to have dinner 
                        with me?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Why not? Meet me here tomorrow at 
                        8:00 o’clock.

           Before Josh can respond, Naseerah is gone, and Ghorbanifar 
           has him cornered, invading his personal space.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                           (conspiratorially)
                        I have information which might be 
                        of interest to the Americans. Do 
                        you know anyone with whom I might 
                        speak regarding monetary 
                        compensation for such information?

           INT. OFFICE, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Jackson chews Josh out.

                                 JACKSON
                        A Libyan hit squad is going to 
                        assassinate the President? Give me 
                        a break. Ghorbanifar’s a 
                        professional liar. He been peddling 
                        bogus tips for years, so Langley 
                        put out a burn notice on him. That 
                        means you could be fired just for 
                        talking to him. Comprende? 

           Jackson puts Josh’s report through the shredder.
           INT. BULLPEN, US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           Josh exits Jackson’s office. The whole staff is waiting for 
           him. Bear holds the phone out.

                                 BEAR
                        It’s Ghorbanifar. He says it’s 
                        urgent. Something about the Libyans 
                        and a Doomsday Machine.

           The whole staff cracks up LAUGHING.

                                 JOSH
                        Ha ha, very funny.

           Josh walks over to the kitchenette and pours himself a cup of 
           coffee. Toby and Bear walk over.

                                 TOBY
                        Don’t beat yourself up; he sold me 
                        some bullshit about the PLO blowing 
                        up the Statue of Liberty when I 
                        first got here.

                                 BEAR
                        How’s the translating going?

                                 JOSH
                        It sucks. I’m dying to get out of 
                        here and see some action. 

                                 TOBY
                        We’ve got an op going down. Why 
                        don’t you tag along?

           He holds up a manila folder stamped “Top Secret - Eyes Only.”

           INT. TOBY’S JEEP - TRAVELLING - DAY

           Toby drives Josh and Bear through the rubble-strewn streets.

                                 TOBY 
                        This op is serious. In fact, it’s a 
                        matter of life and death. You think 
                        you’re ready for it?

           Josh nods, and Toby hands him the folder. Inside is an ad 
           featuring 80’s supermodel Paulina Porizkova.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s this?

                                 TOBY
                        Your mission is to get me laid.
                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 BEAR
                        That’s mission impossible!

           Bear ROARS with LAUGHTER.

                                 TOBY
                        Dude, I’ve been trying to score 
                        with these Arab chicks and let me 
                        tell you: they do not put out. I’ve 
                        been wanking to Paulina for months.

           Josh drops the photo.

                                 TOBY
                        You speak Arabic. You have to tell 
                        me what to say. Write love poetry 
                        for me and shit. You know, like 
                        that guy with the big nose.

                                 JOSH
                        Cyrano De Bergerac. 

                                 TOBY
                        The guy with the big nose. You 
                        know, hiding in the bushes?

                                 BEAR
                        Cyrano, you Goddamn redneck!

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not much of a poet.

                                 TOBY
                        I don’t want excuses; I want pussy.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE, EAST BEIRUT - DAY

           An upscale neighborhood with manicured lawns and palm-tree 
           lined boulevards. Only the presence of military checkpoints 
           tells us we’re not in Beverly Hills.

           A tank and a Camaro are parked on the side of the road. A 
           group of men are gathered around the back of the car as the 
           trunk pops open, revealing ten pairs of night-vision goggles. 

                                 SANDERS 
                        Here they are. Better depth 
                        perception, and these don’t give 
                        you the pounding headaches like the 
                        old ones.
           BUCK SANDERS is an ex-commando turned CIA operative. You 
           could drop Sanders anywhere in the world and he’d be running 
           the place in no time.

                                 BASHAR
                        Is this some kind of joke? Where 
                        are the missiles? You said you 
                        could get us Stingers.

           BASHAR KARAM is a macho killer who wears a prominent gold 
           crucifix around his neck. He’s one of the top men in the 
           Christian Phalange, the deadliest militia in Lebanon. FOUR 
           PHALANGE GOONS, armed to the teeth, hover behind him.

                                 SANDERS
                        That was before you went crazy and 
                        slaughtered a bunch of refugees. 
                        You’re on America’s shit list, pal.

           Bashar laughs like it’s all a joke.

                                 BASHAR
                           (to his men)
                        Listen to this guy, what a kidder!
                           (to Sanders)
                        You get us the missiles, we’ll kill 
                        everybody you want. Fadlallah, 
                        Assad, Arafat, you name it. We make 
                        it look like the Jews did it, that 
                        way your ass is covered. Hell, we 
                        go to Cuba and whack The Beard.

                                 SANDERS
                        Do you want the Goddamn goggles or 
                        not? If you don’t, I’ll go down the 
                        street and sell ‘em to the Amal.

                                 BASHAR
                        How much?

                                 SANDERS
                        A thousand bucks each.

           Bashar snaps his fingers and one of his men opens a briefcase 
           full of jewelry. Sanders picks through the baubles while the 
           Phalange goons grab the goggles.

                                 BASHAR
                        What about our other item of 
                        business? Did you think about my 
                        proposal?
                                 SANDERS 
                        I told you: the agency’s out of the 
                        drug business.
                           (slamming the trunk shut)
                        See you around, Bashar.

           ACROSS THE STREET

           Toby, Josh, and Bear pull up and climb out of the jeep.

                                 TOBY
                           (re: Sanders’ car)
                        Check it out: ‘79 Chevy Camaro Z28. 
                        400 cubic inch V-8, dual overhead 
                        cams, Hurst shifter. Sanders won it 
                        from a Columbian drug lord in a 
                        poker game. It’s like the 
                        Millennium Falcon of cars.

           A cheesy desert landscape is airbrushed along the Camaro’s 
           sides. A busty woman, with a pet rattlesnake around her neck 
           and a six-shooter in each hand, adorns the hood. “LA BANDITA” 
           is stenciled below her in a flowery script.

                                 JOSH
                        Isn’t it a little conspicuous?

                                 BEAR
                        He’s non-official cover, posing as 
                        a Texas oil man. It’s all part of 
                        his character.

           Bashar and his crew walk by with the night-vision goggles on, 
           and Toby and Bear do a double-take.

                                 SANDERS
                        You’re late.

                                 TOBY 
                        Are those the new night-vision 
                        goggles? We just got those in.

                                 SANDERS
                        You’re as gullible as those 
                        dipshits. Those are the old ones 
                        that give you the pounding 
                        headaches.

           Sanders, Toby and Bear LAUGH, then Sanders sizes up Josh.

                                 SANDERS
                        Who the fuck is this?
                                 BEAR
                        He’s the new guy.

           Josh sticks out a hand, and Sanders shakes it.

                                 JOSH 
                        Josh McKenna. 

                                 SANDERS
                           (recalling)
                        You’re the kid that rigged that 
                        student election at Harvard.

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, it was Yale.

                                 BEAR
                           (razzing Josh)
                        He’s a great secretary. Types 70 
                        words a minute and makes a mean cup 
                        of coffee. 

                                 TOBY
                           (piling on)
                        When he saw us leaving the office 
                        without him, he practically started 
                        crying. Been here four days and 
                        thinks he’s ready for the streets.

                                 SANDERS
                        Look, I don’t play tour guide, and 
                        I sure the fuck don’t play baby-
                        sitter. You want to work with me, 
                        you better be ready to get your 
                        hands dirty.

           Sanders opens the car door. Josh gets in without any 
           hesitation.

           INT./EXT. SANDERS’ CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           “Legs” by ZZ Top PLAYS on the radio as Sanders drives. Josh 
           rides shotgun; Bear and Toby are crammed in back. 

                                 SANDERS
                        The first thing you have to 
                        understand is there’s rules to this 
                        stuff. Take your little election 
                        stunt for instance. It was clever, 
                        you showed some initiative, but you 
                        fucked up. Big time.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, I got caught.
                                 SANDERS
                        Everybody gets caught at some point 
                        - you confessed. Always deny 
                        everything. That’s rule number one.

                                 JOSH
                        At least I saved three of my 
                        friends from getting expelled.

                                 SANDERS
                        What are you? A Boy Scout? Rule 
                        number two: don’t get attached to 
                        your agents. They get captured, get 
                        killed, and you never know when you 
                        might have to sell one of them out.
                        Forget everything they taught you 
                        in training. You have that stupid 
                        pen, the one with the camera in it?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah. Why?

           Sanders motions for it, and Josh hands it over. Sanders 
           throws it out the window.

                                 SANDERS
                        Forget the James Bond crap. You get 
                        caught with one of those gadgets, 
                        there’s no talking your way out of 
                        it. You’re dead meat. A good spy 
                        only needs his eyes and ears. 
                        That’s rule number three.

                                 TOBY
                        Don’t forget about the press.

                                 SANDERS
                        Oh, right. And never talk to the 
                        press. You go off the reservation, 
                        that’s it. Your career’s over. 
                           (beat)
                        You know who the Druze are?

                                 JOSH
                        They’re a splinter sect of Islam 
                        that broke off from the Ismailis in 
                        the 11th century-

                                 SANDERS
                        I don’t need the entire Goddamn 
                        history of the Middle East. These 
                        guys are one of the toughest 
                        militias in Lebanon, stone killers. 
                        I need to sell ‘em some guns and, 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANDERS (CONT'D)
                        well, let’s just say we’re not on 
                        the best of terms at the moment. 
                        You think you can handle it?

           Josh nods.

                                 SANDERS
                        You ever negotiated with a warlord 
                        before?

                                 JOSH
                        No, but one time I negotiated the 
                        sale of a train of camels at a 
                        bedouin market.

           Sanders LAUGHS.

                                 SANDERS
                        Close enough.

           EXT. BOMBED-OUT PLO BUNKER - DAY

           La Bandita pulls up, and everybody gets out. Josh notices 
           several gunmen lingering around menacingly.

                                 JOSH
                           (re: La Bandita)
                        Is it okay just to leave it here?

                                 SANDERS
                        If anyone fucks with my lady, they 
                        wind up in a dungeon with jumper 
                        cables clamped to their nuts, and 
                        everyone in Beirut knows it.

                                 TOBY
                        He’s kidding.

           Josh looks at Sanders. He doesn’t look like he’s kidding.

           INT. BOMBED-OUT PLO BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

           A TURKISH MAN in a fez AD LIBS hellos with Sanders. This is 
           AZIZ. He pushes aside a shot-up Pac-Man arcade game, 
           revealing a dirt tunnel, and waves them through.

           Sanders, Josh, Toby and Bear stoop through the passage into

           A BOMB SHELTER

           Packed to the ceiling with weapons. The Cyrillic lettering on 
           the crates attests to their Soviet origins.
                                 SANDERS
                        Two days ago the Christian Phalange 
                        picked a fight with the Druze, and 
                        the Druze have been kicking their 
                        asses. We need an excuse to jump 
                        in, and bail the Phalange out. If 
                        we can sell the Druze these 
                        weapons, it’ll look like they’ve 
                        gone commie, and we can say we’re 
                        trying to stop Soviet aggression.

                                 JOSH 
                        Clever plan. Will it work?

                                 SANDERS
                        How do you think we overthrew the 
                        government in Guatemala?

                                 BEAR
                        This is crazy. He’s not ready for 
                        this.

                                 SANDERS
                        Sure he is. Aren’t you, kid?

           Josh nods, trying to seem more confident than he is.

           EXT. APRICOT GROVE - DAY

           A DRUZE GUERILLA tracks a passenger jet with a Strella 
           shoulder-fired missile. He makes a FIRING NOISE, then LAUGHS. 
           Josh CURSES in Arabic and takes the Strella away from him.

           Josh, the Druze Man, and his COMRADES are gathered around the 
           back of an old truck, packed with Abdul’s weapons. Josh 
           resumes heated negotiations with the Druze in Arabic.

           INT. LA BANDITA - DAY

           Sanders, Toby and Bear watch Josh through binoculars while 
           Aziz chain smokes. One of the Druze points a gun at Josh.

                                 TOBY
                        Oh shit, here we go.

           Toby and Bear pull out guns and go for the doors, but Sanders 
           stops them.

                                 SANDERS
                        Hang on a sec.

           Josh YELLS even louder, getting in the gunman’s face. Then 
           the Druze seem to beg forgiveness. Finally, they open a 
           briefcase and show him the contents. Josh acts insulted by 
           the offer and storms off. The Druze follow, pleading.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Josh climbs in the car carrying the briefcase.

                                 SANDERS
                        You get the one fifty?

                                 JOSH
                        No.
                           (grins)
                        I got two hundred.

                                 AZIZ
                        Allah be praised!

           Sanders opens the briefcase and inspects the money.

                                 SANDERS
                        Alright, kid. I’m impressed.

           Sanders hands Josh several packets of bills.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s this?

                                 SANDERS
                        Your cut. And leave it out of your 
                        report. Langley expects us to raise 
                        money for our operations, but they 
                        don’t want a paper trail, you 
                        follow?

           Josh nods. He looks at the money, then pockets it. 

                                 SANDERS
                        You have a Swiss bank account?

                                 JOSH
                        No.

                                 SANDERS
                        You better get one. You’re going to 
                        need it.

           EXT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - SUNSET

           La Bandita pulls up. Sanders is dropping Josh off.

                                 SANDERS
                        That reporter’s a good lead. You 
                        should pitch her. Is she cute?
                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, she’s a babe.

                                 SANDERS
                        Good. You can recruit her and fuck 
                        her.

                                 JOSH
                        Seriously? We can do that?

                                 SANDERS
                        You can shack up with Svetlinka the 
                        KGB She-Wolf if you want. Just make 
                        sure you’re playing her and not the 
                        other way around. 

                                 JOSH
                        What about all that ‘never talk to 
                        the press’ stuff?

                                 SANDERS
                        Never give her anything real, but 
                        you can give her fake stories to 
                        cover up our ops. She’s perfect. 
                        And since she’s already made you, 
                        there’s no need to pussyfoot 
                        around. Go nail this broad.

           INT. LA MER CAFE - NIGHT

           A nice French place. Josh and Naseerah are eating dinner.

                                 NASEERAH
                        ... but the Ambassador’s going to 
                        kill the deal. Then you’re going to 
                        tip me off, I’ll break the story-

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, why am I going to do that?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Because you find me irresistible, 
                        and want to impress me. Then I’ll 
                        break the story, win the Pulitzer 
                        Prize, and go write for the New 
                        York Times.

                                 JOSH 
                        You’re a good reporter, and you 
                        obviously have a lot of 
                        connections. I could use someone 
                        like you. Come work for me. I’ll 
                        give you a thousand bucks a week.
                                 NASEERAH
                        It’s tempting, but I can’t.

                                 JOSH
                        I could get you tips on stories 
                        before they break. Maybe help you 
                        win that Pulitzer Prize.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I know you want to help, but things 
                        are complicated here, and America 
                        doesn’t do complicated very well.

                                 JOSH
                        Try me.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Six months ago my brother Hamad was 
                        visiting friends near the border 
                        when some guerillas fired rockets 
                        into Israel. The Israelis didn’t 
                        know who did it, so they rounded up 
                        all the men in the village, old men 
                        teenagers, everyone, and shipped 
                        them to Israel in violation of 
                        international law. Hamad’s only 16, 
                        but they labelled him a terrorist, 
                        and locked him up without a trial. 
                        I haven’t heard from him since.

                                 JOSH 
                        I’m so sorry.

           EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           Josh and Naseerah stroll down the deserted path. Josh is in 
           the midst of an impassioned speech.

                                 JOSH
                        ...no, seriously. I’m excited. 
                        Washington has good intentions, but 
                        a lot of people just don’t 
                        understand what’s going on here. I 
                        grew up in the Middle East, so I 
                        do. Things are going to get better.

           She chuckles, but is touched by his conviction.

                                 JOSH
                        We’re not supposed to talk about 
                        politics on a first date, are we?
                                 NASEERAH
                        No, but that’s the only thing 
                        people talk about here.

           They stop and look out over the ruins of an amusement park. 
           The skeletal remains of a Ferris wheel looms over them.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I used to come here when I was a 
                        kid. Now look at it.
                           (ruefully)
                        “The Paris of the Mediterranean.”

           Suddenly, GUNFIRE ERUPTS and bullets WHIZ by. Josh shoves 
           Naseerah into a dark alcove as TWO GANGS take up positions at 
           opposite ends of the street. Josh and Naseerah huddle 
           together in the dark, terrified, as the crossfire rips by. 

                                 NASEERAH
                        I don’t think they saw us. 

           As the shooting drags on, they realize just how close they 
           are: he has his arms wrapped around her, she’s clutching his 
           shirt, their faces just inches apart. Then they’re kissing 
           passionately, fueled by adrenaline and lust.

           EXT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY

           Toby and Sanders are trying to order by pointing to things on 
           the menu. Josh and Bear are already sitting at a table, 
           chowing down. The Embassy’s a block away, in the background.

                                 BEAR
                        I think it’s cool you speak Arabic.
                        When I was in ‘Nam, I was the only 
                        guy in my unit who could speak 
                        Vietnamese. It came in pretty 
                        handy. Hell, that’s how I met my 
                        wife. Check it out.

           Bear pulls out his wallet and starts showing Josh pictures of 
           his wife and their four kids, ages 2 to 12.

                                 BEAR
                        That’s Khuyen, my wife. My oldest 
                        girl Lilly. Summer and Ruby. The 
                        little one’s my son, Bear Jr.

                                 JOSH
                        You got a good looking family.

                                 BEAR
                        Thanks, man. Hey, I was wondering 
                        if you’d do me a favor. I bought 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEAR (CONT'D)
                        these tapes on how to speak Arabic 
                        and they fucking suck. Maybe we 
                        could get together a couple nights 
                        a week, and you could help me with 
                        them. I mean, if you have time.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, sure. I’d be happy to.

                                 BEAR
                        Cool. But don’t say anything to the 
                        guys. I want to surprise ‘em. One 
                        day I’m just going to waltz in and 
                        start talking in Arabic like it’s 
                        nothing. They’re going to shit 
                        their pants!

                                 JOSH
                        Our secret.

           Just then Sanders and Toby walk over and sit down.

                                 TOBY
                        Who’s going to shit their pants?

                                 BEAR
                        You are, after I kick your ass, you 
                        little Marine Corps pussy!

           INT. BULLPEN, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh is translating. Toby sits nearby typing a report. Bear 
           and a couple of other guys hurry by. 

                                 BEAR
                        You’re going to miss the fireworks.

           Josh and Toby exchange a look - what fireworks?

           EXT. ROOFTOP, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, Sanders, Bear, Jackson and the other agents stand 
           on the roof watching the battleship USS NEW JERSEY fire her 
           big guns. Explosions rock the hills overlooking the city. 

                                 JACKSON
                        Turns out the Soviets are backing 
                        the Druze. Gave us the perfect 
                        excuse to get in this ball game.

           Sanders winks at Josh. Josh grins.
                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        My first op was a home run. I’d 
                        advanced the President’s agenda, 
                        and influenced our foreign policy. 
                        It had taken me less than a week to 
                        prove my Dad was full of shit. 

           EXT. THE CASBAH - NIGHT

           Josh, Toby and Bear walk down the street. Josh is wearing a T-
           shirt, black floodwater pants, and penny-loafers with white 
           socks, ala Michael Jackson’s 1983 look. 

                                 JOSH
                        Naseerah said a bunch of Amal 
                        guerillas hang out here watching 
                        Michael Jackson videos all day. 
                        Sounds like the perfect place for 
                        us to recruit some agents.

           He pulls a red “Beat It” jacket from a shopping bag, rips the 
           tag off, and pulls it on. Toby looks at him like he has two 
           heads. Bear ROARS with LAUGHTER. Josh pops up the collar.

                                 JOSH
                        Just follow my lead.

           INT. THE CASBAH - NIGHT

           A seedy bar. A bunch of Arabs are watching a guy break-dance 
           when Josh, Toby, and Bear walk in. Someone turns the music 
           off. Silence and angry stares. Some of the guys have AK-47s 
           slung over their shoulders. Josh momentarily loses his nerve.

                                 BEAR
                        Come on, man - say something.

                                 JOSH
                           (in Arabic)
                        Uh... I bet I can out dance anyone 
                        in this room.

           Everyone just stares at them. Toby flashes the peace sign.

                                 TOBY
                        Al salaam alaykum, muchachos!

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           “Sussudio” by Phil Collins PLAYS over:

           - Josh break-dances. He does the moonwalk and some other 
           Michael Jackson moves. He’s good but not great. Toby and Bear 
           CHEER him on.
           - Josh and Naseerah roller-skate under a spinning disco ball. 
           Josh skates backwards in front of her and they kiss.

           - Josh watches as an Arab man in his 30s, FARAZ, break-dances 
           like a pro. His moves are awesome, totally fluid. He finishes 
           his routine with a dramatic HEADSPIN. The Arab crowd CHEERS 
           wildly. Josh shakes his head. He just got schooled. Big time.

           - In a movie theater, Josh and Naseerah watch “An Officer and 
           a Gentleman.”

           - Back at the Casbah, Josh, Toby, and Bear sit in a corner 
           chatting with Faraz. Faraz is wearing the “Beat It” jacket.

           - Josh and Naseerah fall into bed, kissing passionately. Josh 
           peels off his shirt, and Naseerah slithers out of her jeans. 
           Then he’s on top of her and they’re making love.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. MARINE BARRACKS, BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           It’s a hideous concrete building at the end of the airport, 
           guarded by rings of barbed-wire and sandbags.

           The Marines are having a B-B-Q. Some lay in the sun, others 
           play frisbee, volleyball, etc. Sanders is waxing La Bandita. 
           Jackson sits under an umbrella reading a John Le Carre novel.

           Bear rolls up on his Harley-Davidson in full biker gear.

           LATER

           A basketball swishes through a net bolted to the side of the 
           barracks. 

           It’s a game of 3-on-3; Josh, Bear, and BRIAN versus Toby and 
           two of his Marine buddies, GUNNY and RADAR. Everybody’s 
           shirtless and in shorts except Bear, who’s wearing motorcycle 
           boots, jeans, a Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt, and a bandana.

                                 GUNNY
                        Yo Josh, I think your boy Bear’s 
                        about to pass out. You oughta get 
                        him one of them Arab headdresses.

                                 BEAR
                        I drink gasoline and piss fire.

                                 BRIAN
                        Dude, ignore him. He’s psycho.

           Bear pulls up a sleeve, revealing a tattoo of an eagle 
           clutching a trident in its claws.
                                 BEAR 
                        I was a Navy SEAL for ten years. I 
                        did three tours in ‘Nam and was 
                        awarded the Navy Cross. I am 
                        impervious to pain, heat, hunger, 
                        thirst, or any form of discomfort.

                                 BRIAN
                        Like I said, psycho. 

           Bear passes the ball to Josh, who shoots and scores. He and 
           Bear high-five.

           Toby gets the ball. Josh tries to cover him, but he’s all 
           elbows.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, aren’t you playing for the 
                        wrong side?

                                 TOBY
                        The agency’s a job, dude. The Corps 
                        is for life!

           Toby drives forward, shoots, scores. Gunny passes the ball 
           back in. It arcs toward Josh, then EXPLODES in mid-air!

                                 BEAR 
                        SNIPER!

           Everyone scrambles for cover. Josh and Toby hunker down 
           behind a wall of sandbags. Another shot rings out, hitting 
           the keg. A golden stream of beer arcs out onto the ground.

                                 GUNNY
                        Motherfuckers! The beer’s hit!

                                 JOSH
                           (to Toby re: Marines)
                        Why aren’t they shooting back?

                                 TOBY
                        They’re “peacekeepers.” Their 
                        Goddamn guns aren’t even loaded.

                                 JOSH
                        What kind of fucked up rules of 
                        engagement are those?

           Bear holds out a plastic cup and catches the stream of beer. 
           The Marines all SHOUT at him to take cover.

                                 BEAR
                        Relax, I’m bulletproof.
           A shot shatters one of La Bandita’s headlights. Everyone 
           waits to see how Sanders is going to react...

                                 SANDERS
                        Alright, now I’m pissed.

           He pops the Camaro’s trunk and pulls out a Barrett .50 
           caliber sniper rifle with a high-power scope. As he unfolds 
           the bipod, a shot ZINGS off the car, missing him by inches. 
           He doesn’t even flinch. He braces the gun on the roof of the 
           car, chambers a round, and takes careful aim.

                                 RADAR
                        We don’t have permission to fire!

                                 SANDERS
                        You don’t have permission. I’m CIA, 
                        I can do whatever the hell I want.

           Sanders fires. The sniper tumbles from a sixth floor window, 
           dead. Everybody CHEERS.

                                 SANDERS
                        Nobody fucks with my lady.

           INT. LA BANDITA - DRIVING - SUNSET

           Sanders drives Josh home. 

                                 SANDERS
                        Things are going to be a little 
                        dicey for awhile. When the New 
                        Jersey shelled the hills last week, 
                        a bunch of civilians got killed.

                                 JOSH
                        We didn’t hit the Druze?

                                 SANDERS
                        Somebody gave the Navy the wrong 
                        coordinates and we hit a village by 
                        mistake. Typical: we execute a 
                        flawless op and Washington fucks it 
                        up. Now we’ve all got bullseyes on 
                        our asses.

                                 JOSH
                        How many people were killed?

                                 SANDERS
                        I don’t know. A lot. The point is: 
                        I need you to step it up. You’ve 
                        got all those leads, but you 
                        haven’t closed a single deal.
                                 JOSH
                        It takes time. I’m building 
                        relationships, earning trust-

                                 SANDERS
                        Forget all that tribal ceremony 
                        shit. It’s great you speak Arabic, 
                        but you gotta learn to speak the 
                        universal language.

                                 JOSH 
                        Esperanto?

                                 SANDERS
                        What? No. Money, kid, money. 

                                 JOSH
                        I tried that with Naseerah and it 
                        didn’t work.

                                 SANDERS
                        Chick’s have to be seduced. Guys 
                        are easy. They’ll do anything for 
                        money. So quit screwing around and 
                        close some deals.

           INT. FARAZ’S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s cramped, but filled with personal touches. Josh pulls a 
           brand new Atari 2600 out of a bag. Faraz’s SIX CHILDREN, ages 
           2 - 11, go crazy. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Josh and the kids are playing Pac-Man on the Atari. One of 
           the kids is sitting on Josh’s lap. They clearly adore him. 
           Faraz, and his wife FATIMA look on, smiling.

           EXT. FARAZ’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Faraz is showing Josh around the cluttered garage. Faraz pats 
           an old ice cream cart affectionately. They speak in Arabic.

                                 FARAZ
                        Before the war, I used to sell ice 
                        cream down at the beach. I had six 
                        men working under me. Now, there is 
                        no business, no work. If something 
                        doesn’t change soon...

                                 JOSH
                        I could give you a job.
                                 FARAZ
                        What would I have to do?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing you don’t already do. Keep 
                        an ear to the ground. Tell me about 
                        rumors you’re hearing. This 
                        militia’s planning a big attack, 
                        that militia was behind the latest 
                        car bomb. Stuff like that.

                                 FARAZ
                        Are you asking me to be a spy?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m asking you to help your 
                        country. Help us help Lebanon.

           Faraz looks skeptical. Josh tries to salvage the situation.

                                 JOSH
                        We’d pay you 500 dollars a week.

           Faraz perks up. We FREEZE FRAME on his expression as the 
           following text TYPES its way across the screen: “FARAZ AL 
           BARADEI, CODE NAME: COOL BREEZE”

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        And that’s how I recruited my first 
                        agent.

           INT. BAR, COMMODORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Josh parties with Toby, Sanders, Bear, Jackson, the other CIA 
           guys and a bunch of Marines, including Gunny and Radar.

                                 JACKSON
                           (a toast)
                        Josh finally lost his cherry!

           The guys CHEER. Toby and Bear pour pitchers of beer over 
           Josh’s head. Then Bear pours another pitcher over his own 
           head, and everyone howls with laughter. Just then someone 
           snaps a photo and we FREEZE FRAME on the moment.

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Josh and Naseerah are kissing goodbye at the door. He tries 
           to pull away, but she holds on and keeps kissing him.

                                 JOSH
                        I gotta go. I’m going to be late!
           EXT. SEASIDE PROMENADE, NEAR US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh waits to cross the street. The Embassy can be seen in 
           the distance, a block away.

           A pickup truck pulls up to the light and stops. The DRIVER is 
           feverishly muttering something to himself over and over. Josh 
           glances from the driver to the cargo, which is covered by a 
           tarp. The truck sags under the weight.

           Josh glances over to the Embassy. A Mercedes parked out front 
           FLASHES ITS HEADLIGHTS THREE TIMES, then pulls away.

           THE PICKUP DRIVER SEES THE SIGNAL AND STOMPS ON THE GAS.

           It’s obvious some bad shit is about to go down. JOSH TAKES 
           OFF AFTER THE TRUCK, SPRINTING THROUGH TRAFFIC. Cars screech 
           and swerve, nearly hitting him.

           As it approaches the Embassy, the truck slows and Josh closes 
           in, running as fast as he can. He SCREAMS at the Marines 
           guarding the entrance to the driveway.

                                 JOSH
                        STOP THAT TRUCK! STOP THAT TRUCK!

           But they can’t hear him over the din of the street. The truck 
           makes a wild left turn on two wheels, nearly capsizing, and 
           barrels into the embassy’s driveway, blowing past the guards.

           The truck SMASHES through the Embassy’s front doors and 
           EXPLODES. Every window on the block SHATTERS. The blast hurls 
           Josh through the air like a rag doll.

           The entire face of the Embassy COLLAPSES WITH A ROAR. The 
           American flag on the roof is the last thing to disappear, 
           sinking down into the billowing cloud of dust.

           La Bandita RACES UP and SCREECHES to a stop. Sanders and Toby 
           jump out and stand there frozen with shock as the first 
           survivors stagger out of the dust cloud, covered in blood.

           Then they see JOSH LYING IN THE STREET, writhing in pain. 
           They run over and help him to his feet.

                                 TOBY
                        Dude, you okay?

           Josh nods, but he’s a mess. His skin is scorched and peppered 
           with broken glass. His clothes are in tatters, and a pencil 
           sticks out of his leg like an arrow.
           The three men stand there gaping at the devastation. They 
           just can’t believe it.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           DAYS LATER

           Framed photos of the dead, including BEAR, JACKSON, BRIAN and 
           the OTHER CIA GUYS, are spread out over several tables. 

           At the base of the Embassy’s shattered edifice, a memorial 
           service is wrapping up. Dozens of jittery Marines stand watch 
           while the visiting officials climb into a fleet of SUVs. 

           As the convoy rolls out, a dozen guys remain behind, 
           lingering over the photos: Josh, Toby, Sanders, BILL CASEY, 
           BILL BUCKLEY and SEVEN NEW GUYS.

                                 CASEY
                           (incredulous)
                        Some crazy raghead pulls a kamikaze 
                        on us and kills 63 people. Christ 
                        Almighty. These Arabs are as bad as 
                        the Japs. Goddamn savages!

           SUPER: WILLIAM CASEY, DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

           Casey’s a cranky, foul-mouthed man in his 60s. From being a 
           spy during WWII to running Reagan’s Presidential campaign, 
           Casey’s done it all, and not always with the most integrity.

                                 CASEY
                        Jimmy Carter let these barbarians 
                        push us around, but there’s a new 
                        sheriff in town. His name’s Ronald 
                        Reagan and he’s pissed. He wants 
                        these guys caught and strung up by 
                        their balls. Bill, get over here.

           Buckley steps forward. He’s a quiet man in his late 50s, but 
           don’t let his low-key demeanor fool you: he’s been with the 
           agency since the early years, and he’s kicked a lot of ass.

                                 CASEY
                        This is Bill Buckley, your new 
                        Station Chief. Bill’s an old 
                        friend, and one of the best 
                        clandestine officers the agency’s 
                        ever had. He has generously agreed 
                        to come out of retirement and help 
                        you get back on your feet. Bill?
                                 BUCKLEY
                        First, I just want to say I’m 
                        sorry. I know you guys lost a lot 
                        of friends. Second, I want to thank 
                        Buck Sanders for agreeing to sign 
                        on as Deputy Chief. Third, I don’t 
                        like spending too much time in the 
                        office. I came up through the army, 
                        Special Forces. We’re going to be 
                        out here, on the streets, mixing it 
                        up with these guys. I can’t promise 
                        it’ll be easy, but I will promise 
                        you this: we’re going to get the 
                        sonsofbitches who did this.

           EXT. SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           East Beirut, the Christian side of town. The new Embassy is 
           set back off the street, and is protected by a stone wall and 
           a heavy-duty gate. Concrete barriers have turned the long 
           driveway into a twisting maze.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, Sanders and the new guys are sitting around a 
           table, trying to make sense of the bombing. Movers are 
           hauling in new office furniture in the background.

                                 TOBY
                        Maybe they got the driver out of 
                        the loony bin, like a retard or 
                        something. They could’ve tricked 
                        him. Cut the brake lines and 
                        detonated it by remote control.

                                 SANDERS
                        Exactly. Who’s going to blow 
                        themselves up on purpose? This was 
                        a one-off thing.

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know. I spoke to Eyal this 
                        morning. Remember that car bomb 
                        that hit the Israelis two weeks 
                        ago? He said it wasn’t your usual 
                        car bomb. It was a kamikaze attack.

           While Josh is speaking, Buckley and Casey enter.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Has anyone claimed responsibility 
                        for the bombings?
                                 JOSH
                        A new group of shi’ite radicals 
                        that split off from the Amal 
                        militia. They’re calling themselves 
                        Hizb’allah.

                                 CASEY
                        What the fuck is a Hazbollack? 
                        Jesus Christ. Speak English, kid!

                                 JOSH
                        It means “Party of God.” It’s from 
                        the Qu’ran. “Verily the Party of 
                        God shall be victorious.” 

                                 BUCKLEY
                        What do they want?

                                 JOSH
                        As far as we can tell, they only 
                        have one purpose: to drive the 
                        “infidel crusaders,” America and 
                        Israel, out of Lebanon.

                                 CASEY
                        These dirtballs are nothing! We’re 
                        going to crush ‘em! And when we 
                        expose the Soviets’ involvement, 
                        everyone will see they’re the Evil 
                        Empire the President says they are.

                                 JOSH
                        Sir, I’m not sure-

                                 CASEY
                        That’s who’s behind your Party of 
                        God. I’d bet my daughter’s 
                        virginity on it. There’s thousands 
                        of Soviet advisors in Syria. You 
                        think they’re just laying in the 
                        sun jerking their peckers? The 
                        commies never rest. But this time 
                        they’ve gone too far. They may be 
                        laughing now, but they won’t be 
                        laughing when America strikes back.

           EXT. BEIRUT - DAWN

           As the first red sliver of the sun appears, the sound of a 
           muezzin calling the faithful to prayer ECHOES across Beirut.
           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           It’s silent. Josh and Naseerah are asleep in each other’s 
           arms. The clock reads 6:22 AM.

           A HUGE EXPLOSION IN THE DISTANCE RATTLES THE BUILDING, waking 
           them. Josh jumps out of bed and runs to the window. In the 
           distance, a black cloud of smoke rises up over the city.

           Just then another MASSIVE EXPLOSION GOES OFF. Josh watches as 
           a ball of fire billows into the sky.

           EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

           A PILE OF BROKEN CONCRETE. Unlike the Embassy, this building 
           has completely collapsed. Muffled MOANS and SHOUTS for help 
           come from under the rubble.

           Marines swarm over the pile searching for the trapped 
           survivors. Officers SHOUT orders, trying to get things 
           organized, but it’s chaos.

           Josh, Toby, Buckley and Sanders pitch in. Josh and Toby carry 
           a wounded Marine toward the triage area. As they walk, Josh 
           spots a dead Marine hanging in a tree, impaled through the 
           chest by tree limb.

           They pass a CORRESPONDENT reporting live from the scene.

                                 CORRESPONDENT #1
                        ...the death toll is not yet known, 
                        but is expected to be in the 
                        hundreds. A few miles away, a 
                        second suicide bomber rammed the 
                        French peacekeepers, killing at 
                        least fifty more. The two attacks 
                        were executed just seconds apart...

           Josh and Toby reach the triage area, and set the wounded man 
           down. Dazed and bloodied men are everywhere. Two guys walk by 
           carrying a stretcher piled high with severed arms and legs.

           A Marine comes running over to Toby.

                                 MARINE #1
                        It’s Gunny.

           ON THE PILE

           Josh, Toby and several Marines gather around a gap between 
           two huge slabs of concrete. Toby shines a flashlight into the 
           space. A few feet down, Gunny’s head, shoulder and right arm 
           are visible. The rest of his body is buried in the debris.
                                 GUNNY
                        I can’t feel my legs.

                                 TOBY
                        Hang on, dude. We’re going to have 
                        you out of there in no time.

           Gunny’s not going for the pep talk. He’s scared.

                                 GUNNY
                        I don’t want to die down here. Not 
                        like this. Not like this.

                                 TOBY
                        You’re not going to die. We been in 
                        worse scrapes than this. Remember 
                        Quang Tri?

           While Toby talks, Josh, Buckley, Sanders and some Marines are 
           using hacksaws to cut through the tangles of rebar. The sun 
           is rising higher in the sky, and they’re sweating profusely. 

           Toby lays down on the pile and reaches down into the hole.

                                 TOBY
                        Reach up and give me your hand.

           Gunny reaches up. Their fingertips brush. Toby strains to 
           reach him. Finally, the two men clasp hands.

                                 TOBY
                        I’m not letting go until we get you 
                        out.

                                 GUNNY
                        You always were a homo, Toby.

           NIGHT

           Spotlights illuminate the rubble pile as the Marines toil 
           through the night, trying to save their buddies.

           At the perimeter fence, hundreds of Lebanese civilians look 
           on, holding a candlelight vigil for the trapped Marines.

           Toby’s still lying down on the rubble, reaching down through 
           the gap to hold Gunny’s hand. Gunny is fading.

                                 TOBY
                        Come on, Gunny. Talk to me. That’s 
                        an order, Marine!

           Gunny opens his eyes. Croaks weakly.
                                 GUNNY
                        I’m cold.

                                 TOBY
                        I know, man. I know. Hang in there. 
                        We’re almost there. 

           Josh comes running over. He kneels down next to Toby and 
           sticks his head down in the crevice.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, Gunny, we got some good news. 
                        They just pulled Radar out of the 
                        rubble. He’s pretty banged up but 
                        he’s going to make it.

                                 TOBY
                        If that pussy can hang on, then I 
                        know you can.
                           (beat)
                        Come on, man, keep talking. Gunny?

           Gunny begins mumbling the Marine Corps hymn, barely audible.

                                 GUNNY
                        From the Halls of Montezuma to the 
                        shores of Tripoli...

                                 TOBY
                        We fight our country’s battles on 
                        the land as on the sea...

           The other Marines join in. 

                                 EVERYONE
                        First to fight for right and 
                        freedom, and to keep our honor 
                        clean...

           They belt out the final stanza, many with tears in their 
           eyes. Gunny smiles, then the light fade from his eyes.

                                 EVERYONE
                        We are proud to claim the title of 
                        United States Marine.

           Gunny’s hand goes limp in Toby’s. Toby sits up and buries his 
           face in his hands for a minute. Then he looks up. Tears have 
           washed paths through the concrete dust on his face. 

           A hush settles over the men. Gunny’s gone and everyone knows 
           it. Josh puts an arm around Toby’s shoulder. Off this moment 
           of tenderness we CUT TO:
           MONTAGE OF ARCHIVAL NEWS FOOTAGE: 

           As President Reagan addresses the nation, we intercut with 
           news clips of the nation’s reaction to the tragedy.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        More than 200 of the sleeping men 
                        were killed in that one hideous, 
                        insane attack. Those who directed 
                        this atrocity must be dealt 
                        justice, and they will be.

           - Dover Air Force Base. A hangar is filled with flag-draped 
           coffins. President Reagan walks past them, visibly moved.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        Many of you are asking: Why should 
                        our young men be dying in Lebanon? 
                        Well, the answer is straight 
                        forward: to help bring peace and 
                        stability to the vital Middle East. 

           - Camp Lejeune memorial service. In the pouring rain, Reagan 
           shakes hands with some wounded Marines in wheelchairs.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        Syria has become a home for 7,000 
                        Soviet advisors and technicians who 
                        man a massive amount of Soviet 
                        weaponry. Can the United States 
                        stand by and see the Middle East 
                        incorporated into the Soviet bloc? 

           - All across America, people hold candlelight vigils for the 
           fallen Marines. Yellow ribbons are tied around trees.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        If we were to leave Lebanon now, 
                        what message would that send to 
                        those who foment instability and 
                        terrorism?

           - At the Commodore Hotel, Josh, Toby, Buckley, Sanders and 
           the other CIA guys huddle around a TV, watching Reagan speak.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        We cannot and will not dishonor the 
                        Marines and the sacrifices they've 
                        made by failing to remain as 
                        faithful to the cause of freedom 
                        and the pursuit of peace as they 
                        have been. 
           EXT. MARINE BASE, BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           A long line of Marines, many of them injured, shuffle down 
           the docks to their ships. Josh and Toby are shaking hands 
           with them as they pass, AD LIBBING farewells and semper fi’s. 

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        The President vowed not to pull the 
                        Marines out, but it was just empty 
                        rhetoric.

           A man rolls up in a wheelchair, his head wrapped in gauze. 
           It’s Radar. Josh and Toby shake hands with him, then Radar 
           wheels on down the dock.

           SUNSET

           Josh and Toby stand alone, the base abandoned, looking out to 
           sea. The ships are distant silhouettes against the sunset.

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           The entire staff is gathered around as Buckley speaks.

                                 BUCKLEY 
                        When you walk out that door, you’re 
                        on Hizb’allah’s turf. From now on I 
                        don’t want anyone travelling to or 
                        from work alone, so pair up and 
                        carpool. Watch for surveillance. 
                        Vary your routes and schedule. 
                        Don’t. Get. Predictable.
                           (beat)
                        The President is counting on us to 
                        catch the guys who did this. The 
                        American people are counting on us. 
                        And the families of those Marines 
                        are counting on us. Now let’s get 
                        out there, and get these pricks. 
                        Turn up the heat. I want these 
                        shitbirds running for their lives!

           The staff CLAPS and CHEERS. They’re fired up.

           LATER

           Sanders, Toby and the other guys are sorting through a box of 
           guns and arming up. Buckley turns to Josh.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        What are you packing?
                           (off his look)
                        What kind of sidearm do you carry?
                                 JOSH
                        I don’t.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        From now on you do.

           He pulls out a pearl-handled Colt .45 and gives it to Josh. 

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Don’t go anywhere without this. 
                        When you take a shit, you hold it 
                        with one hand, and wipe with the 
                        other.

           “You’ve Got Another Thing Coming” by Judas Priest PLAYS over: 

           INT. GUERILLA HIDE-OUT, BEIRUT - DAY

           BANG! A cop KICKS THE DOOR IN. Lots of shouting in Arabic as 
           a dozen Lebanese cops storm in, and the four Arab occupants 
           try to scramble out the back.

           Josh KICKS OPEN the back door, hitting one of the men in the 
           face. He, Toby and Sanders rush in with M-16s. Three of the 
           men surrender, but the fourth one SHOUTS at them in Arabic. 
           Sanders slams the butt of his rifle into the guy’s head, and 
           he goes down hard.

           INT. CARPET STORE - DAY

           Josh shows some photos to one of his ARAB AGENTS.

                                 JOSH
                        What about this guy? Abu Muhammed 
                        Kalifa?

                                 ARAB AGENT
                        Muhammed Abu Bin Kalifa?

                                 JOSH
                        No, Abu Muhammed Kalifa.

                                 ARAB AGENT
                        That is Muhammed Abu Bin Kalifa.

                                 JOSH
                        Then who’s Abu Muhammed Kalifa?

                                 ARAB AGENT
                        How should I know?

           EXT. SKI LODGE, MT. LEBANON - DAY

           La Bandita crunches through the snow and pulls over.
           INT. LA BANDITA - DAY

           Sanders is at the wheel, Josh and Toby in the back.

                                 SANDERS
                        This guy works at the Soviet 
                        Embassy, and says he’s got some 
                        info on Hizb’allah and the KGB.

           MIKHAIL, a pale man in his 40s, opens the door and gets in. 

           INT./EXT. LA BANDITA/MOUNTAIN ROAD - DRIVING - DAY

           Sanders speeds down the winding mountain road.

                                 SANDERS
                        So what’d the KGB do? Provide 
                        surveillance? The C-4? What?

                                 MIKHAIL
                        What? Nothing. We don’t even have 
                        any contacts in Hizb’allah. We-

                                 SANDERS
                        Don’t try to change your story. I 
                        want to know who helped them blow 
                        up our guys, and how they did it.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, I think we picked up a tail.

           Mikhail turns around and sees the tail, a black Mercedes with 
           tinted windows. He ducks down, terrified.

                                 MIKHAIL
                        It’s the KGB! If they see me with 
                        you, they’ll kill me.

           Sanders FLOORS it and the Camaro ROARS off. The KGB car gives 
           chase. The cars SCREECH and FISHTAIL down the winding road.

                                 SANDERS
                        If you want to live you better 
                        start talking.

                                 MIKHAIL
                        Hizb’allah has declared jihad on us 
                        because we are killing Muslims in 
                        Afghanistan. I called you because I 
                        wanted to warn you: last week they 
                        kidnapped four of our agents.
                                 SANDERS
                        If I find out you’re lying, I’m 
                        going to personally make sure you 
                        spend the rest of your life in a 
                        Siberian gulag. Understand?
                           (beat)
                        Get ready to jump.

           La Bandita SCREECHES around a hairpin curve, and the KGB car 
           vanishes from view.

           Sanders reaches over and flings opens Mikhail’s door.

                                 SANDERS
                        Jump!

                                 MIKHAIL
                        Slow down! You’re going too fast!

           Sanders shoves Mikhail out. SCREAMING, the Russian cartwheels 
           down the embankment into a ditch. 

           Sanders swerves into the other lane, dodges an oncoming car, 
           and roars past a truck. As he speeds away, Sanders checks the 
           rear-view mirror, but there’s no sign of the KGB car.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The KGB car speeds down a straight-away, but La Bandita is 
           nowhere to be seen. Then the Camaro ROARS out from behind 
           some trees, and races up behind them. Sanders hits the horn, 
           which BLASTS “La Cucaracha,” startling the Soviet agents.

           Sanders nudges their rear bumper in a “pick-and-push”, 
           causing the KGB car to SPIN OUT. Sanders WHOOPS as it SKIDS 
           off the road, and ROLLS down the hill.

           Sanders stops and backs up. THREE KGB AGENTS come climbing up 
           the hill, CURSING.

                                 KGB AGENT
                        Goddamn you, Sanders! That was a 
                        brand new car. How am I going to 
                        explain this to Moscow?

                                 SANDERS
                        Tell them the CIA has a better 
                        driving school. Hey, no hard 
                        feelings. You guys want a lift back 
                        into town?

                                 KGB AGENT
                        That would be very nice. Thank you.
                                 SANDERS
                        EAT SHIT, COMMIES!

           Sanders floors it, spraying the KGB guys with gravel. They 
           COUGH and SPUTTER as the Camaro ROARS away.

           EXT. RUBBLE-STREWN STREET - DAY

           A guerilla unloads an AK-47 on full-auto at a series of 
           bottles lined up on some rubble.

                                 GUERILLA #1
                        INSHALLAH!!!

           He doesn’t hit a single bottle. Three other guerillas jeer 
           him. Josh takes the AK, reloads, and fires off a rapid series 
           of shots. One by one the bottles explode. The men CHEER.

           LATER

           Josh sits off to the side with one of the guerillas.

                                 JOSH 
                        I thought Fadlallah was the most 
                        important shi’ite imam in Lebanon?

                                 GUERILLA #2 
                        He is. But Hizb’allah does not 
                        follow him, they follow the 
                        Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. They 
                        want to turn Lebanon into an 
                        Islamic theocracy. This is why 
                        Khomeini finances and trains them.

                                 JOSH 
                        Are you saying Iran is backing 
                        Hizb’allah?

                                 GUERILLA #2
                        Not just backing - created. Without 
                        Iran, Hizb’allah would not exist. 
                        They share a base in the Bekaa 
                        Valley, in Baalbek. It was an empty 
                        army barracks, but now Iranian 
                        soldiers live there. They train 
                        Hizb’allah to shoot, to make bombs, 
                        to become shahuda, martyrs.

           EXT. PASDARAN BARRACKS - DAY

           Josh, Toby and Buckley, faces hidden behind keffiyehs, hide 
           under some scrub brush on a hill overlooking the sprawling 
           compound. It’s swarming with activity. This isn’t just some 
           terrorist training camp, it’s a FULL-SCALE MILITARY BASE.
           SUPER: PASDARAN BARRACKS - BAALBEK, LEBANON

                                 BUCKLEY
                        See the ones in uniform? They’re 
                        Pasdaran Guard, Iranian Green 
                        Berets, force multipliers. 

                                 TOBY
                        It’s like we just found the Death 
                        Star or something.

                                 JOSH
                        We have to wipe this place off the 
                        map. How long before we can get an 
                        airstrike in here?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Depends. Could take weeks. We’ll-

                                 JOSH
                        The 6th fleet’s in the Med. They 
                        could scramble fighters and be here 
                        in thirty minutes.

                                 BUCKLEY 
                        That’s not how it works. The White 
                        House is going to want proof.

                                 JOSH
                        And when we get it?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Then Casey will personally take it 
                        to the President.

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh is on the phone. In the background, some of the staffers 
           are putting up a Christmas tree and other decorations.

                                 JOSH 
                        ...I’m trying to find a log of some 
                        intercepted phone calls, but no one 
                        seems to know what happened to 
                        them. John Harms at the NSC said 
                        you might be able to help me. 
                           (...)
                        Well, I’m fluent in Arabic. If you 
                        can get me the tapes, I could 
                        translate them myself and get them 
                        off your desk.
           INT. BAR, COMMODORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sanders is at the bar, chatting up two hotties in skimpy 
           dresses. Josh and Toby are sitting in a booth with Naseerah 
           and one of her ARAB GIRLFRIENDS, chatting and laughing.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Come on, just give me something. 
                        I’m not going to quote you.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, but it’s top secret: you have 
                        the prettiest smile I’ve ever seen.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Lame. How about a simple yes or no 
                        answer: are you getting close to 
                        catching the bombers?

                                 JOSH
                        You know I can’t talk about that.

                                 NASEERAH 
                        What’s the matter? Don’t trust me?

                                 JOSH
                        Never talk to the press. That’s 
                        rule number four.

                                 NASEERAH
                        What’s rule number one?

                                 JOSH
                        Always deny everything.

           She nibbles at his ear and whispers:

                                 NASEERAH
                        I have ways of making you talk.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m trained to withstand torture.

           He goes to kiss her, but she pulls back, teasing him. Just 
           then there’s a commotion at the front of the bar. SIX 
           HIZB’ALLAH THUGS with full beards and green headbands burst 
           in with lead pipes, SCREAMING in Arabic. 

                                 THUGS
                        ALLAH U AKBAR! ALLAH U AKBAR!

           They leap over the bar, attacking the bottles of booze. The 
           bartender PLEADS with them as they smash everything.
           The men fan out through the bar, grabbing drinks and smashing 
           them. Thug #1 approaches Josh, Toby, Naseerah and her friend. 
           He SCREAMS at them in Arabic, motioning to the women.

           Under the table, Josh pulls out his pistol and, without 
           taking his eyes off the thug, COCKS back the hammer. The thug 
           BARKS out a question.

                                 JOSH
                        Canada. Montreal.

           Satisfied, the thug storms off. He and the other thugs march 
           for the exit, pumping their fists and CHANTING.

                                 THUGS
                        ALLAH U AKBAR! ALLAH U AKBAR!

           Then they’re gone. Josh exhales and puts the pistol away. 
           Naseerah clings to him, shaken. Toby turns to Josh.

                                 TOBY
                        It’s always a party when the Party 
                        of God’s around.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A badly injured man, with no arms or legs, lies in bed with 
           bandages over his eyes. This is BIJAN. Faraz sits beside him, 
           arguing with him in ARABIC. Josh stands nearby, listening.

                                 FARAZ
                        ...at least tell me his name.
                           (off Bijan’s silence)
                        Why do you protect them? They don’t 
                        deserve your loyalty! Who is the 
                        butcher who did this to you?

                                 BIJAN
                        Mugniyah. Imad Fayez Mugniyah. He’s 
                        the Enforcer. This is what he does 
                        to those who fail him.

                                 FARAZ
                        Can you describe this man?

                                 BIJAN
                        5’10. Average build. Brown eyes. 
                        Black hair and beard.

           Josh and Faraz exchange a look - this is practically useless.

                                 BIJAN
                        Is someone else there?
                                 FARAZ
                        Just the doctor.

                                 BIJAN
                        Doctor, will I ever see again?

                                 JOSH
                        God willing.

           EXT. ISRAELI CHECKPOINT - SUNSET

           Josh greets EYAL ARAD, a tough Israeli officer in his 40s, 
           with a box of Cuban cigars. Eyal runs one of the stogies 
           under his nose, savoring the sweet scent.

           LATER

           Josh and Eyal sit on a tank, smoking cigars.

                                 EYAL
                        We’ve been trying to get a fix on 
                        Mugniyah for years. He’s a ghost. 

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Josh straps on a kevlar vest. Pulls a shirt on over it. He 
           tucks the chrome .45 in the back of his pants, then parts the 
           curtains and checks the street. All clear.

           EXT. JOSH’S APARTMENT BLDG. - MORNING

           Josh scans the area as he walks to his car and gets in. 
           Across the street TWO ARAB KIDS sit behind the wheel of a 
           burned-out car, pretending to drive. They wave to Josh.

           EXT. BUCKLEY’S APARTMENT BLDG. - MORNING

           Josh pulls up and HONKS. Buckley exits the building, crosses 
           to the car, and gets in.

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Buckley looks on as Josh updates an organizational chart of 
           Hizb’allah. At the top, Josh writes “Imad Mugniyah.” In place 
           of a photo, he affixes a question mark drawn on a blank card.

                                 JOSH 
                        When Mugniyah was a kid, he was 
                        wounded by a Phalange artillery 
                        shell. The blast killed his older 
                        brother right in front of him. Two 
                        years later, he joined Arafat’s 
                        Force 17 and started learning how 
                        to make bombs. He was only 14. Now 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH  (CONT'D)
                        he runs Hizb’allah’s SSA, Special 
                        Security Apparatus. He’s the 
                        mastermind behind all of their 
                        attacks, including the suicide 
                        bombings of our Embassy and the 
                        Marines. He’s basically the most 
                        feared killer in all of Lebanon. 

                                 BUCKLEY
                        What else do we have on him?

                                 JOSH 
                        Nothing. The Israelis call him “the 
                        faceless one” because no one even 
                        knows what he looks like.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Keep digging.

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           It’s 4 AM. Josh sits alone in the dark, wearing headphones. 
           He listens to a phone call in Arabic play on a tape deck 
           while furiously scribbling out a translation.

           Then he hears something so shocking he stops writing. He hits 
           rewind, and listens again...

           INT. BUCKLEY’S OFFICE, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Sanders and Buckley are on speaker phone with Casey. We 
           intercut with Casey at his desk in Langley as needed.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Iran shipped the explosives to 
                        their Embassy in Syria using the 
                        diplomatic pouch. Then Iran’s 
                        Foreign Minister called their 
                        Ambassador in Damascus and gave the 
                        attack the greenlight.

                                 CASEY
                        What’s your sourcing on this?

           Buckley looks to Josh. Josh clears his throat.

                                 JOSH 
                        The phone call was intercepted by 
                        the NSA. Sir, it’s the smoking gun 
                        we’ve been looking for.

                                 CASEY
                        Who else has heard this call?
                                 SANDERS
                        No one. There’s a six-month back 
                        log on translating at the NSA, so 
                        Josh translated the tapes himself.

                                 CASEY
                        So where do we hit back? What are 
                        the targets?

                                 JOSH
                        The Iranian Foreign Ministry and 
                        Pasdaran headquarters in Tehran; 
                        the Iranian Embassies in Damascus 
                        and Beirut; and the Pasdaran 
                        Barracks in the Bekaa Valley.

                                 CASEY
                        What about Moscow?

                                 SANDERS
                        We looked into the Soviet angle, 
                        and we couldn’t find any evidence-

                                 CASEY
                        Horseshit! I’m tired of hearing 
                        about a bunch of Arab goatfuckers. 
                        There are commies behind this, and 
                        you better find ‘em!

                                 BUCKLEY
                        He’s right, Bill. It’s a dead end. 
                        If the President is serious about 
                        hitting back, this is his chance.

                                 CASEY
                        Fine. I’ll talk to the President. 
                        You happy now? Goodbye.

           Casey hangs up. Off Josh, Sanders and Buckley’s look:

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           The last few stragglers are filing out for the night. Sanders 
           and Toby grab their coats and head for the exit.

                                 SANDERS
                        Sure you don’t want to come?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m going to stick around in case 
                        the Director calls back.

                        You’re missing out. The Commodore’s 
                        got the best turkey dinner in town.

           They AD LIB “Merry Christmas”s, then Josh is alone.

           INT. BUCKLEY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Buckley’s hunched over a diorama of a Revolutionary War 
           battlefield, painting a miniature soldier. Josh sits across 
           from him, nursing a glass of Scotch.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        The first shots of the American 
                        Revolution were fired right here at 
                        Lexington. You know what the 
                        deciding factor in the battle was?

           Josh studies the diorama. The patriots are scattered about, 
           taking cover behind trees, bushes, wagons, etc. Several lines 
           of Red Coats stand in perfect formation out in the open.

                                 JOSH 
                        Our guys didn’t stand in a line 
                        like a bunch of idiots?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Espionage. The British were on a 
                        secret mission to seize the armory. 
                        If they could keep all the 
                        gunpowder to themselves, the 
                        rebellion would’ve been crushed. 
                        But Paul Revere got word of the 
                        plan. He made his famous ride and 
                        we got there first. When the Red 
                        Coats showed up, they got the 
                        surprise of a lifetime. We chased 
                        ‘em all the way back to Boston.
                           (beat)
                        Here, you do this one.

           Buckley hands Josh the paintbrush and a soldier. Josh takes 
           them, and tentatively applies some paint to the figure.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        The trick is getting the details. 
                        The eyes, the brass buttons. That’s 
                        what brings them to life.
                           (beat)
                        There you go. You’re getting the 
                        hang of it. 

                                 JOSH 
                        How’s Candy doing?
                                 BUCKLEY
                        Busy. Lots of last minute shoppers. 
                        Says the store’s doing real well 
                        without me there screwing it up. 
                        What about you? You call your Dad?

                                 JOSH
                        I sent him a postcard. I drew 
                        flames on the skyline in red ink 
                        and wrote “wish you were here.”

                                 BUCKLEY
                        I know he wasn’t around much when 
                        you were growing up, but he’s 
                        probably going to be pretty lonely, 
                        tomorrow being Christmas and all.

                                 JOSH 
                        Christmas was never a big deal in 
                        the McKenna household. He’s going 
                        to be in Vail hot tubbing with some 
                        snow bunny he met on the slopes. 
                           (re: soldier)
                        What do you think?

           The paint job’s pretty sloppy compared to Buckley’s 
           painstakingly detailed figures.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Not bad. Let’s put him over here.

           Buckley takes the figure and places it on the battlefield.

           IN THE BULLPEN - LATER

           Josh sits at his desk studying the various clocks on the 
           wall. It’s 9 PM in New York. He picks up the phone and dials.

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                           (recording)
                        You’ve reached the McKenna 
                        residence. I’m not here right now-

           INTERCUT WITH

           INT. DONALD’S HOME, LONG ISLAND - NIGHT

           Donald sits on the couch watching “It’s a Wonderful Life” on 
           TV. He hears the answering machine and picks up the phone.

                                 DONALD
                        This is Donald.

           Josh doesn’t know what to say.
                                 DONALD
                        Hello? Hello?

           Josh hesitates, then hangs up. Looks off into the dark.

           EXT. FLIGHT DECK, USS ENTERPRISE - DAWN

           It’s like the opening of “TOP GUN.” Fighter pilots man their 
           aircraft. The first F-14 taxis into position. The full force 
           of American firepower is waiting to be unleashed...

           EXT. ROOFTOP, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAWN

           Josh, Buckley and a few other guys look out to sea with 
           binoculars. Buckley turns to Josh.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Making the case for this strike was 
                        great work, kid. I’m proud of you.

           Josh grins and raises his binoculars, looking for the jets. A 
           LONG BEAT. Josh looks at his watch. Something’s wrong.

                                 CIA GUY #1
                        Where the hell are they?

           Toby comes running up out of the stairwell.

                                 TOBY
                        The mission’s been called off.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        What? By who?

                                 TOBY
                        Weinberger. He went chicken shit as 
                        usual. 

                                 JOSH
                        The President signed off on this!

                                 TOBY
                        The President’s in China and can’t 
                        be reached. The Defense Secretary’s 
                        calling the shots.

                                 JOSH
                        Motherfucker!

           Josh hurls his binoculars across the roof.
           INT. BATHROOM, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh splashes cold water on his face. Sanders comes out of a 
           stall waving a SOLDIER OF FORTUNE magazine to clear the air.

                                 SANDERS
                        Heard the airstrike got called off. 
                        Tough break. You know, the French 
                        are looking to get some payback 
                        too. You could slip ‘em the intel. 
                        Maybe they’d take a crack at it.

           Josh is taken aback by the suggestion.

                                 JOSH
                        If Bill found out, it’d be my ass.

                                 SANDERS
                        Then don’t tell him. I won’t.

           Sanders walks out. Josh stands there, contemplating the idea.

           EXT. BEIRUT - DAY

           A dozen French Super Entendard fighter planes come streaking 
           over the rooftops, rattling windows across the city.

           EXT. HILLSIDE, NEAR THE PASDARAN BARRACKS - DAY

           Josh, Toby and Sanders watch as the jets come ROARING in. 
           They rain bombs down on the barracks, and volcanos of dirt 
           erupt into the sky, blocking out the sun. Our guys cheer and 
           high-five like they just won the Super Bowl. 

           Finally, the air clears. All of the buildings are still 
           standing. Giant craters pock the ground all around them. 

                                 SANDERS
                        Goddamn French couldn’t pour piss 
                        out of a boot if the directions 
                        were on the heel!

           INT. HALL, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh hurries down the hall. Buckley falls in step beside him.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Where the hell have you been?

                                 JOSH
                        There was some looting over on Rue 
                        de Neuf, so I went by to check on 
                        the safe house. What’s going on?
                                 BUCKLEY
                        All hell’s breaking loose. 
                        Hizb’allah just kidnapped two 
                        American journalists, and the 
                        French tried to blow up the 
                        Pasdaran Barracks.

                                 JOSH
                        Did they get them?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Hell no. They’re French! You heard 
                        of a group called the Dawa 17?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, they’re a group of Kuwaiti-

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Good, you can explain it to the 
                        Ambassador. 

           A SECRETARY comes running after them.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Sir, Director Casey’s on the line 
                        again. He says it’s urgent.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Tell him I’ll call him back.
                           (to Josh)
                        Somebody started a whisper campaign 
                        saying I put the French up to this, 
                        and Casey’s furious. I bet you it 
                        was Sanders. He set me up.

           Off Josh’s stunned look... 

           INT. AMBASSADOR’S OFFICE, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh and Buckley meet with AMBASSADOR BARTHOLOMEW.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        They nabbed Terry Anderson of the 
                        AP and Jeremy Levin of CNN, and are 
                        demanding the release of the Dawa 

                                 BARTHOLOMEW
                        Who the hell’s that?

                                 JOSH
                        They botched a car bomb attack 
                        against our Embassy in Kuwait a few 
                        months ago. They got caught, and go 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        on trial tomorrow. The leader is 
                        Imad Mugniyah’s brother.

                                 BARTHOLOMEW
                        Christ. You get the word out to all 
                        of the news agencies?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        They’ve been told not to leave 
                        their hotels without security.

                                 JOSH
                        Sir, how many Americans are still 
                        in Beirut?

                                 BARTHOLOMEW 
                        Around 200.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        We should evacuate them.

                                 BARTHOLOMEW
                        You think there’s going to be more 
                        kidnappings?

                                 BUCKLEY
                        I wouldn’t put anything past these 
                        guys. 

                                 BARTHOLOMEW 
                        I’ll talk to Schultz, but the last 
                        time I suggested it, the President 
                        shot it down. It’s hard to claim 
                        we’re making progress here if we’re 
                        evacuating our citizens.

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The power’s out and the only light comes from dozens of 
           candles scattered about the place. Josh, Toby and Buckley sit 
           around the table talking while Naseerah clears the dishes 
           away. Josh has had a few glasses of wine and is all riled up.

                                 JOSH
                        They took those reporters hostage 
                        because they think they can get 
                        away with anything. This is what 
                        happens when we don’t strike back.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Maybe they think they’re hitting 
                        you back.

           She takes some more dishes, and disappears into the kitchen.
                                 TOBY
                        Why would they be hitting us back? 
                        We haven’t done anything to them.

                                 NASEERAH (O.S.)
                        America’s been meddling in Iran for 
                        thirty years. The CIA staged a coup 
                        in 1953 and overthrew Mossadeq.

                                 JOSH
                        That doesn’t count. He was a 
                        communist.

           She comes back in with a cheesecake and some plates. She cuts 
           the cake, and passes out the slices. Toby hungrily digs in.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        The commie talk was CIA propaganda. 
                        Mossadeq was democratically elected 
                        and we overthrew him because he was 
                        going to jack up the price of oil.

                                 NASEERAH
                           (to Buckley)
                        Thank you.
                           (to Josh and Toby)
                        So you put a corrupt puppet in 
                        power and the people hated him.

                                 TOBY
                           (mouth full)
                        The Shah totally modernized the 
                        country. He gave rights to women.

                                 NASEERAH
                        He was also a tyrant. That’s why 
                        there was a revolution. But since 
                        he’d used his secret police to kill 
                        anyone who spoke out for democracy, 
                        there was no one left to take over 
                        except the Islamic radicals. Iran’s 
                        a mess, but it’s a mess America 
                        helped create.

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever. That doesn’t justify 
                        bombing the Embassy or the Marines. 

                                 NASEERAH
                        I’m not justifying it. I’m just 
                        telling you why they did it.
           EXT. BALCONY, NASEERAH’S APT. - NIGHT

           The city is completely blacked-out. Josh and Buckley watch 
           flashes of gunfire light up the night like lightning. 

                                 JOSH
                        We gave the President a smoking 
                        gun, and he didn’t do shit. I mean, 
                        what is he waiting for? A repeat of 
                        the fucking Alamo? 

                                 BUCKLEY
                        He doesn’t want war with Iran.

                                 JOSH
                        I got news for him: we’re already 
                        at war.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        That’s not the way they see it in 
                        Washington. This conflict’s at a 
                        low simmer, and they want to keep 
                        it that way. If it boils over into 
                        all out war, it could push Iran 
                        into the arms of the Soviets.

                                 JOSH
                        We have to take this into our own 
                        hands. It’s time to get dirty.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        You mean like farming out that 
                        airstrike to the French?

           Josh reacts. He didn’t know Buckley knew about that.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        You let Sanders play you. You’re 
                        too clever for your own good. 
                        Forget the dirty tricks.

                                 JOSH 
                        Oh, come on, Bill. We’re in the 
                        CIA. Dirty tricks is what we do.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        We tried that with Iran, and look 
                        where it got us. We work in secret, 
                        but we should conduct ourselves as 
                        if we didn’t. Don’t do anything 
                        you’d be ashamed of if it ever got 
                        out. Sanders has his rules, well, 
                        that’s my rule.
                                 JOSH
                        It’s kinda fucking corny. Sometimes 
                        you have to fight fire with fire.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Is that how we defeated the Nazis? 
                        By sinking to their level? The 
                        Soviets lost more troops in World 
                        War II than America, Britain, and 
                        France combined, but no one says 
                        the Soviets beat the Nazis. They 
                        say America did. You know why? 
                        Because the Soviets raped Berlin. 
                        Because the Soviets let half a 
                        million POWs starve to death. We 
                        treated people with respect and 
                        mercy, even our enemies, and the 
                        world has never forgotten it.

           Josh wavers. Buckley tries to make the most of the moment.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        Let me ask you something: How many 
                        agents do you have?

                                 JOSH 
                        Twenty. I’m close on a couple more.

                                 BUCKLEY
                        That’s more than twice what the 
                        rest of the staff has, combined. 
                        You’ve got the potential to be one 
                        of the best Case Officers the 
                        agency’s ever seen. I know you 
                        admire Sanders. He’s a hustler, and 
                        a damn good one, but hustlers don’t 
                        change the world. If you want to 
                        settle for that, that’s your 
                        choice. You’ll be a great spy. But 
                        my question is this: do you have 
                        what it takes to be more than that? 
                        Do you have what it takes to be a 
                        great man?

           We hold on Josh as Buckley’s words sink in.

           EXT. BUCKLEY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Josh pulls up and HONKS. He fiddles with the radio while he 
           waits. He HONKS again, and Buckley appears, munching on a 
           bagel. He picks up the paper, and heads toward Josh’s car.

           Behind him, SIX GUNMEN JUMP OUT OF A MERCEDES SEDAN.
                                 JOSH  
                        BILL! LOOK OUT!

           Buckley spins around, drawing his gun. He SHOOTS the first 
           guy, but the rest of the kidnappers swarm over him.

           Josh jumps out of the car, FIRING, and takes out two of the 
           kidnappers. They fire back, spraying Josh’s car with 
           AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE. Bystanders are SCREAMING and running for 
           cover. Several are hit by stray rounds and collapse.

           One kidnapper takes careful aim. Josh doesn’t know it yet, 
           but this is IMAD MUGNIYAH. The Faceless One. The Enforcer. 
           Mugniyah FIRES. JOSH IS HIT THREE TIMES AND GOES DOWN HARD. 

           He lays writhing in the street, clutching his chest. The 
           kevlar vest has saved his life. His shoulder’s been hit, and 
           blood pours down his arm. He fumbles to reload while the 
           kidnappers dump Buckley in the trunk, and dive into the car. 

           Josh FIRES, blowing out the windows. The car ROARS up the 
           street, straight at him. He empties the clip into the 
           windshield, then jumps out of the way. 

           The car SCREECHES around the corner and disappears. Josh 
           scrambles into his car and races after the kidnappers.

           EXT. STREETS OF BEIRUT - DAY

           A high-speed chase ensues, the cars weaving through traffic. 
           Josh rams the Mercedes, but the gunmen FIRE out the windows 
           at him and he’s forced to turn onto a side street.

           In an overhead shot, we see him race ahead on a parallel 
           street, then make a wild turn, sliding around the corner. 

           The two cars, travelling at right angles to each other, speed 
           toward the same intersection on a collision course. As the 
           Mercedes enters the intersection, Josh floors it. He’s going 
           to T-bone the Mercedes at full speed. 

           He races through the red light, straight at the driver’s 
           door. But as he crosses traffic a car in the other lane SLAMS 
           into him. The crash sends both cars SPINNING out of control.

           As the kidnappers speed away unscathed, we see Josh, face 
           covered with blood, slumped over the wheel, unconscious.

           INT. BULLPEN, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Sanders is on the phone, barking out orders. He’s as close to 
           panicked as we’ll ever see.
                                 SANDERS
                        No this is not a joke, and it’s not 
                        a drill. The Station Chief has been 
                        kidnapped, and we have another 
                        agent wounded, possibly dead. 

           Toby and a dozen Marines come running in, armed to the teeth.

                                 TOBY
                        Which hospital did they take him 
                        to?

                                 SANDERS 
                        I don’t know. Just find him before 
                        Mugniyah does.

           Toby and the Marines run out.

                                 SANDERS
                           (into phone)
                        We need a Delta Force team 
                        dispatched to Beirut immediately.
                           (...)
                        Then pull him out of the fucking 
                        meeting!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, BEIRUT - NIGHT

           Josh lays in bed with tubes in his nose and arms, Sanders and 
           Toby at his bedside. Armed Marines stand watch at the door.

                                 SANDERS
                        We emptied the safe, handed out 
                        over a hundred grand. We’ve got 
                        every militia, snitch and scumbag 
                        in the city looking for him.

                                 TOBY
                        Delta Force is on alert, but 
                        there’s nothing they can do until 
                        we find where they’re holding him.

           Josh looks half-dead. He speaks in a raspy WHISPER.

                                 JOSH
                        Pasdaran... Barracks.

                                 TOBY
                        The Pentagon moved a spy satellite 
                        over the barracks. We’re watching 
                        it around the clock, but so far 
                        there’s no sign of Bill.
                                 JOSH
                        Don’t... wait. Hit it... now.

                                 SANDERS
                        The candy-asses in Washington won’t 
                        do shit until we can prove he’s in 
                        there. It’s too “risky.”

           Josh looks totally despondent.

                                 TOBY
                        Don’t worry, dude. He’ll be back at 
                        his desk before you know it.

           An aerial shot of the wooded campus.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CIA HQ - DAY

           Under the words HOSTAGE LOCATING TASK FORCE, an entire wall 
           has been devoted to the SIX Americans being held hostage in 
           Beirut. There are photos, biographical details, maps, etc.

           We pan across the photos (Terry Anderson, missing 384 days; 
           Jeremy Levin, 384 days; Bill Buckley, 381 days; Ben Weir, 308 
           days; Lawrence Jenco, 184 days; and David Jacobsen, 65 days) 
           and settle on Josh, Toby, Sanders, and TWO MEN in suits 
           picking over a spread of stale donuts.

           The first man, MCFARLANE, is a short bulldog in his 50s.

                                 MCFARLANE
                        I love these with the sprinkles on 
                        ‘em.

           SUPER: ROBERT “BUD” MCFARLANE, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

                                 TOBY
                           (to second man)
                        Colonel North, I don’t know if you 
                        remember me, but I took your 
                        survival class. Okinawa, 1979. You 
                        chewed me out for wearing a Led 
                        Zeppelin T-shirt. 
           You may remember OLIVER NORTH’S gap-tooth grin, but instead 
           of his Marine Corps uniform he wears a dapper silver suit. 

                                 NORTH 
                        Hmm, yeah, no. It’s not coming to 
                        me. I trained a lot of guys.

                                 TOBY
                        That’s okay. Your class was fucking 
                        awesome. Sir.

                                 NORTH
                        Stand down, Marine. We’re out of 
                        uniform. And call me Larry. It’s my 
                        middle name.

           North takes a bite out of a donut, and gets powdered sugar 
           all over his mouth. We FREEZE FRAME on his oblivious grin.

           SUPER: LT. COLONEL OLIVER “LARRY” NORTH

           Josh looks on impatiently. He isn’t the same man we last saw. 
           He’s recovered from his wounds, and put on a lot of muscle. 
           There’s an intensity about him that wasn’t there before. A 
           steeliness in his eyes, and in his demeanor.

           Just then Casey storms in, face flushed, in a foul mood.

                                 CASEY
                        Fucking hell! I just heard 
                        Hizb’allah kidnapped another 
                        Goddamn American from the 
                        university this morning. What the 
                        fuck is happening over there? 
                        I thought we were paying for extra 
                        security? Christ in a sidecar!

                                 SANDERS
                        They were disguised as cops. Said 
                        they wanted to give him some tips 
                        on how to avoid being kidnapped.

                                 CASEY
                        They’ve got balls, I’ll give ‘em 
                        that. Cocksuckers! Have we heard 
                        anything? Any demands?

                                 SANDERS
                        Same old shit. They want to trade 
                        the hostages for the Dawa 17.

                        Over my dead body. The Dawa 17 
                        tried to blow up our Embassy in 
                        Kuwait for Christ’s sake.

                                 CASEY
                        Are we going to sit here all day 
                        chit-chatting like a sewing circle? 
                        Where’s this Goddamn presentation?

           MOMENTS LATER - IT’S DARK

           Josh is narrating a slide show. Photos of the hostages, the 
           Pasdaran Barracks, etc., are projected onto a screen.

                                 JOSH
                        This is the married men’s quarters 
                        at the Pasdaran Barracks before 
                        Bill Buckley’s kidnapping-
                           (next slide)
                        And after. As you can see, all of 
                        the windows have been blacked out, 
                        and guards have been posted at all 
                        the exits. We have numerous 
                        secondhand sources that tell us 
                        Bill’s being held in this building.

                                 TOBY
                        Our best hope of saving him is a 
                        rescue mission. We hit the barracks 
                        and take him by force.

                                 NORTH
                        Delta Force won’t launch unless 
                        they can have eyes on the hostages 
                        for 24 hours, and you don’t even 
                        know if they’re in there.

                                 CASEY
                        When Carter sent Delta Force into 
                        Iran they lost eight guys and 
                        didn’t free a single hostage. No 
                        one wants a repeat of that 
                        clusterfuck. This is too dicey. The 
                        Chiefs will never go for it.

           But Josh, Toby and Sanders have anticipated this.

                                 SANDERS
                        That’s why we’re going to do it 
                        ourselves.
           Casey, McFarlane and North exchange a look, intrigued. 
           Sanders nods to Josh. A slide of Bashar Karam, the Phalange 
           maniac Sanders sold the night-vision goggles to, comes up.

                                 JOSH
                        This is Bashar Karam. He’s one of 
                        the top men in the Phalange 
                        militia. He’s offered to handpick 
                        his best fighters and create a 
                        secret paramilitary rescue team. 
                        We’d train them, and once we locate 
                        Bill, we’d launch our own raid on-

                                 MCFARLANE
                        For Christ’s sake, the Phalange 
                        carried out the massacre at Sabra 
                        and Chatila. They’re maniacs! 

                                 JOSH
                        Well, we’re fighting maniacs, sir.
                        The kidnappers are the same guys 
                        who blew up our Embassy, and killed 
                        241 Marines.

                                 MCFARLANE
                        Son, I know exactly who they are.

           Casey observes the exchange. He likes Josh’s pluck. Toby 
           steps in and tries to get things back on track.

                                 TOBY
                        The Israelis have agreed to provide 
                        air support. They’ll take out these 
                        buildings here, here, and here with 
                        laser-guided bombs, killing the 
                        Iranian troops while they sleep.

                                 MCFARLANE
                        What’s plan B if the Israelis miss 
                        or get shot down?

           Josh and Toby don’t answer. There is no plan B.

                                 CASEY
                        And we have no other options?

           No one answers. Casey SIGHS and flips on the lights.

                                 CASEY
                        Let’s talk turkey. You all know the 
                        law. Before we can carry out any 
                        covert action the President has to 
                        notify Congress, and Congress will 
                        kill this faster than you can say 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CASEY (CONT'D)
                        cock-a-doodle-do. We’re going to 
                        have to do this off the books. 
                        We’ll raise the money using some of 
                        Buck’s operations. I want proof 
                        Bill’s in there before we launch 
                        the raid. That’s my only condition. 
                        Other than that, I don’t care if 
                        you hire the Phalange, the Knights 
                        Templar, or the Goddamn Harlem 
                        Globetrotters. Just find him and 
                        get him out. Do whatever it takes.

           THE TRAINING MONTAGE

           “Rebel Yell” by Billy Idol PLAYS OVER the following:

           - Josh, Toby and North inspect the Phalange fighters. They’re 
           a rough bunch, stone-cold killers with blank expressions.

           - North SHOUTS at the men as they run through an obstacle 
           course with Josh and Toby FIRING guns over their heads.

           - Mugniyah and his men surveil the second US Embassy from a 
           nearby rooftop. 

           - Josh, Toby, North and the Phalange go over aerial photos of 
           the Pasdaran Barracks, looking for entry points. 

           - At the real barracks, Mugniyah looks on as a van practices 
           zigzagging through a mock-up of the concrete barriers in the 
           driveway of the second US Embassy.

           - In an empty warehouse, the rescue team storms in. Human-
           shaped targets pop-up and the team blows them away, including 
           the ones clearly intended to represent hostages.

           EXT. SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           A quiet morning in East Beirut. A van turns into the Embassy 
           driveway, accelerates, and CRASHES through the steel gate. 
           The driver weaves through the concrete barriers with expert 
           precision, closing in on the building...

           At the entrance, TWO MARINES open fire, killing the driver. 
           The van rolls to a stop. The Marines creep closer...

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North, Sanders and the other agents are eating 
           lunch when a FIREBALL BLOWS THE WINDOWS IN, spraying them 
           with glass. Coughing, cut and bleeding, the staff stumbles 
           out. Behind them, the outer wall collapses and falls away.
           EXT. SECOND US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, Sanders and North stand around, watching 
           emergency workers extinguish burning cars and collect body 
           parts. Josh points to the parking garage under the building.

                                 JOSH
                        If he’d made it into the garage, 
                        the bomb would’ve brought the whole 
                        damn building down.

           Off their grim looks...

           EXT. THIRD US EMBASSY, BEIRUT - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           Amidst battle-scarred buildings we settle on the third and 
           final embassy, a windowless bunker surrounded by guard 
           towers, steel walls, razor wire, and machine-gun nests.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Several case officers put the Hostage Locating Task Force 
           board and the Hizb’allah hierarchy pyramid up on the wall. 
           Others are getting settled in, setting up their desks, etc.

           Josh sets up Buckley’s Revolutionary War diorama. He brushes 
           some debris off the battlefield as Toby and North walk over.

                                 TOBY
                        Bashar called. He wants a meeting.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Josh, Toby and North get geared up to go out. They strap on 
           kevlar vests, and stash an assortment of weapons in their 
           clothes. Guns, knives, clips of ammo. Last, they wrap their 
           heads in checkered keffiyehs, so only their eyes are visible.

           The other guys watch them like they’re rock stars. 

                                 CIA GUYS
                        Good luck, guys. Watch your backs.

           IN THE BASEMENT

           Josh, Toby and North come down the stairs. Two Marines guard 
           a heavy steel door. They open it, revealing a TUNNEL. 

           INT. BASEMENT, BOMBED-OUT BUILDING - DAY

           A fake slab of concrete is pushed aside, and Josh, Toby and 
           North emerge from the tunnel, guns at the ready.

           GROUND LEVEL
           Josh, Toby and North slink through the ruins. Through a 
           gaping hole we can see the Embassy ACROSS THE STREET. The men 
           peer out a door into an alley. All clear.

           EXT. STREET, BEIRUT - CONTINUOUS

           The guys emerge from the alley and slip on sunglasses. 
           They’re just three thugs going about their business.

           INT. BASHAR’S WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Bashar’s lair. Phalange thugs are hanging out, cleaning their 
           weapons, etc. THUG #1 leads Josh, Toby and North down a hall 
           to a steel door. 

                                 THUG #1
                        Wait here.

           On the other side of the door, SOMEONE IS SCREAMING IN AGONY. 
           Josh, Toby and North exchange uncomfortable glances.

                                 NORTH
                        Does he know we’re here?

           But Thug #1 is already gone. Josh, Toby and North try to 
           ignore the intermittent SCREAMING.

                                 TOBY
                        So Rocky IV opens on Friday. Who do 
                        you think’s going to win? Rocky or 
                        the Soviet dude?

                                 NORTH
                        I used to box a little. 

                                 TOBY
                        Get out of here.

           North throws a couple of punches in Toby’s direction. Toby 
           puts up his dukes. North starts dancing around.

                                 NORTH
                        Watch it, Marine. I took the 
                        Brigade Championship at Annapolis.

           ANOTHER AGONIZED SCREAM. Then a GUNSHOT RINGS OUT and the 
           screaming stops. Toby and North freeze.

           The door opens and Bashar emerges with blood on his shirt.

                                 BASHAR
                        I’m sorry to keep you waiting. The 
                        team is making good progress, no? 
                                 NORTH
                        I’d say another month and they’ll 
                        be ready.

                                 BASHAR
                        I told you, my men are the best 
                        fighters in all of Lebanon. They 
                        are willing to risk their lives for 
                        the American hostages, but...
                           (shaking his head)
                        I wonder if you’re just using us?

                                 JOSH
                        America and the Phalange go back 
                        decades. We’ve stood by you through 
                        thick and thin, even after the 
                        thing with the refugees, so-

                                 BASHAR
                        Then where is the Semtex you 
                        promised? We’ve been waiting for 
                        weeks. This is not a game. We’re in 
                        a war here.

                                 JOSH
                        I know, and we’re working on it. 
                        But we can’t just buy 800 pounds of 
                        high explosives at the local 7-11.

           Bashar feigns sympathy. He’s a good actor.

                                 BASHAR
                        Of course. I understand. I hope 
                        this doesn’t effect the mission, 
                        but I’m going to have to pull some 
                        of my men off the team and put them 
                        back on the front lines. Just a 
                        few. No more than a dozen.

                                 JOSH
                        Whoa, hang on. We’re short-handed 
                        as it is.

                                 TOBY
                        We can’t pull off an assault like 
                        this with fifty men. It’s crazy.

                                 BASHAR
                        I’m sorry, but I have no choice. 
                        We’re fighting for our lives here.

                                 NORTH
                        What about our previous offer? A 
                        hundred grand is more than enough- 
                                 BASHAR
                        It’s not about the money. The 
                        Syrians took out our supplier with 
                        a car bomb. His whole family. Poof.

           Josh looks to North and Toby. North shrugs: what can we do?

                                 JOSH
                        We’ll see what we can do. In the 
                        meantime, don’t pull anyone off the 
                        team. Alright?

           Bashar nods, placated.

           EXT. BASHAR’S WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Josh, Toby and North climb into Toby’s jeep.

                                 NORTH
                        I’ll call General Secord when we 
                        get back to the office. He can get 
                        his hands on anything.

                                 JOSH
                        Larry, we can’t give him 800 pounds 
                        of explosives. For now, let’s just 
                        keep stalling him.

                                 TOBY
                        And when we can’t stall him any 
                        longer?

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know.

           EXT. BEIRUT MARINA - DAY

           Most of the slips are empty, but there’s still a few boats 
           left. Josh, Toby and North walk down the dock toward one of 
           the bigger yachts.

                                 NORTH
                        I’m telling you, this guy has 
                        connections in Iran up the wazoo.

           On the deck, oiled up and naked except for a speedo and some 
           gold chains, MANUCHER GHORBANIFAR appears and waves.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Larry! Josh! Toby! Welcome!

           This is the Iranian guy who sold Josh the bogus tip about the 
           Libyan plan to assassinate President Reagan.
                                 JOSH
                        Please tell me you didn’t bring me 
                        all the way out here for this guy.

           EXT. YACHT, BEIRUT MARINA - DAY

           Josh, Toby, and North sit with Ghorbanifar, who’s sipping a 
           piña colada. Two SWEDISH MODELS lounge around in bikinis.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Iran is desperate for weapons. They 
                        want what you’re selling to Saddam.

                                 JOSH
                        Why can’t we just pay them, and let 
                        them buy weapons from the Soviets?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        They want the best. They want 
                        American. Look, my friends, this is 
                        the deal of a lifetime: 500 TOW 
                        missiles for all of the hostages, 
                        including Mr. Buckley. And, as a 
                        bonus, the Ayatollah will step 
                        down, and hand the government over 
                        to the moderates. Just think of it: 
                        America and Iran, back in business.

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North and Sanders discuss Ghorbanifar’s proposal.

                                 SANDERS 
                        It’s got potential, but what about 
                        the arms embargo? It’s illegal to 
                        sell weapons to Iran.

                                 NORTH
                        So we have Israel sell Iran some of 
                        their old missiles, then we sell 
                        Israel new ones to replace them. 

                                 SANDERS 
                        We can’t get missiles from Defense, 
                        even for Israel, unless the 
                        President signs a Finding, and once 
                        that Finding goes to Congress, 
                        they’re going to know we’re up to 
                        something.

                                 NORTH
                        The law says we have to notify 
                        Congress, but it doesn’t say when. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NORTH (CONT'D)
                        So we sit on the Finding until we 
                        get the hostages out.

                                 JOSH
                        We don’t even know if Ghorbanifar 
                        can deliver. He’s a con artist 
                        looking to make a big score. Not to 
                        mention he failed every question on 
                        the polygraph except for his name.

                                 NORTH
                        This polygraph?

           North picks up the report, and feeds it into a shredder.

                                 SANDERS
                        Josh is right. Ghorbanifar’s a 
                        loose cannon. What are we going to 
                        do if this whole thing blows up in 
                        our faces?

                                 NORTH
                        Then we shred the Finding, and no 
                        one will be the wiser.

           Sanders thinks it over.

                                 JOSH
                        This is a bad idea, Buck. Iran 
                        needs a constant flow of weapons 
                        for their war with Iraq. This is 
                        only going to encourage them to 
                        take more hostages.

                                 TOBY
                        Besides, the contact person in Iran 
                        is the sonofabitch who ordered the 
                        attack on our Embassy in Kuwait. 
                        These guys are total hardliners.

                                 NORTH
                        The President doesn’t have to know 
                        that. We tell him we’re dealing 
                        with a moderate faction. If we back 
                        them now, we keep Iran’s oil away 
                        from the Soviets later. The 
                        moderates will end the war with 
                        Iraq, and the President will get 
                        the credit. Heck, he could end up 
                        winning the Nobel Peace Prize!
                                 JOSH
                        Larry, that’s ridiculous. You don’t 
                        get the Nobel Peace Prize for 
                        arming both sides in a war!

                                 NORTH
                        I know that, I’m just saying that’s 
                        how we sell it to the President.

           “Money for Nothing” by Dire Straits PLAYS over:

           EXT. ISRAELI AIRFIELD - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North and Sanders watch a forklift load the 
           missiles into a large 4-prop cargo plane. Ghorbanifar, in 
           full camouflage and a beret, walks around, smiling and 
           slapping hands with everyone.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Everyone in Reagan’s cabinet hated 
                        the proposal except McFarlane and 
                        Casey. They managed to get Larry 
                        some face time with the President, 
                        and somehow Larry talked him into 
                        the damn thing.

                                 TOBY
                        What if this whole thing’s a trap, 
                        and they take us hostage?

           Sanders hands them each a small tin. Josh opens his. Inside 
           is a large glass pill.

                                 SANDERS
                        Cyanide. Bite down on it, and 
                        inhale. It’s a quick death.

           Josh and Toby exchange a look. North claps Josh on the back.

                                 NORTH
                        Some day, this is going to make us 
                        famous. Good luck!

           INT. COCKPIT, C-130 - FLYING - DAY

           Josh is at the controls, Toby in the copilot's seat. They’re 
           circling over the Iranian desert. Ghorbanifar wrestles with a 
           large topographical map, trying to figure out where they are. 

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        The airfield is supposed to be 
                        right here!
                                 JOSH
                        Well, it’s not. We’ve circled 
                        around for an hour, and we’re out 
                        of fuel. I have to set her down.

           As the engines SPUTTER, Josh starts their descent.

           EXT. HIGHWAY, IRANIAN DESERT - DAY

           A car bails off the road as the C-130 drops out of the sky 
           and touches down. It bounces hard, then rolls to a stop.

           HOURS LATER

           Josh, Toby and Ghorbanifar sit under the wing, playing UNO. 

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Uno!

           Toby grabs Ghorbanifar’s last card. It’s actually three cards 
           aligned to look like one. 

                                 TOBY
                        You cheating bastard!

           Ghorbanifar grins sheepishly. Josh spots a plume of dust 
           rising on the horizon.

                                 JOSH  
                        Hey, somebody’s coming.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sunlight spills into a crate as a soldier pries the lid open, 
           revealing a rusty missile emblazoned with the Star of David. 
           “YOUR FATHER IS A JEW!” is spray-painted along its length.

           Josh and Toby look on, held at gunpoint. AN IRANIAN OFFICER 
           starts YELLING at Ghorbanifar in FARSI. He pounds the missile 
           with his fist, and one of the tail fins falls off. Shocked, 
           the Officer pauses, then starts YELLING even louder.

           EXT. GHORBANIFAR’S YACHT, COAST OF BEIRUT - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North, Sanders and Ghorbanifar meet.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        They considered the Israeli 
                        markings profanity against Islam.

                                 NORTH
                        Well, the missiles were from the 
                        Israeli arsenal. That was the deal.
                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        They were junk! We tested one, and 
                        it went up a few hundred feet then 
                        crashed down on top of us! We were 
                        nearly killed! Tell him, Josh!

                                 JOSH
                        It’s true.

                                 NORTH
                        Look, if they want different 
                        missiles, we can talk.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Talk?! They are furious! It’s over!

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Josh is translating some documents. Naseerah walks over and 
           kisses the top of his head.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I’m going to bed.

           Josh nods without looking up.

                                 NASEERAH
                        When was the last time you got more 
                        than four hours sleep?

           Josh just shakes his head. He can’t remember.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Subburah and her husband just got 
                        back from this resort in Egypt. She 
                        said it was really nice. Maybe we 
                        could take a few days off and go.

                                 JOSH
                        I can’t.

                                 NASEERAH
                        You need a break. It’d just be-

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t have time for a fucking 
                        vacation. Bill’s being tortured in 
                        a dungeon somewhere, and you want 
                        me to work on my tan?

                                 NASEERAH 
                        You think you’re the only one who 
                        cares about Bill? Well, I care too.

                        My brother’s been in an Israeli 
                        prison for over three years. I 
                        don’t know if I’m ever going to see 
                        him again. I pray to God that I 
                        will. But in the meantime, I’m 
                        trying to do what Hamad would want 
                        me to do which is to live my life.
                           (gently)
                        People disappear here all the time. 
                        This is Beirut.

           Josh just stares off, not wanting to accept it. Naseerah 
           tries to comfort him, but he doesn’t react.

           EXT. PHALANGE TRAINING CAMP - DAY

           Sanders and Toby lean against La Bandita, watching Josh and  
           Bashar having a HEATED ARGUMENT in the distance. North tries 
           to calm them down. A few dozen Phalange goons mill about.

                                 SANDERS
                        Doesn’t look good, does it?

                                 TOBY
                        Nope.

           Josh and North come trudging over.

                                 JOSH
                        He pulled half the guys off the 
                        team and says he’s not putting them 
                        back on until he gets the Semtex.

                                 SANDERS
                        I thought you had this guy under 
                        control?

           Josh doesn’t answer. Sanders chews on it for a minute. Then:

                                 SANDERS
                        Don't get it from any of our guys. 
                        Get it from the Libyans. Use a cut-
                        out. If this thing goes south, I 
                        don't want it coming back to us.

           Everyone nods grimly. This is the price of doing business.

                                 SANDERS
                        If he hasn’t used it by the time we 
                        get the hostages out, we can try to 
                        get it back. That’s all we can do.
                                 NORTH
                           (to Josh)
                        Let me handle this.

           North walks over to where Bashar and his men are standing. 
           Sanders turns to Josh and Toby.

                                 SANDERS 
                        We gotta raise some money. Fast. I 
                        got a shitload of Uzis on the cheap 
                        from the Israelis awhile back. Some 
                        joker up in Athens has been trying 
                        to buy them off me for six months. 
                        You think you can handle it?

           Josh and Toby nod. Off their looks we SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BEIRUT STREET - PLANE CRASH - DAY

           We’re back to the FREEZE FRAME of Josh and Toby, covered head-
           to-toe in cocaine, gawking at the packages of drugs. We 
           resume action and Josh SNEEZES.

                                 TOBY
                        I see why people like this stuff. I 
                        feel like I could take on every 
                        guerilla in the city. 

           Josh spots a DOZEN GUERILLAS in keffiyehs coming down the 
           street toward them. They’re all carrying AK-47s.

                                 JOSH
                        You just might get your chance.

           The guerillas OPEN FIRE. Josh and Toby take cover behind the 
           wreckage, fishing their guns out of the cockpit. Bullets 
           THUNK and PING off the fuselage. Josh and Toby return FIRE.

           We HEAR an OMINOUS RUMBLE. A TANK rounds the corner, joining 
           the guerillas. Its turret rotates toward Josh and Toby.

                                 TOBY 
                        Down!

           They DIVE away from the plane as the tank FIRES. Behind them, 
           the wreckage EXPLODES into a million pieces. Josh and Toby 
           pick themselves up and take off running for their lives.

           EXT. THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           A taxi pulls up and Josh and Toby get out.
           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           The staff stares at Josh and Toby as they walk through the 
           bullpen, still covered in white powder.

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Sanders is on the phone when Josh and Toby walk in. Josh 
           tosses a packet of coke onto his desk.

                                 SANDERS
                        I gotta call you back.

           He hangs up the phone, shoves the coke into a desk drawer, 
           and shuts the door. Josh and Toby glare at him in silence.

                                 SANDERS
                        What happened? 

                                 JOSH
                        The drugs got blown up by a tank.

                                 SANDERS
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        Well, first we got shot down by a 
                        surface-to-air missile, and nearly 
                        died. Then the thing with the tank 
                        happened.

                                 SANDERS 
                        Alright, you’re pissed, I can see 
                        that.

                                 TOBY
                        You lied to us.

                                 SANDERS
                        I wanted to give you plausible 
                        deniability in case anything went 
                        wrong.

                                 TOBY
                        You mean in case we were arrested 
                        and thrown in jail for drug 
                        trafficking!

                                 SANDERS
                        We’re out of money. Alright? We 
                        can’t go to Congress, and the arms 
                        deals are off, so I’m going to do 
                        whatever it takes to keep the 
                        rescue team going. If you two want 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANDERS (CONT'D)
                        out, fine. There’s the door. We’ll 
                        save Bill without you. 

           Toby turns and storms out. Josh swallows his anger.

                                 JOSH
                        How soon can you get more?

                                 SANDERS
                        I don’t know. Couple of days.

                                 JOSH
                        Get it.

                                 SANDERS 
                        What about Toby?

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll talk to him.

           INT. BAR, COMMODORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Toby’s drinking by himself. Josh walks in and sits down next 
           to him. Toby’s looking at a photo of the CIA guys partying.

                                 TOBY
                        Remember that night? You’d just 
                        recruited your first agent. 
                        Everybody was wasted, even Jackson. 
                        Remember when Bear almost started a 
                        bar brawl with those French 
                        peacekeepers? If the Marines hadn’t 
                        been there to back us up... The 
                        next morning I was so hung over, it 
                        took Sanders 20 minutes to get me 
                        out of bed. That’s why we weren’t 
                        at the office when the bomb hit. 
                        That’s why I lived and they didn’t. 
                           (beat)
                        What are we doing, Josh?

                                 JOSH
                        We’re trying to save our friend.

                                 TOBY
                        I saw this shit in Vietnam, man. I 
                        promised myself: never again.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s just until we get Bill out. 
                        You remember when Luke blew up the 
                        Death Star? It was only because Han 
                        Solo swooped in and saved his ass.

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        We’re a team, man. I can’t do this 
                        without you.

           EXT. ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           It’s pouring rain. Four thugs in soccer jerseys transfer the 
           crates of drugs from a new Cessna to a van. Josh and Toby, 
           soaking wet, look on grimly.

           EXT. PASDARAN MOCK-UP - DAY

           Dozens of carpenters are hammering and sawing, erecting a 
           full-scale replica of the Pasdaran barracks out of plywood. 

           Amidst the piles of lumber, we find Josh, Toby and North 
           meeting with Bashar and his men. THEY’RE GATHERED AROUND TWO 
           DOZEN CRATES STAMPED “DANGER! HIGH EXPLOSIVES!”

           Bashar examines the blocks of plastic explosive inside one of 
           the crates and nods, satisfied.

                                 BASHAR
                        I knew you could do it if you put 
                        your mind to it. Unfortunately, we 
                        have another problem. Sheik 
                        Fadlallah is planning to announce 
                        Hizb’allah is moving into politics. 

                                 TOBY
                        Who the fuck is Fadlallah?

                                 JOSH
                        He’s the most important shi’ite 
                        cleric in Lebanon.

                                 BASHAR
                        With his influence, Hizb’allah 
                        could end up sweeping the election 
                        and taking over Parliament.

                                 JOSH
                        So rig the election.

                                 BASHAR
                        The shi’ites are the majority. 
                        Everyone would know it was rigged. 
                        We must find a way to ruin his 
                        credibility with the people.

                                 TOBY
                        We could start a rumor he’s into 
                        little boys.
                                 BASHAR
                        Maybe. Fadlallah’s popularity 
                        derives from his charities, the 
                        orphanages, the clinics. What if we 
                        tamper with the medicines he gives 
                        to the poor?

                                 JOSH
                        We’ve made enough stupid mistakes, 
                        we’re not going to add poisoning a 
                        bunch of kids to the list.

                                 NORTH
                           (to Josh and Toby)
                        What if we poison Fadlallah with a 
                        depilatory agent like thallium, 
                        make his beard fall out? It worked 
                        on Castro.

                                 TOBY
                        What? No it didn’t!

                                 BASHAR
                        A Muslim cleric without a beard - 
                        he will look like a fool! He will 
                        be disgraced forever. I love it!

                                 NORTH
                        We could send him a poisoned 
                        Qu’ran. Heck, while we’re at it, 
                        let’s send one to the Ayatollah 
                        Khomeini in Iran!

           Bashar and North LAUGH and do an awkward high-five.

                                 BASHAR
                        This is genius. We must put this 
                        plan into action immediately.

                                 JOSH
                        We’ll look into it. But until we 
                        rescue the hostages, I need you to 
                        keep a low-profile. So don’t do 
                        anything stupid. Understand?
                           (beat, sternly)
                        I’m serious, Bashar. Don’t fuck me.

           Bashar isn’t used to being lectured in front of his men.

                                 BASHAR
                        Watch how you speak to me, my 
                        friend. Or I might poison you and 
                        make your dick fall off.
           Bashar and his men burst into MANIACAL LAUGHTER.

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

           Josh, Toby, and North sprint through the airport. 

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Our inability to get the hostages 
                        out had become so embarrassing, 
                        third parties like the Church of 
                        England started stepping in to see 
                        if they could help. It was like the  
                        Peace Corps coming in to save the 
                        Green Berets. The Church’s special 
                        envoy, Terry Waite, was flying to 
                        Beirut to hear Hizb’allah’s 
                        demands. He had the potential to be 
                        a gold mine of information but, in 
                        typical fashion, we couldn’t even 
                        get to the fucking airport on time.

           Josh, Toby, and North are at the ticket counter, panting.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        I’m sorry, sir. That flight has 
                        already pushed back from the gate.

                                 NORTH
                        Ma’am, I’m with the National 
                        Security Council of the United 
                        States, and we have a personal 
                        message for Mr. Waite from 
                        President Ronald Reagan.

           She picks up the phone. North looks over at Josh and WINKS.

           EXT. RUNWAY, HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

           A 747 idles on the runway. Frustrated travellers peer out the 
           windows, glaring at what’s delaying them: Josh, Toby and 
           North talking to TERRY WAITE on the runway. 

           Waite, 40s, is a tall, bearded Englishman with a mop of curly 
           hair. He hands a photo of Buckley back to Josh and SHOUTS 
           over the ROARING jet engines.

                                 WAITE
                        I can’t do anything that might 
                        jeopardize the position of the 
                        Church as an impartial negotiator. 
                        I’m very sorry.
                                 JOSH
                        We’re not asking you to spy for us, 
                        we’re just asking you to find out 
                        how our friend’s doing. That’s all. 
                        Just ask how he is. Please.

           Waite mulls it over, then reluctantly nods “yes.”

           INT. BAR, COMMODORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Mostly empty. Josh and Naseerah talk by the jukebox. Josh 
           looks for a song.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I want to ask you something off the 
                        record. Are you working with Bashar 
                        Karam and the Phalange?

                                 JOSH
                        Where’d you hear that?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Friend of a friend. She says 
                        Bashar’s running all over town 
                        saying he’s working with the CIA.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, he’s lying. 
                           (re: jukebox)
                        Where the hell’s “Rock Me Amadeus?”

                                 NASEERAH
                        During the massacre at Sabra and 
                        Chatila, one of Bashar’s men took 
                        50 women and children prisoner. He 
                        radioed Bashar and asked what to 
                        do. Bashar told him to kill them, 
                        and to never interrupt him again 
                        with such a stupid question.

           Josh finally looks up and makes eye contact with her.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I’m not asking you to blow an 
                        operation, or to go on the record. 
                        I’m just asking between you and me: 
                        are you working with him?

                                 JOSH
                        I already told you. The answer’s 
                        no.

           She knows he’s lying, and he knows she knows it.
                                 NASEERAH
                        Always deny everything, right?

           She glares at him, hurt, and walks away.

           INT. HALLWAY, NASEERAH’S APARTMENT BLDG. - NIGHT

           Josh knocks. No one answers. He knocks again, louder. 
           Naseerah finally opens the door, but doesn’t let him in.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry about earlier. I really 
                        am, but I can’t talk about that 
                        stuff. 

           She says nothing. Josh digs deep. It isn’t easy for him.

                                 JOSH
                        I love you, Naseerah. I want us to 
                        be happy. Please. Don’t make this 
                        about us.

           She searches his face and sees he means it. She steps aside 
           and lets him in. The door shuts and we DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Josh, Toby and North wait anxiously. There’s a CODED KNOCK at 
           the door and Josh opens it. Terry Waite’s standing there 
           clutching a bed sheet around his otherwise naked body.

                                 TOBY 
                        Dude, what happened to your 
                        clothes?

                                 WAITE
                        They made me strip, then threw my 
                        clothes out the bloody window.

           LATER

           Waite updates Josh, Toby and North on his meeting.

                                 WAITE
                        ...Mugniyah wouldn’t let me see any 
                        of the hostages, but he assured me 
                        they were all in good health. He’s 
                        determined to trade them for the 
                        Dawa 17. He was quite emphatic 
                        about that. If we can get Kuwait to 
                        play ball, I think we just might be 
                        able to get your man out.
           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh and Toby confer with Sanders. North is on the phone.

                                 SANDERS
                        If this church mouse can make a 
                        deal we won’t get in the way, but 
                        the President’s position is firm. 
                        We don’t negotiate, and we don’t 
                        pay ransom. If they kidnap Santa 
                        Claus, we’ll cancel Christmas 
                        before we give in to these pricks.

           North hangs up the phone.

                                 NORTH 
                        That was Ghorbanifar. The Iranians 
                        decided to give us another chance.

                                 TOBY
                        Isn’t selling missiles to Iran like 
                        paying a ransom?

                                 SANDERS
                        No. It’s a bribe. It’s different.

           Off Josh and Toby’s skeptical look we CUT TO:

           EXT. IRANIAN AIRFIELD - DAY

           A C-130 taxis over to the terminal and stops. A banner strung 
           across the building reads: “AMERICA CANNOT DO A DAMN THING.”

           Josh, Toby, North and Ghorbanifar climb out of the plane. 
           North is carrying a chocolate cake. Josh sees it.

                                 JOSH
                        I told you to leave that in the 
                        plane. It’s Ramadan. They’re 
                        fasting. You’re going to insult 
                        them.

                                 NORTH
                        It’s a friendship cake. Who doesn’t 
                        like cake?

           They walk over to the waiting Iranian delegation, and 
           Ghorbanifar motions to the cake, EXPLAINING IN FARSI. An 
           IRANIAN OFFICIAL spits on the cake, then CURSES North.

           LATER
           The Iranians inspect the gleaming missiles. They seem 
           pleased. The soldiers present Ghorbanifar with three 
           suitcases. He opens them, revealing MILLIONS IN CASH.

           INT. HANGAR, BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North and Sanders are talking.

                                 NORTH
                        They’re going to release Buckley 
                        tomorrow morning. They’ll call and 
                        tell us where to pick him up.

                                 SANDERS
                        SEAL Team Six is on standby in 
                        Cyprus. Once we get Buckley’s 
                        position, they’ll make the grab. If 
                        this is some kind of double-cross, 
                        these assholes are going to be in 
                        for the surprise of a lifetime.

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Naseerah’s curled up next to Josh, sleeping. Josh is wide 
           awake, staring at the ceiling.

           3 AM - Josh sits on the edge of the bed, waiting.

           5 AM - It’s still dark out. Josh is up, dressed, and pacing 
           in the kitchen. Naseerah, in her bathrobe, walks in still 
           half asleep. She gives him a kiss.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Let me make you something to eat.

           EXT. GHORBANIFAR’S YACHT - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North and Ghorbanifar sit around waiting for the 
           phone to ring. Josh and Toby are agitated and restless.

                                 JOSH
                        Is this going to happen or what?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Be patient. They will call.

                                 TOBY
                        When? They were supposed to call 
                        hours ago.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        They will call. Relax, my friends. 
                        Look. “Miami Vice” is on.
           Ghorbanifar turns up the TV as the opening credits play. 

           LATER

           Josh and Toby BICKER as the end credits roll.

                                 TOBY
                        Now that’s funny. Look, dude: you’d 
                        be Tubbs, I’d be Crockett.

                                 JOSH
                        Get out of here. I’d be Crockett. 
                        My Dad has a Ferrari.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        You’re both crazy. I’d be Crockett.

           Josh and Toby look at him, incredulous.

                                 TOBY
                        You’d be one of the drug dealers!

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        I am a legitimate businessman!

           The phone RINGS and everyone lunges for it. Ghorbanifar 
           answers in FARSI. He listens for a minute, then hangs up.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        I’m sorry, my friends. They’re not 
                        releasing anyone. And they want 
                        another 500 missiles by next week.

                                 JOSH
                        What? Fuck them. No hostages, no 
                        missiles.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        I’m sorry, but I’m afraid you don’t 
                        have a choice. If they do not 
                        receive the missiles by next 
                        Friday, they will order Mugniyah to 
                        execute one hostage per day until 
                        they are delivered.

           Josh, Toby and North exchange dismayed looks.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        They also want the CIA to provide 
                        them with satellite photos of Iraqi 
                        troop positions, and to help them 
                        assassinate Saddam Hussein.
                                 TOBY
                        That’s it. You’re shark bait, 
                        asshole!

           Toby grabs Ghorbanifar and tries to shove him overboard. Josh 
           and North grab Toby, and the four men collapse in a pile.

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby and North look on as Sanders gets chewed out over 
           the phone. The SCREAMING finally ends and Sanders hangs up.

                                 SANDERS
                        Casey’s having the satellite 
                        imaging sent over. Obviously, we 
                        can’t assassinate Saddam, he’s one 
                        of our only allies in the region, 
                        so we’ll have to try to stall them.

                                 JOSH
                        And the missiles?

                                 SANDERS
                        We don’t have any choice.

           Josh and Toby are pissed. Toby glares at North.

                                 TOBY
                        Got anymore bright ideas, Larry?

           THE ARMS DEAL MONTAGE

           “MR. ROBOTO” by Styx PLAYS over:

           - Josh, Toby, and Ghorbanifar land in Iran. They look on as 
           the Iranians unload the missiles, smiling and laughing.

           - Josh and Toby walk into a BCCI bank in Geneva, Switzerland. 
           They’re each carrying two large suitcases.

           - North enters the White House. He transfers stacks of cash 
           from his briefcase to a safe. The safe is so full of money, 
           North can barely get the door closed.

           - North records all of the transactions in a LEDGER.

           - Josh and Toby look on as several Iranian Generals examine 
           poster-size spy satellite photos of Iraqi troop positions.

           - The rescue team stages a dress rehearsal, raiding the mock-
           up of the Pasdaran Barracks. Their attack is flawless.

           - We slowly PUSH IN on the Hostage Board. The “Days Held” 
           numbers spiral through the hundreds. The count for Buckley 
           goes from 592, through the 600s, and finally stops at 712 as 
           we settle on a tight shot of his photo...

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Sanders pulls Josh aside.

                                 SANDERS 
                        Prime Minister Saad was just 
                        wounded in a car bomb attack. The 
                        Phalange are denying they were 
                        behind it, but it’s got Bashar’s 
                        fingerprints all over it. Casey 
                        wants the rescue team shut down. 

                                 JOSH
                        We’re this close to launching the 
                        raid. We can’t call it off now.

                                 SANDERS
                        If he blames us, we’re fucked!

                                 JOSH
                        If we pull the plug now, we might 
                        as well go home. The arms deals are 
                        a bust, Waite’s spinning his wheels 
                        in Kuwait. This is our only chance!

                                 SANDERS
                        These guys are bored, armed to the 
                        teeth, and out of control. 

                                 JOSH
                        Let me talk to Bashar. I can handle 
                        him.

                                 SANDERS
                        What am I supposed to tell Casey?

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever. Tell him we shut it down. 
                        After we get the hostages out, he’s 
                        not going to care that we lied.

                                 SANDERS
                       If we get them out. We don’t even 
                        know if they’re in there!

                                 JOSH
                        And what? All of a sudden you’re 
                        Mr. By-the-Book?

           The two men stare each other down. Finally:
                                 SANDERS
                        I’m not gambling my career on a 
                        Goddamn hunch. You want me to lie 
                        to Casey? Then prove they’re in 
                        there. You’ve got 48 hours.

           Josh is already halfway out the door. Sanders calls out:

                                 SANDERS
                        Josh. If I have to clean up your 
                        mess, you’re not going to like it.

           INT. FARAZ’S HOME - DAY

           It’s all noise and chaos: Faraz’s children are running around 
           shrieking, Fatima’s trying to soothe a crying baby, etc. Toby 
           looks on while Josh tries to bully Faraz.

                                 JOSH
                        Have we paid you well? Have we 
                        treated you well?

                                 FARAZ
                        Yes, you’ve been most generous.

                                 JOSH 
                        Then it’s time for you to hold up 
                        your end of the bargain. You work 
                        for the CIA. We don’t do charity. 

                                 FARAZ
                        Mr. Josh, I’m very sorry. I cannot 
                        do this. These people-

                                 JOSH
                        I’m serious, let’s go. Get your 
                        shit.

                                 FARAZ
                        No.

           Josh grabs Faraz’s coat and shoves it at him.

                                 JOSH
                        Goddammit, I said get your shit!

                                 FARAZ
                        Please. Mr. Josh, my children-

                                 JOSH
                        You bought this house with a loan 
                        from a warlord. What do you think 
                        he’s going to do when you start 
                        missing your payments?
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                           (pointing to the kids)
                        You want to see them get hurt?

           Faraz shakes his head, humiliated. Toby’s angry.

                                 JOSH
                        You’ve got five minutes.

           INT. JOSH’S CAR - DAY

           Josh and Toby watch Faraz say goodbye to Fatima. Josh catches 
           Toby glaring at him.

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t look at me like that. I did 
                        what I had to.

           EXT. ALLEY, BAALBEK - DAY

           Josh and Toby pull Faraz’s cart out of the trunk. Toby stocks 
           it with popsicles while Josh shows Faraz how to work a camera 
           hidden in a pack of cigarettes. Faraz is nervous and sweaty.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s got a couple cigarettes in it, 
                        but the rest is taken up by the 
                        camera. This little pin hole’s the 
                        lens. To take a photo, just point 
                        and squeeze like this. That’s it.

           EXT. PASDARAN BARRACKS - DAY

           Faraz pushes the ice cream cart towards the building with the 
           BLACKED OUT WINDOWS. He BANTERS with the guards and passes 
           out free popsicles. While reaching into the cart, the pack of 
           smokes falls out of his shirt pocket and lands at his feet.

           UP IN THE HILLS

           Josh and Toby lie under some scrub brush watching through 
           binoculars. 

           AT THE BARRACKS

           Guard #1 picks up the pack, and pulls out a cigarette. He 
           motions for a light. Faraz searches his pockets, but can’t 
           find the lighter. The guards watch him. Finally, another 
           guard gives #1 a light. #1 hands the pack back to Faraz. 

           Faraz hands out a few more popsicles, then acts like he 
           urgently needs to piss. He’s overdoing it, but the guards buy 
           it, and wave him on. Faraz disappears into the building.

           UP IN THE HILLS
           Josh and Toby exchange a look. They can’t believe it.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Josh and Toby wait anxiously for Faraz to exit.

                                 TOBY
                        He should’ve been out by now.

           Another moment goes by, then, at last, Faraz appears. He 
           waves to the guards, grabs his cart, and heads for the main 
           gate as quickly as he dares.

           Josh and Toby are visibly relieved: he’s going to make it.

           Then two men rush out of the building. The first, an Arab 
           civilian, points to Faraz. The second, a Pasdaran soldier, 
           runs after him, YELLING at him in Arabic. 

           Faraz keeps his cool as the man approaches. The guard whips 
           out his pistol and SHOOTS FARAZ IN THE FACE without warning.

           Josh and Toby RECOIL as the shot echoes off the buildings.

           INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

           Fatima and the kids are crying in the hall when Josh and Toby 
           enter. Fatima flies at Josh, SLAPPING and CURSING him. A 
           relative grabs her and restrains her. 

           We stay on Josh as he keeps walking, trying to keep it 
           together. In the background, Fatima WAILS at him in Arabic.

           REFRIGERATION ROOM

           The coroner slides a table out. There’s a bullet hole in 
           Faraz’s forehead. His lifeless eyes stare up at them. 

                                 JOSH
                           (to Coroner, in Arabic)
                        Could you give us a minute?

           The man exits. Josh grimly goes through Faraz’s pockets. He 
           finally finds what he’s looking for: the pack of cigarettes 
           with the hidden camera. Avoiding Toby’s eyes, Josh exits.

           Toby brushes his hand over Faraz’s face, closing his eyes.

                                 TOBY
                        Al salaam alaykum, amigo.

           INT. DARK ROOM, THIRD US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Josh and Toby look on as a techie develops the film.
                                 CIA TECHIE
                        Looks like there’s two exposures.

           Josh hovers over the guy’s shoulder, but Toby just sits there 
           like a zombie. The techie drops the photographic paper in the 
           fixer and an image slowly emerges. It’s Bill Buckley. He’s 
           blindfolded and chained to a wall, but it’s him. 

           Off Josh’s grim satisfaction we CUT TO:

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE, THIRD US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Josh and Sanders are going over the calendar while the rest 
           of the staff looks on, murmuring with excitement.

                                 SANDERS
                        There’s a new moon in two nights. 
                        We’ll have total darkness. That’s 
                        our window. 
                           (to staff)
                        In 48 hours we’re hitting the 
                        Pasdaran Barracks with everything 
                        we’ve got!

           Before he even finishes, the guys are all cheering and 
           clapping. Everyone except Toby.

                                 SANDERS
                           (to Josh)
                        Put Bashar and the Israelis on 
                        alert. When this is over, I’m going 
                        to talk to Casey and recommend you 
                        for the Intelligence Star.

           Sanders claps Josh on the back. Conflicted, Josh nevertheless 
           flushes with pride.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Josh walks over to the Hostage Board and starts updating the 
           “Days Held” numbers. Under Buckley he changes 715 to 716.

                                 JOSH
                        Hang in there, Bill. We’re coming.

           Toby appears behind him.

                                 TOBY
                        I know you think everything you do 
                        is for Bill, but if he could see 
                        you now, he’d be disgusted.
                                 JOSH
                        What’s your problem? Rule number 
                        two: don’t get attached to your 
                        agents. We got the proof we needed, 
                        and now we’re going to save Bill.

                                 TOBY
                        You know what, Josh? Fuck you, man. 
                        Fuck you and fuck your bullshit. 
                        I’m done with this shit.

           Toby storms out. Josh watches him go.

           INT. BATHROOM, THIRD US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Josh splashes some water on his face. He catches a glimpse of 
           himself in the mirror and looks away. Hands trembling, he 
           reaches for a paper towel and THROWS UP. He falls to his 
           knees and pukes again. He wipes his mouth, and pants for air.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, several CIA guys, Eyal, and a few other Israeli 
           advisors are going over a schematic of the Pasdaran Barracks. 
           Toby’s nowhere to be seen. Sanders comes out of his office. 
           He grimly motions to Josh, and Josh walks over.

                                 SANDERS
                        Someone just tried to assassinate 
                        Sheikh Fadlallah. They blew up the 
                        Bir-Al-Abed mosque.

           Sanders’ look says it all. Josh turns to KENT, a wide-eyed 
           agent who looks like he should still be in high school.

                                 JOSH
                        Grab your shit. You’re with me.

           Eyal and the Israelis look on as Josh and Kent hurry out.

           EXT. STREET, BEIRUT - DAY

           There’s a huge crater in the street. An apartment building 
           has collapsed on one side, a mosque on the other. Dead bodies 
           and severed limbs are strewn everywhere.

           Josh and Kent, their faces hidden behind keffiyehs, push 
           through the chaos, passing a South African news crew.

                                 CORRESPONDENT
                        ...even by Beirut standards this is 
                        a shocking attack. Rumors are 
                        flying that the American CIA was 
                        behind the bombing, but no one...
           Josh and Kent duck into a darkened doorway as some men raise 
           a banner across the devastation. It reads: “MADE IN THE USA.” 
           Someone lights an American flag on fire and the crowd starts 
           CHANTING “Death to America!”

           Josh spies Naseerah across the plaza, photographing a woman 
           weeping over a dead child. Naseerah kneels down next to the 
           woman, trying to comfort her.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH, A BLOCK AWAY - DAY

           Josh is on the phone, trying to maintain his composure.

                                 JOSH
                        Bashar, it’s Josh again. We gotta 
                        talk about this. Call me. Now. 

           He hangs up, and bows his head in defeat. Then, in a fit of 
           rage, slams the handset down over and over.

                                 JOSH
                        FUCK!

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Josh enters. Dozens of photos of the bombing hang from a 
           couple of clotheslines, drying. Naseerah comes out of the 
           dark room and clips up a few more shots.

           Josh walks over and puts his hand on her shoulder. Neither 
           says anything. Then she starts to cry, quietly. Josh puts his 
           arms around her and she breaks down.

           LATER - NIGHT

           Naseerah’s asleep on the couch. Josh sits in a chair next to 
           her, staring at the photos. He snaps out of his trance, picks 
           up the phone, and dials a number.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s me. Get up, get dressed. We 
                        gotta find Bashar. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, BEIRUT - NIGHT

           A car SCREECHES to a stop, and Josh and Kent get out.

           INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BLDG. - NIGHT

           Josh and Kent march up to Bashar’s door. Kent is about to 
           knock when Josh grabs his arm. THE DOOR IS OPEN A CRACK.

           Josh pulls out his .45. Kent fumbles with his pistol, 
           terrified. Josh pushes the door open and they creep into
           BASHAR’S APARTMENT

           TWO ASSASSINS exit the bedroom and nearly walk headlong into 
           Josh and Kent. They go for their guns, and Josh OPENS FIRE, 
           blowing them away. Josh and Kent share a stunned look.

           IN THE BEDROOM

           They find Bashar lying in bed, the sheets stained with blood. 
           His throat’s been slit. Kent looks like he’s going to faint.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Josh rifles through the pockets of the dead assassins. He 
           finds a sheet of paper covered with Arabic writing.

                                 KENT
                        What’s it say?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s everyone on the rescue team...
                           (realizing)
                        It’s a hit list. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THIRD US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Toby, North, Kent and the other agents wait anxiously.

                                 TOBY
                        How the fuck did Hizb’allah get a 
                        list of the rescue team?

           Silence. No one knows. Sanders and Josh walk in.

                                 SANDERS
                        Half the team’s dead. Ten more are 
                        missing. We rounded up the rest and 
                        stashed them in a safe house, 
                        but... It’s over, guys.

           Silence. Everyone’s devastated.

           INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT

           Josh sits in the dark, alone, staring at the photos of the 
           hostages on the wall. Sanders comes out of his office, and 
           heads for the exit. He sees Josh and walks over.

                                 SANDERS
                        It’s not your fault.

           Josh doesn’t respond. Sanders puts a hand on Josh’s shoulder 
           for a moment. Then turns and walks out.
                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Hizb’allah had gotten revenge on 
                        Bashar and his men for the bombing, 
                        now it was America’s turn to pay.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North, Sanders and the rest of the staff watch 
           live coverage on CNN of the HIJACKING OF TWA FLIGHT 847.

           ON TV: The iconic image of CAPTAIN TESTRAKE leaning out the 
           cockpit window while a hijacker clamps a hand over his mouth 
           and holds a gun to his head.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        ...the jet, loaded with American 
                        tourists, had just left Athens when 
                        the hijackers seized control and 
                        diverted it to Beirut...

           ON TV: A PASSENGER appears in the doorway, his face a bloody 
           mess. This is Robert Stethem, a 23-year old Navy kid. A ski-
           masked hijacker forces him to kneel, then shoots him in the 
           back of the head. Stethem’s body falls to the tarmac below.

           EXT. TERMINAL ROOF, BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           Toby, Sanders, North and dozens of other officials look out 
           over the tarmac, where the TWA jet sits surrounded by over 
           two dozen Hizb’allah terrorists armed with AK-47s.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        For the next 17 days the White 
                        House tried to negotiate with the 
                        terrorists, without looking like 
                        they were negotiating with them. 

           Bijan, the quadruple amputee, sits in a wheelchair. He’s 
           regained his sight and Josh holds binoculars up to his eyes. 
           Josh points to a hijacker who’s conferring with two others 
           like he’s in charge.

                                 JOSH
                        The one on the right, with the 
                        radio.

           Bijan turns white as a ghost and curses.

                                 BIJAN
                        That’s the man who did this to me. 
                        That’s Imad Mugniyah, the Enforcer.
                           (off Josh’s look)
                        You know him?
                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, he shot me three times.

           Josh marches over to a surveillance post and talks to the 
           men. They snap photos of Mugniyah through telephoto lenses.

           EXT. ISRAELI CHECKPOINT - DAY

           Josh and his Israeli contact Eyal drink expensive brandy and 
           smoke cigars.

                                 JOSH (V.O.) 
                        Israel finally stepped in and saved 
                        our asses. In exchange for the TWA 
                        passengers, they released some of 
                        the Lebanese detainees they’d been 
                        holding. I made sure Naseerah’s 
                        brother Hamad was one of them.

           EXT. BUS STATION - DAY

           Josh and Naseerah look on as the detainees spill out of 
           several buses. Naseerah’s nervous. She kisses Josh.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Thank you.

           He just grins, and kisses her back. Then she spots HAMAD in 
           the doorway of a bus. He’s just a kid. 18 at most. She waves 
           and he raises a hand in return. Naseerah runs through the 
           crowd of rejoicing families and throws her arms around him.

           Josh looks on and smiles.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh pins a photo of Mugniyah to the top of the Hizb’allah 
           hierarchy chart, and draws a bull’s-eye over his face.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh, Toby, North, Sanders and the staff meet. They’re all 
           exhausted and frustrated.

                                 SANDERS 
                        What about the church mouse, you 
                        know, what’s his name?

                                 TOBY
                        The Kuwaitis aren’t cooperating. 
                        It’s not looking good. 

           North holds up a belt with an extremely suspicious black 
           metal box for a buckle.
                                 NORTH
                           (re: belt)
                        It’s time to put a tracking device 
                        on Waite, and let him lead us to 
                        Mugniyah.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, they’ll never notice that.

                                 TOBY
                        They don’t even let him wear pants!
                        What are you going to do? Shove it 
                        up his ass?

                                 NORTH
                        If we have to.

                                 TOBY
                        You’re going to get him killed!

                                 NORTH
                        You got any better ideas?

                                 TOBY
                        Yeah, how ‘bout we stick it up your 
                        ass, and see how you like it.

           The room is silent. Finally, Josh speaks up.

                                 JOSH
                        Iran’s been blackmailing us for 
                        months. We gotta call their bluff. 
                        We’ve given them everything, and 
                        they’ve given us nothing. We-

                                 NORTH
                        Now, hold on, Josh. That’s not 
                        exactly fair. They’ve paid us 
                        millions of dollars-

                                 JOSH
                        That wasn’t the deal. The deal was 
                        for the hostages. Either Iran puts 
                        them back on the table, or we call 
                        their bluff and cut ‘em off. 

                                 SANDERS
                        What if they’re not bluffing?

                                 JOSH
                        They need weapons for their war 
                        with Iraq, and the hostages are 
                        their only bargaining chip. They’re 
                        not going to kill them. 
                                 TOBY
                           (ice cold)
                        Like they weren’t going to kill 
                        Faraz?

           The room is shocked. No one can believe Toby went there. Josh 
           and Toby glare at each other from across the table.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s better than sticking that 
                        thing up Terry Waite’s ass!

                                 SANDERS
                           (it’s decided)
                        I’ll talk to Casey.

                                 TOBY
                        Have all of you lost your minds? 
                        Listen to what you’re talking 
                        about. Who’s more expendable? Terry 
                        Waite? One of the hostages? We’re 
                        supposed to be the good guys!

           Toby slams his chair against the wall and storms out.

           EXT. TEHRAN AIRPORT - DAY

           Josh, Kent, North, and McFarlane shake hands with a bunch of 
           black-robed MULLAHS. McFarlane presents a Bible to one of 
           them, while Ghorbanifar interprets.

                                 MCFARLANE
                        Islam and Christianity are both 
                        religions of peace. This Bible was 
                        autographed by President Reagan, 
                        and I present it to you as a 
                        gesture of America’s good will.

           The mullah hands over a Holy Qu’ran and speaks in Farsi.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        ‘In return, please give this Holy 
                        Qu’ran to your President on behalf 
                        of the Ayatollah Khomeini. And now, 
                        as you say in your country, let us 
                        get down to business.’

           As everyone grins stupidly and tries to make nice...

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Incredibly, calling their bluff 
                        worked. They agreed to trade Bill 
                        for 800 TOW missiles. And just like 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        that the arms-for-hostages merry-go-
                        round was up and running again.

           EXT. TEHRAN AIRPORT, IRAN - DAY

           Josh and Kent look on as the Iranians unload the missiles.

           EXT. BEIRUT AIRPORT - DAY

           Josh and Kent exit the C-130. Sanders and Eyal are waiting 
           for them. The two men pull Josh aside.

                                 SANDERS
                        We need to talk.

                                 EYAL
                        A few hours ago a suicide bomber 
                        blew himself up at one of our 
                        checkpoints and killed 12 soldiers.

                                 SANDERS
                        It was Naseerah’s brother.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s impossible.

                                 SANDERS
                        How did Hizb’allah know Buckley was 
                        the Station Chief? How did they 
                        find out about the rescue team? 

                                 JOSH
                        What are you saying?

                                 SANDERS
                        Naseerah saw your list, Josh. She 
                        copied it, and gave it to them.

                                 JOSH
                        There’s gotta be some mistake.

           Sanders and Eyal just look at him: there’s no mistake.

           INT. NASEERAH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Josh is rifling through her things. He finds a manila 
           envelope at the bottom of a drawer. He opens it and pulls out 
           a series of SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of Bashar and the rescue 
           team. Josh and the CIA guys are in a few of the shots.

           Josh picks up a chair and throws it across the room.

                                 JOSH
                        FUCK!
           He starts tearing the place apart, knocking things out of the 
           cabinets, ripping drawers out. He shoves all of Naseerah’s 
           notebooks, photos, negatives, etc., into a duffle bag. 

           EXT. NEWSPAPER OFFICES - DAY

           Naseerah exits and hurries down the busy sidewalk. Josh steps 
           out of a doorway and follows her.

           EXT. HAMRA MARKET - DAY

           Josh tails Naseerah through the crowded open-air market. He 
           loses sight of her as she turns down an alley. Josh rounds 
           the corner - the passageway is empty. As he hurries down it, 
           Naseerah jumps out of a doorway and grabs him.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Gotcha!

           She LAUGHS. But Josh is furious.

                                 JOSH
                        Who taught you to spot a tail?

                                 NASEERAH
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        Who taught you counter-
                        surveillance? Who are you working 
                        for?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Josh, what are you talking about? I 
                        saw your reflection in a window.

           He grabs her arm, and backs her against the wall.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Josh, that hurts!

                                 JOSH
                        How much did they pay you for Bill 
                        Buckley?

                                 NASEERAH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOSH
                        ANSWER ME! HOW MUCH?

                                 NASEERAH
                        Josh, you’re scaring me. I’m not a 
                        spy and you know it. I-
                                 JOSH
                        Then what the fuck is this?

           He shoves one of the photos in her face. She finally realizes 
           how serious this is, and tries to explain.

                                 NASEERAH
                        It’s not what you think. I was 
                        working on a story about Bashar and 
                        I got a tip about a meeting. I had 
                        no idea you guys were going to be 
                        there. I snapped a couple photos 
                        before I even realized-

                                 JOSH
                        You’re a Goddamn liar!

                                 NASEERAH
                        Listen to me. Remember that night 
                        at the bar? I tried to talk to you 
                        about it, but you lied to me. What 
                        was I supposed to do? After the 
                        attack on Fadlallah-

                                 JOSH
                        Is that what this was about? 
                        Revenge? Is that why you sold out 
                        the rescue team?

                                 NASEERAH
                        What rescue team? I could’ve run a 
                        story about Bashar and the CIA 
                        working together and I didn’t 
                        because I wanted to protect you. 
                        Because I love you.

                                 JOSH
                        Bullshit! You played me to get your 
                        brother out. You knew he was a 
                        terrorist-

                                 NASEERAH
                        My brother is not a terrorist.

                                 JOSH
                        Really? That’s funny, because he 
                        just blew himself up at an Israeli 
                        checkpoint a few hours ago and 
                        killed twelve people.

           Naseerah takes it like a punch to the gut. Her face crumbles 
           and she bursts into tears.
                                 NASEERAH
                        What?!

                                 JOSH
                        You won, Naseerah. You really 
                        fooled me good. You happy now?

           Naseerah leans against the wall for support, but her knees 
           give out. She slides to the ground, SOBBING. Josh turns and 
           walks away, his face contorted with betrayal.

           INT. BASEMENT, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh and Sanders pass a bottle of Cuervo back and forth. Josh 
           takes Naseerah’s stuff from the duffle bag and throws it into 
           the incinerator.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sanders helps Josh in. Josh is fall down drunk, barely 
           conscious. Sanders lays him down on the couch, then goes into 
           the bedroom. He returns with a blanket, and covers Josh with 
           it. Josh comes to for a minute, mumbling.

                                 JOSH
                        I loved her, Dad. I really loved 
                        her.

                                 SANDERS
                        I know. Get some rest, kid. We’ll 
                        talk about it tomorrow.

           MORNING

           POUNDING at the door. Josh is still passed out on the couch. 

                                 KENT
                        JOSH! OPEN UP! JOSH!

           Josh slowly comes to, GROANING.

                                 JOSH
                        What do you want? Go away!

                                 KENT
                        THEY RELEASED A HOSTAGE! WE THINK 
                        IT’S BILL!

           Josh whips off the blanket and jumps up.
           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY 

           Josh hurries through the hall, still in yesterday’s clothes. 
           A small crowd is gathered around the door to Sanders’ office. 
           Josh pushes his way through and bursts into

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE, THIRD US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           Sanders, Toby and North are talking to a man whose back is to 
           the camera. Scraggly hair, emaciated limbs, and tattered 
           clothing indicate he’s been in captivity for some time. 

                                 JOSH
                        Bill!

           The man turns around. It’s not Buckley.

                                 WEIR
                        Sorry, son. Name’s Ben. Ben Weir.

                                 JOSH
                        Where’s Bill?

           Josh looks to Sanders and North. Sanders looks away. North 
           tries but can’t get the words out.

                                 WEIR
                        You must be Josh McKenna.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s right. Where’s Bill?

                                 WEIR 
                        He’s dead, son. He died six months 
                        ago. I’m very sorry.

           Josh collapses into a chair, then bursts into tears. Toby 
           punches the wall, then storms out to hide his own tears.

                                 WEIR
                        He’d been sick for weeks. He had a 
                        fever and got delirious. One 
                        morning he said: “I’d like some 
                        poached eggs on toast,” and that 
                        was it. He just stopped breathing. 
                           (beat)
                        He talked about you a lot, you 
                        know. He knew you were doing 
                        everything you could to save him.

                                 JOSH 
                        I could’ve done more.
                                 WEIR
                        He said you’d say that. Toward the 
                        end, he knew he was dying. He made 
                        us promise that if any of us got 
                        out we’d find you and remind you of 
                        a conversation you once had. ‘Tell 
                        him he has what it takes.’ He said 
                        you’d know what that meant. 

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Josh makes his way toward the Hostage Board. The photo of 
           Bill Buckley stares back at him. Josh reaches the board and 
           takes it down. Someone in the back of the room SOBS.

           INT. CASEY’S OFFICE, CIA HQ - DAY

           Casey, looking old and frail, sits at his desk in tears.

           A BRIEF MONTAGE:

           - Josh and Kent deliver more missiles. Josh goes through the 
           motions like a robot. The spark is gone.

                                 JOSH (V.O.) 
                        Hizb’allah released two more 
                        hostages, but over the next few 
                        weeks they kidnapped six more. They 
                        now had more hostages than when 
                        we’d started. The arms deals had 
                        been a complete Goddamn failure.

           - Josh, Toby, Kent and some of the other guys watch Terry 
           Waite holding a press conference on CNN.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        With the press asking questions 
                        about the hostages’ release, North 
                        and Sanders went to work getting us 
                        a cover story.

                                 WAITE (ON TV)
                        ...as a result of our negotiations, 
                        Hizb’allah decided to release these 
                        men as a gesture of good faith. I 
                        hope the government of Kuwait will 
                        step forward and reciprocate...

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Of course Waite knew nothing of the 
                        arms deals with Iran. Larry lied to 
                        him, and tricked him into taking 
                        credit for the hostages’ release.
           - At the airport, Josh and Waite have a heated argument.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        I warned Waite his credibility was 
                        ruined, but he was convinced he 
                        could fix things with Mugniyah.

           - Josh watches as Waite walks away. He pushes open the doors 
           to the street, and disappears into the blinding daylight...

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        He was wrong.

           - Josh pins a photo of Waite to the Hostage Locating Task 
           Force board. Under it he writes: “Days Held: 1”

           EXT. ROOFTOP, BEIRUT - NIGHT

           Josh looks out over the bombed-out shell of the first US 
           Embassy, drinking a bottle of whiskey. 

                                 JOSH (V.O.) 
                        Just when it looked like things 
                        couldn’t get any worse, Kuwait 
                        announced it would execute the Dawa 
                        17 in one week. Mugniyah vowed to 
                        kill the hostages in retaliation. 
                        We didn’t have a single card left 
                        to play. We were totally fucked.

           Josh finishes off the bottle and hurls it into the darkness 
           with a SCREAM of frustration and despair.

           INT. BULLPEN, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Josh sits at his desk, staring off into space, completely 
           despondent. He looks like he hasn’t slept in days.

           Toby walks up and feeds a memo through the fax machine.

                                 TOBY
                        Bummer about the hostages. It’s 
                        going to be pretty hard to make 
                        money off them once they’re dead.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

           But Toby just walks away. The question hangs in the air.

           LATER

           Everyone’s gone home. Josh sits in the dark staring at 
           Buckley’s Revolutionary War diorama, lost in thought.
           LATER

           Josh rummages through a drawer full of junk and finds a lock-
           pick. He goes over to North’s office and picks the lock.

           NORTH’S OFFICE

           Josh rifles through North’s desk, until he finds the ledger. 
           Josh flips through the pages. It’s filled with thousands of 
           financial transactions. Over and over we see the words: “Wire 
           transfer to Lake Resources.”

           INT. HALLWAY, CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

           Josh POUNDS on a door. Loud music is blaring on the other 
           side. Josh gets tired of knocking, and KICKS THE DOOR IN.

           INT. GHORBANIFAR’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           A woman SCREAMS as the door CRASHES OPEN and Josh storms in. 
           Ghorbanifar’s in bed, cavorting with two call girls. There’s 
           champagne and lines of coke on the night stand. 

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        What are you doing?

           Josh grabs a pile of clothes and tosses them at the girls.

                                 JOSH
                        Party’s over. Beat it! I said: get 
                        out!

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        You’re a crazy man. How dare you 
                        come into my house like this.

           The call girls are still wrestling with their stuff. Josh 
           grabs it and throws it into the hallway. They run from him 
           like he’s a maniac, and he slams the door behind them.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s Lake Resources?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Those were my guests. You come in 
                        here like a lunatic-

                                 JOSH
                        You want to see lunatic?

           Josh starts smashing all of Ghorbanifar’s stuff. He kicks in 
           the TV, throws a lamp across the room. Ghorbanifar flutters 
           around, clutching his head and moaning.
                                 JOSH
                        HOW’S THAT FOR LUNATIC? NOW TELL ME 
                        WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE MONEY!

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Josh grabs Ghorbanifar and drags him out onto the balcony. 
           They’re twenty floors up. Josh grabs him by the lapels of his 
           silk bathrobe and SLAMS him up against the railing.

                                 JOSH
                        So help me God I’ll throw you off 
                        this fucking balcony!

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        It was Larry’s idea! I had nothing 
                        to do with it!

                                 JOSH
                        With what?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Sending the money to the Contras.

                                 JOSH
                        What Contras? In Nicaragua? 

                                 GHORBANIFAR 
                        Congress had banned the CIA from 
                        helping them and Sanders and Larry 
                        were very angry. I said maybe we 
                        could use the profits from the arms 
                        sales to help them-

                                 JOSH
                        I thought you said it was Larry’s 
                        idea?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        It was! I was joking, but they took 
                        it seriously. They told Casey, he 
                        got Larry a meeting with the 
                        President, and the President loved 
                        it. So Larry created Lake Resources 
                        so they could launder the money. 

           Stunned, Josh lets go of Ghorbanifar and turns to leave.

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        Josh, wait, please. You must help 
                        me. I am in big trouble. 
                                 JOSH
                        Really? Good!

                                 GHORBANIFAR 
                        This isn’t funny. The Pentagon sent 
                        the Iranians a catalogue with the 
                        real prices in it. It’s been seven 
                        years since the Shah was overthrown 
                        - update your mailing list for 
                        God’s sake! 

                                 JOSH
                        What do you mean “real” prices?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        We were overcharging them. I said 
                        let’s charge them double, but Larry 
                        said let’s charge quadruple. Idiot! 
                        Now they know we screwed them. They 
                        took out a $40 million insurance 
                        policy on me so they can kill me 
                        and get their money back. I’m 
                        warning you: pay them back, or I 
                        will go to the press.

                                 JOSH
                        Are you trying to blackmail me?

                                 GHORBANIFAR
                        I’m not trying, I am doing!

           INT. SANDERS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sanders walks in and turns on the lights. He’s startled to 
           see Josh sitting in a chair in the corner.

                                 SANDERS
                        Jesus! You scared the shit out of 
                        me. What are you doing?

           Josh doesn’t answer. Instead he takes a drink from an almost 
           empty bottle of Jack Daniels. That’s when Sanders notices 
           he’s holding Buckley’s chrome .45 in the other hand.

                                 SANDERS
                        You come here to kill me, Josh?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m thinking about it. 

                                 SANDERS
                        You’re drunk. I’m calling you a 
                        cab.
           Sanders picks up the handset and dials a number on the old 
           rotary base. Josh FIRES and the base explodes. Sanders is 
           left holding the handset and a dangling wire.

                                 SANDERS
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 JOSH
                        You ruined Terry Waite on purpose. 
                        You wanted the crisis to go on so 
                        you could keep making money off the 
                        arms deals. But you didn’t count on 
                        the Kuwaitis setting an execution 
                        date, did you? 

                                 SANDERS 
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 JOSH 
                        Spare me your bullshit. Ghorbanifar 
                        told me everything. Lake Resources. 
                        The Contras. The overcharging.

                                 SANDERS
                        Shit. I told Casey we should’ve had 
                        him whacked.

                                 JOSH
                        Bill Buckley worked for the agency 
                        for 30 years and you sold him out!

                                 SANDERS
                        And Congress sold out the Contras! 
                        If we’d let Nicaragua go commie, 
                        Mexico would’ve been next! Then 
                        there’s Soviet Migs flying over 
                        Texas. And this isn’t just about 
                        Nicaragua; it’s about the fate of 
                        the world. Angola, Afghanistan, 
                        Cambodia, Ethiopia-

                                 JOSH
                        Angola wasn’t our mission! Ethiopia-

                                 SANDERS
                        The hell it wasn’t! Our mission is 
                        to defeat the Soviet Union! That 
                        takes priority over everything, and 
                        Bill would’ve understood-

                                 JOSH
                        Our mission was to get the hostages 
                        out, and you blew it!
                                 SANDERS
                        I’m sorry Bill’s dead. I really am. 
                        But this is war, and sometimes you 
                        have to send your men up a hill 
                        knowing none of them are coming 
                        back. I got where I am because I’m 
                        willing to make the tough calls.

                                 JOSH 
                        Was selling out the rescue team to 
                        Hizb’allah one of those tough 
                        calls?

                                 SANDERS 
                        I warned you if I had to clean up 
                        your mess you wouldn’t like it. 

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus Christ, Buck. Bill was still 
                        alive then. We could’ve saved him!

                                 SANDERS
                        What can I say, kid? It’s a nasty 
                        business.

                                 JOSH
                        Naseerah was never working for 
                        Hizb’allah. She was just your cover 
                        story, wasn’t she?

                                 SANDERS
                        I fed you some ideas, but I didn’t 
                        make you betray her. You did that 
                        all on your own.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s wrong with you? You can’t 
                        just play with people’s lives like 
                        this! The hostages are about to be 
                        killed, all so you and Larry could 
                        make your own foreign policy. Who 
                        the hell do you think you are?

                                 SANDERS
                        I’m the guy that keeps America 
                        safe.

           Josh has had enough. He turns to walk out.

                                 SANDERS
                        Before you get any stupid ideas, 
                        just remember: you’re in this up to 
                        your eyeballs.
           INT. BEIRUT AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Josh calls his Dad from a pay phone.

           INTERCUT WITH

           INT. DONALD’S OFFICE, CHEVRON BLDG. - DAY

           Josh’s Dad sits behind his desk in a huge corner office 
           overlooking midtown Manhattan.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Your son’s on line 3. He says it’s 
                        urgent.

           Donald picks up the phone.

                                 DONALD
                        Josh, where are you? You okay?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m in big trouble, Dad. I need 
                        your help.

           EXT. PALACE, SAUDI ARABIA - DAY

           Josh gets out of a limo and walks up the steps of an opulent 
           palace. PRINCE AL RASHID, flanked by servants, greets him.

                                 AL RASHID
                        Your father told me you had become 
                        a man, and I see he was right.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s good to see you again, your 
                        Highness.

           They shake hands, then disappear into the palace.

           INT. BCCI BANK - GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - DAY

           Josh, carrying a briefcase, approaches a teller.

                                 JOSH
                        I’d like to empty my account.

           EXT. FARAZ’S HOME - DAY

           Josh steps up to the door. He summons his courage and KNOCKS. 
           Fatima opens the door. She glares at him, then lets him in. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Josh sits across from Fatima. The briefcase sits open between 
           them, FILLED WITH CASH. Josh places an envelope on the table.

                                 JOSH
                        These are residency visas. They’ll 
                        get you and the kids into America.

           Fatima, shocked, says nothing. Josh gets up and walks out.

           EXT. STREET, BEIRUT - DAY

           Two militias trade GUNFIRE in the streets. Naseerah and a few 
           other journalists SNAP PHOTOS from behind a pile of rubble.

           Josh makes his way toward Naseerah, ducking for cover as 
           bullets WHIZ by. She sees him and tries to get away.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I don’t want to hear it.

                                 JOSH 
                        I’m not here to make excuses for 
                        what I did. 

                                 NASEERAH
                        Then what do you want?

                                 JOSH
                        I promised I’d give you a big story 
                        one day. Well, I’ve got one.

           INT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Josh talks while Naseerah scribbles away furiously. 

                                 NASEERAH 
                        This story’s going to ruin you too. 
                        You know that, right?

           Josh nods. He knows.

           EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

           Josh and Naseerah exit the cafe. This is goodbye.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Promise me you’re not going to do 
                        anything stupid.

                                 JOSH
                        Just run the story. No matter what 
                        happens.
           They hug. Despite everything, the attraction’s still there. 
           Naseerah lifts her head and looks him in the eye.

                                 NASEERAH
                        I wanted to hate you for what you 
                        did. I tried, but I couldn’t do it.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry. I should’ve trusted you.

           She rests her forehead against his. Their lips are so close. 
           It seems like they’re going to kiss, then she pulls away.

                                 NASEERAH
                        Goodbye, Josh.

           She turns and walks away. Josh watches her go. It’s harder 
           than he thought it’d be.

           INT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Josh is at the table, writing a letter. It begins “Dear Dad.”

           LATER

           Josh tucks the letter in an envelope and writes “In the Event 
           of My Death” on the front. He lays it on the table next to 
           the pearl-handled .45 Bill Buckley gave him, and walks out.

           EXT. SHI’ITE SLUMS - DAWN

           Josh walks down the middle of the street toward a checkpoint. 
           Yellow Hizb’allah flags, a fist clutching an AK-47, flutter 
           from the rooftops. People stop and stare as Josh walks by.

           AT THE CHECKPOINT

           Two tanks are parked nose-to-nose, blocking the street. A 
           dozen guerillas lounge around smoking cigarettes. They see 
           Josh coming, and raise their AK-47s.

           Josh raises his hands but keeps walking. He’s not afraid. In 
           fact, he’s more at peace than he’s been in years. He reaches 
           the men and holds out his passport. They examine it, baffled.

                                 JOSH
                           (in Arabic)
                        My name is Josh Aaron McKenna. I’m 
                        an employee of the Central 
                        Intelligence Agency, and I want to 
                        see Imad Mugniyah. I have important 
                        information about his brother.
           The guerillas debate what to do. Then one steps up and SLAMS 
           the butt of his AK-47 into Josh’s face and we CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON:

           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Josh, blindfolded, hangs from a pipe by his wrists, 
           unconscious. His face is cut and bruised, and his shirt is 
           stained with dried blood. He’s obviously been badly beaten.

           The door SCREECHES open. Two thugs enter and unchain him. 
           Josh comes to as they drag him out.

           ANOTHER ROOM

           The guards shove Josh down in a chair. Two bodyguards enter 
           carrying AK-47s. Then an Arab man in casual clothes enters 
           and everyone snaps to attention. It’s the man who shot Josh 
           during Buckley’s kidnapping. It’s Imad Mugniyah.

           He has a pistol tucked into the front of his pants. He glares  
           angrily at Josh for a moment, then sits down at the table.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        You have information on Youssef? 

                                 JOSH
                        Better. I have a deal that will 
                        save his life.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        You’re not in a position to make 
                        any deals.

           Mugniyah glances to one of the guards, and he pummels Josh 
           with his fists. Bored, Mugniyah finally calls him off with a 
           wave of his hand. Josh spits out a mouthful of blood.

           Mugniyah walks over, grabs Josh by the hair, and yanks his 
           head back so they’re face-to-face.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        If it was up to them, you would 
                        already be dead. Fortunately for 
                        you, I am merciful.

           Mugniyah roughly shoves Josh’s head away, disgusted. He wipes 
           his hand on his pants.

                                 JOSH 
                        Merciful? You murdered 241 Marines 
                        while they were sleeping.
                                 MUGNIYAH
                        Invaders. Occupiers who bombed our 
                        villages. I kill soldiers at their 
                        base. You kill women and children 
                        while they worship.

                                 JOSH
                        I didn’t come here to debate you. I-

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        -came here to make a deal. You 
                        already said that. Bill Buckley 
                        said you were smart, but you don’t 
                        look so smart to me.

           Mugniyah rises and opens the door. A TORTURER enters, pushing 
           a cart loaded with the tools of his trade.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                           (goodbye)
                        Your friend was not an easy man to 
                        break. I think you are not so 
                        strong. We’ll find out soon enough.

                                 JOSH
                        Your brother’s going to get his 
                        head chopped off in 24 hours. If 
                        anyone was going to offer you a 
                        deal, they would’ve done it by now. 
                        No one’s coming. They saw what 
                        happened to the last guy who tried 
                        to negotiate with you. So I’m not 
                        just the best deal in town, I’m the 
                        only deal in town.

           Mugniyah thinks it over, then sits back down, smirking. 
           Disappointed, the Torturer retreats into a darkened corner. 
           Mugniyah motions for Josh to go on.

                                 JOSH
                        I know a member of the Saudi royal 
                        family who is close friends with 
                        George Bush, the Vice President of 
                        the United States. He convinced Mr. 
                        Bush to talk to the Emir of Kuwait, 
                        and pressure him to commute your 
                        brother’s death sentence to life in 
                        prison. If you and I can make a 
                        deal, Mr. Bush will make the call.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        I thought America didn’t negotiate 
                        with “terrorists.”
                                 JOSH
                        This wouldn’t be made public. It’d 
                        just be between my friend, Mr. 
                        Bush, and the Emir. 

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        What do you want in return?

                                 JOSH
                        Your word you won’t take any more 
                        hostages, and that you will not 
                        harm Terry Waite or the others. 

           Mugniyah considers this for a long moment.

                                 MUGNIYAH 
                        As long as Iran is profiting from 
                        the hostage taking, they’ll find 
                        someone to do it for them.

                                 JOSH
                        Then we’ll have to take away the 
                        profit motive.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        How?

                                 JOSH
                        You’ll see it in the newspaper in 
                        the next day or so.

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        If this is a trick...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s no trick. I’m ready for this 
                        to be over. Are you?

                                 MUGNIYAH
                        If the Dawa 17 live, then Mr. Waite 
                        and the American prisoners will 
                        live. If the Dawa 17 are set free, 
                        your men will be set free. But if 
                        my brother dies, I will personally 
                        kill all of the hostages, starting 
                        with the Englishman.

                                 JOSH
                        If any of the hostages die, then 
                        the deal’s off, and your brother 
                        loses his head.

           They glare at each other, a bitter understanding between 
           them. Mugniyah motions to his men, and they cut Josh loose.
           EXT. STREET, BEIRUT - DAY

           A car slows down and Josh is shoved out. He hits the ground 
           hard, and rolls. He sits up, pulls the black bag off his 
           head, and squints in the harsh sunlight.

           EXT. JOSH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Josh comes down the steps, his face badly bruised, carrying 
           two suitcases. There’s a taxi waiting at the curb.

                                 TOBY (O.S.)
                        Hey, Josh.

           Josh turns and sees Toby walking towards him.

                                 TOBY
                        Sanders said you handed in your 
                        resignation.

           Josh nods. It’s true.

                                 TOBY
                        The Dawa 17 got their death 
                        sentences reduced to life in prison 
                        this morning. Rumor has it some 
                        mysterious American got himself 
                        kidnapped by Hizb’allah, then made 
                        a deal to save the hostages. 

                                 JOSH
                           (playing dumb)
                        I heard something about that.

                                 TOBY
                        You’re fucking crazy, you know 
                        that?

           Josh grins. Toby sticks out a hand. They do one of those fancy 
           handshake things, then Toby pulls Josh into a hug. 

                                 TOBY
                        Al salaam alaykum, amigo.

                                 JOSH
                        And peace be upon you as well.

           Josh gets in the cab. Toby watches as it pulls away.

           INT. SANDERS’ OFFICE, THIRD US EMBASSY - DAY

           Sanders picks up the morning paper. The headline SCREAMS: 
           U.S. MAKES SECRET DEAL WITH IRAN. By Naseerah Al-Hassan. 
           Off Sanders’ shocked expression we CUT TO:

           - President Reagan answers questions at a press conference.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        Our government has a firm policy 
                        not to capitulate to terrorist 
                        demands. That no-concessions policy 
                        remains in force, in spite of the 
                        wildly speculative and false 
                        stories about arms for hostages and 
                        ransom payments. We did not,  
                        repeat, did not, trade weapons or 
                        anything else for hostages.

           - North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, frantically shred 
           documents while someone POUNDS on the door. Hall starts 
           shoving papers in her boots, North shoves some down his 
           pants. The door BURSTS open and Capitol Hill Police and 
           Justice Department officials storm in - BUSTED.

           - Reagan addresses the American people from the Oval Office.

                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN
                        A few months ago, I told the 
                        American people I did not trade 
                        arms for hostages. My heart and my 
                        best intentions still tell me 
                        that’s true, but the facts and the 
                        evidence tell me it is not.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Larry had shredded the Finding the 
                        President had signed and, like a 
                        good soldier, volunteered to be the 
                        fall guy. He offered to take 
                        responsibility for everything, and 
                        more importantly, to only tell the 
                        Congress what they already knew.

           - North, in his Marine Corps dress uniform, a chest full of 
           medals, raises his right hand and is sworn in. We’re in
           INT. HEARING ROOM, US CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           North testifies before a Congressional panel.

                                 NORTH
                        I saw the idea of using the 
                        Ayatollah Khomeini’s money to 
                        support the Contras as a good one. 
                        I still do. I don’t think it was 
                        wrong. I think it was a neat idea.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           Josh sits next to Casey, who lies in bed, his face gaunt, his 
           head crisscrossed by ugly, red craniotomy scars. Casey’s 
           clearly dying. The two men watch North testify on TV.

                                 CASEY
                        Look at that ham! The uniform was a 
                        brilliant touch. He’s lucky it 
                        fits. He hasn’t worn it in years.

                        Colonel North, you’ve been accused 
                        of shredding the Constitution-

                                 NORTH (ON TV)
                        I don’t believe that’s one of the 
                        documents I shredded.

           ON TV: LAUGHTER. The CHAIRMAN bangs his gavel.

                                 CHAIRMAN INOUYE (ON TV)
                        The creation of a secret shadow 
                        government is a serious matter, not 
                        something to joke about!

                                 CASEY
                           (to Josh)
                        Just because you got immunity from 
                        the Special Prosecutor, doesn’t 
                        mean anybody cares what you have to 
                        say. Larry’s lying through his 
                        teeth and everyone knows it. But 
                        nobody wants another Watergate, not 
                        even the Democrats. You go in there 
                        shooting your mouth off, these guys 
                        will bury you.

           Josh doesn’t waver.

                                 JOSH
                        Bill was counting on me to do the 
                        right thing, and I let him down.

                        make things right.

           Casey sees there’s no dissuading him. He’s anticipated this. 
           He hands Josh a worn copy of “Othello.”

                        Go on, read it.

           Josh opens the book to a marked passage.

                                 JOSH
                        “I have done the state some 
                        service, and they know it. I pray 
                        you, when you shall these unlucky 
                        deeds relate, speak of me as I am. 
                        Nothing extenuate, nor set down 
                        aught in malice. Then you must 
                        speak of one that loved not wisely,

           Two cops escort Josh through the crowd of Ollie North fans.

           INT. HALLWAY, CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           Josh waits nervously in the marble hall with his Dad. The 
           huge oak doors are flung open to reveal the hearing room, 
           crowded with spectators and reporters. Josh and his Dad 
           exchange a look, then Josh walks into

           INT. HEARING ROOM, CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           DOZENS OF FLASHES GO OFF as Josh makes his way down the aisle 
           to the Witness Table. He raises his hand and is sworn in.

                                 CHAIRMAN INOUYE
                        Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                        whole truth, and nothing but the 
                        truth, so help you God?

                                 JOSH 
                        I do.
                                 CHAIRMAN INOUYE
                        You may now read your opening 
                        statement.

                                 JOSH 
                        You’ve heard all about the arms 
                        sales, and the diversion to the 
                        Contras, but Colonel North didn’t 
                        tell you about dozens of other 
                        covert actions we carried out. 
                        Operations that got assets, and 
                        even civilians, killed.

           Several Congressmen shift uncomfortably, exchanging glances. 
           They don’t like where this is going...

                                 JOSH
                        These operations were part of what 
                        Director Casey called ‘a CIA within 
                        the CIA.’ This program, which 
                        answered to no one, not even the 
                        President, was code named Veil.

           Josh is cut off by a snarling Congressman, DICK CHENEY.

                                 CHENEY
                        Mr. Chairman, this touches upon 
                        sensitive National Security issues, 
                        and I ask that we move these 
                        proceedings into Secret Session.

                                 CHAIRMAN INOUYE
                        Motion granted. Can we clear the 
                        gallery? Clear the gallery, please.

           The room starts to clear out. Josh watches in dismay.

           “Born in the USA” by Bruce Springsteen PLAYS OVER:

           EXT. STEPS, CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           Josh ambles down the steps, lost in thought.

                                 JOSH (V.O.)
                        Casey was right - no one wanted 
                        another Watergate. My testimony, 
                        along with that of dozens of other 
                        witnesses, was sealed and made 
                        secret. And what did the American 
                        people think of all this? 

           JOSH’S POV: A cheering mob of Ollie North fans. 
                                 FAN #1
                        OLLIE NORTH FOR PRESIDENT!

                                 JOSH
                        His friends call him Larry.

           EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY

           Josh strolls past row after row of headstones. He finds the 
           one he’s looking for. It reads: LT. COL. WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, 
           US ARMY. Josh solemnly lays a bouquet of flowers before it. 

                                 JOSH (V.O.) 
                        Bill once asked me if I had what it 
                        took to be a great man. I don’t 
                        know if I do or not. But I’m 
                        trying, Bill. I’m really trying.

           SUPER OVER BLACK:

           DURING IRAQ’S 1990 INVASION OF KUWAIT, THE DAWA 17 ESCAPED 
           FROM PRISON. HIZB’ALLAH THEN RELEASED TERRY WAITE AND THE 
           AMERICAN HOSTAGES, ENDING THE SEVEN YEAR CRISIS.

           OLIVER “LARRY” NORTH WAS CHARGED WITH SIXTEEN FELONIES AND 
           WAS FOUND GUILTY ON THREE COUNTS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE IRAN-
           CONTRA COVER-UP. HIS CONVICTION WAS LATER OVERTURNED ON A 
           TECHNICALITY. HE CURRENTLY HOSTS “WAR STORIES” ON FOX NEWS.

           IN 2004, THE US GOVERNMENT WAS BACK IN BUSINESS WITH MANUCHER 
           GHORBANIFAR, WHO PROMISED TO DELIVER PROOF OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
           DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ. THE WEAPONS WERE NEVER FOUND.

           IN 2002, JUST MONTHS BEFORE THE SECRET IRAN-CONTRA TESTIMONY 
           WAS DUE TO BE MADE PUBLIC, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ISSUED AN 
           EXECUTIVE ORDER SEALING THE RECORD INDEFINITELY.

           EXT. MARINE BARRACKS MEMORIAL - DAY

           Rain pours down on the marble wall. THEY CAME IN PEACE is 
           carved in the stone, along with the names of the dead.

           SUPER: NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
           ATTACKS ON THE US EMBASSY AND MARINE BARRACKS IN BEIRUT.

           IMAD MUGNIYAH REMAINS AT LARGE. SINCE BEING PHOTOGRAPHED HE 
           HAS TWICE UNDERGONE PLASTIC SURGERY TO ALTER HIS APPEARANCE. 

           WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
           THE MURDER OF MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER TERRORIST IN THE 
           WORLD.
