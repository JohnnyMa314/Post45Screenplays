ESTABLISHING - WINTER - DAY

           TOP DOWN-- high above the LINCOLN MEMORIAL-- gliding over the 
           frozen, I-shaped REFLECTING POOL-- looking down on the 
           WASHINGTON MONUMENT. The NATIONAL MALL is packed with people, 
           standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Odd for a cold January day. 

           As we CLOSE on the CAPITAL BUILDING, the size of the crowd 
           grows exponentially. TWO-HUNDRED-THOUSAND EYES focused on--

           EXT. THE STEPS OF THE U.S. CAPITAL BUILDING - DAY

           -- HARRY ROSS (60’s)-- as he becomes the forty-fourth 
           President of the United States--

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        -- and will, to the best of my 
                        ability, preserve, protect, and 
                        defend the constitution of the

           CAMERA circles a huge, H-SHAPED BUILDING, surrounded by 
           skeletal trees-- and TEN THOUSAND CARS.

                 INSERT SUPER: CIA HEADQUARTERS. LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

           INT. LANGLEY - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

           CIA DIRECTOR ANDERSON (50's) walks with a vengeance, THREE 
           ATTACHÉS struggle to keep pace-- passing CIA EMPLOYEES--

           INT. ELIOT'S OFFICE - SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

           -- the views are good. The décor is dated, since TED ELIOT 
           (60's) has more important things to worry about. His visage 
           is handsomely chiseled, but craggy and wise.

           SPECIAL ASSISTANT TIM WALKER (40's) pops his head in. Looks 
           like an athlete. His easy-going manner masks a vast ambition.  

                                 WALKER
                        Director Anderson is heading this 
                        way; he doesn't look happy.

           Eliot reaches into a drawer, pulls out a SEALED FILE.

           As Eliot's door POUNDS OPEN, we see his NAMEPLATE--

            'Theodore Eliot, CIA Associate Director Counterintelligence'

           -- before Director Anderson storms in--
                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                (to Attaches and Walker)
                        Wait outside--
                (slams the door)
                        Did you know about this?

                                 ELIOT
                        This being? 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        The goddamned Mercury Initiative.  

                                 ELIOT
                        President Ross didn't give me a 
                        heads up, if that's what you're 
                        thinking--

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        You've been buddies with Ross since 
                        West Point, and you want me to 
                        believe he never asked you to weigh 
                        in on what’s about to become the 
                        biggest clandestine fuck-up since 
                        Iran-Contra?(cid:13)

                                 ELIOT
                        That is exactly what I'm telling 
                        you. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Bullshit. Everyone in this whole 
                        building knows you turned my job 
                        down, Ted. You really think it's 
                        productive to rub it in my face?

                                 ELIOT
                        You’ll learn pretty quickly that I 
                        never risk a source without a 
                        reason, Admiral. Means I'll know 
                        things I won't tell you from time 
                        to time and that isn't changing.

           Eliot slides the SEALED FILE to Anderson--

                                 ELIOT
                        But the better you look on the 
                        Hill, the more effective The CIA 
                        can be protecting this country.

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        What's this?
                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 ELIOT
                        My justification for not informing 
                        you in advance. It's a thorough 
                        analysis of the new threats E.O. 
                        17559 will generate.

           Director Anderson unseals it. First page has the Presidential 
           Seal and ‘EXECUTIVE ORDER 17559-- THE MERCURY INITIATIVE’ 

                                 ELIOT
                        He’s about to shake the shit out of 
                        one viciously amoral hornets nest. 
                        My conclusions are speculative, but 
                        there is one recommendation in 
                        there I'd stake my career on.

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Which one?

                                 ELIOT
                        The Secret Service better start 
                        hiring.

           EXT. A PANORAMIC CITYSCAPE - PRE-DAWN

           Russian Orthodox churches out of a Tsar's dream tower over 
           Shinto temples. European buildings flank the frozen Songhua 
           River. Some argue the architectural casserole of--

                       INSERT SUPER: HARBIN, CHINA

           -- is the most beautiful city in the country. All eight 
           million residents would agree it's the coldest.

           INT. THE HOTEL BATHROOM - HARBIN - DAWN

           A HAND wipes the steamy mirror, revealing the hardened eyes 
           of ROMULOUS (30’s). His physique is a marvel of sinew, 
           muscle, and tendon, but he feels far more dangerous than 
           sexy. He begins to shave. We've never seen it done this 
           efficiently. Each swipe barely overlaps. 

           PDA VIBRATES. He reads a message written in Russian Cyrillic. 
           Whatever it says must be important. He triples his shaving 
           speed to a wince-worthy pace. Still perfectly precise. As he 
           wipes the tiny flecks of foam off his face, we CUT TO--

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MIDDLE OF THE CITY - MORNING

           -- Romulous, bundled up, shuffling down a sidewalk. He kneels 
           beside a NAVY BLUE FIRE HYDRANT. Begins to tie his shoe.
                                                (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           With a pickpocket’s stealth, he pulls a STRIP OF NAVY BLUE 
           MOLDING from his sleeve, wraps it around half the base of the 
           hydrant, then walks off. The strip blends in perfectly. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MORNING

           The elevator door opens. FOUR MSS AGENTS (Ministry of State 
           Security; China’s hybrid of FBI and CIA) step out, guarding 
           YURI POVLOVSKY, an unhealthy looking Russian in his 40's.

           EXT. THE FRONT OF THE APARTMENT - MORNING

           THREE BLACKED OUT SUV'S idle at the curb. EIGHT MORE MSS 
           AGENTS guard the vehicles. Yuri strides towards them.

           NEAR THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING-- Romulous crossdraws his 
           silenced handgun, hits a button on his CELL PHONE--

           -- the BLUE STRIP DETONATES, ripping the FIRE HYDRANT off 
           it's base. Water pressure finishes the job, flip-spinning the  
           Hydrant across the road-- drilling FRONT SUV so hard, it 
           folds in on itself! The air fills with a MASSIVE GEYSER of 
           water, instantly turning to ICE. The NOISE is deafening. 

           Visibility is two feet. No one sees TWO MSS AGENTS get shot 
           in the head. SOMEONE reacts, throwing Yuri into MIDDLE SUV--

                                 SOMEONE(O.S.)
                (in Chinese)
                        (GO! GO! GO!)

           It peels out, leaving FOUR AGENTS to deal with the threat--

           INSIDE MIDDLE SUV

           -- someone is Romulous. He shoots a THIRD MSS AGENT, while 
           busting the trachea of the FOURTH. Blasts the DRIVER with a 
           headshot. Yanks the EARPIECE from Driver, slaps it in his own 
           ear. Mercilessly efficient.

           ON A STRAIGHTAWAY NOW-- Romulous climbs up front, pushes the 
           driver’s CORPSE out-- takes his place. 

                                 YURI
                        (Are you Russian?)
                (Romulous nods)
                        (FSB?)
                (nods, Yuri is relieved)
                        (Did you rescue my family?)

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (We’ll know in a few minutes.)
                                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           They rocket through a RED LIGHT-- Romulous’ lightning 
           reflexes prevent collisions with ONE-- TWO-- THREE CARS.

           EXT. STREETS OF HARBIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Romulous makes a quick turn, backs into a NO PARKING ZONE. 
           They jump out. KEY in hand, Romulous remotely unlocks the PRE-
           POSITIONED CAR behind them. They hop in. Drive off. We hear 
           SIRENS as we CUT TO--

           INT. THE GET-AWAY CAR - MINUTE LATER

           -- POLICE roaring past them, heading the opposite direction.

           INT. SUBURBAN BARN - DAY

           Romulous pulls into a barn, next to TWO CARS. SIX CAUCASIAN 
           AGENTS hover about. Yuri jumps out at the same time YURI’S 
           WIFE and SON climb out of another car-- as Son runs into Yuri 
           arms, we see he's a GORY MESS; face is covered in blood. 
           Yuri's Wife is crying hysterically. Son is not.

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (Is the boy hurt?)

                                 AGENT ONE
                        (No.)

                                 YURI
                        (Where is Natalia? Where is my 
                        daughter? Is she dead?)

                                 AGENT ONE
                        (There were more guards than 
                        expected. We left the girl.)

           Two Agents carry a DEAD AGENT out of a car. Blood drains. 

                                 YURI
                        (Is my daughter dead?!)

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (No.)

                                 YURI
                        (Then we go back. I will never 
                        again do anything for mother Russia 
                        without my daughter.)

                                 ROMULOUS

                        the rest of your family safe.)
                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           Wife shuffles towards him. Begging him. Desperate-- 

                                 WIFE
                        (Please, do not make me leave my 
                        Natalia. Please--) 

           Romulous locks eyes with Yuri’s son. His shirt has been torn 
           open; a SILVER RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CROSS hangs from his neck.

                                 WIFE
                        (You must have a family--) 

           ON ROMULOUS-- watches ONE TEAR roll down the boy’s face-- no 
           sniffling. Crying like an adult. As the TEAR zigzag down--

                                 WIFE
                        (-- you must have a soul.)

           -- tracing a path through the gore. Romulous averts his eyes-- 
           finding no respite in the desperation of Yuri and his Wife. 
           Yuri’s son, stares coldly-- almost as if-- judging him. 
           Before he makes his decision, we SMASHCUT TO-- 

           INT. CAR - POLICE CHECKPOINT - DAY

           -- Romulous driving towards a bridge. POLICE are trying to 
           stop people from leaving town. But Romulous is heading back 
           into Harbin. CLOSE ON the EARBUG he snatched from the MSS 
           DRIVER-- TUNE IN the CHINESE RADIO CHATTER-- 

           -- he's been listening to MSS COMMUNICATIONS the entire time.

           INT. SPRAWLING APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

           SIX BUILDINGS OF TEN STORIES EACH-- BALCONIES ring each 
           floor; separated by brick partitions.

           Romulous, looking up, examines the layout. Waits until no one 
           can see him, then hurdles a low wall down to--

           A BELOW GROUND PATIO

           A THICK METAL SCREEN blocks his entry. Windows are covered 
           with BARS. He unscrews the porch’s LIGHT BULB. Stomps it. 
           Yanks the TUNGSTEN FILAMENTS free, then inserts the ends into 
           the lock. Picks it in a second (yes, you really can do this).

           INT. SAFEHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           MSS AGENTS surround NATALIA (5). Sniffling in a corner. 

           ONE MSS AGENT has a makeshift SECURITY SYSTEM set up. Has the 
           ENTIRE EIGHTH FLOOR under surveillance, watching:
                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           -THE ELEVATORS-- THE HALLWAYS--
           -AND A SECOND ROOM-- with FIVE more heavily-armed MSS AGENTS.

           INT. CHINESE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           TWO SILENCED BULLETS splinter the deadbolt. Romulous pushes 
           the door open, steps gingerly to the middle of the room, 
           pulls a THICK BATON out of his belt. He assembles it into a 
           two-foot by two-foot SQUARE. TAPES it to the floor, then 
           flicks a dial on the side. Draws his HANDGUN as we CUT TO--

           INT. SAFEHOUSE APARTMENT - MOMENT LATER

           -- a TWO-FOOT BY TWO-FOOT SQUARE blowing down from the 
           ceiling! Drywall is a pulverizing cloud. MSS AGENTS are 
           stunned by the blast-- guns out, searching for a target.

           NATALIA (5) is balled on the bed. ROMULOUS, using the cloud 
           for cover, has dropped in unseen. He snatches her up. As he 
           fires towards the PLATE GLASS WINDOW, we MATCH CUT TO--

           EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           -- the window BLOWING OUT, followed by Romulous. Carrying 
           Natalia in one arm, he whips them around the wall to--

           THE BALCONY NEXT DOOR-- presses himself against the BRICK 
           PARTITION, flips his coat over his head; forming a sling in 
           front of him. He scoops Natalia into it. Whispers in Russian--

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (Hold me very tight.)

           MSS AGENT’S HEAD peeks into view, Romulous bashes it against 
           the wall, holds on to the stunned Agent’s BELT for ballast, 
           leaps over the rail (with Natalia), dangles-- and drops.

           OTHER MSS AGENTS-- yank Stunned Agent back, aim down to--

           THE BALCONY BELOW--

           Romulous rolls over the rail as BULLETS geyser concrete 
           behind him. He SHOOTS the plate glass window, and runs--

           THROUGH ANOTHER APARTMENT-- full of PEOPLE eating--

           INT. HALLWAY - ONE FLOOR BELOW SAFEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- shoulders the door, pulls the FIRE ALARM. It starts 
           BLARING. He never slows, running straight across the hall. 
           TWO SHOTS BLOW THE DEADBOLT on another door; entering--
                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           INT. A THIRD CHINESE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           -- he blasts the Third Plate Glass window, and runs out--

           EXT. BALCONY - OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Romulous, holding Natalia, drops. Catching edges-- Falling-- 
           ONE-- TWO-- THREE FLOORS. Almost to the BARREN TREES when--

           -- MSS AGENTS appear above him. FIRING DOWN as he leaps into 
           A TREE. A bullet hits him in the back. Doesn’t affect him as 
           he grab, snap, shimmies, down--

           TO THE GROUND

           Where he carries Natalia into the SEA OF PEOPLE POURING OUT 
           OF THE BUILDING, reacting to the FIRE ALARMS. 

           Good tactic-- but it’s not going to work. MSS AGENTS on the 
           ground fire into the air, YELLING in Chinese-- the order is 
           obvious. Everyone drops--

           EXCEPT ROMULOUS AND NATALIA--

           They're spotted. FIFTY POLICE and MSS AGENTS run and drive 
           after them. Romulous, one-arming Natalia, hustles around a 
           corner-- into a THOROUGHFARE. CARS skid-stop all around them. 

           Natalia searches Romulous’ face; she’s deciding something. 

           He spots TWO POLICE HELICOPTERS swooping in towards the area. 
           Kneeling down, he opens a car door-- a WOMAN with her KIDS in 
           back is looking at his GUN. He speaks in Chinese--

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (Give me your wallet--)

           She does, he removes her ID-- reads her name.

                                 ROMULOUS
                        (Liu Xiang. A helicopter is landing 
                        in People's Park in twenty minutes. 
                        If this girl is not there--
                (points to address on ID)
                        -- I’ll come back and kill your 
                        children.)

           He pockets her ID, shoves Natalia in the backseat. As he 
           waits for the helicopter to pass, Natalia yanks a RUSSIAN 
           ORTHODOX CROSS off her neck (same one Yuri’s Son had).

                                 NATALIA
                        (This is for the good guys.)
                                                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           Romulous takes it. Surprised. Then duck-runs away from her.

           EXT. WIDE ON THE THOROUGHFARE - CONTINUOUS

           FIFTY POLICE AND MSS PURSUERS collapse; stopping all cars. 
           RIFLES OUT, nearing Natalia in the car--

           ROMULOUS - FIFTY FEET AWAY

           Sees them closing in on her. Spins the SILENCER OFF his gun, 
           stands up, FIRES TWICE at the MSS Agents. Without the 
           silencer, his location is obvious-- helicopters, police, and 
           MSS shift their focus away from the car with Natalia--

           -- and back to Romulous. He blasts the window out of a BIG 
           TRUCK, yanks DRIVER out, jumps in. Guns it--

           -- ramming TWO CARS. As they jackknife, he pounds through the 
           gap. Into the opposite lane-- bulldozing cars until he breaks 
           free of the congestion, and roars around a corner.

           INT/EXT. STOLEN TRUCK - STREETS OF HARBIN - MORNING

           Romulous, doing forty, eyes a MAKESHIFT ROADBLOCK of THREE 
           POLICE CARS up ahead. Now he's doing fifty-- sixty-- and 
           blasts through-- spearing the police cars out of his way.

           POLICE OPEN FIRE on the rear of the truck.

           EXT. STREETS OF HARBIN - MORNING

           As HELICOPTERS KEEP PACE, the truck’s rear tires shred off. 
           Romulous, driving on rails, takes a corner-- SPARKS FLY.

           EXT. NEAR A PARK - CONTINUOUS

           GOVERNMENT VEHICLES STACK UP in front of a RUN DOWN 
           STOREFRONT-- as the truck screams around a bend, Romulous 
           ducks his head below the dash-- BULLETS decimate the cabin! 

           GOVERNMENT OFFICERS, FIRING, see the truck is not stopping. 

           The moment it ploughs into the blockade, Romulous launches 
           himself through the shot out front window. Truck quick-stops. 
           Romulous doesn't-- using momentum to fly over the barricade--

           WE SEE THIS FULL SPEED--

           -- nasty when he lands. His shoulder pops out of its socket. 
           Dives behind a WALL that instantly starts getting chewed by 
           gunfire. Romulous pounds the door open with his good arm.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           INSIDE THE BUILDING

           Adrenaline masks the pain as he leaps down stairs. He can 
           hear TWENTY BOOTS above him as he rounds the bannister into 

           A STORAGE BASEMENT

           Scans the room. Looking for-- a SECURITY CAMERA, guarding a 
           RUSTY DOOR. He limp-runs up, speaks into the camera. 

                                 ROMULOUS
                        Abelard. 

           Rusty Door is a decoy-- a SEAM IN THE WALL pops open ten feet 
           to the left. He spins in-- a moment before THE POLICE enter.

           INT. SEWER - CONTINUOUS

           Romulous, stumbling down metal stairs, is careful not to slip 
           on ice patches. Uses his good arm to lift his dislocated arm 
           above his head, winces as he pops his shoulder back in. 

           Up ahead, he sees a METAL PLATE on the floor. KA-TUNK! The 
           plate’s lock pops open-- remotely. Romulous lifts the plate, 
           to reveal a SHAFT-- two stories straight down. No handholds. 
           Light at the bottom. He steps to the nearest wall-- running 
           his fingers along the stones. Must know what he’s looking 
           for; he finds a CRANK. As he turns it, a LADDER, built flush 
           into the shaft’s wall, churns out. 

           INT. STORAGE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Filled with TWENTY POLICEMEN. Using a crowbar, they pry the 
           Rusty Decoy Door open, it leads to another storage area. TWO 
           CHINESE MEN and MSS WOMAN, in business suits, hustle down the 
           stairwell. Enter the basement. Head over to the Police--

                                 MSS WOMAN
                        (We’ve apprehended the operative.) 

                                 POLICE CAPTAIN
                        (You are mistaken. He is in--)

           She flashes her Ministry of State Security BADGE--

                                 MSS OFFICER #1

           -- the CIA CREST on a CHERRY WOOD WALL. TWO SUITS flank CIA’s 
           Deputy Director of Operations ELAINE MASON (50's), standing 
           around a reflective onyx conference table. Eliot enters.

                        Mason, early enough for you.

                        Don’t worry, Admiral. It wasn’t us. 

           Mason touches the table. It’s a massive TOUCH SCREEN MONITOR. 
           (we'll make it work like an iPhone). 

           She brings up a DOSSIER WINDOW, we see a PHOTO OF YURI--

                        Yuri Povlovsky. Russia’s top 
                        computer scientist. He was the 
                        architect of their electronic 
                        attack on Estonia in 2006, and the 
                        more sophisticated operation they 
                        launched against Georgia last year.

                                 SUIT #1
                        Essentially, Povlovsky directs a 
                        viral code to seize millions of 
                        computers, then bombards another 
                        country’s technical infrastructure 
                        with so much traffic it ceases to 
                        operate.   

                                 MASON
                        In Georgia, he turned it into a 
                        weapon by taking down their radar 
                        and communication systems two hours 
                        before Russian mechanized infantry 
                        invaded. China wanted the same 
                        capabilities, so--

           Brings up PHOTOS OF YURI’S FAMILY; we recognize them all. 

           Eliot eyes the family carefully.

                                 MASON
                        -- four months ago, they kidnapped 
                        Yuri’s family while on vacation in 
                        Turkey, and forced him to defect. 
                        He would have accelerated China’s 
                        electronic warfare program by a 
                        decade-- something someone, most 
                        likely Russia, could not allow.

           She brings up RECORDED TOP-DOWN SATELLITE FOOTAGE: The Four 
           MSS Agents shuttling YURI out of his building--

                                 MASON
                        Harbin, China. Three hours ago. 
                        This man is Yuri Povlovsky.

           -- let’s it play-- a FIRE HYDRANT explodes-- a HAILSTORM of 
           ice-- Romulous firing-- throwing Yuri in the SUV--

                                 MASON
                        This operative cannot be identified 
                        here, but he’s clearly world-class. 

           Mason shifts the screen a COUPLE MILES over Harbin. Now we're 
           watching what happened at the OTHER SITE:
                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           -A top-down view of a FULL ON SHOOT-OUT-- an Agent takes a 
           HEADSHOT-- his brains blow on Yuri's Son-- whose shirt is 
           torn as they’re dragged towards one of the getaway vehicles--

                                 MASON
                        Two team simultaneous hit. The 
                        second team wasn’t as good. They 
                        had to leave Povlovsky’s daughter. 

           -Natalia is surrounded by MSS AGENTS thrown into another 
           vehicle. POLICE CARS are streaking in from all over.

           -Forty yards away, the Caucasian Agents surrounding Yuri's 
           Wife and Son have to pile into their Vehicles and bug out.

                                 SUIT #1
                        Forty minutes after Povlovsky 
                        disappeared, cell phone chatter in 
                        Harbin went crazy in a third 
                        location. We managed to hack 
                        Harbin’s traffic cameras-- 

           TRAFFIC CAMERAS SHOW: Romulous’ escape-- holding Natalia-- 

                                 SUIT #2
                        On his primary mission, he was 
                        careful never to let a camera catch 
                        his face. We can assume that means 
                        the first part was carefully 
                        planned-- and this part-- was not. 

           A STILL FRAME-- ZOOMS IN ON ROMULOUS’ FACE. 

                                 MASON
                        We mapped his features and matched 
                        him to a CIA Dossier. Cryptonym is 
                        Romulous. Real name is Christopher 
                        Kilmoonie. Former Delta Force, CIA 
                        Special Activities Division, and 
                        for the last seven years, a very 
                        reliable, Congressionally deniable 
                        Independent Contract Operative. 
                        Since CIA had nothing to do with 
                        his mission, it’s clear he’s chosen 
                        to hire himself out. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        I got a four AM ass-chewing from 
                        the Secretary of State because 
                        Russia framed CIA for this?
                                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)

                        Probably. NSA recorded a large 
                        spike in Russian radio 
                        communications in the area. 

           SUIT #1 taps the tabletop, brings up a SATELLITE IMAGE OVER 
           HARBIN; the same area Romulous went underground.

                                 SUIT #1
                        This is where it gets weird. Harbin 
                        has traffic cameras everywhere 
                        except for this four block section. 
                        Apparently Romulous knew it. 
                        Judging from the amount of MSS 
                        radio transmissions, we think he’s 
                        still in the area. 

           Eliot’s pulls his vibrating SECURE CELL/PDA out. Nothing but 
           gibberish onscreen until he touches the FINGERPRINT SCANNER 
           on the side. The screen wipes, leaving the message:

           ‘REMUS en route to Virginia. On the ground in fifty minutes.

           A birds eye view, gliding over the frosted countryside of--

           -- following in the wake of a HELICOPTER.

           The helicopter flares on the white lawn. REMUS, AKA WILLIAM 
           ROOSEVELT (30's) hops out. Got the looks without the vanity; 
           he's the kind of guy who makes friends on airplanes.

           INT. ELIOT’S ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           ELIOT heads towards the front door-- passing PHOTOGRAPHS of a 
           life lived in military and political spheres. OLD PHOTOS of 
           Eliot from Vietnam-- lead to NEWER PHOTOS of Eliot with 
           Presidents and Prime Ministers. 

           Will RAPS the door, enters. Eliot stares at him. In awe. 

                                 ELIOT
                        Good god, William. Lazarus couldn’t 
                        have recovered faster.

           Wraps him in a warm, fatherly embrace. Takes Will’s head in 
           his hands, marvelling his face; SCARS are barely visible.

                        All in the genes, sir. 

           Will is completely at ease as Eliot traces the scars. Eliot 
           is family; the closest thing to a father he’s ever had. 

                                 ELIOT
                        Reconstruction really came 
                        together. For the shock value, I’m 
                        almost glad I couldn’t visit you 
                        last month.

           Will shows Eliot a BOX: ‘SONNY BRYAN’S BBQ. DALLAS, TX.’

                                 ELIOT
                        I thought I told you to hurry. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I had to wait for the jet. Pulled 
                        pork; I know how you like to eat 
                        weird shit for breakfast. 

           Will heads towards the kitchen, passing PHOTOS-- 

           HOLD ON THREE IMPORTANT ONES: 

           -Eliot (30’s) standing with Will (age 6) and Chris, AKA 
           Romulous (age 7) in front of a MASSIVE STONE BUILDING. A sign 
           reads ‘George Washington School for Boys’. 

           -Eliot (30’s) with WILL and CHRIS (7 and 8)-- both of whom 
           are receiving their yellow belts in a Dojo.  

           -SAME TWO BOYS (14 and 15; now clearly Will and Romulous ) 
           wear military academy uniforms in a drill line.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Will heads right for a drawer. Grabs a fork. Hands 
           ‘breakfast’ to Eliot-- who puts it in the fridge.

                                 ELIOT
                        I’ll have it later. How’s the knee?

                                 WILL
                        Three pins had to stay in, but it's 
                        back to a hundred percent.

           Eliot glances at Will's hands-- TWIN SCARS on both sides.

                                 ELIOT
                        Are you?

                                 WILL
                        Yep. I’m ready to get back to work.
                (Eliot’s face falls)
                        Where’s Chris-- is he okay? 

                                 ELIOT
                (glances at his watch)
                        For the moment--

           INT. ELIOT’S OFFICE- CONTINUOUS

           -- Eliot sits down at his desk, Will sits across from him.

                                 ELIOT
                        Your brother did his best to keep 
                        it from you, but he experienced a 
                        psychotic breakdown in Serbia and 
                        has not been the same since. 

           Eliot pulls an EYES ONLY file out, hands it over. PHOTOS OF: 
           BARBARIC VIOLENCE-- snippets of CORPSES with pulp for heads. 

                                 ELIOT
                        You’d recognize their faces if the 
                        skulls weren’t collapsed. After he 
                        neutralized the threat, he took a 
                        metal pipe to all survivors. 

                                 WILL
                        Pretty damning photos without the 
                        reason. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I thought I’d spare you.

                                 WILL
                        Since when have I been squeamish?

           Eliot hands over VIDEO FRAMES, blown up as PHOTOS: a barely 
           recognizable WILL-- tortured, ruined, NAILED to the floor. 
           NEXT PHOTO-- we realize it’s not a floor but a wall. Someone 
           crucified him. That’s where the SCARS came from.

                                 WILL
                        If the roles were reversed, I 
                        would’ve done the same thing.

                                 ELIOT
                        You wouldn’t have. Chris snapped. 
                        We don’t snap. Our entire job is 
                        about maintaining objective 
                        distance. 
                (a beat, it gets worse)

                        Besides, if it was an isolated 
                        incident, that would be one thing--

           PHOTOGRAPHS: a MASSACRE at the barn in HARBIN. We recognize 
           corpses: they’re all the Caucasian agents. Agent One took two 
           in the head. Someone executed all of them. 

                                 ELIOT
                        -- Christopher organized a snatch 
                        and grab in Harbin, China. It went 
                        down four hours ago. Those are the 
                        men he hired to help him. 

                                 WILL
                        You think Chris did that?

                                 ELIOT
                        All I know is that CIA had nothing 
                        to do with any of it--
                (a shock to Will)
                        -- and every piece of evidence 
                        points to Russia as his employer. 

                                 WILL
                        Gimme a break, Eliot. It’s Chris.

                                 ELIOT
                (sharply)
                        William. The only certainty at the 
                        moment is that family is family, 
                        and your brother is in deep shit.   

           Eliot takes a remote, turns a LARGE PLASMA on--

           SCREEN SHOWS: a SCHEMATIC of the SAFEHOUSE IN HARBIN, located 
           deep underground-- directly below the ORTHODOX CHURCH. Two 
           thousand square feet, including the FIVE UNDERGROUND HALLWAYS 
           that SPIRAL OUT from the sanctuary itself.

                                 ELIOT
                        He’s stuck in Harbin’s Abelard 
                        Sanctuary. And since he used his 
                        old CIA access code to gain entry-- 
                        China thinks we sent him.

                                 WILL
                        CIA can’t claim him anyway?

                                 ELIOT
                        Not a chance; odds are Russia won’t 
                        either. His mission infuriated the 
                        MSS. He is a diplomatic nuke.

                        So we’ve got thirty-two hours to 
                        get him out.

                                 ELIOT
                        Just under. China is acting like 
                        Sparta laying siege to Troy. 

           Eliot hits a couple buttons on the remote- A NEW DISPLAY 
           COMES UP: TOP DOWN OVER THE RUN DOWN STOREFRONT--

                                 ELIOT
                        This is from our last pass. 

           An OVERLAY shows has CARS and TRUCKS-- marked with circles. 
           Some MEN on the street are circled as well. A BUILDING across 
           the park, is also marked in red--

                                 ELIOT
                        Sanctuary is here. MSS temporary 
                        operations command is here. Circles 
                        denote vehicles or agents that have 
                        been transmitting. Bare minimum, 
                        we're looking at fifty Chinese 
                        assets covertly monitoring all 
                        exits. Good news is Harbin’s in the 
                        middle of their International Ice 
                        Festival, so as soon as you get 
                        through the outer perimeter, it 
                        gets easier. I assume you two have 
                        periodic check-in protocols? 

                                 WILL
                        We do. And we’re operating under 
                        the assumption whoever did that--
                (photos of barn massacre)
                        -- may not be all that happy Chris 
                        is still alive? 

                                 ELIOT
                        Yes. Unless he was in on it. 

           We hold on Eliot’s face, as we SMASHCUT TO--

           EXT. ESTATE GROUNDS - DAY

           -- Will throwing two DUFFEL BAGS into the helicopter. Glances 
           back at Eliot. As the rotors ROAR to full power, we CUT TO--

           INT/EXT. ELIOT’S TOWNCAR - DAY

           -- Eliot’s DRIVER racing down the Virginia freeway. Eliot, in 
           back, makes a phone call.

                        It’s time to brief the Director. 

           EXT. DIRECTOR ANDERSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Nothing fancy. Clear the Director hasn’t ever worked in the 
           private sector. His BLACK SUBURBAN pulls into the drive. 

           Eliot and Mason are waiting for him.  

           INT. DIRECTOR ANDERSON’S STUDY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           TWO SUITED SECURITY AGENTS flank the door. Anderson searches 
           the faces of Eliot and Mason. Walker enters. 

                                 WALKER
                        Sorry. Got here as soon as I could.

                                 ELIOT
                (to Security Agents)
                        Thank you, that will be all.

           They exit. A moment passes. 

                                 ELIOT
                        One of the first things new 
                        Presidents, and often, new CIA 
                        Directors do-- is ask to be brought 
                        up to speed on conspiracy theory 
                        101. JFK, Area 51, etc.

                        The truth is always a let down. 
                        There’s only one secret every new 
                        Director finds surprising.

           Eliot pulls an OLD FILE from his bag. Hands it to Anderson.

                        In 1939, a week after Hitler 
                        invaded Poland, the heads of 
                        Soviet, British, American, French, 
                        and German Intelligence met 
                        secretly in Oslo, Norway.

                        anyway; foreseeing the need for a

                        - he was captured by a nun right 
                        afterwards. Truth is he made it to 
                        the Vatican’s Abelard Sanctuary 
                        where the Vatican Administrator 
                        barred him entry. The Administrator 
                        should’ve been terminated, but he 
                        successfully argued that if he had 
                        allowed Ali Agca Sanctuary, the 
                        ensuing investigation would have 
                        revealed, and ended the Abelard 
                        Agreements. An ammendment went into

RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH'S ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Will ties TWO ROPES to TWO SEPARATE PILLARS. He pulls a 
           PNEUMATIC CANON from his back. Waits for a FIRECRACKER to 
           EXPLODE, then fires a GRAPPLING HOOK across a fifty-yard gap 
           and onto the roof of THE TALL OLD BUILDING next door. 

           EXT. A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND - NIGHT

           LOOKING DOWN ON WILL-- as he sweeps across the gap between 
           the buildings. THREE ROPES feed through THE MECHANIZED ROPE 
           CLIMBING MACHINE, hanging from his harness. About the size of 
           a shoebox (presently in use by U.S. Special Forces).

           INT. ABELARD SANCTUARY - NIGHT

           Chris glances at his watch: 3:15...3:14...3:13. Chinese Man 
           returns Chris’ GUN. 

                                 CHINESE MAN
                        You still have five hours to be 
                        claimed-- are you certain you don’t 
                        want to wait?

           Yep. Chris chambers a round, steps out the door, and RUNS. 

           EXT. ROOF OF TALL OLD BUILDING - NIGHT

           Will has unlatched himself from the ropes. Shifting silently 
           around FOUR MSS SENTRIES until he arrives at--

           A LARGE ROOFTOP STRUCTURE. He finds an ACCESS HATCH. Picks 
           the lock in three seconds. Opens the hatch to reveal THICK 
           CABLES. The structure is the top of an ELEVATOR SHAFT.

           INT. ABELARD ESCAPE SHAFT - MOMENT LATER

           Chris silently climbs up a ladder-- dark above.

           EXT. ROOF OF TALL OLD BUILDING - NIGHT

           Will, crouched right in front of the rooftop structure, pulls 
           TWO POUCHES from his belt. His flicks a SWITCH on the first 
           one. As a LIGHT BLIPS ON, we CUT TO--

           INT. ABELARD ESCAPE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- Chris’ WATCH. A MATCHING LIGHT blinks on.

           EXT. ROOF OF TALL OLD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Will arms the SECOND POUCH. As the light blinks, we CUT TO--

ABELARD ESCAPE SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

           -- Chris’ watch. A SECOND LIGHT appears besides the first. 
           He's paused on the ladder, below the lip. Waiting. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS

           Will nestles the First Armed Pouch among the elevator CABLES. 
           Looks down the elevator shaft, then drops THE SECOND POUCH--

           WE FOLLOW THE POUCH-- DOWN THE SHAFT-- FOUR STORIES DOWN, it 
           lands on the elevator’s roof.

           INT. ABELARD ESCAPE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Chris remains paused on the ladder. His watch reads: 
           38...37... both RED LIGHTS glow steadily. 

           CAMERA RISES TO REVEAL-- TEN MSS AGENTS at the exit. Soon as 
           Chris climbs up, they’ll have him dead to rights. An OLD 
           ELEVATOR can be heard humming nearby.

           BACK DOWN THE SHAFT - ON CHRIS

           When his watch hits '30' Chris taps the FIRST BUTTON--

           EXT. ROOF OF TALL OLD BUILDING - NIGHT

           The ROOFTOP STRUCTURE-- BLOWS UP!

           INT. ABELARD ESCAPE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           A rumble, then a sudden wind, as the ELEVATOR, blown free of 
           it's rooftop supports, lands! BOOM! The MSS Officers get 
           knocked off their feet--

           CHRIS-- leaps out of the shaft. MSS AGENTS recover, but 
           before they can fire, Chris hits the SECOND BUTTON on his 
           watch. While diving to the ground--

           THE SECOND POUCH (ON TOP OF THE CRUMPLED ELEVATOR) EXPLODES!

           THE FIREBALL RIPS ACROSS THE ROOM, engulfing the MSS Agents, 
           flashing over Chris' head. Chris rolls to his feet, runs past 
           MSS Agents. Cooked, eardrums blown out, no longer a threat.

           His watch reads: 13...12...as he bounds up the remains of the 
           stairwell, rounds the corner and runs into FIVE MSS AGENTS!

           Too close to fire. It's hand-to-hand-- and whatever Chris’ 
           fighting style is, we’ve never seen it before. His hands are 
           blurring so fast, it’s got to be on the bleeding edge of 
           human capability. He takes out all FIVE in four seconds. 
                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)

           Christopher’s fighting style actually exists)

           EXT. BOTTOM FLOOR LOBBY - TALL OLD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Chris runs out, dives behind a car-- plainclothes MSS AGENTS 
           can't believe it. They whip guns out:...3...2...

           WILL drops INTO FRAME; rope stretching more than anticipated. 
           Crashes hard onto the roof of the car, denting it. Chris 
           jumps on him, reaches down and CRANKS THE ROPE MACHINE TO 
           FULL POWER. They're WHIPPED UP like ragdolls!

           ON CHRIS AND WILL - RACING UP THE WALL

           Will draws his knife, slices ONE of the THREE ROPES feeding 
           through the machine. It’s the rope attached to the grappling 
           hook directly above. As it SNAPS, we CUT TO--

           EXT. THE GROUND - CONTINUOUS

           -- MSS OFFICERS training flashlights on the TALL OLD 
           BUILDING. All they find is a sliced ROPE yo-yoing.

           EXT. QUICK SNIPPETS - BUILDINGS AROUND HARBIN - NIGHT

           THE FOUR SNIPERS- scan the buildings-- trying to find-- 

           CHRIS AND WILL 

           sweeping sideways, still attached to the TWO ANCHOR POINTS on 
           the roof of the Church. ROPE CLIMBING MACHINE races to suck 
           them up to the top before they crash into the church's wall.

           EXT. TOP OF THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           They smash into the wall just below the lip. Gotta hurt, but 
           they don't slow as they roll onto the roof, right as SNIPER 
           BULLETS blast chunks of stone free-- careful to stay below 
           the balustrades, they duck-run across a thin catwalk. Will 
           grabs the TWO LARGE BACKPACKS he stashed--

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH

           -- they run right off. Still clipped into the anchor points, 
           they drop rapidly down. A controlled descent--

           INTO AN ALLEY

           Will and Chris tear open the backpacks. Pull out DOWN COATS, 
           festooned with GAUDY NORWEGIAN FLAGS. TWO FESTIVAL I.D.'s, 
           PASSPORTS, BOTTLES OF BOOZE, and ICE FESTIVAL commemorative 
           hats. Then walk casually into the back door of a HOTEL--

           EXT. FRONT OF HOTEL - NIGHT

           -- and stumble right up to a POLICE CHECKPOINT. POLICE let 
           the 'tourists' through, where they disappear into a HUGE 
           INTERNATIONAL CROWD-- BUILDINGS OF ICE glow all around.

           MSS OFFICERS round the corner-- PULL BACK-- looking out on an 
           OCEAN OF VISITORS. Chris and Will may as well be ghosts.

           INT. STOLEN CHINESE CAR - PRE-DAWN

           Will is driving. The IGNITION SWITCH hangs from the steering 
           column. Chris is examining the bleak, but gorgeously pristine 
           woods of Northeastern China. The tension is thick.

                                 WILL
                        Someone massacred your entire 
                        second team. 

           This is news to Chris. That much is certain. 

                                 CHRIS
                        When?

                                 WILL 
                        Right after you left. I’m glad you 
                        didn’t know, but it opens up a 
                        whole other can of shit. Who were 
                        you working for?

           Unlike Will, Chris always thinks before speaking.

                                 CHRIS
                        Who do you think?

           Will looks at him-- reads him. Both really confused now. 

                                 WILL
                        You thought Eliot sent you? 
                (Chris nods)
                        Eliot thinks you went rogue; the 
                        rest of CIA thinks you whored 
                        yourself out for the Russians. 
                        How’d you get your orders?

                        Our standard coding system. 

           Another beat-- definitely bad news as they both realize--

                                 WILL
                        Someone co-opted Eliot’s codes.

                        There’s only two ways that could

           WALKER exits Director Anderson’s office, followed by the 
           DIRECTOR himself. They say something we can’t hear.

           Before he can process it, his intercom BEEPS, and we CUT TO--

                        Who has the most to lose if the 
                        Mercury Initiative is successful?

                                 MASON
                        The country with the world’s 
                        largest energy reserves; Russia. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Means any move Russia makes has to 
                        be analyzed through that lens. What 
                        are the odds Remus and Romulous 
                        know anything useful?

                                 ELIOT
                        Romulous may know who hired him--
                                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)

                                 ELIOT
                        If it was Russia-- no. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Then I want them taken out. 
                (off Eliot’s look)
                        They’re traitors who know far too 
                        many government secrets. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’ll find a way to bring them in. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Do your best--
                (to Mason)
                        -- but if you locate them before 
                        they voluntarily turn themselves in 
                        for a life sentence in Leavenworth, 
                        hit them with a surgical strike-- 
                (Eliot begins to respond)
                        -- that will be all. 

           INT. ELIOT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Eliot’s computer BLINKING with an alert-- 

           ONSCREEN: clicks on a list of MILITARY CONTRACTORS. Another 
           click-- Chris and Will’s photos and info pop up along with:

               -Kilmoonie, Christopher T-- Cryptonym Romulous.
               -Roosevelt, William B-- Cryptonym Remus.

               -Assets to be terminated on sight--    

           CLOSE ON Eliot’s pained face, remembering, as we DISSOLVE TO--

           EXT. FLASHBACK - PUBLIC HOUSING TENEMENT - DAY (1978)

           -- A GOVERNMENT SEDAN parks near a row of FILTHY APARTMENTS.

           INT. FLASHBACK - WORLD'S DIRTIEST APARTMENT - DAY

           Piles of DEAD FLIES cover every tabletop-- surrounded by 
           pieces of old curled up bologna and sardine heads.

           IN THE KITCHEN-- YOUNG WILL (5) hovers over an oily sardine. 
           He's as dirty as his environment. The garbage is piled high 
           with TIN CANS. Clearly all he's been living on.
                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           A FLY alights on the fish head. Will takes aim. Makes it 
           sporting by waiting until the fly takes flight. SNAP!

           As the fly pinwheels out of the air, the stairwell CREAKS. 
           Young Will’s reaction is primal-- he bolts into-- 

           THE BASEMENT-- where he hides in the corner. ELIOT (30’s) 
           kneels down. They take their first good look at each other.

                                 ELIOT
                        You must be William. I can tell 
                        from the way you handle yourself 
                        that you must be Gerry's son. He 
                        was a good friend of mine.

           Will doesn't let his emotions betray a thing.

                                 ELIOT
                        I've come to help. I know your 
                        mother left.

                                 WILL
                        She's coming back.

           But Will knows it's not true. Tears run down his cheeks. The 
           disturbing part is that he cries like an adult. No loud 
           noises, no huffing, just tears as we DISSOLVE TO--

           INT. FLASHBACK - DAY

           - YOUNG CHRIS (6) in an ORPHANAGE. Standing in a line of 
           ORPHANS. A COUPLE peruses, might as well be shopping for 
           cars. They pause in front of Chris. He gives them a hopeful 
           smile. His teeth are disgusting. They move on.

           -- THE SAME SCENARIO REPEATS--

           ANOTHER COUPLE pauses in front of Chris (7). This time, he 
           gives them his best closed-lip smile. They keep walking.

           -- THE THIRD TIME WE SEE IT--

           Chris, emotions on his sleeve, doesn't even look up as ELIOT 
           (30's) kneels in front of him.

                                 ELIOT
                        You must be Christopher. Amazing; 
                        you look just like your father. He 
                        was a good friend of mine. I 
                        promised him I’d look after you.

           As Chris studies his savior, we DISSOLVE BACK TO--

THE PRESENT - ELIOT’S OFFICE - DAY

           -- Eliot, staring at the Burn Notice.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING - SUNSET

           A landscape pure as any in the world. Snow-capped peaks in 
           the distance. Summer in the southern hemisphere.

                      INSERT SUPER: PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA

           A BATTERED LAND CRUISER works its way across a STREAM, 
           towards a CABIN-- nestled at the base of a towering cliff.

           INT. CABIN - SUNSET

           Chris, favoring his good arm, carries BOXES OF FOOD in from 
           the Land Cruiser. Will’s behind him, loaded up as well. Looks 
           like they’re prepping to be here for awhile.

                                 WILL
                        Think Eliot will task us with 
                        executing whoever did it? 

           Chris, leaned over, shoving a box under a table--

                                 CHRIS
                        Depends on why it was done. 

           When Chris stands, the CROSS Natalia gave him has come out; 
           attached to a new leather thong around his neck. 

                                 WILL
                        Someone in CIA sets you up to die, 
                        and you think their reason is 
                        relevant?  

           OUTSIDE-- walking towards the Land Cruiser.

                                 CHRIS
                        Can’t use revenge as motivation, 
                        Will. Not in our line of work.

                                 WILL
                        It’s not revenge I’m after--

           Chris looks at him: give me a break.

                                 WILL
                        Not just revenge. It’s also about 
                        making the next suit think twice 
                        about screwing his own soldiers.

                                 WILL
                        I’d gut President Ross if he 
                        betrayed you. 

           They smirk, fully aware not too many people would take that 
           as an admission of affection. Then Will notices the cross.

                                 WILL
                        What’s that?

                                 CHRIS
                        It was a gift. From the little girl 
                        in Harbin. 

                                 WILL
                        How the hell did she have time to 
                        give you a present?  

           BACK INSIDE THE CABIN

                                 CHRIS
                        She handed it to me as I put her in 
                        the car. Told me it was for the 
                        good guys.  

           Will looks at his brother-- reads him easily.

                                 WILL
                        You are one of the good guys. 

           Chris doesn’t react. Will puts his bags down. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t tell me you think these-- 
                (re: scars on his hands)
                        -- make that cross mean something? 
                        We’re talking about a couple nails, 
                        man, not some proof of divinity. 

           Chris hardens at the lighthearted response. Will softens.

                                 WILL
                        Eliot told me about your breakdown. 
                        I wish you’d talked to me about it.

           Chris opens a cabinet full of WEAPONS. He pulls out an M-5 
           RIFLE. Will takes a second RIFLE. Both start cleaning them. 

                                 CHRIS

                        So you didn’t want to burden me, or 
                        you didn’t think I was going to

                        I dropped four Serbs on my initial 
                        entry. Closed the gap on the other 
                        six, and took them down hand-to-
                        hand. One ran away. Last thing I 
                        remember was seeing you hanging on 
                        the wall. I came out of it after 
                        I’d killed the runner. He couldn’t 
                        have been older than fifteen. I 
                        must have chased him down, dragged 
                        him back in, then made him watch as 
                        I brained every survivor with a 
                        pipe-- before I did it to him.    

                                 WILL
                        I remember that kid; he was pretty 
                        handy with a blowtorch and pliers. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Doesn’t matter. 

                                 WILL
                        He wasn’t learning on me.

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s not what I mean. I’ve been 
                        tiptoeing the dark edge for a long 
                        time. After I broke like that, I 
                        knew I was done. 

                                 WILL
                        How’d you end up taking on the 
                        Harbin assignment, then?

                                 CHRIS
                        Came in as a coded emergency. 
                        Saving a family-- felt right. 
                        Afterwards, at the rendezvous, Yuri 
                        and his wife were begging me to go 
                        back for their daughter, and their 
                        son was staring at me, and his face 
                        was all bloody, and he reminded me 
                        of you, the first day we met--

           Chris, finished cleaning the M-5 puts it back, grabs another.

                        I wanted to put their family back 
                        together. I like to think the cross 
                        means I made the right choice, but 
                        I know I can’t just do the missions 
                        and ignore the rest. Not anymore.

                                 WILL
                        You’re thirty-five and you want to 
                        retire? What would you even do with 
                        yourself? Get a desk job? 

           Chris doesn’t answer. Will knew he wouldn’t, he’s just 
           incapable of staying introspective. The opposite of Chris. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever you choose to do, you know 
                        I'll always back you. But hold off 
                        on any major decisions until Eliot 
                        gets here.

                        -- she had a necklace. Her father 
                        instructed her to ‘give it to the

           Chris and Will, are busy donning what appear to be WETSUITS 
           with HOSES. They pull on another layer: GHILLIE SUITS. Makes

           the CLIFF FACE. Nose up to an abrupt hover over--

           A CLEARING. TWENTY-FOUR OPERATORS, total, zip-line down.

           All eyes are pinned to two screens: ONE is a REAL TIME CAMERA

           the THERMAL FEED, we can see exactly where they are:

           - OPERATORS #1-12 are searching the area around the cabin.    
           - OPERATORS #13-24 are searching the top of the cliff area.   

           No evidence of Will and Chris-- until Operators #12 and #13

           Doctoring their wounds. Bodies are covered with horrendous 
           bruises, cuts, and burns. Some fresh. Some older.

                        Those were Nighthawk Helicopters. 
                        Most likely US Special Operations.

                        Looks like whoever set you up in 
                        Harbin just did it again. We got--

                        Pulling out all the stops.

           A TRUCK rambles to a stop, bearing the logo 'TELEFONICA DE 
           ARGENTINA'. An ENGINEER steps out. As he looks at TWO DOWNED 
           WIRES an ARM WRAPS AROUND HIS NECK. Will bears down. Only 
           takes seconds until the Engineer loses consciousness.

           Chris sorts through EQUIPMENT in the truck. Fashions an 
           ADAPTOR, attaches it to the downed line, plugs it into 
           ROUTER, plugs that into the Engineer’s LAPTOP.

           Director Anderson hangs up. Doesn’t trust Eliot’s answer. 
           Walker appears in the door--

                        No sir, but we just got a lead on

                        -- they’re in Lebanon. 

           PULL BACK-- Chris and Will are sweating in the rear. 

           EXT. BORDER CROSSING - DAY

           The PUBLIC BUS drives towards a WELL DEFENDED CHECKPOINT. 
           ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES scour every inch of the vehicle-- 

                  INSERT SUPER: KFAR KILA BORDER CROSSING. ISRAEL. 

           INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

           IDF CAPTAIN steps on, sorts the faces. Chris hides the cross.

                        Is there a Dr. Honeycutt onboard?

                        Christopher.

                        Can either of you give me a reason 
                        why I should ignore CIA’s Burn 
                        Notice and let you into Israel? 

                                 WILL
                        Because we’re asking for your help.

                                 ERIKA
                        How do I know you and Eliot didn’t 
                        decide it was time to cash out and 
                        lead the good life. Thick as 
                        thieves, the three of you. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Sounds like you know more than us.

                                 WILL
                        Is this an act for the camera? If 
                        you came to us for help, we 
                        wouldn’t convene a board meeting. 

           She glares at him. Anyone (other than Will) would wilt. 

                                 WILL
                        It was five years ago--

                                 ERIKA
                        -- you fucked my asset and turned 
                        her into a double agent.

                                 WILL
                        True, but I didn’t know she got off 
                        revealing state secrets beforehand.

                                 ERIKA
                        It wasn’t your intention? What is 
                        that, the Dalai Lama defense?

                                 CHRIS
                (before Will can respond)
                        Erika. We’d appreciate anything you 
                        can tell us about our situation. 

           She keeps her eyes on Will as she pulls a FILE from her bag. 

                                 ERIKA
                        How much do you two know about 
                        President Ross’ Mercury Initiative? 

                                 WILL
                        Never heard of it.

                        In a nutshell, it’s a ten-year plan 
                        to make fossil fuels obsolete. 
                        Nothing revolutionary about a 
                        politician saying they’re going to 
                        do it, but for the first time, the 
                        gloves are coming off.

                        Ross secretly asked the leaders of 
                        the world’s top fourteen energy 
                        importing nations to join him in a 
                        buyers cartel. If you want to bone 
                        up on the economics of cartels--

                        -- here’s the briefing manual. The 
                        effect, in theory, is that energy 
                        costs will drop substantially. A 
                        tax will be added to keep prices 
                        the same as they are now, and 
                        trillions of dollars will be 
                        shifted out of the pockets of the 
                        world’s energy exporters-- and 
                        channeled into the development of 
                        renewable energy technologies.

                                 CHRIS
                        But Ross isn’t planning to gamble 
                        the global economy on a theory. 

                                 ERIKA
                        Nope. CIA, working with its allies, 
                        will maintain the flow of oil 
                        through covert operations 
                        specifically targeting decision 
                        makers in OPEC, and global energy

                                 ERIKA
                        It’s high-risk, but something has 
                        to change.

                                 WILL
                        And if it works, most of Israel’s 
                        enemies just happen to become 
                        completely irrelevant.

                        It’s a nice side effect. But it’s 
                        not the answer you’re looking for--

                        CIA has distributed a tape of you, 
                        in the Bahamas, two weeks ago, when 
                        20 million Euros arrived in your 
                        account. They tracked the origin of 
                        the payment back to a shell 
                        corporation, owned by a consortium 
                        of companies loosely affiliated 
                        with the Russian oil industry.

                        are one of eight separate cells 
                        that have been hired by Russia and 
                        their business partners to

           of Israel. As he remembers their first visit, we DISSOLVE TO--

           INT. FLASHBACK - TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY (1997)

           -- blinding light pours in as the rear gate opens. Eliot, 
           Will, and Chris (all thirteen years younger) step down--

                       INSERT SUPER: ELIAT, ISRAEL, 1997

           A bear-like good ol’ boy in a COWBOY HAT is waiting for them. 
           They all clearly enjoy LUCAS HARDY (50’s). 

                                 ELIOT
                        Hardy. You’ve been dieting? 

                                 HARDY
                        It’s the heat. Base is hotter than 
                        a rattlesnakes ass in August.  

           As he shakes hands with Chris and Will, they smirk--

                        Nice hat, dude.

                                 HARDY
                        It’s a lifesaver. Don’t worry, 
                        ladies, you’ll be underground for 
                        the majority of your stay. 

           INT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY (1997)

           At a CHECKPOINT, manned by fierce looking MOSSAD GUARDS, 
           Chris and Will are voiceprinted-- fingerprints are scanned. 
           They enter an ELEVATOR. Hit the down button.

                                 WILL
                (still about the hat)
                        Quick question, Kemo Sabe-- aren’t 
                        you from Jersey?

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - DAY (1997)

           A GYMNASIUM-- TEN STUDENTS (a mix of Israeli men and women in 
           their 20's) stand at attention. Chris and Will are the only 
           foreigners. IMI SDE-OR (60's) eyes his class. A MALE CADAVER 
           hangs in a standing posture behind him.

           Using a scalpel, Sde-Or cuts two flaps of skin, exposing the 
           RIB CAGE. He flops the skin back, seals the cuts with tape.

           Satisfied, he turns his back on the cadaver, stands flat-
           footed holding his arms out, palms down, parallel to the 
           floor. An ASSISTANT places a COIN on the back of each hand.

           IN A BLUR-- Sde-Or flips his hands over and catches both 
           coins, but in the same instant, the corpse jerks back.

           Sde-Or then strips the tape off the swaying corpse, and pulls 
           the skin back-- the rib cage has been completely shattered!

                                 SDE-OR
                        If he were alive, the ribs would 
                        have punctured the lungs. He'd have 
                        died from asphyxiation; Cyanotic in 
                        three minutes, dead in six. 

           As the Students look on, stunned, Will notices ERIKA for the 
           first time. She doesn't notice him.

           INT/EXT. MONTAGE - TEN WEEKS OF TRAINING (1997)

           IN THEIR ROOM-- Chris and Will place the coins on the top of 
           each others hands. Not even close to catching them--

           BUCKETS OF SWEAT-- students hone their hand-to-hand combat 
           training-- Erika squares off with men and women; her 
           athleticism is lithe, balletic, and deceptively fast.

           AS THEIR SKILLS PROGRESS-- Erika and Will work together. Both 
           can catch the coins now--

                                 SDE-OR (V.O.)
                        The strength of your enemy is

                        translated instantly to action.

           SWEAT. BRUISES. MORE SWEAT-- and electric chemistry every 
           single time Will and Erika are able to brush against each 
           other-- while walking through doors.

           Eliot, monitoring their progress, notices. It’s not hard. 

           IN THE ISRAELI DESERT-- Eliot, Will, and Chris run in the 
           midday sun. Hauling ass.

                                 ELIOT

                        win-- no matter how hard you try. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Want us to slow down? 

                                 WILL
                        Hamas can hear you breathing.

                        not the Virgin Mary over there.

           IN THE MESS HALL-- Will and Erika's thighs touch while 
           eating. Neither moves from the contact.

           against a wall-- while flipping and catching the coins.

           Chris, Erika, and Will are able to do it ten times in a row-- 
           leaving the SAME INK PRINT on the wall in front of them each 
           time. It's an astounding display of precision and speed.

           THE NEXT STAGE: the student practice with MUSIC BLASTING, 
           LIGHTS STROBING, and FOG MACHINES. Total sensory depravation.

                        Fall for an operative it’s worse.

           FINAL TESTING-- students practice on each other-- wearing 
           HUGE CHEST PADS. Eliot stands next to Imi Sde-Or. ERIKA 
           replicates Sde-Or's initial demonstration-- catching the 
           coins in a blur-- as Will jerks back. He heaves. Tries to 
           speak. Tries to say he's okay. Has to take a knee. Then 
           VOMITS. Soldier humor: everyone laughs, including Eliot.

           INT. RED SEA RESORT - DAY (1997)

           Beaches and turquoise water framed in huge windows. Will, 
           Erika, and Chris check in. Wearing civilian clothing.

                                 ELIOT (V.O.)
                        Since your loyalty can’t be given 
                        over to them, lasting relationships 
                        become impossible. 

           INT. THE ROOM - DAY (1997)

           Erika and Will are trying to play it cool, waiting for Chris 
           to leave. He knows what’s up. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I'll be at the pool.

           As soon as he's out-- Erika and Will step towards each other. 

                                 ELIOT (V.O.)
                        I wish I could paint a rosier 
                        picture. Certainly hope I’m wrong. 
                        But that’s all I’ve ever known. 

           Pent-up-love, unable to touch for months-- the kiss is epic.

           IN A BEDROOM

           Fair is fair; we see Erika’s breasts, we show Will’s ass. As 
           Erika climaxes, TEARS run out of her eyes. Will notices--

                        What's wrong?

           Absolutely nothing. As she smiles, we DISSOLVE BACK TO--

           INT. THE PRESENT - AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

           -- A LEAR JET taxis to a stop. The HANGAR doors close as the 
           STAIRS are lowered. ELIOT steps down, followed by TWO GUARDS 
           (30's). They look as formidable as Chris and Will.

                         INSERT SUPER: TEL AVIV, ISRAEL

           A BEAT UP, inconspicuous SUV is waiting for them. Eliot slaps 
           a TRIANGLE STICKER on the roof as he climbs in.

           EXT. FANCY NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           FLYING OVER an ornate FOUR STORY BUILDING--

                        Got eyes on Eliot’s marker--

           Will, on a rooftop deck, slaps SOMETHING on the top lip of--

           -ONE-- TWO-- THREE-- FOUR CORNERS of the roof.

                                 CHRIS(O.S. FILTERED)
                        -- coming up the hill. He's clear.

           Will looks down the hill-- sees the beat-up SUV driving 
           towards them. Will checks his PDA screen. Satisfied with 
           whatever he sees, he heads downstairs.

           INT. OLD FANCY STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           The interior is ambassadorial. Eliot and his Two Guards 
           ascend the stairs.

           INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will opens the door for Eliot, then eyes the Two Guards, who 
           have taken up security positions around the door.

                        That’s the key. Who briefed you? 
                (a beat)
                        Erika?
                (Will nods, Eliot smiles)
                        Oh my-- I would’ve bought a ticket 
                        to watch that bout. Who won?

           Just then-- Chris enters. Eliot gives him a warm embrace. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’m so sorry about Harbin. 

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s okay. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I will get you boys out of this-- 
                (into Chris’ eyes)
                        -- and get you fixed up.

                                 CHRIS
                        I don’t think this can be fixed.

           Eliot sees the leather thong. Curious, he pulls the CROSS up.

                                 WILL
                        He finally settled on a religion.

           Chris notices Guard #1 eye the cross, then look away-- 

           EXT. TOP OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT

           We see the something Will placed on the roof. ONE--TWO--THREE-
           -FOUR SMALL CAMERAS-- pointing straight down.

           INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

           Guard #1 surreptitiously presses a button on his watch. 

                                 ELIOT
                        The problem, Christopher, is that 
                        you believe what we do is wrong.

                                 CHRIS
                        Serial killers say they black out 
                        while committing their crimes. I 
                        always thought that was bullshit 
                        ‘til it happened to me. 

                                 ELIOT
                        Your enemy was torturing the one 
                        person who means everything to you.

           Chris looks away.

                                 CHRIS
                        You ever wonder if there are limits 
                        to the things that can be forgiven?  

            Eliot starts over with him.

                                 ELIOT
                        Remember, when you boys were eight 
                        and nine, I taught at West Point? 

                                 WILL
                        We had you around all year. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’ve never told you the reason. A 
                        mission in Berlin had gone bad. By 
                        the time I got into an ER, I’d lost 
                        so much blood I was legally dead. 
                        Instead of being pulled towards the 
                        white light you’re supposed to see, 
                        I felt a shadow pin me down, and I 
                        heard the Rolling Stones playing 
                        ‘Paint it Black’ as it sliced my 
                        heart out. That’s when they hit me 
                        with the paddles.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t think this is helping--

                                 ELIOT
                        -- Hush, William. I accepted it as 
                        a warning, quit CIA, and took the 
                        West Point job. But the following 
                        spring, I went to a reunion of my 
                        unit from Vietnam, and someone 
                        brought up a story I’d blocked out. 
                        The night my best friend was torn 
                        in half by a mine, we had a 
                        makeshift memorial service for him. 
                        I got plastered. 
                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 ELIOT(cont'd)
                        'Paint it, Black' was playing when 
                        I fell into a ditch and knocked 
                        myself out. I woke up drenched in 
                        blood.

           Eliot opens up his shirt. Among NUMEROUS CUTS and BULLET-HOLE 
           SCARS-- he shows Chris one, a JAGGED SCAR over his heart. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’d fallen on a piece of shrapnel.

                                 WILL
                        How could you forget about a scar 
                        like that?

                                 ELIOT
                        There’s a lot of things I don’t 
                        remember about Vietnam, William. 
                (back to Christopher)
                        Once I realized there was nothing 
                        supernatural about what I’d seen, I 
                        went back to The CIA. Christopher, 
                        the thing you have to answer for 
                        yourself is this: if you are one of 
                        a few people on earth capable of 
                        stopping the next Hitler, what 
                        happens to your soul if you walk 
                        away? We have a duty to send some 
                        people to hell. And if God has a 
                        problem with that, then God has a 
                        problem. Not you.

           Will glances at his PDA. All FOUR CAMERA FEEDS SHOW: VEHICLES 
           zooming in; surrounding the building. ARMED MEN jump out. 

                                 WILL
                        We’re burned--

           Chris glances up at Guard #1, then asks Eliot--

                                 CHRIS
                        Where’s the safehouse exit?

           EXT. THE HALL OF A CONNECTING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

           They hustle towards a CLOSET DOOR with a KEYPAD. Eliot inputs 
           a code. Bleeps back in failure.

                                 ELIOT
                        Code’s been changed--

           Guard #1 and #2, guns out, look down the stairwell. THREE 
           STORIES DOWN-- they hear the FRONT and REAR DOORS KICKED IN!
                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           Eliot looks at the keypad--

                                 ELIOT
                        Blow it off and hotwire it. It's a 
                        Starkly; it will take perfect 
                        timing by both of you to override.

           Chris and Will step up to the KEYPAD. Chris, aiming his gun 
           at an angle, BLASTS an edge up. Will whips out a KNIFE, pries 
           the KEYPAD OPEN, then cuts the wires inside. Four of them--

           Chris readjusts the metal plate on the keypad, doesn’t turn 
           his back on the Guards until he can see them in the 
           reflection, then angles the plate so Will can see Guard #1.

                                 CHRIS
                (whispers)
                        Something’s off about him--

           Chris and Will use all four hands on the wires, both are able 
           to see the REFLECTION BEHIND THEM-- 

           SWAT TEAMS POUND UP THE STAIRS--

                                 WILL
                        Two-- one--

           BOTH GUARDS have been waiting for this moment, when Chris and 
           Will's hands are completely occupied. Helpless--

           IN THE REFLECTION, they watch the TWO GUARDS rip guns up-- 

           THE MOMENT THE GUARDS SHOOT AT THEM--

           Chris and Will are already on the move-- bodies rolling clear-
           - Chris flicks his knife back-- it’s flying towards Guard #1, 
           who dodges, just enough distraction for Will to lunge at him--

           As he does, Guard #2 FIRES! BULLETS hit Will in his back, but 
           Chris is lunging before they can shoot his head.

           Guard #1 blocks Chris’ punch, then wallops him in the face. 
           No one so far has ever been able to even lay a finger on 
           Chris, but Guard #1 seems as fast as he is. 

           TWENTY SWAT SOLDIERS pound the steps-- one floor down now--

           Chris and Will, hands blurring, fight. All four of them are 
           using Sde-Or! A whirlwind of controlled blocks and strikes. 
           Eliot aims his gun at the melee. No safe shot. 

           Chris takes a glancing blow. Guard #1 uses the advantage to 
           dive for his gun, spins around and BLASTS TWO SHOTS at Eliot. 
                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           Both drill Eliot in the chest! He drops. 

                                 CHRIS
                        ELIOT!!

           Christopher is not a man to infuriate, as evidenced by how 
           quickly he gains the upper hand on Guard #1-- hands flash, 
           palms forward-- into Guard #1’s chest. A SICKENING CRUNCH! 

           Then he dives towards Eliot-- yanks his shirt open-- 

           Will rams Guard #2’s head into the wall, denting plaster, 
           stuns him long enough to grab a gun-- FIRING UP! THREE TIMES. 
           Blood blows up; spraying the ceiling.

           Chris sees two slugs buried in Eliot’s BULLET PROOF VEST. 
           Completely relieved. But it only lasts a moment. Eliot 
           reaches up, yanks the CROSS off Chris’ neck. His other hand 
           holds a GUN, aimed at Chris nose. 

           TIME SLOWS DOWN

           Chris stares, childlike, at the Cross in Eliot’s hand and the 
           gun aimed right at his head. Eliot’s pupils contract. He 
           pulls the trigger--

           -- but Will is already throwing Guard #2’s corpse at Chris. 
           Knocking Chris’ head out of the path of the bullet. 

           SWAT TEAM GUSHES from the stairs, but they can't fire through 
           Eliot-- means Chris and Will have a fraction of a second to 
           grab the FOUR WIRES--- press them together in perfect 
           synchronicity. As the SAFEHOUSE ESCAPE DOOR unlocks, they 
           spin inside to the DEAFENING ROAR OF GUNFIRE! The thick, 
           metal door saves their lives--

           INT. THE SAFEHOUSE EXIT CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           -- like a large closet. Except for the FIREMAN’S POLE and an 
           ARESENAL OF WEAPONS.

                                 CHRIS
                (heartbroken)
                        It was Eliot. This whole time. 

                                 WILL
                        Bury it ‘til we’re clear.

           They grab TWO TYPES OF GRENADES: smoke (cylinders) and 
           fragmentation (round)-- then slide down the pole.

GROUND FLOOR - FANCY BUILDING - MOMENT LATER

           NINE SOLDIERS aim at a DOOR. It cracks open. BILLOWING SMOKE 
           GRENADES roll out along with FOUR FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.

                                 CHRIS(O.S.)
                (to save the soldiers)
                        GRENADE!

           Soldiers dive for cover as the FOUR GRENADES EXPLODE!

           INT. UPPER FLOOR - MOMENT LATER

           Eliot looks out-- SMOKE and FIRE obscures everything below. 
           Knows Chris and Will escaped. Hold on Eliot's face. It's not 
           failure that weighs on him. It's genuine anguish.

           EXT. STREETS OF TEL AVIV - DAY

           Will and Chris run towards an CAR. Guns up. Driver SPEEDS UP! 

                                 WILL
                        Fuckin’ Israelis.

           Chris fires two warning shots that blow off the REARVIEW 
           MIRROR. That works. The car skid-stops. They yank DRIVER out!

           INT. STOLEN CAR - DAY

           Will’s driving them along the coast. Both are in shock. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I told him I was done. And instead 
                        of helping me, I became expendable.  
                        Going back for Natalia was the one 
                        thing he didn’t plan for. 

           Chris is reeling; seems scary.

                                 CHRIS
                        He couldn’t kill me in an Abelard 
                        Sanctuary, so he called you. You 
                        weren’t even supposed to be 
                        involved.

                                 WILL
                        But why do it this way? Protocol 
                        would’ve been two to the head as 
                        soon as he had the chance. 

                                 CHRIS
                        He must’ve needed something.

           Christopher thinks for a moment. 

                                 CHRIS
                        It was the crucifix. 

           They drive onto a freeway--

                                 CHRIS
                        He couldn’t ask about it, or I’d 
                        know he was the one who set me up. 
                        But as soon as he knew where it 
                        was, he made sure our hands were 
                        occupied before his Guards 
                        attacked. Backup plan was to get 
                        shot to lure me in, then--

           Chris can’t finish.

                        Bernstein’s still in their

                        Sir, with her access, Remus and

           The road stretches out, flat and straight for a mile in

           HEARING a roar-- landing lights flash on--

           A JET lands, flaps up, airbrakes. It slows. ERIKA lowers the

                                 ERIKA
                        Povlovsky is only useful for one 
                        thing: shutting down a country's 
                        technical infrastructure. 
                (thinking it through)
                        NSA has at least three guys who can 
                        do the same thing-- 

                                 WILL
                        But if any of them launched an 
                        electronic attack, everyone would 
                        know NSA was responsible.

                                 ERIKA

                        behind the attacks on Estonia and 
                        Georgia. Means Eliot now has the 
                        ability to launch an electronic 
                        attack that won’t lead back to CIA.

                        If this is about killing President 
                        Ross, and Eliot uses Povlovsky to 
                        cripple a country's ability to 
                        respond to an emergency, the 
                        ensuing chaos would be the ideal 
                        time to launch an attack on him.

                                 WILL
                        That would explain why Eliot tried 
                        so hard to keep the Harbin mission 
                        a secret. 

                                 ERIKA
                        If Eliot wanted Ross dead, Ross 
                        would already be dead.

                                 WILL
                        Unless he wants to make sure

                        other teams of assassins who may or 
                        may not exist. Problem is, we have 
                        zero hard proof and even less 
                        credibility.

                        didn’t find our how powerful Eliot 
                        really is until I tried to take him 
                        down. 

                                 CHRIS
                        For what? What was it, Hardy?

                                 HARDY
                        I’ve got a hell of a lot of 
                        skeletons, but there are limits. He 
                        was running a program codenamed 
                        Halcyon. It was the most grotesque 
                        betrayal of the ideals I spent my 
                        life protecting--  

           He stares at Chris-- takes a moment, then clams up. 

                                 HARDY
                        Long story short, I tried to burn 
                        him for it-- and failed. The CIA 
                        Director is a political appointee; 
                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 HARDY(cont'd)
                        same with both deputy directors, 
                        but the fourth spot, Chief of 
                        Counterintelligence, is held on 
                        merit. In CIA, it's where the power 
                        resides, and Eliot hasn't kept his 
                        position for twenty years without 
                        breaking every rule.

                                 CHRIS
                        What was Halcyon? 

           Another odd moment-- staring at Chris-- who picks up on it.

                                 CHRIS
                        Does it have something to do with 
                        us?

                                 HARDY
                (changing his mind again)
                        The only reason I’m still alive is 
                        that I was smart enough to hide all 
                        the dirt I had on Eliot in a secure 
                        location before I went after him. 
                        We reached a détente. Long as I 
                        stay gone along with my secrets, he 
                        doesn't come after me.

                                 CHRIS
                        Then why live here?

                                 HARDY
                        It's Eliot. He'll find it someday. 
                        Here, I can still sleep at night. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Can you at least guess why he’s 
                        willing to kill the president over 
                        this Mercury Initiative?

                                 HARDY
                        No, I can’t. And knowing Eliot, 
                        you’re never gonna figure it out.

           EXT. THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Erika, spots something in the distance-- turns her scope--

           SCOPE POV: a few miles away, she sees a LINE OF POLICE AND 
           UNMARKED VEHICLES zooming towards the castle.

           Hardy holds his gaze. Clear he’s choosing not to cooperate.

                        So that’s it then?

                                 WILL (O.S. FILTERED)
                        Chris, get out.

                                 HARDY
                        I gave my whole goddamned life to 
                        CIA, kid, and look where it got me.

                                 CHRIS
                (stands)
                        Guess we’re in the same boat; 
                        difference is we’re trying to do 
                        something about it.

                                 HARDY
                        You’re asking me to throw my life 
                        away for a theory? You have nothing 
                        conclusive.

                                 CHRIS
                        You think we're wrong?
                (Hardy doesn't answer)
                        'When you know, you know. Anything 
                        else is a coward's excuse'. Direct

                                 HARDY
                        That sounds like the simpleminded 
                        bullshit they feed you early on.

                                 CHRIS
                        Sure looks that way, since you were 
                        the one who said it. See how you 
                        feel watching Ross' funeral.

                        If I were Eliot, and I’d predicted 
                        where we were going, I’d place 
                        snipers on the southern ridges.

                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 ERIKA
                        Are you serious? You want to take 
                        down an NSA Substation?

                                 WILL
                        Chris is right. An NSA Mainframe is 
                        the only place we can figure out 
                        where he’s planning to launch the 
                        attack. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We’ll also need some gear.

                                 ERIKA
                        Least Eliot won't be expecting it.

           Will looks down at the SMALL AIRPORT--

                                 WILL
                        We’ve got another problem-- Mossad 
                        just cut you loose for helping us.

           Sure enough, ERIKA’S JET is lifting off without them. 

           EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - DAY

           We see the sign on the tower reads, in English and Polish-- 
           ‘KOPANKA AIRPORT’. A POSH FAMILY is walking towards a small 
           JET. The RENTAL VAN stops-- Erika, Will, and Chris all jump 
           out. We can hear sirens now, as POLICE CREST a hill. 

                                 ERIKA
                        Back in your car. Now.

           Guns out, they run right up into--

           INT. THE COMMANDEERED JET - DAY

           Will aims his gun at the PILOT-- 

                                 WILL
                        Get out.

           No problem. Pilot runs out. Will yanks the throttle to full 
           power. Looking out the window-- rocketing forward.

           INT. THE JET - CRUISING ALTITUDE - DAY

           Chris takes the yoke. Will steps back to THE GALLEY- where 
           Erika downloads a file on her PDA. 

                                 WILL
                        Not worried about a trace?
                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 ERIKA
                        NSA doesn't even have this yet. 
                        SPLINTER encrypts a file, takes a 
                        snapshot of the code, and breaks it 
                        into a thousand images. Then it 
                        inserts those images into a million 
                        more generated to look the same. 
                        It's reassembled when it reaches 
                        the end user. Even if a third party 
                        manages to crack the encryption, 
                        there isn't a computer on earth 
                        that can trace the origin.

           Will nods; cool stuff. They have a moment. Erika looks away.

                                 ERIKA
                        When I heard what happened in 
                        Serbia, I thought about you more 
                        than I’d like to admit. 

                                 WILL
                        Is there any circumstance where 
                        you’d give us another shot?

                                 ERIKA
                        Not without getting creative.

           A beat. Then another--

                                 WILL
                        How creative?

           -- they’re both melting a little. 

                                 WILL
                        Can you at least tell me one thing?

           She knows what he’s going to ask.

                                 ERIKA
                        It was the only time I ever felt 
                        like I could let my guard down. It 
                        never happened with anyone else.

           ERIKA-- finishes typing, keeping her eyes off Will. As she 
           hits 'send', we CUT TO--

           INT. MOSSAD HEADQUARTERS - GENERAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           -- MOSSAD GENERAL, at his computer, reading ERIKA’S MESSAGE. 
           With a couple clicks, brings up the list of NSA EMPLOYEES. 
           Sends it as he picks up his phone-- waits for a moment--
                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 MOSSAD GENERAL
                        I know where they're going.

           INT. JET - NIGHT

           Chris, on the computer, references points on a map of LISBON, 
           PORTUGAL. Plane is on autopilot, but Will keeps looking back 
           and checking on it. 

                                 CHRIS
                        The Columbus II transatlantic cable-
                        - makes landfall here, runs to this 
                        substation. It's owned by a 
                        consortium of thirty companies, one 
                        of which is a front for NSA.

           EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - PORTUGAL - NIGHT

           The stolen jet lands. The airport is tiny. TWO HANGARS. A 
           couple prop planes. No tower. No one on duty. 

           INT. JET - NIGHT

           Will stands up, leaving Erika in the other pilot seat. 

                                 WILL
                        As soon as you're back, just deny 
                        your involvement. There’s no proof. 

           Erika gives him a withering look as she guides the jet into 
           line with OTHER PLANES. Soon as they’re stopped, she kills 
           the engines. Powers the plane down, and stands.

                                 ERIKA
                        I don’t see either one of you 
                        running for cover. And you’re 
                        definitely going to need my help. 

           EXT. VILLAGE - PORTUGAL - NIGHT

           They find a mid 90's TOYOTA CAMRY. Erika pulls out a pocket 
           knife, shoves the nail file in the lock, turns. There's a 
           reason it's the most frequently stolen car on the planet.

           EXT. FOUR STORY HOUSE - LISBON - NIGHT

           RISE UP to the fourth floor bedroom --

           INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           At the foot of the bed, we see a fancy looking SCALE-- the 
           brand name reads: 'ALERE DAYLINK MONITOR'.
                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           DICK (40’s) has a sleep apnea snorkel covering a thick beard. 
           From the shadows, Chris slips over to his bed. With a 
           surgeons skill, a SYRINGE glides into Dick's neck. He wakes 
           with a start-- as the rush of the drugs completely unpin him--

                                 CHRIS
                        Shhhh. Dick. It's okay. You're 
                        going to work in two hours, right?

           Chris removes Dick’s snorkel, then pockets DICK'S GLASSES.

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m working for you today, pal, so 
                        you can to sleep in. How about you 
                        walk me through all procedures and 
                        security protocols?

           FLASHING THROUGH - QUICK SNIPPETS OF IMAGES--

           CHRIS-- taking numerous PHOTOGRAPHS of Dick-- holding an IRIS 
           SCANNER to Dick's eye-- placing strips on Dick's fingertips 
           to make MOLDS-- using a GADGET to measure the distances 
           between Dick’s fingers.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Chris heads out the door. Will is facing away from him. Erika 
           is working on applying makeup to Will’s face. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Will, if you have extra time, see 
                        what you can find out about a 
                        program named code-named Halcyon. 

                                 WILL
                        How come?

                                 CHRIS
                        Something Hardy said. Or didn’t 
                        say. He kind of indicated we were 
                        involved with it, somehow. 

           EXT. FANCY NEIGHBORHOOD - LISBON - PRE-DAWN

           TERRY JAMES (50's) steps out. His house is gorgeous, his suit 
           is crap. As he walks away--

           -- Erika's watching. Soon as he rounds the corner, she steps 
           to his front door, picks the lock, and slips inside.
                                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           INT. A LISBON CAFÉ - PRE-DAWN

           Dick enters. Hold on, it’s not Dick, it’s Will. His make-up 
           isn't perfect, but it's close. He waves to TERRY JAMES, then 
           steps right up and places a LAPTOP on the table. Will can't 
           imitate Dick's voice, so he speaks softly--

                                 WILL
                        Terry James-- look at the screen.

           The SCREEN SHOWS: internet streaming video of A WOMAN in a 
           bedroom. Knocked out, bound, gagged, with a second WOMAN IN A 
           MASK beside her. Holding a KNIFE to her throat.

                                 TERRY
                        That's my wife--

                                 WILL
                        Keep calm, do what we say, and she 
                        won't remember any of this.

           Will looks at a TV in the café, types into the laptop.

           ON SCREEN: the Woman in the Mask (Erika) reads her computer, 
           turns the camera towards a television. Switches the channel-- 
           there's a slight delay, but it's the same broadcast.

                                 WILL
                        Satisfied that we're live?

           INT. NORMAL OFFICE BUILDING - DAWN

           Terry leads Will (in costume) into the building. Will's 
           wearing Dick's glasses, but one arm has been broken off and 
           WRAPPED IN TAPE.

           INT. UNDERGROUND - LEVEL FOUR - DAWN

           They walk out of the elevators, and stop at a SECURITY 
           CHECKPOINT manned by FOUR NSA GUARDS. Will and Terry have to

           Will goes first. BALLISTIC PLEXIGLAS seals him inside. He 
           drops DICK's ID and TAPED-UP GLASSES into a tray. Places his 
           hand on a BIOMETRIC SCANNER. Security Guard #1 puts the 
           GLASSES in a MAGNET MACHINE. BUZZ! He’s in.

           Dick and Terry's cubicle has glass panels; not much privacy 
           (which is the point). The entire space HUMS with lines of 
           work stations. Not a single sheet of paper is visible.

           (cid:13)           TEN MORE NSA EMPLOYEES can be seen in their cubicles.

           Terry and Will sit at two computers, facing each other. Both 
           enter passcodes. The computers have IRIS SCANNERS. As Terry 
           leans into his scanner, his computer BLIPS; scan worked. 

           Will whips off the glasses, pulls the tape off. The ARM has a 
           USB PORT. Will removes the cord from the IRIS SCANNER, 
           inserts the arm of the glasses into the USB slot. ONSCREEN: 
           we see the image Chris took of DICK'S IRIS. Blip. Success.

                        Look up their present deployments.

                                 TERRY
                        Uh-- no go-- same access problem.

                                 WILL
                (scary as the devil)
                        Get creative, Terry.

           Terry goes to work-- as NSA's computers rip through files--

                                 TERRY
                        These guys are careful-- but CIA 
                        rotates their cell phones. If I 
                        backdoor that list-- I can 
                        triangulate the last transmission. 
                        Can't tell what they're saying, but 
                        this is where the phones were used.

           A sequence of DOTS, mostly in Europe. At least TWENTY are in 
           'Switzerland'. 

                                 WILL
                        Soon as I'm clear, your wife will 
                        be released. 

           Terry's computer suddenly shuts down remotely.

                                 WILL
                        What did you flag, Terry?

                                 TERRY
                        I didn't. Look at me. I'm no hero.

           EIGHT GUARDS-- hustle towards Dick and Terry's office-- 

                                 NSA GUARD #1
                        Put your hands above your head!

           NSA EMPLOYEES-- following normal procedures, remain in their 
           seats with their hands visible on their desks.

           WILL-- hawks the Guards, only twenty feet away now. They draw 
           their weapons-- Will puts his hands above his head.

                                 TERRY
                        Please don't hurt my wife.

                                 WILL
                        Then help me get out of here.

                        I can't. Once you're in, you're 
                        stuck. Soon as the alarm trips, 
                        electromagnetic locks automatically 
                        engage on all exits--

                                 NSA GUARD #1
                        -- keep your hands above your head 
                        and step out of the cubicle--

                                 TERRY
                        -- they can stop a truck doing 
                        forty, and can't be opened by 
                        anyone for thirty minutes.

                                 NSA GUARD #1
                        Dr. James, same with you--

           Will looks up at VENTS in the ceiling--

                                 WILL
                        How committed are NSA employees?

           Hands above their heads, they walk out into the hall--

                                 TERRY
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        Are you expected to burn alive for 
                        security?

                                 NSA GUARD #1
                        Get down on your knees--

           -- where the Eight Guards, guns up, surround them. Textbook.

                                 TERRY
                        No. But good luck getting a fire 
                        started in here.

           Good point- the substation is just one big mass of tile, 
           computers, and things that don't burn.

                                 NSA GUARD #1
                        Now lay down on the ground, and 
                        keep your hands in front of you.

           Will and Terry lay on the ground-- Guard #2 approaches-- soon 
           as his knee touches Will’s back, Will's already rolling, 
           wrapping his leg around Guard #2's pelvis, and keeps going 
           until Guard #2 is on top of him-- shielding him from--
                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           -- the rest of the Guards. They can’t shoot, so they jump in. 

           Each of Will’s moves is so fast and rhythmic, it justifies 
           his thirty years of training. In six seconds, Eight Guards 
           are unconscious, or moaning with dislocated arms--

           INT. THE GUARD BOOTH - DOWN THE HALL

           THE LAST GUARD, watches the whole thing behind bulletproof 
           Plexiglas, slams a button. ALARMS BLARE! Sirens spin up--

           BACK IN THE OFFICE

           Terry can't believe what he just witnessed--

                                 WILL
                        Terry. Grab me a bottle of water.

           TERRY-- runs out, snatches a BOTTLED WATER from an Employee.

           WILL-- pops a computer case-- drops a MONITOR on the floor 
           and yanks its POWER CORD OUT. Plugs the cord into an outlet-- 
           then touches the exposed wires to the motherboard-- the 
           embeded Magnesium catches fire in a WHITE FLAME.

           Will tosses two more computers on the FLAME then snatches the 
           BOTTLED WATER from Terry. Dumping water on a Magnesium fire 
           results in a CHEMICAL REACTION. FWOOSH! The fire grows by a 
           factor of five as we CUT TO--

           INT. HALLWAY TO EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           -- the Last Guard eyeing Will, striding towards him. 
           Separated by Plexiglas, Will just waits until-- the HALON 
           FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS KICK ON--

           Last Guard's MONITOR BLEEPS! The ELECTROMAGNETIC LOCKS 
           DISENGAGE, and-- Will, surrounded by JETS OF WHITE GAS from 
           the ventilation system, pushes the door open, and walks out.

           INT. ELIOT'S JET - NIGHT

           Eliot WATCHES FOOTAGE of the NSA BREAK-IN on his computer, 
           reads a list of everything Will and Terry accessed. Easy to 
           put together that they figured it all out. He makes a call--

                                 ELIOT
                        Walker, send their files and photos 
                        to media outlets, and Interpol. 

                                 WALKER (O.S.)
                        What if the Secret Service forces 
                        Ross to cancel his appearances?
                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 ELIOT
                        I know Ross. He knew the risks when 
                        he started this thing. If he goes 
                        into hiding, it all falls apart. 

           EXT. STOLEN TOYOTA - MORNING

           Chris is sitting in a bush. Staking out the car, waiting for 
           Will, who suddenly appears beside the Toyota. 

           INT. STOLEN TOYOTA - MORNING

           Chris pulls out into traffic. Will is frosty.

                                 WILL
                        Geneva. Day after tomorrow. Any 
                        problem stealing the passports?

                                 CHRIS
                        A little-- Erika's going to have to 
                        become 'Jose Saramago'. You okay?

                                 WILL
                        He fucked us, Chris. From day one. 
                        I couldn’t access Halcyon, but I 
                        saw the dossiers of everyone 
                        involved. We are one of thirty 
                        pairs. All of us had fathers killed 
                        in action. None of us are related, 
                        but each pair had a city listed 
                        beside their name. For us, 
                        Philadelphia. Neither one of us are 
                        from there-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        -- that's where George Washington 
                        School for Boys is. 

                                 WILL
                        The military had thorough 
                        evaluations of our fathers. If they 
                        had the makings of an elite 
                        soldier, and the son became an 
                        orphan, Eliot came calling. 

           Both of them are staring out. Traffic strobes past. The 
           rising sun creates starbursting reflections, blurring focus--

                                 WILL
                        Our whole lives were an 
                        indoctrination. Nothing was real. 

           -- as both remember a life shaped rather than chosen--
                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

           - IN THE MILITARY ACADEMY-- Chris(6) and Will(7) are by far 
           the youngest boys in the drill line.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        Someone thinks you two are special. 
                        Are you special, Kilmoonie?

           Chris shakes his head: no. The DRILL INSTRUCTOR slaps him.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        You answer properly!

                                 CHRIS
                        Sir, I'm not special, sir.

           He grimaces at Chris' rotted teeth. Moves on to Will--

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        Someone must think you're a lot 
                        smarter than the rest of these boys 
                        to jump four grades. You think 
                        these boys are stupid, Roosevelt?

                                 WILL
                        Sir, no sir!

           He SMACKS him-- Will keeps repeating his answer-- smacked 
           over and over-- tears drip from Will’s eyes-- crying like an 
           adult. Like when Eliot came for him. Like Yuri’s Son-- 

                                 CHRIS
                (saving Will)
                        I think they're stupid, sir!

           We see the OLDER BOYS, hatred in their eyes. Chris ignores 
           them, makes eye contact with Will.

           IN THE BUNKROOM-- Chris and Will FIGHT, trying to protect 
           each other from the OLDER BOYS, who are mercilessly punching 
           and kicking them.

           IN THE INFIRMARY-- Chris and Will have swollen black and blue 
           faces. Eliot (40's) hurries in, pushing nurses out of the 
           way, as he spins around one--

           SLOW MOTION-- facing away from the boys, we see Eliot make 
           eye contact with the DRILL INSTRUCTOR. All of it was planned. 
           Soon as he spins back towards the boys, his jaw sets in Oscar-
           worthy fury. He takes both of the boys' hands.

                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 ELIOT
                        Your fathers would want me to do 
                        something about this. You ready to 
                        make sure it never happens again?

           IN A DOJO-- both boys work with a JUDO INSTRUCTOR-- SPARRING 
           with bigger and older students-- ELIOT steps into the room. 
           Both boys light up. Ecstatic to see him, they hug his legs.

           ELIOT-- beams at graduations: BLACK BELTS-- DIPLOMAS-- MARINE 
           CORPS-- Eliot is there for all of it as we DISSOLVE BACK TO--

           INT. THE PRESENT - STOLEN MERCEDES- MORNING

           -- even though they have no genetic relation, they look like 
           brothers. Their faces are mirrors: Eliot's a dead man.

                                 WILL
                        All of us went into Special Forces. 
                        The ones who performed well in 
                        combat were sent to Israel to learn 
                        Sde-Or. Which means Eliot’s got his 
                        own secret division of the best 
                        operatives on earth. Reporting 
                        solely to him. And they’re all 
                        heading to Geneva.  

           They pull into a MARINA.

           EXT. MARINA - MORNING

           Walking towards ERIKA, who's untying a CESSNA CARAVAN, the 
           largest single engine FLOAT PLANE around. The door to the 
           plane opens, we recognize the OLD COWBOY HAT (from Israel) as 
           LUCAS HARDY pokes his head out.

                                 HARDY
                        In a fight against a skilled enemy, 
                        the victor never hesitates.

                                 CHRIS
                        Sounds like simpleminded bullshit 
                        they feed rookies at The Farm.

                                 HARDY
                        I fuckin’ hope so. Mr. Roosevelt.
                (shakes hands with Will)
                        Still offering up the only prize 
                        that’d get me back in the game?

CESSNA CARAVAN - 10,000 FEET - MORNING

           Erika's in the pilot seat, Will is beside her. The plane has 
           four rows of seats. Hardy and Chris are in the second row.

                                 CHRIS
                        How'd you find us?

                                 HARDY
                        I'm owed a few favors by some 
                        senior members of Mossad-- one of 
                        whom is doing what he can to help 
                        Erika. He sent me your NSA request. 
                        Wasn't hard to guess what you were 
                        up to. Even easier to follow you.

           EXT. AIRPORT - GENEVA - SUNRISE

           Eliot’s jet pulls to a stop. Swiss Guard surround the plane, 
           providing security as the stairs are lowered. Eliot steps 
           down to a US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN. 

           INT. BACK OF THE CESSNA - DAY

           Erika's topless. Will's wrapping a bandage around her chest. 
           Trying to compress it. Doesn't work. He unwraps, starts over.

                                 ERIKA
                        How are you holding together?

                                 WILL
                        I’ll be better after Eliot’s dead.

                                 ERIKA
                        How about Chris?

                                 WILL
                        Not good. Long as he believed Eliot 
                        was making hard choices, but doing 
                        the right thing, he could manage. 
                        But you yank that away from him-- 

           -- they look up at him. Hardy's flying. Chris is just staring 
           out the window. Erika looks as if she wants to go talk to 
           him, Will shakes his head: not now. He finishes wrapping a 
           second time. Didn't work. He starts unwrapping.

                                 ERIKA
                        You're doing it on purpose.
                (trying to cheer him up)
                        Pervert.

                        I'm not. Wouldn't make me a pervert  
                        if I was though.
                (rewrapping again)
                        Suck it in and try to visualize 
                        what you were like at twelve.

           UP FRONT-- Chris slides into the cockpit. Hardy reads him.

                                 HARDY
                        Channel it, Chris. It’s useful.

           EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

           A U.S. AIRFORCE C-17 GLOBEMASTER, taxis into a MASSIVE 
           HANGAR. As soon as it's inside, SWISS SOLDIERS roll the huge 
           hangar doors closed and take up security positions.

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - DAY

           The Globemaster's rear storage bay is so massive-- BLACK 
           SUBURBANS, CARS, and most importantly, CADILLAC ONE (the 
           President's vehicle) are able to drive out side-by-side.

           INT/EXT. QUICK CUTS - IMAGES OF GENEVA - DAY

           TELEVISIONS: show news reports and PHOTOGRAPHS of Will, 
           Chris, and Erika now. Definitely INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES--

           SWISS POLICE have been positioned around--

           -AIRPORT PASSPORT CONTROL
           -TRAIN TERMINALS.
           -A CHECKPOINT at the SWISS-FRANCE BORDER.
           -The SWISS-ITALY border crossing.

           ALL AROUND GENEVA, we see SUITED CIA and SECRET SERVICE 
           OFFICERS. This is going to be impossible.

           EXT. LAKE COMO - ITALY - DAY

           Their float plane skims in towards a MARINA.

           INT. TRAIN TERMINAL - DAY

           Hardy reads a sign in Italian to 'GENEVA' bound trains--

           NOTE: for the time being, Hardy's face is the only one we 
           see. Will, Chris, and Erika are only shown from the back.

           PASSENGERS are looking at them oddly, then quickly looking 
           away, as if they don't know where to put their eyes.

PRIVATE TRAIN COMPARTMENT - SUNSET

           The Italian Alps race past. ATTENDANT enters the compartment. 
           His reaction is the same as the rest. He looks down--

                                 ATTENDANT
                        (Passport and tickets, please.)

           NOW WE SEE THE PASSPORTS:

           -- all are of smiling PORTUGUESE MEN. All have an official 
           government decal below it that says they are--

           'FIREFIGHTERS'

           And when Attendant looks up at their faces-- Will, Chris, and 
           Erika have used FAKE SKIN to make themselves look like their 
           faces have been SEVERELY BURNED in the line of duty.

                                 ATTENDANT
                (like they're heroes)
                        Let me know if I can do anything to 
                        make your trip more comfortable.

           INT. PRIVATE TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Everyone has removed their makeup, but they've got 
           COMPRESSION MASKS by their sides, just in case. Chris is 
           sitting in the dark as the moonlit landscape blurs past. The 
           following is spoken in a low whisper, so as not to disturb 
           Will and Erika, sleeping on the top two bunks.

                                 HARDY
                        Still have a hard time sleeping?

                                 CHRIS
                        Sometimes.

           Chris is disgusted with himself. Hardy reads him easily. 

                                 HARDY
                        Ninety-eight percent of human 
                        beings suffer extreme mental trauma 
                        from killing. That's a fact. Only 
                        two percent are like Will. It 
                        doesn't mean anything bad about 
                        him, it just means his mind doesn't 
                        reject the idea the way most people 
                        do. I know that because all the 
                        orphans were tested for it. Eliot 
                        was looking for what they termed

           (cid:13)           Hardy pauses--

                                 HARDY
                        You were the only one in the 
                        Program who tested normal. You were 
                        too physically gifted, too 
                        intelligent to pass up. That's why 
                        they made sure you imprinted so 
                        heavily to Eliot. So he could 
                        support you. It's also why you and 
                        Will were the only pair that was 
                        never told the truth.

           Chris just stares at Hardy-- such a monstrous admission.

                                 HARDY
                        You never signed up for what he did 
                        to you, Chris. If God is worth a 
                        shit, he'll put your sins on Eliot.

           As Chris hardens even further-- WILL AND ERIKA look down on 
           him. They were listening to the whole thing.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING - DAY

           - THE CAMERA sweeps in over LAKE GENEVA, a birds-eye view of 
           Europe's most pristine city--

                      INSERT SUPER: GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

           -- CAMERA continues flying over DOWNTOWN, CLOSING ON--

           EXT. A ROOFTOP - DAY

           -- where Four Halcyon Operatives are installing a 
           refrigerator sized MACHINE. BUTES hits a button on the 
           control panel-- flicks green--

           EXT. MANSION - DAY

           Twenty million Euros for this spread. Huge lawns. 
           Unobstructed views. GENEVA is spread out like a carpet below. 

           Eliot’s SUV pulls up the long drive. WALKER is waiting. 

           INT. MANSION - DAY

           Fancy Furniture has been shifted out of a main hall. Tables 
           have TEN COMPUTERS LINED UP in three makeshift workstations.

           YURI POVLOVSKY is manning four computers on his own. From the 
           look on his face, this is not a voluntary assignment. 

                                 COMPUTER OPERATOR #1
                        All systems are running green.

                                 ELIOT
                        Yuri?

           Fingers flying like a concert pianist as Yuri hacks. Only 
           takes a few seconds before-- his screens flicker, switching 
           to real-time TRAFFIC CAMERA FEEDS of GENEVA, real-time MAPS.

           EXT. FRONT OF ANNEMASSE TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Only a couple miles outside Geneva. Chris, Will, Erika have 
           their disguises back on. Hardy hails a TAXI, as we CUT TO--

           INT. A DARK APARTMENT - DAY

           -- A TELEVISION plays a sitcom. They all made it safely. 
           Chris motions to various spots on a MAP of Geneva.

                                 CHRIS
                        E.U. Assembly begins in five hours. 
                        If they want to keep the visit a 
                        secret, Air Force One won't land 
                        until the last possible moment.

                                 ERIKA
                        Airport is here. U.N. Headquarters 
                        is here. The Motorcade can take 
                        numerous routes between them. Means 
                        the only way Eliot can keep the 
                        Secret Service from communicating 
                        with one another will be a Barrage 
                        Jammer strong enough to cover this 
                        entire area.

           Will is taking it all in, but he seems to be on edge--

                                 HARDY
                        They'll have to place it on a 
                        rooftop between-- here-- and here.
                (to Erika)
                        Remember, you can't take the Jammer 
                        out until they launch their attack. 
                        Otherwise Eliot will just call it 
                        off and hit him some other time.
                                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)

                (has an epiphany)
                        Secret Service Operations Command 
                        in D.C. will be watching the 
                        motorcade on satellite. As soon as 
                        the jammer goes active, they’ll 
                        lock down the origin of the signal.

                                 ERIKA
                        Won’t help us, though. They’ll see 
                        where the signal is coming from, 
                        but with the coms down, they won’t 
                        be able to tell anyone.

           Chris heads over to a DESK, digs around. Finds a SHARPIE, 
           hands it to Erika. She understands immediately. Smiles. 

                                 CHRIS
                        With everyone dressed the same and 
                        unable to communicate, we've got a 
                        shot at this.

                                 HARDY
                        Hate to break the hard truth here, 
                        but if Eliot was really concerned 
                        about you, he would've called it 
                        off by now. You might be the best, 
                        but he'll have numbers. 

           Hardy looks around-- they don’t care. Neither does Hardy. 
           Loving that he's got another shot at Eliot. Points to a spot 
           on the map-- motions to FOUR DIFFERENT MARKED ENTRIES. 

                                 HARDY
                        If you can't secure the President, 
                        take him here. Gonna be one hell of 
                        a mind-fuck for Eliot if that 
                        happens. It's an Abelard Sanctuary. 
                        As Commander in Chief, Ross can 
                        claim sanctuary. 

                                 WILL
                        What part of this brings us closer 
                        to killing Eliot? That was the 
                        deal. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Ross first. Eliot second. Even if 
                        Eliot gets away, we’ve got he rest 
                        of our lives to hunt him down--
                                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 HARDY
                        -- what the hell else are you going 
                        to do with yourself?

                                 WILL
                        Don’t joke. You don’t know what it 
                        feels like. I want to kill him 
                        close.  

                                 CHRIS
                        This is about saving a man who’s 
                        trying to change the world. 
                (softly, just to Will)
                        Even if Ross fails, my life can’t 
                        just be about death. 

                                 WILL
                        If we don’t lock him down here, 
                        Eliot’s going to spin his way out 
                        of it, regroup, and come after us. 

           We’ve never seen Chris this emotional-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        I am not asking you. 

           Will gets it: redemption trumps revenge. He nods to Chris.

           A KEY IN THE LOCK-- everyone stiffens.

                                 HARDY
                        It's my guy. It's okay.

           JEAN FRANCOIS pops the door open, starts pushing BAGS OF 
           EQUIPMENT into the Apartment as we CUT TO--

           TAKING STOCK:

           - An arsenal of weapons and body armor, as well as TWO BLACK 
           JUMPSUITS with U.S. SECRET SERVICE MARKINGS on the shoulders. 
           Chris and Will immediately pull them on.

           - TWO MOTORCYCLE HELMETS, SETS OF BULKY LEATHERS, and KEYS.

           - Hardy unpacks a GENEVA TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT UNIFORM, 
           along with a map that shows the FLOOR PLAN OF A BUILDING.

                                 JEAN FRANCOIS
                        I could not get a functional ID on 
                        short notice, but I got the one 
                        thing I did not think possible--

           He pops open a HUGE case for Erika. The MASSIVE RIFLE is--

                        not even have to wear earplugs.

           - ERIKA downloads PHOTOGRAPHS from a Mossad database-- 
           everyone who received Sde-OR training, AKA, the FACES OF ALL 
           HALCYON OPERATIVES. She sends the file to Hardy. He checks 
           his PDA-- nods. Got it. 

           INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - DAY

           TRAVELERS read the DEPARTURE SIGNS-- all of a sudden, flights 
           are DELAYED-- DELAYED-- DELAYED-- everything down the board. 
           What the hell? The answer is out the window--

           -- where AIR FORCE ONE can be seen gliding in for a landing.

           EXT. MANSION - DAY

           Walker and Eliot hustle through a hallway. Earpieces crackle--

                                 VOICE(FILTERED)
                        He just landed, sir.

           INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY

           Waiting. The TELEVISION cuts to BREAKING NEWS: the 
           PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE sweeps past SWISS REPORTER.

                                 HARDY
                        His scheduler lied about the time.

           All snap to action-- Will and Chris zip LEATHER MOTORCYCLE  
           SUITS over their black Secret Service jumpsuits.

                                 CHRIS
                        Eliot will wait until Ross is 
                        speaking. They'll want him furthest 
                        from the airport when they attack.

           The SOUND OF THRUMMING ROTOR BLADES bridges the CUT TO--

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE GENEVA - CONTINUOUS

           -- A BLACKED-OUT SECRET SERVICE HELICOPTER, flying a hundred 
           meters above THE 40 VEHICLE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE. SECRET 
           SERVICE SNIPERS hang from both of the helicopter’s struts--
                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           EXT. FRONT OF APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           A CITROEN pulls out first. Erika's driving, Hardy (in his 
           transportation uniform) is in the passenger seat.

           Will and Chris, wearing helmets, riding a pair of BMW TOURING 
           BIKES, pull out behind them. We can assume they've stowed 
           their weapons and gear in the MOTORCYCLE LOCK BOXES.

           EXT. MANSION - GENEVA DAY

           A SECOND BLACKED-OUT HELICOPTER lifts off the grassy lawn. 
           Identical to the one flying cover for the President down to 
           the uniforms the TWO SNIPERS on the struts are wearing.

           In the driveway, FOUR BLACK U.S. GOVERNMENT SUBURBANS idle. 

           NOTE: though they are indistinguishable from the Presidential 
           Motorcade Suburbans, for clarity’s sake, we’ll always refer 
           to these vehicles as HALCYON SUBURBANS #1, 2, 3, and 4. 

           TWENTY HALCYON OPERATIVES hustle into the Halcyon Suburbans. 
           Dressed as Secret Service Counter Assault Teams (CAT). Same 
           black jumpsuits Chris and Will put on. They too will be 
           indistinguishable from the Secret Service CAT Teams. 

           As each TEAM OF FIVE fill a suburban, we recognize many of 
           them from the photos. All wear RED TINTED GLASSES and 
           HELMETS. Soon as they’re all in, they head out-- flashing 
           OFFICIAL lights as they zoom down the hill.

           EXT. GENEVA TRANSPORTATION HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Erika drops Hardy in front of the building. The SIGN matches 
           the PATCH on his uniform: 'Transport Public Genevois'. 

           As he walks towards the entry, he looks back at Erika, but 
           keeps walking. Runs right into a MAN in the same uniform--

                                 HARDY
                        Pardon moi.

           -- as Hardy steps through the doors, we see a freshly stolen 
           ID CARD in his hand.

           INT. GENEVA TRANSPORTATION HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The security is nowhere near the level of NSA, but there's 
           still a GATE. Hardy swipes his ID CARD. He’s in. As he walks 
           into an elevator, we CUT TO--
                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           INT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL CENTER - DAY

           -- Hardy following a CONTROLLER into--

           A DARKENED NERVE-CENTER

           It's chaos in here. Looks similar to CIA Operations Command, 
           except these TECHS aren't used to the madness of re-routing 
           an entire city for the President of the United States.

           MANAGERS yell orders. WALL SIZE SCREENS show traffic flow, 
           locations of trains and buses.

           A GRID OF SMALLER SCREENS flash through TRAFFIC CAMERAS, some 
           of which show the PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE approaching the 
           massive UNITED NATIONS OFFICES OF GENEVA.

           It's a perfect situation for Hardy to get lost in the 
           shuffle. He strides right over to a FEMALE CONTROLLER. Sits.

           She's so busy, she doesn't look up until she feels the 
           HANDGUN pressed against her side. He speaks in German--

                                 HARDY
                        (Do everything I say, and I'll be 
                        gone in five minutes. Make a fuss, 
                        I blow out your intestines. You'll 
                        die slow and the smell is awful.)

           Hardy plugs his PDA into a port-- waits, then clicks her 
           mouse, bringing up the files Erika downloaded from Mossad:

           Photos of ALL THE OPERATIVES that trained in Israel.

                                 HARDY
                        (Cross reference these photos with 
                        your camera's imaging systems.)

           FEMALE CONTROLLER, with a couple mouse clicks, has the 
           computers ripping through images-- sorting-- matching.

           EXT. STREETS OF GENEVA - DAY

           Erika is parked on the street. Her EARPIECE crackles--

                                 HARDY(O.S. FILTERED)
                        First hit-- Rue de Lyon.

           -- off she goes, heading into traffic.

           INT. THE MANSION - DAY

           ELIOT'S CONTROLLER, got a hit--
                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)

                        Sir, the computer just locked a 
                        facial match from your watch-list.

           BRINGS UP SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE: Hardy, swiping the 
           stolen ID through the turnstile.

                                 WALKER
                        How'd he get out of Poland unseen?

                                 ELIOT
                        He's Hardy. Hold the fort--

                                 WALKER
                        You certain we should go through--

                (sharply)
                        It’s thirty versus four. Three 
                        after I deal with Hardy. 

           Eliot hustles out--

           INT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL CENTER - DAY

           -- Hardy has an IMAGE OF A LATINO HALCYON OPERATIVE locked on 
           one screen, and the real-time CAMERA IMAGE of the same man, 
           waiting to cross the street. The light turns green.

           EXT. GENEVA STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A CROWD walks towards LATINO HALCYON OPERATIVE-- one of whom 
           is looking away. He sees Erika too late-- she rips both palms 
           straight forward, into his ribcage. The SOUND is repulsively 
           familiar. She acts like she's helping him keep his feet, but 
           she's really snatching his EARMIC and TALK BOX. By the time 
           he drops to his knee, unable to breath, she's already--

           AROUND THE CORNER--

           Plugging the TALK BOX into her PDA, downloading the 
           encryption to--

           INT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL CENTER - DAY

           -- Hardy's traffic computer. He clicks a couple buttons. Now 
           that he's got ELIOT’S ENCRYPTION; he’s able to tap into their 
           com systems. Hardy's earpiece crackles, and he can hear--

           ALL OF ELIOT’S COMMUNICATIONS-- 

                                 HARDY
                        Triangulate that signal.

                                 HARDY(O.S. FILTERED)
                        Here we go. Three hotspots.

           They look at their PDA's-- A MAP OF GENEVA pops up with RED 
           BLINKING DOTS. The hotspots are clusters of signals:

           -ONE is up in the hills. We can read the COORDINATES.
           -TWO is a cluster of FIVE SIGNALS, near the airport.
           -THREE is a cluster of TWENTY, moving rapidly.

                        One will be Eliot’s control center. 
                        Two will be the building with the 
                        jammer. Three is his strike team.

           INT. TRANSPORTATION CONTROL CENTER - DAY

           Hardy closes his computer windows, speaks into his mic-- 

                                 HARDY
                        Go to work, I'm out.

           INT. THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Hardy's only taken three steps out the door when--

                                 POLICE VOICES
                (Swiss-French, and German)
                        (EVERYONE GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR!)

           POLICE, GUARDS, and SUITED AGENTS have surrounded him. He 
           turns. The DOOR to the control center seals behind him. 
           TWENTY EMPLOYEES lie down on the floor, shaking.

                                 HARDY
                (sotto, into mic)
                        Coms are compromised. Kill ‘em.

           Hardy stays on his feet. Sees ATLAS, who talks into his mic--

                                 ATLAS
                        We've got Hardy, sir.

           in each shoulder. Arms are now useless-- Hardy tries to run-- 
           another shot from Atlas blows Hardy's kneecap apart. 

                                 ELIOT(O.S. FILTERED)
                        Drug him.

           Atlas whips a SYRINGE OUT-- injects it into Hardy's neck. 

                                 HARDY
                        Sodium Amatol-- feels good. Feels 
                        even better to have fucked-- you. 

           -- Eliot has arrived, hovering over drugged Hardy. 

                                 ELIOT
                        Hello, Hardy. Nice outfit-- are the 
                        boys in uniform as well?

           As Atlas rolls him over, Hardy digs deep. Even in his 
           condition, he manages to strike Atlas. Who shrugs it off--

           ON HARDY'S HAND

           When he hit Atlas, he grabbed the SYRINGE with his other 
           hand. His fingers draw back the plunger, fills it with AIR as 
           he drags his arm towards his head; has to do it smooth and 
           slow or Atlas will see the syringe--

                                 HARDY
                        Not yet. 

                                 ELIOT
                        What’s the plan, Hardy?

           Hardy keeps it palmed, can't get Atlas, or Eliot. When his 
           hand gets up beside his neck, he squeezes his fist-- Atlas 
           snatches Hardy's hand-- the syringe hangs out. Plunger down. 
           Hardy's eyes roll back as the AIR EMBOLISM hits his heart. He 
           dies a few seconds later. Smiling at Eliot.

TRANSPORTATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

           Every piece of technology in the entire room CRASHES!

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS(PRE-LAP)
                        No longer will we heel to despots 
                        for their oil--

           INT. UNITED NATIONS ASSEMBLY CHAMBER - DAY

           Looking over President Ross' shoulder as his teleprompter 
           CUTS OUT. MIC isn't working either. He's speaking to himself.

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        No longer will we prop up regimes 
                        that run counter to everything we 
                        stand for--

           EXT. STREETS OF GENEVA - CONTINUOUS

           Chris and Will stop at a red light. Turns GREEN-- PEOPLE step 
           into the street-- as a TRUCK PLOUGHS RIGHT THROUGH THEM!

           INT. UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

           The President's SECURITY DETAIL, yanks Ross off the stage.

           INT. ERIKA'S CITROEN - CONTINUOUS

           All STOPLIGHTS are GREEN. A BUS in front of her rolls right 
           over TWO SMART CARS as if they’re traffic cones. Erika, 
           driving like Mario Andretti, avoids the accidents. 

           She doesn't see the CAR CAREEN into her rear. The Citroen 
           spins violently, whip-lashing ERIKA'S HEAD against the 
           driver's side window so hard the glass shatters!

           EXT. WIDE ON THE UNITED NATIONS BUILDING - DAY

           THE PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE ROARS OUT--

           At the first intersection, filled with DEMOLISHED CARS, the 
           Motorcade splits into TWO GROUPS--

           GROUP ONE heads off to the left--

           GROUP TWO to the right; it's called the 'Secure Package'. 
           FOUR SUBURBANS in front, FOUR SUBURBANS trailing. Sandwiched 
           between them is CADILLAC ONE, affectionately nicknamed 'The 
           Beast' by the President's Security Detail.

           The Secure Package Motorcade drives over grass and sidewalks. 
           Doing anything and everything to keep moving.

           struts, sweeps in overhead, flying cover for the motorcade.

           PAN AROUND-- A HALF MILE BEHIND THEM--

           -- the SECOND HELICOPTER sweeps in. IDENTICAL, down to the 
           snipers on the struts (Second Helicopter is the one we saw at 
           Eliot’s Mansion).

           EXT. CITROEN CRASH SITE - GENEVA - DAY

           Through her shattered driver side window, we see Erika. 
           Coming to. Blinking away the blood running down her face.

           PULL BACK-- RISING SIXTY FEET UP-- until we can see--

           A ROOFTOP-- where Five Halcyon Operatives guard the BARRAGE 
           JAMMING SYSTEM. As an indicator light flicks green, we CUT TO-

           - Secret Service Helicopter Pilots #1 and #2--
           - and the Presidential Counter Assault Teams--

           All hear a SQUELCH-- as their radios go dead.

                                 EVERYONE

                        Over-- say again-- negative--

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE 'SECURE PACKAGE' MOTORCADE - DAY

           -- Eliot’s Snipers (on Second Helicopter) open fire on 
           Helicopter #1. They kill both Secret Service Snipers with two 
           head shots. Then open fire on Helicopter #1’s FUSELAGE--

           EXT. STREETS OF GENEVA - CONTINUOUS

           -- Will and Chris are hauling-ass through the chaos. They 
           spot smoking Helicopter #1 falling out of the sky, about a 
           1/2 mile off. They gun their bikes towards-- the EXPLOSION!

           EXT. TOP-DOWN - HIGH OVER GENEVA - DAY

           The Nine Car ‘Secure Package’ Motorcade races down a street. 

           ONE BLOCK OVER-- HALCYON SUBURBANS #1 and #2 bob and weave 
           down a parallel street, keeping pace.   

           TWO BLOCKS BEHIND-- HALCYON SUBURBANS #3 and #4 are trailing 
           the Presidential Motorcade.

WIDE ON A THOROUGHFARE - DAY

           Secure Package Motorcade turns down an on ramp-- entering a 
           SUNKEN SIX LANE FREEWAY-- traffic is crawling. They steer 
           their vehicles onto the shoulder, need to keep moving.

           INT. CADILLAC ONE (AKA THE BEAST) - DAY

           PRESIDENT ROSS, in the back, wears body armor over his suit. 
           Head of Detail, right beside him, scans for threats along the  
           sunken six lane freeway--

                                 DETAIL #2
                        No police radio, no cell phones. 
                        Nothing. We still got nothing.

           EXT. HIGH OVER THE THOROUGHFARE - DAY

           SECOND HELICOPTER BANKS OVERHEAD, snipers on the struts.

           HALCYON SUBURBANS #1 and #2 skid to a stop on a BRIDGE ahead 
           of the motorcade. TEN HALCYON OPERATIVES pile out. 

           Two fire STINGER MISSILES--

           -- Secret Service Suburbans are armored, but they can't stand 
           up to anti-tank weapons. The TWO LEAD SECRET SERVICE 
           SUBURBANS blow sky high! Incinerating the teams inside!

           The Secure Package Motorcade, unable to move forward-- 
           reverses, bashing cars out of the way--

           EXT. OVERPASS BEHIND THE MOTORCADE - CONTINUOUS

           HALCYON SUBURBANS #3 and #4 unload TEN MORE HALCYON 
           OPERATIVES. They fire TWO MORE STINGERS-- at the Suburbans, 
           reversing towards them. TWO MORE DIRECT HITS!

           SCREAMING CIVILIANS are bailing out of CARS. The Motorcade is 
           now completely pinned in by evacuated cars, people, the 
           divider, smoldering wreckage, and the embankments. 

           INT. THE BEAST - DAY

           HEAD OF DETAIL yells to the Driver--

                                 HEAD OF DETAIL
                        Do not stop. Stay moving.

           Driver guns them forward as another STINGER-- streaks in!

           The Beast’s automated defense systems kick into action-- 
           SCREENS on the DASH read ‘Infrared Countermeasures engaging’

           The Beast’s Oxygen systems HISS ON-- the SCREEN blinks 
           ‘sealing cabin’.

           EXT. WIDE ON THOROUGHFARE - DAY

           A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE is fired at The Beast.

           INT. THE BEAST - CONTINUOUS

           The same countermeasures kick on-- 

                                 HEAD OF DETAIL
                        That one’s an RPG-- INCOMING!

           This time, the countermeasures don’t work-- 

           EXT. WIDE ON THE BEAST - CONTINUOUS

           -- BOOM! THE AXLE’S BLOWN OFF! The Beast skids to a sparkling 
           stop. Soon as ‘The Beast’ is no longer mobile-- All Twenty 
           Halcyon Operatives rush to take positions-- TEN stay on the 
           high ground, covering. The other TEN run down the embankment.

           EXT. WRECKED CITROEN SITE - DAY

           Erika works to remove A HEAVY BAG out of the back of her car, 
           and what looks like a POSTER CARRIER. 

           The accident's taken a toll, but she's got a mission to 
           complete. Gets the bag out. Lugs it across the street.

           EXT. ABOVE THE THOROUGHFARE - DAY

           Will and Chris skid to a stop. Peek over the lip, it drops 
           down to the thoroughfare, where they get their first look at--

           A WARZONE

           TWENTY REMAINING SECRET SERVICEMEN are firing, establishing a 
           defensive perimeter around The Beast-- but they’re getting 
           decimated. BULLETS ARE PINGING AND SPARKING EVERYWHERE! 

           Within seconds, they’re down to FIFTEEN MEN.

           CHRIS AND WILL

           Strip off their motorcycle leathers, revealing their Secret 
           Service CAT Jumpsuits underneath. They watch Second 
           Helicopter a moment-- SNIPERS on the struts are picking off 
           Secret Servicemen around the beast-- KILLING with each shot.
                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)

                        Snipers seem to know who to hit.

           With everyone dressed as Secret Service CAT Member, it's 
           impossible to keep track of who--

                                 CHRIS
                (nods, both know how)
                        Vintage Eliot; that’s our way out. 

           EXT. SECOND HELICOPTER - LOOKING DOWN - CONTINUOUS

           As a Sniper on the struts, targets another Secret Serviceman, 
           we see his eyes through the RED LENSES, then CUT TO--

           SNIPERS POV: all Halcyon Operatives are wearing INFRARED 
           STROBES in their breast pockets to mark them as 'friendlies'.

           EXT. TOP OF THOROUGHFARE - CONTINUOUS

           Chris and Will wait for SECOND HELICOPTER to thunder past--

           CHRIS-- lays on top of a car, ready to drill anything that 
           moves. Covering for Will, who sprints down the embankment.

           A Halcyon Operative turns, about to shoot Will, when Chris’ 
           bullet drills him through the neck. Will dives on him-- 
           snatches the Red glasses. Soon as he puts them on we CUT TO--

           WILL’S POV-- immediately able to see the INFRARED STROBES. 
           Now it’s easy to separate the good guys from bad guys. 

           ON WILL-- pockets the STROBE, about the size of a pen, then 
           scans for ANOTHER STROBE. Sees one blinking under a car-- ten 
           feet away. He lays down and FIRES at--

           A HALCYON OPERATIVE’S FOOT! Dropping him. Will is waiting. 
           Fires twice-- into the Operatives mouth. Will’s already 
           rolling under the car-- towards the corpse, strips the RED 
           GLASSES and STROBE. Then duck-runs back to--

           CHRIS-- who pockets the strobe. Dons the glasses. Leapfrogs 
           past Will, and runs towards The Beast.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE OPERATIONS COMMAND - D.C. - CONTINUOUS

           The set-up is similar to CIA's Operations Command. The logo 
           on the wall is different; the egos are the same. And this is 
           bad as it's ever been in here, watching LIVE SATELLITE FEEDS: 

           GOD’S POV-- looking down on the EIGHT REMAINING SECRET 
           SERVICEMEN fighting to save the President.

           (Chris and Will). Miraculously, they don't get shot by any of 
           the attackers. Instead, they coldly gun down TWO HALCYON 
           Operatives, as we SMASHCUT TO--

           EXT. THE BEAST - SAME MOMENT

           -- TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN watching Chris and Will do it, then 
           pause behind a car, drop their strobes near a CORPSE, and 
           duck-run over, diving beside the stunned SERVICEMEN--

                                 WILL
                        We have a way out for the 
                        President!

                                 SERVICEMAN #1
                        Who the fuck are you?!!

                                 WILL
                        CIA GS-12's with medals you've 
                        never even heard of, so shut up and 
                        listen!

                                 SERVICEMAN #2
                        Give me your authentication codes!

           Chris stands up-- drills a bullet through a Halcyon 
           Operatives head-- takes a bullet in the chest. Drops back. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Good enough?

                                 WILL
                        You got, maybe, thirty seconds ‘til 
                        you're overrun. Either Ross dies 
                        then, or you let us into the 
                        vehicle now!

           INT. THE BEAST - DAY

           Stunned Serviceman #2 throws a hand sign. Head of Detail 
           opens the window. Chris dives in, immediately, he's got his 
           gun pointed at Ross' head-- Head of Detail has his gun on 
           Chris-- Will, through the window, aims at Head of Detail.

                                 CHRIS
                        See my face? See his face? You’ve 
                        been warned about us?

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        Yes.

                        If Eliot was telling the truth, 
                        you'd be dead right now. We got one 
                        shot at getting out of this. Wanna 
                        try or you wanna die?

           INT. SECRET SERVICE OPERATIONS COMMAND - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is desperate for any good news--

                                 SATELLITE TECHNICIAN
                        SIR! Who's that?

           ONSCREEN: a WOMAN assembles a RIFLE on a rooftop near the 
           location of the BARRAGE JAMMER. As they ZOOM IN, we CUT TO--

           EXT. TOP OF A BUILDING - DAY

           -- Erika, blood running down her face, aiming the TAC-50 
           SNIPER RIFLE. Six feet long. She marks her target carefully. 
           As she FIRES, we CUT BACK TO--

           INT. SECRET SERVICE OPERATIONS COMMAND - DAY

           -- the IMAGE OF ERIKA FIRING. Nearby-- the Barrage Jammer 
           disintegrates! The OVERLAY suddenly shows the jammer die.

           Immediately, RADIO CHATTER FILLS THE AIR!

                                 TECHNICIAN #2
                        Line of sight radios are up! Phones 
                        and routers are still down.

           They watch Erika-- yank SOMETHING out of the POSTER CARRIER-- 
           She holds over her head. Techs ZOOM IN to read the SIGN:

           ‘Origin of netbot attack/location of CIA Tier 1 Target Yuri 
           Povlovsky: 46° 12' 0 N, 6° 9' 0 E.’

                        Shift the satellite, and vector a 
                        strike team to that location--

                                 TECHNICIAN #4
                        -- sir! They're moving POTUS!

           ALL EYES SPIN TO THE OTHER TOP DOWN IMAGE:

           watching the remaining SIX SECRET SERVICEMEN surround the 
           Beast, covering THE PRESIDENT. They form a protective bubble, 
           then run him towards the REMAINING SUBURBAN.

           President into the suburban. Slam the doors. The vehicle guns 
           straight up the embankment. Looks like they might make it. 
           Until a STINGER streaks in and BOOOMMM!!!!

           The Suburban, with the President inside, blows sky high! 
           Suddenly, you could hear a pin drop.

           EXT. SECOND HELICOPTER - DAY

           The Sniper looks down on the carnage as we CUT TO--

           SNIPER POV: the only soldiers moving are all wearing STROBES, 
           running into the Halcyon Suburbans. He looks around-- POLICE, 
           now able to communicate, are hauling towards the battle zone.

           INT. GOVERNMENT SUV - MOBILE COMMAND HUB - DAY

           Eliot on a laptop, REWINDS SATELLITE FOOTAGE, WATCHING AGAIN:

           The moment the Suburban bearing the President BLOWS-- he sees 
           THREE MEN DIVE FROM WITHIN THE BEAST-- they snatch the 
           infrared beacons (the ones Chris and Will placed under the 
           nearby car) and slip them into their pockets.

                                 ELIOT
                (into mic)
                        The President is alive. 

           Fast forwards the footage-- to the direction they drove off.

                                 ELIOT
                        They’re trying to get him to the 
                        Abelard Sanctuary. Walker, pack it 
                        up and have all units collapse on 
                        the four entries--

           INT. GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN - DAY

           -- Will driving, Chris is holding his rifle, eyes panning for 
           threats. And in the backseat--

           PRESIDENT ROSS

           -- is dressed like a Counter Assault Team Member, holding an 
           M-5 Rifle. All three are wearing the infrared strobe in their 
           pockets and the Red Sunglasses.

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        How can you be sure it’s Eliot?
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 CHRIS
                        Cross reference the identities of 
                        the corpses back there with a CIA 
                        program codenamed Halcyon.

                                 WILL
                        No matter what they tell you, it 
                        exists. We're part of it.

           IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD OF THEM

           Second Helicopter drops in below building level-- the snipers 
           start FIRING-- their bullets spiderweb the window.

           Will leans down below the dash, floors it-- the Helicopter 
           has to rise, but before Chris and Will are clear--

           A HALCYON SUBURBAN-- rockets out and T-BONES THEM!

           Chris-- ears ringing, blinks his wits back as Will grabs 
           President Ross-- dives out with him--

                                 WILL
                        CHRIS! COVER ME!

           -- Chris doesn’t have to think-- already laying down cover 
           fire from the open door-- as Will shuttle runs Ross into-- 

           EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Filled with DUMPSTERS and ALCOVES-- Chris stays in front of 
           Ross, Will behind--

                                 CHRIS
                        Closest entry is two more blocks! 

           EXT. THE ABELARD SANCTUARY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           An empty MAIL CENTER. Post Office Boxes line the walls. PAN 
           OVER TO SEE-- Chris, Will and Ross running TOWARDS CAMERA. 

           Behind them, more Halcyon Operatives arrive, EIGHT TOTAL OPEN 
           FIRE! Chris and Will take SHOTS TO THE BACK and HEAD but the 
           body armor and helmets do the job. 

           ON CHRIS-- peeling off, buries himself in an ALCOVE--

                                 CHRIS
                        Keep going!!

           -- he reloads fast as a magician, starts firing back the way 
           he came. Will and Ross keep running, only a block from the 
           Mail Drop/Store Front now. Chris’ cover fire is precise--  
                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           -- DROPPING TWO HALCYON OPERATIVES. With all their enemies 
           behind them-- they’ve got a shot at getting Ross into the 
           Sanctuary-- 

           UNTIL TWO MORE HALCYON SUBURBANS SKID around the corner-- 

           -- and stop right in front of the Mail Drop/Abelard Entry. 
           SIX MORE OPERATIVES jump out and open fire-- along with-- 

           ELIOT. He looks at--

           WILL-- who throws Ross behind a DUMPSTER. CHRIS catches up, 
           but gets shot in the arm as he and dives beside Ross. All 
           taking cover between two dumpsters. A half a block from the 
           Sanctuary, but on the wrong side of the alley. Surrounded. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Count to five-- 

           Before Will can protest, Chris sandwiches himself into the 
           space behind the dumpster and the building wall-- gun out in 
           front of him, sliding towards Eliot’s position.

                                 WILL
                (to Ross, fast)
                        You’ll see stairs inside. Go down. 
                        Find the camera. Say ‘Abelard’.

           TEN FEET AHEAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE DUMPSTER

           Chris slips out. Got the drop on Two Halcyon Operatives, 
           blasts them with headshots! Closing the gap so no one can 
           fire without hitting friendlies. Now it’s hand-to-hand-- and 
           Chris, the best in the world, demolishes ONE-- TWO-- THREE 
           HALCYON OPERATIVES. 

           A superhuman monster, taking out a lifetime of rage, his 
           hands blur, too fast for film. FIVE HALCYON OPERATIVES lay 
           into him as a unit. No one is that good. Chris takes blow 
           after blow. Trying to keep them from hitting him with a Sde-
           Or killing strike. Clearly Sacrificing himself for--

           WILL AND ROSS

           Running out-- Will is firing forwards-- Ross is hosing 
           bullets behind them. Halfway across the alley-- Will gets 
           shot in the thigh-- blood spurts-- he stumbles, but they make 
           it into the alcove-- Will kicks the door in, sees a STAIRWELL 
           leading down. Throws Ross towards it-

           BUTES palms to flash into Chris ribs! The sickening sound. We 
           know what it means. Still, Chris fights on. Won’t quit--  

           Will becomes a God-- someone shoots him, he doesn’t even feel 
           it. Nothing can stop him from getting to Chris-- who falls to 
           his knees, spitting bubbles of red froth. Can’t breathe. 

           BUTES AND TALL HALCYON OPERATIVE

           Move on Will, who’s bleeding profusely, but it doesn't 
           matter. Blocking punches, Will takes a glancing blow on 
           purpose, to get inside and snatch Tall Operative’s throat. 
           Collapses it, then it's just Butes--

           -- who kicks Will's knee. Will’s tendons shred; knee turns to 
           rubber, but Will is already ripping his palms out into Butes 
           kidney. Gaining the advantage, Will, all he’s got left, wraps 
           Butes by the neck. Like cracking a whip-- snaps Butes’ neck.

           Chris, with indomitable willpower; red froth burbling from 
           his mouth-- crawls forward-- crawling towards--

           ELIOT, who strides into the Mail Drop/Abelard Entry. 

           THE LAST TWO HALCYON OPERATIVES stay way back from Will and 
           Chris. Making sure they can’t get to Eliot. Chris and Will 
           are out of moves. Will, unable to stand, lays his body over 
           Chris-- trying to shield him-- 

           -- as the Last Two Ha_lcyon Operatives aim their guns to 
           finish Chris and Will-- both Halcyon Operatives are suddenly 
           thrown back ten feet by the POWER of TAC-50 BULLETS! 

           EXT. A CAR NEARBY - DAY

           Erika, TAC-50 laid on the hood, drops the gun, and runs 
           towards Chris and Will.

           ON CHRIS

           Red froth bubbles down his face, commingling with the blood 
           draining from Will. Chris claws at a TALK BOX from a dead 
           operative. Will, eyes fluttering, about to pass out from loss 
           of blood, fights to maintain consciousness. He manages to 
           grab the Talk Box-- puts it in Chris’ ear--

                                 CHRIS
                        Eliot-- did you-- ever even meet 
                        our dads?
                                                               (cid:13)

BOTTOM OF STAIRS - GENEVA ABELARD SANCTUARY - DAY

           Eliot strides towards a CAMERA-- 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’m sorry, Christopher, I didn’t. 

           EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

           Erika runs up. Quick examination of Chris and Will, she tears 
           her sleeve off, makes a tourniquet for Will’s leg.  

                                 WILL
                (passing out)
                        Eliot’s-- in there--

                                 ERIKA
                        What’s your access code? I’m 
                        Mossad, Will. I don’t have one.

           Will weakly shakes his head-- 

                                 WILL
                        Won’t work--

           Chris can’t talk anymore. Fading fast. SIRENS are getting 
           close. Erika kneels beside him.

                                 ERIKA
                        Christopher. Swiss Police got to 
                        Yuri Povlovsky in time. His family 
                        was with him. They’re all safe. 

           Will grabs Chris’ hand-- tries to smile through his tears. 

                                 WILL
                        -- after all that-- you saved them-- 
                        with a sharpie.

           And for the very first time in a very hard life, a look of 
           peace takes hold on Christopher Kilmoonie’s face. He dies 
           right there in his brother’s arms. Erika drag-carries Will 
           towards one of the MERCEDES. She gets him inside. 

           As she drives them away, we CUT TO--

           INT. THE ABELARD SANCTUARY - GENEVA - DAY

           -- very different from the Harbin Abelard Sanctuary. TWO PRIM 
           SWISS MEN stand in a white, tech-heavy room-- with the 
           President of the United States. Eliot enters. Ross reacts--
                                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        Arrest him.

                                 SWISS MAN #1
                        Apologies Mr. President; we cannot. 
                        But you will not be harmed here.

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        Where are we?

                                 ELIOT
                (goading him)
                        That's classified.

           Ross tries to punch Eliot. Doesn't even get close. Eliot 
           snatches Ross' arm in a finger lock, smashes his head against 
           a table. Eliot’s still got his covert operative skills. 

           He releases Ross before the Two Swiss Men have to intervene.

                                 ELIOT
                        You ready to be civilized, Harry?

           A pause. Ross' polish is gone. He's raw. 

                                 PRESIDENT ROSS
                        You gonna spin me? Tell me this is 
                        about stability you sonofabitch? 

           On the side of his face, where Eliot smashed his head on the 
           table, Ross has a BAND-AID on. Odd. He didn’t have it before.

                                 ELIOT
                        Harry-- what are the two things 
                        Americans need to motivate them out 
                        of their cushy existence?

           Ross just stares back, not going to play the game.

                                 ELIOT
                        Enemies. And heroes. I attempted to 
                        give them both with one fell swoop.

           For Eliot, everything is an equation for the greater good, 
           and this is far more of a briefing than a justification.

                                 ELIOT
                        The Mercury Initiative is a pipe 
                        dream. It has zero chance of 
                        affecting any significant change-- 

           Eliot drops the bomb--
                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 ELIOT
                        -- unless you die for it. And 
                        America believes Russia, and big 
                        oil, are responsible. 

           There's our answer. Ross starts sweating.

                                 ELIOT
                        JFK was an atrocious President, but 
                        after his assassination, everyone 
                        whitewashed his image and waltzed 
                        his agenda through Congress. It was 
                        only after Martin Luther King was 
                        killed that Civil Rights became an 
                        American cause. Give us an enemy to 
                        vanquish, and a martyr who dies for 
                        something we believe in, then watch 
                        America get to work.

           Ross suddenly sits. Feels his face-- the BAND-AID. Tears it 
           off-- looks at it. A TINY CAPSULE has been smashed, leaving 
           an INKY GREEN RESIDUE on the inside pad.

                                 ELIOT
                        Ten years from now, we’ll no longer 
                        fear the demise of our empire. All 
                        for one life. 

                                 ROSS
                        What’d you do to me?

           The Two Swiss Men realize what happened-- too late. As they 
           rip their guns up, Eliot punches his palm into Swiss Man #1’s 
           nose while kneecapping Swiss Man #2. As Swiss Man #2 falls, 
           Eliot drives his knee up into his face, then grabs Swiss Man 
           #1 by the head and smashes it into the wall. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I'm a patriot, Harry. Killing you 
                        was the easiest decision I've ever 
                        made.

           Ross can’t breathe; choking. Dying. Eliot walks out--

           INT. DIRECTOR ANDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

           Director Anderson’s sitting at his desk. Mason enters.

                                 MASON
                        William Roosevelt contacted me two 
                        days ago. He filled in the gaps.

           Hands the Director a SEALED FILE--

                                 MASON
                        There were never any other teams. 
                        Every lead we were following was 
                        internally generated by Eliot. 

                                 DIRECTOR ANDERSON
                        Any clues to his whereabouts?

                        Word is Mr. Roosevelt is working in

                        Signatories to track him down. 

           The two of them look at each other. Then the FILE.

                        Is there any other proof Russia had

A TROPICAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Exotic vegetation. Boats and buildings are Asian with 
           Buddhist influences. FIVE BLACK SHAPES run below a PIER.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An ocean breeze flits the shears. In the darkness, ELIOT 
           opens his eyes. SOMEONE is in the room with him.

                                 ELIOT
                        I knew they'd find me eventually--

           REVEAL WILL-- on top of Eliot instantly. Eliot tries to 
           fight, but his resistance simply thicken his veins. An easy 
           target for the syringe. After a few seconds, Eliot relaxes.

                                 ELIOT
                        Feels like-- Tetrodotoxin? 

           Will is robotic. Whatever pleasure he thought he’d get isn’t 
           there. Paralyzed; Eliot can barely move his lips.

                                 ELIOT
                        I’m glad it’s you who came.

           Eliot searches Will’s face for a trace of emotion. A 
           connection of any kind with the man he raised. He finds none.

                                 WILL
                        Theodore Eliot. You have been 
                        adjudicated as an Abelard Violator. 
                        You have no viable defense. 

                                 ELIOT
                        I’m so sorry, William. But the 
                        needs of my country have always 
                        outweighed my love for you.

           Will pulls Eliot’s shirt open--

                                 WILL
                        The only thing Chris ever cared 
                        about was your approval. He was 
                        just a kid. And you destroyed him. 

           -- revealing the JAGGED SCAR over Eliot’s heart.

                                 WILL
                        Do you remember what you told him 
                        about this? Or did you lie about 
                        that, too?
                                                (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 ELIOT
                        It wasn't a lie. 

           Will pulls out a pair of headphones. Places them on Eliot's 
           head. Then pulls out an IPOD. THE ICON SHOWS:

           'The Rolling Stones' -- 'Paint it, Black'.

           He doesn't show Eliot the screen. He doesn't need to.

                                 WILL
                        My brother believed that there are 
                        limits to the things that can be 
                        forgiven--

                                 ELIOT
                        -- not if your intention is to save 
                        more lives than are sacrificed.

           Will draws his KNIFE.

                                 WILL
                        I don't know the answer. But you're 
                        about to find out.

           As his finger moves to hit PLAY, he looks down at Eliot, who 
           looks back. For the first time, we see fear on Eliot's face.

                                 ELIOT
                        William. Please don't play it.

           Only in this moment, does Will’s facade drop. He cracks. 
           Emotional. As he decides Eliot's fate, we FADE OUT.

                                 - THE END -
