           present day and 15 years earlier - a line marking each 
           transition.

           Irishman, you find a first-rate gentleman; but these are worse 
           than savages; they are too mean to swab Hell’s kitchen.”                    

                                 -- Davy Crockett in New York City, 1835

           The quote fades as the flare of a falling FLASHLIGHT breaks 
           the darkness --

           It clatters hard to the ground, revealing a 

           CONCRETE TUNNEL

           And a STRUGGLE -- two uniformed legs KICK WILDLY at the edge 
           of its beam, the only light here.  GURGLING sound of choking.

           One foot hits the flashlight, spinning it, the beam coming to 
           rest on the full figure of the 

           UNIFORMED MAN

           who flails on the ground, hands clutching at a SHOELACE 
           wrapped tight around his neck.  

           Little can be seen of the MAN kneeling behind him:  Two arms 
           of ropy muscle pulling the chord tight.  And above that, in 
           the darkness -- only the glint of glacial eyes, the shine of 
           his face, slack and passionless.  He is all brutal efficiency, 
           this is simply a thing that needs to be done.

           The Uniformed Man’s eyes search the darkness before him for 
           some salvation.  Those ropy arms pull harder.  His gurgle and 
           squeal reach a desperate peak.  

           Then fade.  His legs twitch, then also go still.

           The man releases the body to the floor, which sends the 
           flashlight spinning again --

                                             MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT 

           -- FLASH of a spotlight moving over the foggy water from a 
           POLICE BOAT.

           It putters along - and suddenly the black hulk of a stone-and-
           steel GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE SUPPORT COLUMN moves into 
           frame.

           As the boat passes behind it, reveal there: the dark figure of 
           the Man treading water at the shadowy base, waiting for it to 
           pass.  Breath fogging - it’s cold - but he shows no hint of 
           pain.
                                                                      (cid:13)             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                 (cid:13)           EXT. ROW HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT

           He snags clothes off a line, into the shadows.  

           He pulls off his wet t-shirt, revealing a body carved with 
           muscle and decked with PRISON TATTOOS and JAGGED SCARS.

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           The Man, now in jeans and a sweatshirt, moves through the 
           seedy, run-down neighborhood, hood pulled low.

           He stops, looking up at a decrepit, boarded-up pile of bricks -  
           HOTEL MONDRAGON.

           ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Man BREAKS a side window with his elbow.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           He strides down the ghostly, empty hall.

           He hears low NOISES, peers into an open room.  Inside: two 
           JUNKIES fucking on the floor.  The girl looks at him glassy-
           eyed.  

           He continues to ROOM 177.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The Man stands before his reflection in the filthy, streaked 
           glass:  

           The first good look we’ve gotten of him -- maybe 40 years old, 
           greasy, shaggy hair, thick goatee, a jagged scar across his 
           cheek.  A fire in his dark eyes.  

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Who are you?

           CRASH - he drops the mirror unceremoniously to the floor, 
           leaving a square patch of clean wall almost like a window 
           amongst the decades of dust. 

           He lightly taps several spots with his knuckle, PUNCHES the 
           last, his fist going through a thin layer of plaster of Paris.

           He pulls his hand out holding an old edition of The Inferno.

           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                   (cid:13)           He sits on the bed, opens the book to reveal a hollowed cavity 
           with a BLACK BAG inside. 

           INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

           The scumbag OWNER examines a DIAMOND with a loupe.  

                                 OWNER
                        Family heirloom, huh?

           He looks up across the counter at the Man, who looks like 
           little more than some skid-row drifter.

                                 THE MAN
                        That’s right.
                     (points)
                        Throw that in.

           The owner follows his gaze to a gleaming HUNTING KNIFE under 
           the glass.

           An uneasy moment, then the owner looks back at the

           SPARKLING DIAMOND

                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DIAMOND WHOLESALER, BACKROOM - NIGHT

           A different diamond seen through a different loupe -- now in 
           the hands of an upscale but shady DIAMOND DEALER.  

           He looks down at the TWO DOZEN OTHER STONES in velvet on the 
           counter, then up at-- 

           The Man -- now clean and razor-sharp in an immaculate black 
           suit and overcoat.

                                 DIAMOND DEALER
                        Deal.

           EXT. CORNER - NIGHT

           A newspaper on the ground, the headline: “GANGSTER GIOVANNI 
           ‘THE PRIEST’ FARIA DIES IN PRISON.”

           It blows past two skinny Korean PROSTITUTES, knees shaking, 
           under-dressed for the weather.  

           A SEDAN pulls to a stop beside them and MATT KRUPASKI (45), a 
           sharply dressed walking oil slick, leans out to them.  

                                 KRUPASKI
                        Cold night, girls.
                            (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)

                        We make you nice and warm.

                                 KRUPASKI (CONT’D)
                        You girls with Johnny Hu?

           Prostitute 1 is confused -- weird question.

                                 KRUPASKI (CONT’D)
                        I’m used to having to go down to 32nd 
                        for Johnny Hu’s girls.

           He flashes a fat MONEYCLIP.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Krupaski lies on the bed with his hands laced behind his head, 
           a depleted grin on his face. 

           The Prostitutes dress and go for the door.

                                 KRUPASKI
                        One more thing, ladies.

           They turn to find him standing, nude, holding a DETECTIVE’S 
           BADGE.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Close on: DECLAN COLE (50), a cold cipher of a man, drops 
           pinches of food into an elaborate aquarium of ANGELFISH.

           He watches them feed with the same quiet satisfaction a 
           rancher might regard a thousand head of cattle: this is the 
           closest thing he feels to love in his life.

                                 DECLAN
                        Gorgeous things, aren’t they?  You 
                        know anything about angelfish?  One 
                        of the most intelligent species there 
                        is.  You know they can recognize 
                        their owner?  Look at ‘em, you can 
                        tell.  One of the few monogamous 
                        species too.  Often when one mate 
                        dies, the partner will refuse all 
                        others after. 

           Reveal: he is in a WHEELCHAIR, a kneeling WOMAN giving him a 
           blow job.

                                 WOMAN
                        Baby, there’s nothing going on down 
                        here--
                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 DECLAN
                        Shut up.

           He downs a glass of whiskey, staring with a kind of sadness at 
           his beloved pets.

           The phone RINGS, snapping his reverie.  He picks it up.

                                 DECLAN
                     (into phone)
                        Yeah?...  Downstairs in ten.

           Hangs up.  Back to his soothing fish.  But he’s now suddenly 
           gone cold and unfeeling.

                                 DECLAN
                     (to woman)
                        Get the fuck outta here.

           INT./EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Krupaski drives, grooving to an old Snoop Dogg song on the 
           radio. 

                                 KRUPASKI
                        Rollin’ down the street smokin’ endo, 
                        sippin’ on gin and juice...

           The two Prostitutes in the backseat, hands cuffed behind their 
           backs.  Their natural dread becomes alarm as they take in 
           their deserted, industrial surroundings -- he isn’t taking 
           them anywhere near a police station.

           He makes a turn into the

           DOCKS

                                 KRUPASKI (CONT’D)
                        With my mind on my money and my money 
                        on my mind...

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

           He pulls up close to a small YACHT -- “MY IRISH MOLLY O” -- 
           where Declan smokes on the dock.

           Krupaski stops, gets out, and opens the passenger side door.  
           The Prostitutes are terrified.

                                 KRUPASKI
                        Come on.

           They don’t move.  He matter-of-factly grabs Prostitute 2 by 
           the hair and roughly pulls her out.  Looks sharply at 
           Prostitute 1 -- she follows.

           tosses the glass into the water: 

           FINN MORGAN (40) -- boss of the Hell’s Kitchen Irish mob.  And 
           though his conservative appearance speaks of control and 
           assurance, his dark eyes reveal an unstable powder keg beneath 
           it all. 

                                 FINN
                        Detective.

           Prostitute 2 BEGS in Korean.

                        She speaks English.

           Finn regards them.

                        Fuckin’ Johnny Hu.  Can’t even 
                        provide his girls with proper coats.  
                        Disgraceful.

           Declan, stonefaced, has an overcoat draped over his lap.  Finn 
           takes it and goes to Prostitute 2, now weeping.

                                 FINN 
                        Shhhhhhh.

           He drapes the coat over her and buttons it.  Jerks his head at 
           the other.  Krupaski uncuffs her.

                                 FINN 90
                        You--
                     (points at ground)
                        Pick up those rocks.

           She trembles.  Finn pulls out a gun, presses it hard against 
           her head, and COCKS the trigger.

           She falls to her knees and picks up two large STONES.

                                 FINN (CONT’D)
                        Now.  Put them in her pockets.

           Prostitute 1 is horrified.  She yelps as Krupaski yanks her 
           forward by the hair.

                                 PROSTITUTE 1
                     (sobbing, in Korean:)
                        Forgive me.

           She puts the stones in Prostitute 2’s pockets.  Prostitute 2 
           suddenly realizes, and CRIES out.

           black river, eyes never leaving Prostitute 1.

                                 DECLAN
                        Remind Johnny Hu and whoever the fuck 
                        else you run into: their merchandise 
                        is not welcome in Morgan territory.  

           Beat.  Finn makes an imperious get-the-fuck-out-of-here 
           gesture and she races away.

           Krupaski lights a smoke and turns to Finn.

                        How’s the wife?

           INT. FREE CLINIC - DAY

           A weeping, strung out TEENAGE GIRL sits at a desk across from 
           a beautiful but heartbroken counselor who’s seen too much -- 
           MOLLY MORGAN (40).

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        --and when I woke up they’d dropped 
                        me in this park, and I didn’t know 
                        where I was and or what they did to 
                        me while I was out or what had 
                        happened to my shoes...and I didn’t 
                        care.  I was lucky I was alive and 
                        all I cared about was getting back to 
                        find Tre again for my next fix.

           Molly listens to this lost little girl with an understanding 
           all her own.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                     (awash in shame)
                        I-- I don’t even know what I’m doing 
                        here.  I have nothing, no money, no 
                        clothes--

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s okay.  That’s what we’re here 
                        for -- to help.  I know it’s scary.  
                        But you’ve already taken the hardest 
                        step: the first.  Sometimes life can 
                        feel like this prison and there’s no 
                        way out, but it’s not true.  The key 
                        is inside yourself.  A lot of people 
                        never learn that.

           Molly offers a supportive smile, but it falters, her mind 
           seeming to linger on her final words.

           Molly alone in front of a HEADSTONE, the inscription of which 
           we do not see.  In her face is a pain so old and intimate it’s 
           like her last friend -- she could find her way to this place 
           with her eyes closed, but could not be more lost. 

           She kneels and places a ROSE by the grave.

           There is a chill wind and she cinches her coat and turns and 
           makes her way back through the frosty graves.

           INT. POSH CONDO, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A sprawling place, well-appointed, but cold and lifeless.

           Molly sits on a divan with a stack of case files, a glass of 
           vodka beside her.  At home she possesses the passive, numb 
           quality of a person whose conception of herself 20 years ago 
           was irreconcilably different.

           She glances down the hall toward the sound of a VOICE, and 
           drinks.

           INT. CONDO, BEDROOM - SAME

           Finn stands like a pillar at the floor-to-ceiling windows, on 
           a cell phone.  He gazes past his ghostly reflection in the 
           glass to the city outside with the air of ownership -- his 
           city.

                        I know you’ve always been more of a 
                        natural catcher than pitcher, Eddie, 
                        but broaden your fuckin’ horizons 
                        already.

           IN THE BLEACHERS

           Molly watches her boys, in her eyes a light and kind of 
           ballbuster gleam missing entirely in the future.  

           Eddie catches her eye and winks.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m visualizing.

                        What, my fuckin’ jock strap?

                                 EDDIE
                        This is what separates an artist from 
                        a fuckface.  An artist visualizes and 
                        mentally performs the motion before 
                        firing a single neuron, while your 
                        common variety fuckface lacks the 
                        requisite discipline and patience.

                        bag-ese.

                                 EDDIE
                        And so while you’re giving that big 
                        mouth exercise it doesn’t need by 
                        every men’s room wall account, I am 
                        visualizing the surgical precision 
                        and grace with which I am going to 
                        throw this ball not half an inch 
                        outside the strike zone, which you, 
                        being an inveterate and practiced 
                        fuckface as always, will swing at - 
                        and miss.

           Finn goes quiet with a fierce and focused look.  They have 
           been best friends all their lives.

           (cid:13)           The whole field is now dying with anticipation.  Molly leans 
           forward.

           Eddie smiles and gently, almost lazily lobs the ball.

           Finn’s fingers whiten around the bat.  Every muscle of his 
           body wants to swing, but he doesn’t--

           The ball whoomps into the catcher’s mitt.  Finn gives Eddie a 
           fuck-you smirk.

                                 UMPIRE
                        Out!

           The ball was thrown fractionally WITHIN the strike zone.  Finn 
           realizes how he was fooled and glares at Eddie.

           Eddie taps his forehead -- all up here.

           Cheers and jeers.  Molly claps, laughing.

           Finn notices her, face clouding with barely suppressed rage.  
           But it passes and he drops the bat.

           Eddie and Molly stand on opposite sides of the chainlink 
           backstop.

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you throbbing with desire over my

                        say that?

           She leans in and they kiss through the fence.

           Finn comes up from behind and roughly but playfully gets Eddie 
           into a headlock.

                        Anyways, I’m gonna miss my bus.

           Eddie leans back to the fence.  This time Finn silently 
           watches the lingering kiss between his best friend and the 
           girl he’s clearly in love with.  

           ON THE FIELD

           A fight brewing between some of the law school boys and the

                        Shit.

           A BRAWL.  And in a blink, Finn and Eddie are in the mix, side 
           by side, trying to break their respective sides.

           Until a frat boy POPS Finn in the mouth.  But before he can 
           swing back, Eddie hammers the guy.

Finn and Eddie tearing through guys, back to 
           back.  Brothers.

           Molly shakes her head, watching the melee from the fence.  
           This is nothing new.  

           EXT. STREET - EVENING 

           A tough neighborhood -- dumpy tenements, pawn shops, OTBs.

           Finn walks with Molly -- at home -- a sheen of sweat on both 
           of them in the heat.  Finn spits blood and rubs his split lip.

                        spreadsheet.

           We intimate from his look and proximity that Molly is more 
           comfortable around Finn with Eddie as a buffer.

           They come to a stop at

           He stands watching the door swing closed.

           He turns and we track him as he strides purposefully down the 
           street.

           Approaches Krupaski.  A BOOMBOX on the stoop plays Dr. Dre -

                                 FINN
                     (laughs)
                        Yeah, yeah.

           Abruptly, Finn SLUGS him in the gut.  Krupaski doubles over, 
           gasping.  

                                 FINN
                        Degenerate tax.

           Finn turns and steps away.

           RUSSIAN.  They eye him hard, one wagging a finger, the other 
           cocking hand like a gun at him -- POW.  Trouble.

           INT. PRISON KITCHEN - DAY (2008)

           “Nothin’ but a G Thang” playing on a beat-up old radio.

           Beside it, a powerfully built inmate, JACKIE LOMBARDO (45), 
           scrubs a mountain of pots and pans, a sweaty mess.

           A PRISON GUARD steps in and bangs on the counter.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Hey, Jackie.  You got a visitor.

           Jackie pauses -- huh?

           INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Jackie sits at the partition glass.  Across from him is a 
           sharp-looking LAWYER with a briefcase.  They pick up the 
           phones.

                                 LAWYER
                        Mr. Lombardo.

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah?

                                 LAWYER
                        My name’s David Meyer, I’m an 
                        attorney with Meyer, Simms, and 
                        Sullivan.  

                                 JACKIE
                        Who?

                                 MEYER
                     (pulls out a FILE)
                        I’ve been looking into your file.  I 
                        think your public defender got his 
                        law degree off a matchbook; I’ve seen 
                        stronger cases of beer than the 
                        prosecutor’s here.  

                                 JACKIE
                        I don’t get it.  Why are you here?
           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 MEYER
                        The why isn’t important, but my 
                        client is paying $1000 an hour, so 
                        time is.  How would you feel about an 
                        early release?

           Jackie just stares at him, dumbfounded.

                                                 CUT TO:

           A gavel SLAMS down on a judge’s desk.

           EXT. PRISON - DAY

           Meyer leads Jackie out, and points him to a waiting LIMO.

                                 JACKIE
                        Who’s that?

                                 MEYER
                        Our employer.  Mr. Mondragon.

           Meyer waves to the limo, then veers off for his own car.  
           Jackie hesitates, then steps into the 

           LIMO

           Where Eddie waits sipping scotch.  Jackie sits across from 
           him.  A quiet, stunned beat.

                                 JACKIE
                        “That I may know Him and the power of 
                        His resurrection.”

           Eddie hands him a drink.  The car takes off.  They sip in 
           silence.

                                 JACKIE
                        So what’s the game -- Mr. Mondragon?

                                 EDDIE
                        You know anyone who can play?

           INT. POOL HALL - DAY

           Dark and smoky.  Slow pan across a rogues gallery of ex-cons, 
           hustlers, and stick-up men drinking at the bar and playing 
           pool...

                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        I’m looking for out-of-towners, men 
                        on the fringe.  Guys with no 
                        affiliations and nothing to lose.

                                 EDDIE
                        And good.

           Jackie takes a big drink and grins...

           BRIEF MONTAGE

           -- A handsome shark, MIKE MULLIN (35), smokes, watching cash 
           counted out on a barroom table.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Strongarm Mike Mullin.  Used to run 
                        numbers for one of the Pittsburgh 
                        outfits.

           Mike glances up at a sexy OLDER WOMAN smiling at him across 
           the room.  Grins.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Until he got caught fingering the 
                        boss’s wife.

           -- Mike SCREAMS, three men holding him down as a buzzing 
           CIRCULAR SAW is brought down toward his right arm.

           -- Mike casually passes through airport security, his right 
           arm now in a CAST.

                                 JACKIE (V.O.)
                        Now he runs a different racket. 

           -- Airport pickup.  Mike slips into the back of a waiting car.  
           He twists his cast and removes the entire FAKE FOREARM, 
           dumping out cash, a bag of pills, and four passports.

           -- Cut back to: Mike screaming as the saw approaches...

                                 JACKIE
                        His partner, Frank Terry, ol’ Sand-
                        ass... His talents lie elsewhere.

           Pan up to FRANK TERRY (45), a pitbull of a man, holding the 
           saw.  Closer...

                                            SMASH CUT BACK 
                                                    TO:

           INT. POOL HALL - DAY

           CRACK - pool balls scatter.  Eddie and Jackie step up to Mike 
           and Terry playing at a table in the back.  
                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                       (cid:13)

                        Gentlemen.  This is the guy I was 
                        telling you about.  Mr. Mondragon.

                                 MIKE
                        So, what’s the score?

           Eddie drops two thick bundles of CASH on the pool table.  Mike 
           glances at Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re in.

           A small nod from Eddie -- time to go to work.

                                 OLD MAN (V.O.)
                        It’s all reducible to economics...

           INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT (BRIEF FLASHBACK)

           Almost like a dream-place: In an inky sea of darkness a candle-
           flame highlights Eddie’s sweaty face.  He squats in a dark 
           concavity, scraping at the wall with a screwdriver.  No other 
           sign of his location.  

           The old Italian man speaking -- JOE “THE PRIEST” FARIA -- sits 
           smoking in the shadows behind him, in the middle of a kind of 
           underworld tutorial.

                                 FARIA
                        Supply and demand, cost risk 
                        analysis.  The successful criminal 
                        isn’t a sociopath, but a rational 
                        profit maximizer. 

           INT. CARD ROOM - NIGHT

           Three of FINN’S CREW oversee a smoky, five-table poker room, 
           deep in action.  Lots of cash. 

           A COMMOTION outside and the door FLIES OPEN.  Frank and Mike, 
           both in gloves and ski masks, charge in with guns behind the 
           bloody LOOKOUT.

           One of Finn’s guys goes for a gun, and Mike promptly SHOOTS 
           him in the calf, dropping him.

           Frank racks a shell in his shotgun, aiming at the head room-
           runner.

                                 FRANK
                        Bag it.

           A Morgan prostitution house.  Eddie, also masked, holds a 
           revolver on the THUG running the place, while Jackie hands out 
           CASH from the open strongbox to the PROSTITUTES there.  

                                 JACKIE
                        Beat it.

           The girls hesitantly take the money and leave.

                                 THUG
                        You bitches take that money and I 
                        swear to Christ I’m gonna--

           Eddie SLAMS him against the wall and presses his gun to the 
           man’s crotch.

                                 EDDIE
                        Speak to those girls again and I make 
                        you one.

           Jackie eyes the man’s LEATHER COAT.

                                 JACKIE
                        That a 42 long?

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Two IRISH HOODS stand with their hands up beside a car.

           Frank, holding a gun on them, tosses bags of COCAINE from the 
           trunk to Mike, who proceeds to cut them open and dump it down 
           a sewer.

                                 IRISH HOOD
                        You’re making a serious fucking 
                        mistake.

           Frank gives him a wink.

           INT. OFFICE SPACE - NIGHT

           A bookie mill buzzing with action.  Workers man phones taking 
           bets, while two BOOKIES run cash through a money counter and 
           update a chalkboard of games and odds.

                                 BOOKIE
                        Bump Green Bay up to minus seven--

           The bolted door BURSTS open behind a sledgehammer.  Jackie 
           (with the hammer) and Eddie march in, raising hell.
                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           Jackie hits one bookie in the gut with the sledgehammer then 
           hurls it into one of the many TVs.

           The head bookie just watches dumbfounded as Jackie begins to 
           dump the bundles of cash on the floor.

                                 BOOKIE
                        Are you fuckin’ stupid?  You know 
                        whose joint this is?

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah.

           Jackie squirts a bottle of LIGHTER FLUID on the money and 
           lights it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Mine.

           He looks beyond the nauseous bookie to the chalkboard.  Pulls 
           out the HUNTING KNIFE.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (1993)

           Small and modest, with a general lived-in clutter.  Eddie 
           enters, exhausted, pizza dough powdering his hands as he 
           thumbs through the mail.

           He stops cold on one LETTER: “New York Board of Law 
           Examiners”.  

           INT. THE ROSE - LATER

           Near closing.  Molly behind the bar cleaning up.  A handful of 
           lingering and dedicated drunks.

           Eddie enters, hair slick from a quick shower, breathing as 
           through he ran here.

           Molly suppresses a grin, surprised to see him.

                                 MOLLY
                        You missed last call by five minutes.

                                 EDDIE
                        Make an exception.  We need a drink 
                        for this.

           She turns to get a drink, and when she turns back a small RING 
           BOX sits on the bar between them.  She looks up, stunned.

           A bottle of Jameson on the desk.  Behind it sits Finn’s 
           father, JIMMY MORGAN (60), a prematurely aged husk of the 
           formidable man he once was.  But there is fire in him yet.

           Sitting across from him are Finn and Declan (35 here).

           On the small TV: a news report on the “FALLOUT OF THE SOVIET 
           UNION COLLAPSE”.

                                 JIMMY
                        Fuckin’ commies.  They lose their 
                        shit and it lands in our backyard.

           He shuts it off with disgust.  

                                 DECLAN
                        They’re not alone, Jimmy.  Ryan’s 
                        lost action to the Chinks down 
                        Wooster.  And you know the Guineas 
                        are looking to put the boot on our 
                        neck. 

                                 JIMMY
                        As goes 9th street, so goes the 
                        fuckin’ world.
                     (beat)
                        So what’re you proposing here?

                                 DECLAN
                        Remind ‘em whose neighborhood it is.  
                        Take the gloves off.

           Jimmy frowns, ruminating.  He holds his handkerchief to his 
           mouth for the hacking cough of a sick man.

                                 JIMMY
                        One, we need the shitstorm of heat 
                        that would bring down like I need a 
                        cock in my ass.  

                                 DECLAN
                        We already discussed a way of 
                        deflecting attention from our 
                        interests.

                                 JIMMY
                        Which I told you no way.  The pay off 
                        is no guarantee, and the risk is 
                        fuckin’ Chernobyl.

           Finn looks from one to the other with interest -- he has no 
           idea to what they’re referring.

           (cid:13)                                 JIMMY
                        And two, we got our hands full as it 
                        is without poking every barking dog 
                        from here to Brooklyn.  Who’s gonna 
                        go to the mat?  Doyle and his 
                        knuckleheads?

           Declan puts a hand on Finn’s shoulder.

                                 DECLAN
                        We put Finny in charge.  The boys 
                        respect him.  Give the kid a shot at 
                        making his bones.  Some real 
                        responsibility, you know?

           Unsaid: Because you’re going to die soon.

                                 FINN
                        I’ll make you proud, Pop.

           Jimmy nods, thinking.

                                 JIMMY
                        That, uh, that little Pollock you 
                        lifted those sneakers with when you 
                        were kids, what was his name?

                                 FINN
                     (goes ashen)
                        Matt Krupaski.

                                 JIMMY
                        Right, right... Except these days 
                        isn’t it Officer fuckin’ Krupaski?
                     (roars)
                        What did that scumbag owe you?  A 
                        grand?  Do you know what comes outta 
                        my pocket in fucking mea culpas when 
                        you slug a cop in the middle of the 
                        sidewalk?  You think this is the Wild 
                        fucking West, you fucking jerk?  Now 
                        if you don’t get your act together, 
                        I’m not putting you in charge of 
                        whacking it on the john until I can 
                        trust you not to fuck it up.  And if 
                        I’m in the ground before that happens 
                        so be it, I won’t have you destroy 
                        what Morgans came halfway across the 
                        globe to build.

           Finn shrinks with every word.  Declan watches him wearily: You 
           punched a cop?

           Jimmy angrily hocks and spits blood on his handkerchief.  

                                 JIMMY
                        We’re done here.
                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           He stands and walks out.  Close on Finn.

           O.S. The jukebox comes on: “Wild Horses.”

           INT. THE ROSE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is now empty except for Molly and Eddie slow-
           dancing.

           Jimmy steps out of the office, followed by Finn and Declan.

                                 JIMMY
                        Alright, alright, no funny business, 
                        this is a reputable joint here.

           He shakes Eddie affectionately by the scruff of the neck.

                                 JIMMY
                        So I gotta pay by the hour to lose 
                        myself in your pretty eyes or what?

           Eddie produces the bar exam letter.  Jimmy lights as though 
           it’s his own son.

                                 JIMMY
                        This kid, I always knew it, this kid.  
                        Hey, why don’t you cough a few times 
                        on that lunk (Finn), see if it 
                        catches.

                                 EDDIE
                        Jimmy, hey, you want to watch how you 
                        talk about my best man?

           Jimmy stares at him, then Molly.

           Molly smiles in such a fashion that in this moment we can see 
           how a man might destroy his brother for it.

           Jimmy enfolds them both in his arms like a bear.

           Finn is speechless, stunned -- which Declan observes.

           Finn breaks into a giddy laugh and goes to Eddie.

                                 FINN
                        C’mere you fuckin’ prick.

           They hug and cackle like best friends, Declan regarding them 
           carefully.

OFFICE SPACE - NIGHT (2008)

           Declan, just as coldly analytical, watches as Krupaski takes a 
           knee at the smoldering ashes of the money at the busted bookie 
           mill, smoking a cigarette.

                                 KRUPASKI
                        Jesus wept.

           Finn toes the busted TV glass, Ryan chomps at the bit behind 
           him.

                        see what falls out.  And clean this 
                        shit up.  

           Ryan moves into action.  

                                 KRUPASKI
                        You want to file a report?

                        I want a name.

           Krupaski just stares at the chalkboard (unseen).  Finn snaps.

                                 FINN
                        You’re a detective!  Detect, 
                        motherfucker!

           Krupaski flicks his cigarette into the ashes and beats it out 
           the back door.  Finn and Declan also both now staring at the 
           chalkboard.

                                 DECLAN
                        They didn’t take a thing.  Anywhere.

           Finn pulls out the Inferno page from his coat.

           Reveal: the CHALKBOARD.  The game odds are wiped away, 
           replaced with a message carved into it: “ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE 
           WHO ENTER HERE.”

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Finn and Declan head out from the bookies.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI (O.S.)

           a sidewalk cafe table.

                                 FINN
                        If it isn’t the Unfuckables.

                                 DECLAN
                        Early bird gets the germ.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Looks like they lost something, Bill.

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Way of the world these days.

           Girardi sips his coffee and glances back at the chi-chi coffee 
           house.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        That’s right.  I remember when this 
                        spot used to be one of your daddy’s 
                        old clip joints, back before your 
                        mother wiped her ass with that stain 
                        in the sheets and birthed you.  

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Yeah, gentrification’s a bitch, huh?  
                        Way neighborhoods change...

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Sometimes overnight.

           Finn sets a twenty dollar bill on their table.

                        Have another latte, faggots.

           Finn and Declan head on down the street toward their car.  
           Girardi and Fisk’s smiles vanish.

           Finn’s bodyguard drives, Finn and Declan in the back.

                                 DECLAN
                        What do you think?  Feds coloring 
                        outside the lines now?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN FINN/DECLAN AND GIRARDI/FISK CONVERSATIONS:

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Dominicans?

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Fuck no.

           Declan observes as Finn washes down a few prescription pills 
           with whiskey.

                                 FINN
                        I don’t know.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Maybe.

           Finn and Declan drive back by the cafe, Finn and Girardi 
           eyeing each other hard.

           INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Molly sits with a glass of self-medication watching TV.  Finn 
           enters, radiating the stress and tension.  She does not greet 
           him.

           He goes and stands over her and kneads her shoulders but still 
           she doesn’t acknowledge him.  He picks up her drink and swigs 
           it.

                                 FINN
                        Shitty, since you ask.  Pretty 
                        fucking shitty.

           And here is revealed a crucial piece of the tragedy: Finn, 
           underneath it all, just wants this woman to love him.  And she 
           never has.

                        mini-bar and Xanax bottle.  You know 
                        there are women out there who 
                        wouldn’t mind a husband who provides 
                        them these things.  You could be a 
                        little more fucking grateful.  

           Molly’s face:  You’re right.  I could. 

           She takes her drink and leaves.

           Linger on Finn’s bitter impotence.

           _____________________________________________________________

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (1993)

           A banner: “CONGRATULATIONS EDDIE AND MOLLY!”

           IRISH ROCK, a party in high gear.

           Kitchen thugs, friends and family, locals young and old - the 
           neighborhood come together for two of its own.

           Eddie, drunk, is given another shot, which he stares at, 
           green.  Molly takes the drink from him, throws it back, sits 
           on his lap.  He buries his face into her neck.

           Jimmy shuffles toward them towing an uptown suit with coked-
           out eyes -- young Jerry Villefort (40) -- pats Eddie on the 
           shoulder.

                                 JIMMY
                        C’mere, kid.  You know Jerry 
                        Villefort?

                                 EDDIE
                     (shakes Jerry’s hand)
                        Yeah, I think.  Assistant D.A.?

                                 JERRY
                        What the door says.

                                 JIMMY
                        The old Kitchen punk went uptown on 
                        us.
                     (beat, to Eddie)
                        And you got an interview Monday.

           Eddie looks to Molly.  It takes a second to soak in.

                                 EDDIE
                        No shit?
                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)

                        So decrees Jimmy Morgan on high.

           Eddie leaps up, grabbing Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        Alright, don’t turn into a fuckin’ 
                        broad on me.

           Someone calls Jimmy away.  Jerry downs his drink and leaves it 
           on the bar, sycophantic grin gone.

                                 JERRY
                        Wear a suit.

                                 EDDIE
                     (asshole)
                        Yeah, thanks for the tip.

           Jerry walks away.  Eddie shrugs him off and scoops up Molly 
           into a hug, laughing.  This couldn’t get any better.

           CORNER BOOTH

           Finn sits alone with a bottle, dangerously drunk, watching 
           them.

           Declan wheels up, holds out his glass to Finn’s.  Clink.

                                 DECLAN
                        To a long and prosperous union.

           Finn pounds his whole drink.

                                 DECLAN
                        The old man... he loves you, you 
                        know.

                                 FINN
                     (pouring another)
                        Yeah.

                                 DECLAN
                        But love can cloud a guy’s better 
                        judgement sometimes.  Make you miss 
                        the forest for the trees.

           Finn is only half paying attention.

                                 DECLAN
                        So if he comes off as a hard-ass 
                        sometimes, it’s just he wants to 
                        protect you, you know.  You’re his 
                        only son.  He had it his way he’d be 
                        around fucking forever just to make 
                        sure things went just so.

                                 DECLAN
                        Thing is, it doesn’t work that way.  
                        Life comes at you, you gotta be one 
                        step ahead -- as my faithful steed 
                        and I can attest.

           He smiles and pats his wheelchair.

                                 DECLAN
                        Now you and I know, the old man, much 
                        as he refuses to let into that old 
                        mick skull, ain’t long for this 
                        world, and when that happens we’re 
                        gonna need iron around our asses to 
                        keep from getting fucked by the 
                        Italians, not to mention the fuckin’ 
                        United Nations of shitheels north of 
                        110th.  We need to be stronger than 
                        we’ve ever been, and that might 
                        require a little improvisation, which 
                        ain’t exactly the old man’s long 
                        suit.

           Finn chuckles.

                                 DECLAN
                        Something funny?

                                 FINN
                        You’d probably be boss already if you 
                        didn’t need monkey bars to take a 
                        shit.

                                 DECLAN
                        And instead of going to officers’ 
                        school I chose to shoot guys through 
                        the heart at 1200 yards.  I’m good at 
                        my job, kid, I don’t need to be 
                        Franklin fuckin’ Roosevelt.

                                 FINN
                        So it don’t bug you you got the 
                        throne but not the crown?

           Declan SLAPS him.  Finn is shocked but doesn’t retaliate.

                                 DECLAN
                        The old man’s naming Doyle as his 
                        successor.

           Finn reacts as though to another blow.

           AT ANOTHER TABLE

           Doyle (50), an obese bearded man, stuffing a meatball hoagie 
           into his mouth.

                        Now you want to pout like a 
                        schoolboy, or pay attention to your 
                        fucking underboss?

           Finn is now listening.

           Declan glances to Jerry.  Jerry returns it with a quick, 
           knowing look.

           INT. THE ROSE, MEN’S ROOM - LATER

           Finn splashes water on his face and stares into the dirty 
           mirror.  A SNORTING sound from the stall.

           Jerry steps out of it, pocketing a vial of cocaine.  Neither 
           looks at the other.

                                 JERRY
                        You talk to Declan?

                                 FINN
                        Yeah.

           Jerry looks past him to the mirror, wiping his nose and 
           adjusting his hair.

                                 JERRY
                        “For by wise counsel thy shalt make 
                        thy war, and in multitude of 
                        counselors there is safety.”

           And with that he leaves Finn to himself.

           INT. ROSE, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Finn exits the bathroom and runs into Molly.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey, where you been?  I haven’t seen 
                        you all night.

           He just shrugs, at a loss for words for a moment, as he looks 
           down at the ring on her finger.

                                 FINN
                        So he’s finally gonna make an honest 
                        woman outta you, huh?

                                 MOLLY
                        Honest as I’m gonna get.

           An awkward silence.  Finn looks like he wants to say more, but 
           she quickly cuts him off.

                        C’mon, I got a girlfriend I want you 
                        to meet.  Just your type -- blind on 
                        Bushmills, ready to make bad 
                        decisions.  

                                 FINN
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I’ll meet you out there.

           With a wink, she heads to the main bar.  As she does a 
           laughing drunk, DONNY, stumbles and knocks her into the wall.

                                 DONNY
                        Ah fuck, I’m sorry, honey.

           Molly waves it off and heads in.

           Donny moves down the hall for the men’s room.

                                 FINN
                        Hey, Donny, you don’t watch where 
                        you’re going?

                                 DONNY
                        Huh?  Gimme a fuckin’ break, Finn.

                                 FINN
                        I’ll give you a fuckin’ break--

           He jerks the guy from the doorway, CRACKS his head into the 
           drywall.  

           Finn slams him in the nose, the gut.  The Drunk goes down.  
           But Finn doesn’t stop.  Stomping.  Punching.  Blood on the 
           wall.

           Now the entire bar sees.  Two thick hoods pull Finn back.

           He looks up and now sees

           THE BAR

           Eddie and Molly watching horrified.  Jimmy with a stone-faced 
           scowl.

           Finn jerks free of the hoods, who pick up Donny.

                                 HOOD
                     (to bar, re: Donny)
                        He’s alright, folks, he’s fine, just 
                        too much to drink.

           The party slowly resumes.  Eddie watches with concern as Finn 
           storms down the back hallway and SLAMS out the rear exit.

           BOOM - side door is kicked in.  Eddie, Jackie, Mike, and Terry 
           step into the sprawling, musty place and look around.

DUMPY APARTMENT - DAY

           Ryan pauses in his punching of the cringing Lowlife, 
           momentarily stunned by something he just said.

                                 RYAN
                        Say that again.

           INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Two sharply dressed black GANGSTERS in a booth with their arms 
           around beautiful WOMEN.

                                 GANGSTER 1
                        Mondragon?  You don’t want to fuck 
                        with that nigga.  I hear he’s from 
                        Serbia or some fucked up place.  Cats 
                        come through and pop him, he goes and 
                        tracks down the entire fuckin’ 
                        regiment with a fire engine full of 
                        hydrochloric acid.

                                 GANGSTER 2
                     (snorts)
                        You special-ed motherfucker.  Nah nah 
                        nah.  Way I hear it, man was black 
                        ops in Afganistan, went MIA when his 
                        chopper went down.  Shows up on the 
                        Russian border six months later 
                        covered in towelhead blood with total 
                        fuckin’ amnesia.

           Reveal: they are addressing Krupaski.  He nods bemusedly.

                                 KRUPASKI
                        The borough thanks you for your 
                        cooperation, gentlemen.

                                 GANGSTER 2
                        You know who loves you, baby.
                     (prods one of the girls)
                        Caramelle -- show the detective what 
                        a fine citizen you are.

           Caramelle stands and leads Krupaski back toward a private 
           room.

           The Gangsters drop the kiss-ass act, eyeing Krupaski with 
           spite -- then nod to a DARK FIGURE at the bar.  Eddie.

           LOUNGE HALLWAY

           Krupaski follows Caramelle, now on his cell phone.

                        Mondragon.  You ever hear that name 
                        before?

           Eddie shadows them, eyes burning into the back of Krupaski’s 
           head.

           They head into a 

           DARK ROOM 

           She flicks on the light -- revealing Frank, waiting with his 
           shotgun.

           CRACK -- he slams the butt into Krupaski’s head.  He and the 
           cell phone drop to the floor.  Finn’s tinny voice on the 
           phone...

                                 FINN (V.O.)

                        What?  Matt?

           Eddie picks it up.

           INT. THE ROSE - SAME

           Finn pacing on the phone.  He freezes.

                                 FINN
                        Matt!

           Only the thumping music of the lounge and the sound of 
           breathing on the other end -- tense beat.

                                 FINN
                        Who is this?

           The line goes dead.  He looks up at Declan.

                                                 CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           And from that darkness sounds emerge:

           Soft GROANING... 

           CLINK of metal on metal...

           A high overhead LIGHT slams on, spotlighting the kneeling lump 
           of Krupaski.  

           His hands are CHAINED to the floor.
                                   (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           He scans about through the blood in his eyes and concussion 
           fog: dusty floor -- broken glass -- rusty I-beams high above.  
           He’s in Eddie’s

           WAREHOUSE

           Behind him, a soft BUZZ rings out like a shotgun in the quiet.

           He turns to that darkness, where another light blinks on, 
           revealing a table with his VIBRATING CELL PHONE and a hot 
           SOLDERING IRON.

           Buzz... Buzz...

           He pulls his chain there and answers it.

                        Nothing that you can give me.

           He speaks through a DISTORTER, his speech low and gravelly.

                                 KRUPASKI
                        You’re fucking with a police here,

                        You haven’t been police for 15 years.

           Krupaski’s spooked now.  He tries to push down his nerves.

           INT. OFFICE

           Sound of Krupaski now gasping and choking sobs, pure animal 
           desperation.

           Eddie places the file back on the desk.  One line stands out:

           PRISONER NUMBER - 655817

           He takes another drag of his cigarette, tight on the

           EMBERS.

                                 KRUPASKI
                     (filtered)
                        Oh God... Oh God... Oh God...

           He SCREAMS with the sound of searing flesh.

                                             MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie stands over Krupaski passed out on the floor, looking 
           down at the lone “6” burned into his arm.  Shakes his head in 
           disappointment. 

                                 EDDIE
                        No heart.

           Reveal: he is holding the HUNTING KNIFE from the pawn shop.

           ______________________________________________________________

           INT. CENTRE STREET BUILDING - DAY (1993)

           Young Eddie sits nervous in a cheap tie and blazer, waiting 
           for his interview.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Donovan?

           Eddie looks up and shakes the hand of a stately older man, 
           D.A. BOB BARNES.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yes.

                                 D.A. BARNES
                        Bob Barnes.  Let’s come back to my 
                        office.

           Eddie nods with a too-big smile and follows him back.  The 
           RECEPTIONIST gives him a thumbs-up and scoops up a ringing 
           phone.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                     (into phone)
                        District Attorney’s office.

           EXT. CENTRE STREET BUILDING - LATER

           Eddie steps out and throws up his fists in victory like a 
           prizefighter to the crowd, then quickly becomes aware of his 
           professional surroundings.

           He hustles for the subway entrance.  Jerry, heading in, 
           watches him go with envy and spite.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Eddie walks in and stops -- there’s Molly in panties and 
           Eddie’s Columbia Law t-shirt.

                                 MOLLY
                        A.D.A. Donovan, I presume?

           He grins.  She pounces on him with an elated hug.  They 
           stumble over the couch and against the window, laughing.  Pure 
           happiness.

STREET - SAME

           A dark figure in a hoodie smokes, watching them up in the 
           window -- Finn.  Pure heartbreak.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        This is the time for strength...

           Finn drops the cigarette, and crushes it out with his heel 
           like something despised.  

           EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

           A distant, high pan over the whole of the city, hot and alive.  

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        City’s awash in weak fucks.  
                        Brainless scumbags who confuse balls 
                        with power.  

           Closer: Details come clear.  Steam - neon - sirens.  The night 
           world coming to life.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        Their only strength is in numbers.  
                        Like rats.  Fuckin’ streaming in here 
                        for years.  And we gave it up to 
                        them...

           And even closer: On one HOODED FIGURE - Finn - moving with 
           purpose down the street.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        But no more.

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           The night of Molly and Eddie’s engagement party, the 
           festivities in full swing.

           Finn in the back booth with Declan -- his is the rest of the 
           conversation we never heard.

                                 FINN
                        This thing.  You’re talking about 
                        more than war.  You’re talking about 
                        the fuckin’ apocalypse.

                                 DECLAN
                        It’s already in the mail, look 
                        around.  Our end is fucking nigh.  
                        Now, we can say novena and pray the 
                        Lord our souls to keep -- or we can 
                        take it back.

                        And how do we do that?

                                 DECLAN
                        We replace a common enemy with a 
                        friend...

           Declan raises his glass to Jerry across the bar and drinks.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING, D.A.’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           D.A. Barnes packs up his briefcase and bids goodnight to his 
           receptionist.

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT

           An arsenal of shotguns and pistols and ammo on the pool table.  
           Four THUGS load the weapons, Declan watching over it all.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        And we show these weak fucks what 
                        real power is.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eddie and Molly kissing hungrily.

           INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Strung-out prostitutes pack bindles of heroin on the couch.  A 
           KOREAN MAN watches over them and TV, while three others play 
           cards at a table.

           BOOM - the deadbolt on the door EXPLODES with a shotgun blast, 
           and two of the THUGS from the Rose burst in and unload on 
           them. 

           The Koreans go for guns and cover, but it’s too late. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Finn marching down the street in his hoodie.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           Two BLACK MEN exit and head for an SUV, where another man 
           waits in the passenger seat.

           A CAR ROARS down the street, windows down.  A double-barrel 
           shotgun emerges from one, a revolver from another.  They see 
           it too late.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           D.A. Barnes drives, on his cell phone with his wife.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eddie and Molly fall to the bed.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Three tattooed RUSSIAN MEN stumble laughing down the street. 

           TWO FIGURES approach them up the block.  They pass into the 
           darkness of a downed street light.  

           When they come into the light on the other side, they now wear 
           ski-masks, pistols in each hand. 

           The Russians reach for coats and waistbands.  Useless.  The 
           men open fire -- a point-blank bloodbath.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Finn turns a corner in a ritzy neighborhood.

           EXT. BRONX STREET - NIGHT 

           Two MAFIA MEN in suits, one old, one young, exit a car and 
           head toward a walk-up in a friendly argument.

           The side of the old man’s head EXPLODES in a cloud of atomized 
           blood, followed by the sound of a distant RIFLE RAPPORT.

           The younger man drops to a knee by his body, stunned.  

                                                 CUT TO:

           POV THROUGH A NIGHT-VISION RIFLE SCOPE:

           In the crosshairs -- the man whips out a gun, searching the 
           night.

           CRACK - the sight bucks with the rifle shot.  When it settles 
           back on the scene, the younger man lies squirming beside the 
           old man, shot through the heart.

           Declan pulls back the rifle and begins disassembling it with 
           practiced calm.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        We know who to hit...

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Back to the party.  Declan downs his whiskey.

                                 DECLAN
                        Fuck ‘em.  Let the mutts fight it out 
                        who did it, scramble for the scraps.

                        Thing is, for that to work we’d have 
                        to lose one of our own too.

                                 DECLAN
                        Now you’re using your head.

           He pours another.

           EXT. STRIP CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Doyle shuffles out of the club to his car.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        What can I say...

           He gets in, fires up the groaning engine--

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        War requires sacrifice.

           --it EXPLODES in a fireball and shower of glass.  Car alarms 
           go off wailing around the block.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eddie and Molly make love, wrapped up in each other, tender 
           yet heated.

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Finn drinks, adding it all up.

                                 FINN
                        And what about our “friend?”

           Jerry paces with a drink, talking to himself.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh my God, that’s--  Holy shit--  
                        Those motherfuckers.  

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        He’ll play his part.

           It’s now becomes clear -- Jerry is rehearsing.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Finn stands pressed into the shadows by a building.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                        So long as you can.  Question is: can 
                        you?

           HEADLIGHTS wash across the building and pass by.

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Finn downs his drink, looks Declan right in the eye - yes.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Barnes exits his car and turns, just as Finn produces a PISTOL 
           from his pocket and - BAM - shoots Barnes in the temple.

           He walks on at a quick pace, never looking back.

           INT. THE ROSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A small grin on Declan’s face as he looks at Finn.

                                 DECLAN
                        Good boy.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dark and still.  Eddie and Molly in bed, his arms wrapped 
           around her.

                                 MOLLY
                        I love you.

           The moment is soon broken by the scream of a POLICE SIREN 
           bombing down the street...

JIMMY MORGAN’S HOME - NIGHT

           The same SIREN whips by outside, as whiskey pours from a 
           bottle into two glasses.  Jimmy hands one to Finn.

                                 JIMMY
                     (re: the sirens)
                        The animals are feeding tonight.

           Finn takes a big drink.  He just murdered someone.

                                 FINN
                        What did you want to see me about?

                                 JIMMY
                        Can’t an old man just want to talk to 
                        his boy?

                                 FINN
                        Sure.  If one of ‘em’s not us.

                                 JIMMY
                        Maybe you’re right.  

           Finn turns away and looks over old childhood photos on the 
           wall -- with Jimmy, with Eddie -- tears welling in his eyes.  
           He knows what’s coming.

                                 JIMMY
                        So let’s just talk like men then.

                                 FINN
                        Why not me?  

                                 JIMMY
                        Finn...

                                 FINN
                        Why was I never good enough?  Every 
                        fucking thing I did -- was to be like 
                        you, to make you proud.

                                 JIMMY
                        Maybe I ain’t someone I want you to 
                        be like.

                                 FINN
                        No.  You wanted me to be him.  

           Finn’s eyes now fall on a photo young Eddie, Finn, and Molly.

                                 FINN
                        You know what it’s like to love 
                        someone - and to look in their eyes 
                        and be just not quite good enough?

Jimmy hesitates then answers it.

           Finn’s jaw clenches, years of frustration and anger building.

                                 FINN
                        I could be him.  I could have 
                        everything he has if I wanted.

           Jimmy listens to an excited voice on the phone.  A stunned 
           expression forms.  

           He looks back to Finn, who returns a cold-blooded stare.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dark.  A KNOCK on the door O.S.

           Eddie clicks on the bedside lamp, shaking sleep, and looks to 
           Molly.

           LIVING ROOM

           Eddie shuffles in and opens the door.  There’s Finn, dark-
           eyed, sipping a pint bottle of whiskey.

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie getting a glass of water, Molly in her robe beside him.  
           They share a slightly annoyed look.  Eddie shrugs, and they 
           head into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Where Finn drops the needle on a record on the player.  
           Springsteen’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town” crackles to life.

           Eddie offers the water, but Finn waves it off.

                                 FINN
                        What’re you, sleeping?  C’mon, it’s 
                        time to celebrate!

           He takes a slug of whiskey and breaks out singing along at 
           her.

                        Mister and Misses.

           Finn trails off, losing himself again in the music and dark 
           thoughts.

                                 FINN
                        Kind of a sad song, isn’t it.

           He puts a hand to his belly, suddenly nauseous.  He bolts for 
           the bathroom. 

           Eddie gives Molly an apologetic kiss on the top of her head.

                                 MOLLY
                        Your witness, counselor.

           She heads for the bedroom.

           IN THE BATHROOM

           Finn just puked.  He spits and flushes the toilet.

           He goes to the sink, splashes water on his face--

           SILENT FLASH:  Finn smothering Jimmy with a pillow, screaming 
           through tears.

           Finn looks up as his pale reflection in the mirror.  Hardens.

           LIVING ROOM

           Finn walks in.

                                 EDDIE
                        You alright, man--

           Finn gives him a tight hug.

                                 FINN
                        I love you, you know that?

                        anywhere.  You know that.

           Finn nods, then looks right at him.  Silent beat.

                        You deserve it all.

           He pats him on the back.  And with that, he leaves, his smile 
           gone.

           Eddie shakes his head.  Clicks off the record, skipping at its 
           end, and the light, and heads down the hall in the dark.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)

           EXT. THE CITY - DAWN

           A bloody sunrise breaking over dark Manhattan.  Oddly 
           foreboding.  

           And then...

                        violence was felt in every corner of 
                        our city.  And though it is with a

                        an unprecedented crackdown on

           Two POLICE CRUISERS skid to a stop.  The hoods run for it.

           INT. EDDIE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The battering ram SMASHES open the door -- police surge in.

           Eddie steps out, and they pin him against the wall.  

                                 EDDIE
                        What the fuck?!

           They fan out and to search the apartment.  Molly steps out.

                                 MOLLY
                        What is this?

                                 EDDIE
                        Guys, you’ve got the wrong place--

           One DETECTIVE holds up a SEARCH WARRANT to them.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Edward Donovan -- we have a warrant 
                        to search the premises.

           Eddie stares with growing concern at the search warrant -- his 
           name on it -- then looks to Molly.

           An officer walks out of the hall holding a .38 REVOLVER.

                                 EDDIE
                        Whoa, wait a minute, that’s not mine--

                                 DETECTIVE
                     (cuffing him)
                        Mr. Donovan, you’re under arrest for 
                        suspicion of the murder of Robert 
                        Barnes.  You have the right to remain 
                        silent--

                                 EDDIE
                        What?  You can’t be serious.

                                 MOLLY
                        Murder?!

                                 EDDIE
                        This is bullshit!

           They pull Eddie away.  Molly has to be restrained.  Eddie 
           tries to keep it together.

           INT. THE ROSE - DAY

           On the bar TV: Jerry at the press conference, now taking 
           questions.

           Finn clicks it off.  He turns to Declan and a half-dozen 
           others of the gang gathered there, and begins to pour glasses 
           of whiskey.

                                 FINN
                        Most of you’ve heard, my father’s 
                        illness finally got the better of him 
                        last night.  And Doyle got hit

                        But if you saw the mug on TV, you 
                        know -- things are already in motion 
                        to keep us...insulated.

           They each take a glass, somber, but everyone knows the score.

           Declan hits a button on the jukebox, and the mournful fiddle 
           of a caoine (Irish funeral song) comes on.

           Finn looks to Declan, who raises his glass to him.

                                 DECLAN
                        Shed a tear at a birth.  Sing a song 
                        at a wake.

           They all drink, Finn still holding Declan’s gaze.

           Molly bursts in.

                        Easy, it’s okay.  Eddie, listen to

                        me?  You just hold on.  Okay.

           Finn hangs up.  He gives Molly a long hug, Declan eyeing him 
           from the bar.

           Another “witness”: Officer Krupaski.  He glance to Finn in the

                                 KRUPASKI
                        Yes, I saw the defendant that night 
                        near the victim’s home.  He was 
                        obviously in an intoxicated and 
                        agitated condition, and knowing his 
                        lifelong association with the Morgan 
                        crime family, I took note of it. 

           Eddie quietly argues with his out-matched LAWYER, then SLAMS 
           his fist on the table and stands.

           INT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING (2008)

           Morning sun pours through the stained glass windows over empty 
           pews and statues of saints.  Still and serene.

           A PRIEST strides down the aisle with a cup of coffee toward 
           the CONFESSIONALS.

           He sees the small cross-window above one lighted RED -- 
           occupied -- checks his watch with a sigh.

                        Bit early today aren’t we, Mrs. 
                        Murphy--

           He opens the booth -- and GASPS, his coffee mug CRASHING to 
           the marble floor.

           INT. THE ROSE, BACK OFFICE - SAME

           Finn paces, popping pills and drinking, staring down at his 
           phone.  Eyes red, mind racing -- he hasn’t slept a wink.  

           The door opens.  Finn spins with a pistol, startled -- only 
           Ryan.  He calms, rubbing his face, and tosses the gun.  Ryan a 
           little shaken.

                                 FINN
                        Any word?

                                 RYAN
                        No.  But I found this at the back 
                        door.

           He sets a brown paper PACKAGE on the desk -- “Finn Morgan” 
           scrawled on the top.

           Finn hesitantly picks it up.  A tiny smear of BLOOD on the 
           side.

           INT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

           A POLICE TECHNICIAN snap photos of the confessional booth.

           bullet hole through his head, shirt soaked with blood.

           Finn, unraveling, rants at Ryan and his other enforcers.  
           Declan off to the side, watching Finn with concern.

           INT. CENTRE STREET OFFICE BUILDING, OFFICE - SAME

           Jerry hangs up.  “MONDRAGON” written on a notepad on his desk.

           He jerks open a drawer and pulls out a small REVOLVER.  Checks 
           that it’s loaded and sticks it in his jacket.

APARTMENT BUILDING HALL - SAME

           Declan rolls to a stop outside his door, which he sees is 
           AJAR.  MUSIC coming from inside.

           He pulls out a PISTOL stowed under his wheelchair and 
           cautiously rolls into the

           APARTMENT

           On the stereo: Sinatra crooning “Between the Devil and the 
           Deep Blue Sea”.

           Declan rolls through, gun leading every move.  Not a sound, 
           except the eerie music.  

           But the place is empty.  Begins to calm.

           It’s then his eyes fall on his

           AQUARIUM

           Full of only water -- NO FISH.

           Declan’s eyes rim with tears, hand squeezing the gun until 
           he’s shaking.  He inhales to scream--

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR - SAME

           --DING.  The two men from the hall step in and turn -- Mike 
           and Frank.  

           Mike twists his cast and pulls off the fake forearm.  Frank 
           reaches in and pulls out a plastic bag of water and DECLAN’S 
           FISH.  

           He makes a goofy fish-face at them, as the elevator doors 
           close.

           INT. CENTRE STREET OFFICE BUILDING, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

           A different elevator opens.  Jerry quickly slips in, jabbing 
           the garage button.

           Sweaty and nervous.  He barely even notices the MAN reading 
           the newspaper there.

           Jerry in the back of his car service ride.  It slows.

                        Uh, Mr. Villefort?

           Jerry looks up and sees two POLICE CARS in front of his 
           building.

           ACROSS THE STREET

           A car with two KOREAN GANGSTERS pulls away.

           INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jerry steps into the open door to find his crying WIFE staring 
           in disgust at his COMPUTER next to two POLICE OFFICERS.

           Agent Girardi walks into the office, where everyone is

           Villefort being led out of a car in handcuffs.

           Jerry, bruised and trembling, sits across from Girardi and 
           Fisk, who savors every moment.

                                 JERRY
                        Get me the fuck out of here.

                        Wife stiffed you on the bail, huh?  
                        Tough beat, considering you put half

                        I guess finding out your husband 
                        shops at the children’s department 
                        will do that to a woman.

                        Okay, Jerry, have it your way.  Enjoy 
                        your time.  Here’s a tip, though: 
                        don’t shave.  I hear the brothers 
                        don’t like to get head from guys with 
                        beards.

           The agents get up to leave.  Jerry conflicted, then...

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

           They stop.

                                 JERRY
                        Full immunity.  Get me out of here 
                        and I give you all of it.

           INT. CITY JAIL - DAY

           A loud BUZZ opens Jerry’s cell door.  A guard hands him his 
           clothes.

                                 GUARD
                        You’re processed.

           He leads Jerry down a hall to an

           OPEN SECOND FLOOR WALKWAY

           Where he suddenly stops to tie his shoe.  Jerry looks back 
           just as two SKINHEADS grab him.

           Before he can scream: One slips a WIRE ROPE around his neck, 
           then clips the carabiner end to the railing -- as the second 
           stabs him with a BOX CUTTER and RIPS IT ACROSS HIS BELLY.

                                 SKINHEAD
                        Morgan says hi.

           They shove him over the railing -- the wire SNAPS TAUT -- 
           hanging him, GORE spilling from his open gut.

           EXT. CONDO BUILDING - DAY

           Finn, tweaked on pills and paranoia, exits a car flanked by 
           Ryan and another watchful bodyguard.  They head in.
                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           IN A CAR ACROSS THE STREET

           Eddie watches through the passenger side-view mirror.  Jackie 
           at the wheel.

           Just then Molly steps out of a cab, right into his view.  

           EDDIE

           Locks eyes with her.

           MOLLY

           Stares, paralyzed.  Neither breathes.  She finally takes a 
           step that way.

           EDDIE

           Forces himself to look away.

                                 EDDIE
                        Go.

           Jackie hesitates, seeing what he sees, then takes off down the 
           street.

           MOLLY

           Can only stand there watching, shaken, unsure what she just 
           saw.  She puts a hand to her belly, almost nauseous.  

           INT. CONDO - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly shuffles in, mind still swimming, as Finn’s bodyguards 
           make sure the place is clear.

                                 FINN
                        You okay?

           She finally notices the commotion.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s going on?

                                 FINN
                        Nothing.  I just need you to be 
                        careful.

           He wraps his arms around her from behind and rests his weary 
           head on hers, wanting only the comfort she can’t give.

                                 FINN
                        Do something for me.

                                 MOLLY
                        What.
                                 (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 FINN
                        Tell me you love me.

           But her mind is clearly elsewhere.  Ryan steps back in from 
           searching.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s clear.

           Finn sees the words are never coming and pulls away from her.

           INT. CONDO, BEDROOM - LATER

           Molly sitting at an antique vanity.  She opens a drawer and 
           pulls out a small engagement ring -- Eddie’s ring.  All that 
           old heartbreak rushing back.

           INT. WAREHOUSE, OFFICE - DAY

           KA-THUNK -- the hunting knife imbeds in the wall beside an 
           AQUARIUM with Declan’s fish.  

           Eddie strides over, pries the knife out, and walks back across 
           the room.

           There is a KNOCK on the door and Jackie enters with an uneasy 
           expression carrying a FILE FOLDER.

           KA-THUNK -- Eddie throws the knife again.

           Jackie hands him the folder, clearly put off by its contents.  
           Eddie opens it -- the PHOTO of Molly on the balcony (other 
           photos beneath it - unseen).

           Eddie glares at him.

                                 JACKIE
                        Thought it might do you better to 
                        look at that.

           Eddie tosses the photo.

                                 EDDIE
                        Anything else?

                                 JACKIE
                        Nothing.  Boss.

           He leaves.  Eddie sits with the folder, which also contains 
           what Eddie wanted: CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of Villefort’s body.  

           But we linger on the discarded photo of Molly, just as Eddie 
           does.

CITY JAIL - DAY (1993)

           Just after Eddie’s conviction.  A tearful Molly on the phone 
           across from Eddie, partition glass between them.  

           Eddie is an expressionless void.  Everything blown out of him.  
           He picks up his phone, but can barely look at her.

           She wipes away tears and plays at strength and hope.

                                 MOLLY
                        I talked to another lawyer, he has 
                        some ideas for appeal.  I didn’t 
                        really understand, they’re longshots 
                        he says, but I think with a new judge 
                        and presentation of--

                                 EDDIE
                        It won’t.

                                 MOLLY
                        Eddie, this is just... this is a 
                        travesty.  Villefort, that cop--

                                 EDDIE
                        Are doing exactly what it takes to 
                        bump up to the next paygrade.  I know 
                        the law, Molly.  I used to believe in 
                        it.  But the math is simple: the 
                        machine gets hit, it hits back.  
                        Innocent, guilty -- it doesn’t 
                        matter.  What matters is evidence.

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t do this.  Don’t give up on me.

                                 EDDIE
                        It gave up on me.
                     (beat)
                        And you should too.

           She breaks down.  He almost does also, seeing her.  He looks 
           away, fighting tears with every word.

                                 MOLLY
                     (sobbing)
                        No.  Look at me.

                                 EDDIE
                        So I have to go soon.  They’e going 
                        to take me away from here.  And when 
                        they do, you walk out of this place-- 

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t you fucking do this to me.

                        --and don’t ever come back.

                                 MOLLY
                        Look at me!  Eddie!

           Eddie pushes it all down, and looks at her cold.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m dead.  We’re dead.
                     (beat)
                        Goodbye.

           Eddie stands and walks away - gutted - Molly crying and 
           banging the partition behind him.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY 

           Dead winter.  Recreation time.  INMATES milling around, 
           shooting hoops, playing checkers, steam rolling from their 
           mouths.

           BLEACHERS

           Joe Faria sits off to himself reading the newspaper.  He 
           glances across the yard.

           Reverse Angle: Eddie, also by himself, staring out the fence, 
           eyes middle distance, consumed in his own darkness.  He is 
           gaunt and his head is shaved.

           Faria looks back at his paper.  

           ARTICLE HEADLINE: “Law Student Turned Assassin”.

           A SNOWBALL thumps against Faria’s shoulder.  He looks O.S. and 
           wags his finger.  As he brushes himself off, a SHADOW falls 
           over him.

           Two heavily tattooed JAPANESE INMATES stand over him -- one 
           lean and rat-looking, the other a 250 pound fire hydrant.

           One sits next to Faria, while the hydrant turns away, facing 
           the yard.

           Japanese Inmate picks up the Comics, folds a bundle of money 
           within, and replaces it next to Faria.

                                 FARIA
                        Grazi.

                        I want to bump my next order to 50.

                        I know you can get it.

                                 FARIA
                        And?

           He looks at the man bluntly, challenging him to argue.  But 
           the man backs off and rises, muttering in Japanese.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                        Watch your language.

           The two men start to head off, but find themselves in the path 
           of a head guard AL DORLEAC (45), a paunchy, balding, fascistic 
           sadist.

           He stares them down, both whither from his gaze with no more 
           fight than beaten animals.

           He continues to Faria, who ignores him.  Beat.  Dorleac picks 
           up the Comics section, opens it, raises his eyebrows.  

           Faria continues not to acknowledge him.  Dorleac peels off 
           several bills, folds the money back into the paper, and 
           returns it.

                                 DORLEAC (CONT’D)
                        Any special Valentine’s Day plans, 
                        Joe?

                                 FARIA
                        You’re not skimming enough to afford 
                        me, Al.

           Angle back on Eddie.  A basketball bounces roughly off his 
           head to O.S. laughter.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                        That boy.  You think he really did 
                        it?

                                 DORLEAC
                        The fuck you talking about?  We’re 
                        all innocent here.

           He walks off, SLAMMING his baton down on a game of checkers 
           for the fuck of it.

           INT. CELL - DAY

           Eddie lies on his back, the same distance in his eyes.

           His cellmate - Jackie - here with a lean fighter’s build, 
           pants and grunts, doing boxing combinations in the air.

           Abruptly he throws a FEINT at Eddie, who flinches.
                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 JACKIE
                        Gotta stay sharp, killer.

           The MAIL CART passes and several letters as well as a Hustler 
           are handed through.  Jackie tosses the letters at Eddie and 
           opens the Hustler.

           Eddie takes the first letter - from Molly - gets up, tears it 
           in two, and drops it in the trash.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        The fuck this cooze got to say that’s 
                        so offensive to your delicate 
                        sensibility anyway?

           He goes to the trash to retrieve the halves.

           In a flash Eddie lunges and SLAMS Jackie into the wall and 
           stares him down murderously.

                                 JACKIE 
                     (holds up both hands)
                        Hey, hey, Jesus.  Peace.

           Beat.  Eddie lets him go, heads back to his bunk.

                                 JACKIE 
                        Hey, Donovan.

           Eddie turns.  Jackie SLUGS him in the eye.

                                 JACKIE 
                        Take a fucking joke, huh?

           Eddie does not retaliate.  

           INT. EDDIE’S CELL - NIGHT  

           Eddie lies awake in bed, staring at nothing.  The madhouse 
           hoots and calls from inmates echo through the cell block.  All 
           hope lost.

           LATER

           Eddie writing.

           INSERT: LETTER

           Molly,

           I can neither ask you to understand or forgive this decision, 
           but I need you to know what I do, I do out of

           BACK TO SCENE
                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                       (cid:13)           Lying near the letter is what was once a plastic spoon, now 
           filed into a crude BLADE.

           FOOTSTEP approach his cell, hushed voices.  Eddie palms the 
           blade as an unhappy-looking Jackie enters escorted by Dorleac.

                                 DORLEAC
                        ...and watch out for his jaw -- 
                        cocksucker’s got a chin like a china 
                        doll’s cunt.  But here I am telling 
                        Picasso how to paint.
                     (to Eddie)
                        Shame your celly here can’t try out 
                        for the summer games, Donovan -- he 
                        could bring home the gold in taking 
                        dives. 

           Dorleac heads out.

                                 JACKIE
                     (mutters)
                        Yeah, in your mother’s muff.

           Dorleac wheels around and SLAMS Jackie into the wall, pressing 
           his baton into his windpipe.

                                 DORLEAC
                        What was that?  Say it again, you 
                        greaseball faggot.

           Jackie’s face goes red as he RASPS for breath.

           Eddie rises.

                                 EDDIE
                        What I said was, do you let the E-
                        block ladyboys spit out your dirty 
                        panties long enough to say heil 
                        Hitler while they paddle your ass?

           Dorleac releases Jackie and stares Eddie down with primal 
           rage.  Then, improbably, he CACKLES with mirth.

                                 DORLEAC
                        Nice to see you come out of your 
                        shell, Donovan.

           CRACK - he slams the nightstick into Eddie’s skull.  

           INT. CELL (SOLITARY CONFINEMENT) - LATER

           An empty, windowless dungeon with a dripping pipe.  The door 
           opens and a battered Eddie is heaved in.  The door shuts.

           Eddie lies on the floor.
                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           Begin MINI-MONTAGE:

           DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

           -- TIGHT on Eddie’s blank eyes.

           Sound of cloth tearing: SCRI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ITCH...

           FLASH: Molly shaving her legs in the shower.

           -- Eddie slumped against the wall, legs splayed out. 

           DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

           FLASH: Molly lying on a lounge chair in sticky summer heat, 
           dripping an ice cube on her abdomen.

           SCRI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ITCH...

           -- Eddie lightly thumping his head against the wall.

           DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

           FLASH: Eddie and Molly kissing fervently on a pier: their 
           first.

           SCRI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ITCH...

           -- Eddie LAUGHING like a lunatic.

           DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

           FLASH: Eddie slow dancing with Molly in the Rose.

           SCRI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ITCH...

           -- Eddie stands shirtless, his breathing slow and measured.

           BLACK

           The dripping and tearing both stop.

           FOOTSTEPS...

           The door opens.

                                 GUARD
                        Alright, Sunshine-- Oh fuck.

           Eddie dangles from a noose woven from his shirt.  He TWITCHES, 
           still asphyxiating, the pipe dripping on his head.

           INT. PRISON HOSPITAL - DAY

           Eddie lies on a bed, staring off into middle distance, a 
           bandage around his neck. 
                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           A BATMAN COMIC drops into his lap.  He looks at the orderly: 
           Faria.

                                 FARIA
                        It’s a good one, with the Two-Face.  
                        I like the Two-Face.  I always 
                        thought the Joker was a finocchio.

           Eddie does not - and in fact, presently, cannot - reply.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t met.  I am Faria.  You can 
                        call me Joe -- when, of course, you 
                        regain your powers of speech.
                     (off Eddie’s neck)
                        Such a foolish thing, a young, 
                        healthy man like you.

           Eddie visibly checks out -- he doesn’t need this shit.

           Faria SMACKS him upside the head.  Eddie GLARES, but restrains 
           himself.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                        You see, fire in you yet.  You think 
                        I’m a silly old man, you little 
                        fighetta?  I have shit-streaks in my 
                        underwear with more sense than you.  

           Faria holds his glare, then pats the comic.

                                 FARIA
                        Enjoy.  And maybe next time I’ll 
                        bring you some heavier reading.

           Faria leaves.  Eddie picks up the comic book, unsure of what 
           to make of the preceding exchange.  Two-Face on the cover...

           ______________________________________________________________

           INT. CENTRE STREET OFFICE BUILDING, OFFICE - DAY (2008)

           Girardi and Fisk search Jerry’s office, royally pissed.  Fisk 
           slams a file cabinet drawer.

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Shit.

                        gutless little fuck...

           Fisk pauses at the desk, pushing some papers aside.

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Hey.  Remember that name he said?

           INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY

           The Morgan task force meeting.  There is a BULLETIN BOARD of 
           photographs arranged in a hierarchy of Finn’s operation.  

           Now Villefort’s note - “MONDRAGON” - is tacked off to the 
           side, a MOVIE STILL of Bela Lugosi above it in place of a 
           photograph.

           Girardi holds court:

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        What the fuck.  How does a comet not 
                        have a tail?  NYPD: dick.  DEA: dick.  
                        NSA: dick.  This doesn’t happen -- a 
                        major player doesn’t spontaneously 
                        generate like pimples on Rivera’s 
                        mother’s ass.

           Rivera extends a middle finger.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI (CONT’D)
                        I do not fucking permit this to 
                        happen.  From hence forth none of you 
                        assholes knows sleep, the loving 
                        touch of a woman, or a nice, 
                        leisurely shit with the Sunday Times 
                        until I know who this fuckbag is.  
                        He’s taking down lowlife cocksuckers, 
                        and that is our job, gentlemen.  So 
                        let’s do it.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Mike paces, chain smoking.  Frank and Jackie play cards at a 
           table, Jackie looking up at Eddie’s silhouette in the office 
           window.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m worried.

                                 MIKE
                        Why, because we got every cop and 
                        mick hood in the city kicking down 
                        doors looking for us?  Or maybe it’s 
                        the 100-fucking-grand bounty on our 
                        heads?

                                 FRANK
                        Sit down.

                                 JACKIE
                        He’s losing the handle.
                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 MIKE
                        Burning cash, flushing coke down the 
                        fucking toilet -- I mean, what the 
                        fuck is he doing?

                                 FRANK
                        He’s paying.  Now sit the fuck down.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m tired of sitting!

           Mike tries to calm.  He flicks his cigarette butt and checks 
           the pack -- empty.

                                 MIKE
                        I need some smokes.

           He peeks out the door, checking the alley, then leaves.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s an asshole.  But he ain’t wrong.

           Jackie looks back up at Eddie.

           INT. FREE CLINIC - DAY

           Molly at work, shuffling files and papers with forced focus.

           Her eyes suddenly well with tears and she rests her head in 
           her hands, trying to hold it back.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

           Molly pays for a small bottle of vodka.  The owner hands her 
           the change, observing her defeated expression.

                                 OWNER
                        Can’t win ‘em all.

           She heads out into the 

           STREET

           Slipping the bottle into her purse.

                                 JACKIE (O.S.)
                        Molly Morgan?

           She stops and sees -- Jackie, hood up, in the shadows of an 
           alley.
                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           INT. WAREHOUSE, OFFICE - SAME

           Eddie sits at the desk, watching Declan’s fish, much like he 
           did.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        My God.

           His head snaps up.  She stands in the doorway, stunned, 
           searching for words.  He gets up.

                                 MOLLY
                        It is you.  I saw you, that day...  I 
                        knew it, but...  How--

                                 EDDIE
                        What do you know?

           He looks away.  She’s taken aback by his coldness, and it 
           begins to sink in how much he’s changed.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you doing, Eddie?

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re mistaken.

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t you dare.

                                 EDDIE
                        Speaking figuratively.  There is no 
                        Eddie anymore.

           She can’t understand this -- but moves forward.

                                 MOLLY
                        Then let me feel your heart.  I’m 
                        looking at this Halloween costume but 
                        if your heart isn’t beating out of 
                        your chest I’ll turn my back on you 
                        and whatever sick game this is you’re 
                        playing.

           He looks at her.  He unbuttons his shirt, revealing a torso 
           vested in TATTOOS.

           She moves toward him.  Cautiously puts out a hand.  His face 
           betrays nothing.  She puts her hand to his heart.

           And the moment they touch it’s animal: he seizes her violently 
           and kisses her, she clutches at him, nails plunging into his 
           flesh.

           He pulls her up, she wraps her legs around him.

           (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           He backs her to the desk, knocks the computer to the floor, 
           and lays her down.  She torques up and kisses across his 
           abdomen and unfastens his belt.

           He tugs down her pants and enters her and with NO MUSICAL 
           ACCOMPANIMENT they fuck in real time.

           LATER

           Molly lies on the floor.  Eddie stands at the window.  Both 
           are COMPLETELY NUDE.

                                 EDDIE
                        Whatever you think this is -- it 
                        isn’t.

                                 MOLLY
                        Look at me and say that.

           He turns to find her right behind him, avoids her eyes.

                                 EDDIE
                        You should leave.  The city.  Get out 
                        and go.

                                 MOLLY
                        Come with me.

                                 EDDIE
                        There are things in motion now that 
                        don’t get stopped.

                                 MOLLY
                        You can stop any time you want.

           He looks at her neither agreeing or arguing.  She places a 
           hand on his naked chest, her eyes welling with tears as they 
           take in the tattoos and scars there.

                                 MOLLY 
                        I don’t know what happened to you or 
                        whatever it is that brought you here 
                        and I don’t care.  You were dead and 
                        now you’re standing in front of me 
                        and if that isn’t a gift sent by God 
                        I don’t know the meaning of the word.
                     (beat)
                        Why are you doing this?  Why can’t 
                        you look at me?

           And for a moment she sees a glimpse of that old Eddie and 
           makes him look at her.

                                 MOLLY
                        You can fool everyone else.  You can 
                        fool yourself.  But you can’t fool 
                        me, Eddie Donovan.  I love you and I 
                        always have.
                                     (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           In his eyes -- he’s about to break -- hand moving almost 
           imperceptibly toward her...

           Then it retreats into a fist as he forces himself to pull back 
           and turn away.

           And with all the strength he has in him, withdraws back into 
           that hate that has fueled him all these years.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Bodies lie, Molly.  You would know.  
                        And your continued unhappiness is one 
                        of the purest sources of satisfaction 
                        in my life you fucking Judas whore.

           She tries to speak but can’t.  She dresses, completely 
           eviscerated but doing her absolute damnedest not to show it to 
           him.

           She goes to door, stops.

                                 MOLLY
                        If you think I’m going to tell him, 
                        don’t worry -- I can’t think of two 
                        people in the world who deserve each 
                        other more.

           She leaves.  

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Molly exits, fumbling with the final buttons of her shirt, 
           devastated.  

           IN A CAR ACROSS THE STREET 

           Ryan watches her, a grim “holy shit” look forming on his face.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh kill the fuckin’ messenger.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Eddie drinks from a nearby bottle, lost in thought, then sends 
           it SMASHING against the wall.

           In a piece of broken window glass, he catches his scarred

PRISON, CELLBLOCK - DAY (1994)

           Eddie, throat still scabbed and red from his suicide attempt, 
           wanders back amongst the general population.

           Dorleac hangs up the wall PHONE.  He passes by Eddie and 
           briefly they catch each other’s eye.

           INT. THE ROSE - SAME

           Finn sits at Jimmy’s desk, his face a dark mask, lighting, 
           extinguishing, and relighting a ZIPPO.  

           INTERCUT WITH: 

           CELLBLOCK

           An obscurely ominous air around Eddie -- passing glances, 
           flashing grins.  But he is oblivious.

           THE ROSE

           Finn fucking with the lighter.  Lid flips up.

           FLASH: Finn staring up at Molly’s silhouette in her window. 

           FLAME ignites.

           CELLBLOCK

           Eddie walks on, passing two SKINHEADS.

           THE ROSE

           Finn flips the zippo lid shut.  He pulls out a cigarette, 
           sparks up the zippo one last time, and lights it.

           CELLBLOCK

           The two skinheads start to trail Eddie, just as he perceives 
           something is wrong.  He ducks into the PRISON LIBRARY.

           THE ROSE

           The phone RINGS.  Finn answers it, lighter still burning.

                                 KRUPASKI (O.S.)
                     (on phone, filtered)
                        It’s done.

           Hands shaking, Finn hangs up.  And snaps the zippo shut.

           PRISON LIBRARY
                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                        (cid:13)           Eddie makes eye contact with a GUARD, who turns and walks 
           away.

           Real panic suddenly hits him just as the two Skinheads burst 
           in and seize his arms--

           They drag him into the stacks and pinion him to the wall.  A 
           MASSIVE SKINHEAD steps in, slipping on a crude, brutal BRASS 
           KNUCKLE.

           Eddie struggles, but it’s no use.  Massive Skinhead advances 
           fast -- this is going to be over quick.

           POW!  Jackie comes flying and SLUGS Massive Skinhead across 
           the face, followed by a flurry of bodyblows.

           Eddie takes this advantage and viciously BITES Skinhead 1’s 
           ear, tearing it free.  Skinhead 1 SCREAMS, releasing him.

           Eddie SLAMS his free elbow into Skinhead 2’s nose.

           Massive Skinhead throws several punches at Jackie, who, far 
           quicker, dodges, jabbing at the man’s face to disorient him.

           Skinhead 2 punches Eddie and knees him in the stomach, Eddie 
           brings the top of his head crashing up into the man’s jaw.

           Massive Skinhead throws a crushing blow at Jackie, clipping 
           him.  Jackie staggers backwards, reeling, comes back with an 
           UPPERCUT to the guy’s balls.

           Skinhead 1, blood streaming from his head, rushes Eddie with a 
           SHIV -- STABBING HIM TWICE in the gut before Eddie can react.

           Eddie leaps back, the blade SLASHING his chest and face.  He 
           catches the swinging blade with his bare hand.

           A brutal eye-to-eye struggle for it, blood streaking down his 
           arm.  

           Eddie slams the Skinhead’s ripped ear, sending him reeling 
           back, SCREECHING in pain -- right into a wild swing from 
           Massive Skinhead’s brass knuckles.  CRUNCH.  He drops, dead 
           before he hits the ground.

           Skinhead 2 leaps on Eddie’s back, STABBING him in the ribs 
           with a sharpened screwdriver.  Eddie kicks against the wall, 
           falling backwards on top of the man, knocking the wind out of 
           him.

           Eddie climbs on top of him, slick with blood, running on pure 
           adrenaline, and wraps his fingers around the man’s throat.  

           Breath ragged, eyes barely human, Eddie squeezes...  
           squeezes...

           the Skinhead gags, eyelids fluttering.

           TIGHT on Eddie’s eye, the cut under it weeping blood.  PULSE 
           accelerates, going faster and faster, until--

           Sound returns, and Eddie realizes he’s murdering another man.

           Eddie releases him and slumps back, panting and sweating.

           Jackie offers his hand and helps Eddie up.

           They make their way out of the stacks -- to find themselves 
           face to face with Dorleac and a phalanx of GUARDS.

                                 DORLEAC 
                        Not bad, Princess.

           He KNOCKS Eddie unconscious with his baton.

           BLACK

           After a silent beat, a soft sound emerges.  Growing clearer.  
           A voice reading in ITALIAN...

           INT. PRISON HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Eddie’s swollen eyes flutter open.  A little light.  And the 
           voice.  All through a fog of drugs and pain...

           He looks over to find Faria seated beside his bed, reading.  
           Faria pauses, smiling at what he just read.

                                 FARIA
                        Dante Alighieri.  You ever read him?  
                     (beat)
                        That man wrote the finest work of art 
                        in human history.

           INSERT - THE BEAT-UP OLD BOOK: Il Inferno.

           The delicate, yellowed pages.  Dark ILLUSTRATIONS of the 
           damned and their grotesque tortures.

                                 FARIA (V.O.)
                        Five years he spent on the Inferno 
                        alone.  The discipline, the drive.  
                        Hell’s architect.  Assigning a nice 
                        spot in the hot place for every poor 
                        sinner in this world.  Gluttons, 
                        heretics, hypocrites, everyone.  And 
                        the pit with Lucifer himself he saved 
                        for the worst sinners of all...

           consuming three men -- Judas, Brutus, and Cassius -- the same 
           page Finn found nailed to the door.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 FARIA
                        The Traitors.

           Faria snaps the book shut, finally looking over his glasses at 
           Eddie.

                                 FARIA
                        First you want to die.  Then when 
                        death comes for you, you fight.  
                        Which is it, hm?  
                     (beat)
                        Give it a read.  And if in it you 
                        should find a reason to stand in hell 
                        rather than lie in it--

           Faria tucks the book under Eddie’s hand.

                                 FARIA
                        --Well, that will be another 
                        conversation.

           With that, Faria leaves, a polite tip of his cap to the night 
           guard.

           Eddie’s weak hands pick up the book.  

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Faria in hushed conference with Dorleac.

                                 DORLEAC
                        That’s no small favor.

                                 FARIA
                        You’re no small man.

           He slips Dorleac a thick roll of CASH, and moves to leave.

                                 DORLEAC
                        What do you care about this kid?

                                 FARIA
                        Blessed are we who die in the Lord, 
                        Al, for we shall rise again.

           Faria walks on with a tiny grin.

PRISON MORGUE - NIGHT

           The BODY of the dead skinhead, his face demolished.  

           With a quick glance around, Dorleac rips off the toe tag and 
           slips on a new one.  

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

                                 DORLEAC
                     (into phone)
                        Closed casket.

           FLASH: THE NEW TOE TAG -- “Name: Edward Donovan”.

           INT. PRISON HOSPITAL - SAME

           Eddie opens the book.  As he does, a small bundle of PAPERS 
           falls from it to his lap.  

           Confused, he opens the bundle: newspaper clippings, notes, 
           grainy photographs.  

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Behold, I tell you a mystery...

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The PRIEST reads, addressing a small crowd of mourners before 
           a coffin.  Eddie’s funeral.

                                 PRIEST
                        We shall not all sleep, but we shall 
                        all be changed...

           Molly, a statue of grief, stands beside Finn.

                                              CUT BACK TO:

           INT. PRISON HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Eddie examines a newspaper article with a photo of Jerry.  
           Headline: “Villefort Overwhelmingly Elected as District 
           Attorney”.  

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        In a moment, in the twinkling of an 
                        eye: the trumpet shall sound and the 
                        dead shall rise again incorruptible.

CONDO BATHROOM - DAY

           Villefort leans up from snorting a line on the counter.  

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        O death, where is thy sting?  O 
                        grave, where is thy victory?  The 
                        sting of death is sin; and the 
                        strength of sin is the law...

           He wipes his nose and adjusts his tie with a look of supreme 
           confidence.

           Eddie pours over more of the papers.  Faster - a blur of 
           connections.  It all sinking in...

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        And so this corruptible must put on

           Declan watches the mourners, fingers lightly drumming on the 
           arm of his wheelchair.

           Eddie, anger swelling despite his weak state, comes to on OBIT 
           for Jimmy Morgan--

                                 PRIEST
                        Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye

           Finn stares at the coffin.

                                 PRIEST
                        Always abounding in the works of the 
                        Lord, knowing that your labor is not 
                        in vain in the Lord.

           He pulls his hand from his pocket and holds Molly’s beside 
           him.  She doesn’t resist.

           The book and notes spill onto the floor, as Eddie rises 
           through the pain, clutching that last photo of Finn and Molly.  

           CONTINUE INTERCUT WITH:

           THE FUNERAL

           The coffin lowered into the grave...

           Eddie’s IV rips out of his arm...

           WHUMP - Molly drops a handful of dirt on the coffin...

           Eddie’s wounds reopening as he takes a step...

           WHUMP - Declan drops a handful of dirt...

           Eddie staggers another step, fuming, bleeding -- then his 
           vision goes dark and he crumples hard to the floor--

           WHUMP - Finn tosses a final handful of dirt.

           INT. THE ROSE - DAY

           The wake.  Molly stands away from the crowd, turning Eddie’s 
           engagement ring around her finger.  With a final twist it 
           slips off.

           Finn steps up.  Quiet beat.  Neither really looks at the 
           other.  

                                 FINN
                        Whatever you need...  I’m here for 
                        you, Molly.  I always have been.  I

           then downs his drink and flees back to the wake.

           Molly looks back down at the ring.  

           She pockets it, almost breaking down.  A silent decision.

           INT. FARIA’S CELL - NIGHT

           Eddie comes to, drugged and disoriented.  

           He looks around, realizes this isn’t his cell -- it is, in 
           fact, the most tastefully appointed cell in the entire prison: 
           bookshelves, percolating coffee pot, record player.

           Standing at the record player is Eddie’s new cellmate, Faria, 
           who places the needle on an Italian opera record.  

                                 EDDIE
                        What am I doing here?

                                 FARIA
                        If you recall, we had an appointment.  
                        And I, for one, honor my agreements.

           It’s then Eddie sees Il Inferno and the notes beside him -- 
           and it all comes flooding back to him in a FLASH.

           Eddie leaps up and SLAMS Faria against the wall.

                                 EDDIE
                        Why did you do this to me?  Why did 
                        you show me this when I’m stuck in 
                        this fucking place?

                                 FARIA
                        Because, Edward, it’s not the average 
                        graduate of Columbia Law School who 
                        would rip off another man’s ear with 
                        his teeth.

           Eddie falters, his weak state catching up with him.  He sits, 
           clutching his side, lost in that heartache.

                                 EDDIE
                        What do you want from me?

                        As you may have observed, I have a 
                        fairly elaborate system in place 
                        here.  It’s taken me a not-
                        insignificant number of years to 
                        build, and has afforded me a certain 
                        lifestyle I’ve grown rather 
                        accustomed to.

                        otherwise.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Why would I give a fuck about that?

           Faria pulls a sheet across the bars and smiles cryptically.

                                 FARIA 
                        Because I offer something else.

           INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           A dark, musty space of no identifiable use, walled in on all 
           sides. 

                                 FARIA (V.O.)
                        In 1916 a terrible nor’easter hit the 
                        harbor, causing a flood in the piping 
                        that killed several inmates.  
                        However, with the war, it seemed 
                        liked a waste of resources to 
                        reconstruct the whole system, and so 
                        that main was simply sealed off...

           Sound of STONE SCRAPING...

           Several CINDERBLOCKS inch outward at the bottom of one wall.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie and Faria stand regarding another wall.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                     (knocks it)
                        With four feet of solid granite.

           They drop down to a RECESS in the wall, a concave depression 
           of roughly a foot.  

           Lined in a ritualized row on the ground is a graveyard of 
           SCREWDRIVERS worn to nubs.

                                 FARIA 
                        Five years getting the proper cell.  
                        One year getting through.  And twelve 
                        years making it this far.  But as I 
                        said, I am getting no younger.

                        out by my 80th birthday -- in 2008.

           He looks at Eddie in the exact moment the entire molecular 
           make-up of what Eddie Donovan thought he was becomes another 
           thing entirely.

                        Hope, Edward -- hope is not a 
                        profitable emotion in this place.

           Massive Skinhead closes his eyes, threads his hands behind his 
           head.

                                 FARIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No, what I have to give you is 
                        something you can use.  Something you 
                        can hold, to give you meaning, 
                        strength.

           The lean Japanese Inmate from the prison yard appears behind 
           Massive Skinhead.

           Cut to Manboy stumbling backwards in shock, BLOOD washing from 
           his hair into the drain.

           INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Back to Faria and Eddie, who stares into that shallow 
           depression in the concrete.

                                 FARIA
                        I can give you hate.

           INT. WAREHOUSE, OFFICE - NIGHT (2008)

           Eddie packs up gear -- guns, files, stuffs an envelope full of 
           cash. 

           He flips over one sheet in the pile and pauses -- the 
           discarded photo of Molly.

           Jackie enters.  Hands a SATCHEL to Eddie, who checks its 
           contents (unseen).

                     (re: the satchel)
                        Should I ask?

                                 EDDIE
                        No.
                     (beat)
                        I can finish this alone.

                                 JACKIE
                        No, you can’t.

           Eddie hands him the envelope.

                                 JACKIE 
                        You need help, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Don’t-- call me that anymore.  Your 
                        services are no longer required.

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re free, you know that?  You’re 
                        fucking free and you don’t even know 
                        it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Freedom is a relative term. 

                                 JACKIE
                        So’s cunt.

           He bitterly takes the money and leaves.

           EXT. THE ROSE - DAY 

           Two THUGS guarding the front door.  CLICK-CLICK -- They freeze 
           in black-and-white --

           INT. VAN - SAME

           Across the street: Agent Rivera and the FBI surveillance team 
           snapping photos.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                        Okay, give me “degenerate fuckhead”.
                     (takes picture)
                        Nice, nice.  Now, you, show me “sixth 
                        grade education.”  Oh, very good.   

                                 TEAM MEMBER
                        Lot of muscle.  Somebody’s seen the 
                        boogeyman.

           OUTSIDE AT THE ROSE:
                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                            (cid:13)           A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA now above the door watches all...

           INT. THE ROSE, BACK OFFICE - SAME

           The view from the camera on a black-and-white MONITOR.  Three 
           other monitors show cameras feeds covering the bar and back 
           alley.

           Finn’s bloodshot eyes dart between them, a man caged in his 
           own place of power.  

           FLASH: This office, decades ago.  A moment of peace: Jimmy in 
           his prime, a bull; young Finn sitting in his lap -- they 
           listen to a baseball game on the radio.

                                 FINN
                        Sometimes I wonder...what the old man 
                        would do.

           Declan taps a cigarette on the wheelchair arm, his calculating 
           eyes study Finn.

                                 DECLAN
                     (to himself)
                        So do I.

           Finn turns with venom to confront him, but Declan now looks 
           elsewhere.  Finn follows his gaze to the monitor: a MAN 
           approaches the front door.

           INT. VAN - SAME

           Rivera snaps to curious attention, watching.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                        Who the fuck is this asshole?

           INT. THE ROSE, BACK OFFICE - SAME

           Finn watching the monitors: the man is escorted in, through 
           the bar, down the back hallway...

           He shares a guarded look with Declan, as one of the THUGS 
           opens the door.

                                 THUG
                        Finn, this guy’s got something you 
                        gotta hear--

           The man steps up -- MIKE.

                                 MIKE
                        You want Mondragon?  I can give him 
                        to you.

THE ROSE - LATER

           Ryan steps in and stops, seeing three of Finn’s other 
           enforcers load GUNS on the pool table with Finn and Declan, a 
           new energy burning in them all.

                                 RYAN
                        What’s going on--

           Declan tosses a SHOTGUN to him.

                                 DECLAN
                        We got a date.  Get your warpaint on.

           Ryan looks to Finn, unsure whether to speak now.

                                 FINN
                        What.

                                 RYAN
                        Nothing.

           Finn SNAPS his loaded revolver closed.

           EXT. THE ROSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Finn and Ryan march out and into a car out front.  Another 
           THUG hops into a car behind them.

           INT. VAN - SAME

           Rivera pushes equipment out of the way, getting ready to 
           follow.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                        Whoa, whoa, we got some action.

           He fires up the van as Finn and Ryan take off, followed by the 
           other car.

           Rivera follows, dialing his cell phone.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                     (into phone)
                        We’re on the move.

           Girardi on the phone, snapping his fingers at Fisk.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI

           Rivera on their tail.

                        Morgan and the Wild Bunch with hard-
                        ons for something.  I got--

           SCREECH -- Rivera slams on the brakes -- the thug following 
           Finn has stopped cold ahead of them, blocking traffic.  

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                        Son of a bitch.

           In the car ahead: the thug smiles in the rearview mirror, 
           flipping-off Rivera.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                        You motherless Irish mutt.

           He looks to throw the van into reverse, but a car is behind 
           him, honking.  He can only lean back with a sigh.  Screwed.

                                 AGENT RIVERA
                     (back to the phone)

           Declan and the three other enforcers speed out in another car,

           Girardi throws his phone across the room.

           Fisk nods to the Bela Lugosi “MONDRAGON” picture.

                        Gotta be after him.

BAR - NIGHT

           Jackie watches whiskey pour into a glass.

           He downs the shot, slaps down a twenty from his envelope, 
           pushes back, and ambles out to his new life.

           Linger on: one FIGURE in the rear of the bar, who stands and 
           follows.

           INT. CAR - SAME

           Ryan kills the headlights, and slows to a quiet stop on a 
           deserted street.  Grabs the shotgun.  Finn grabs his arm hard.

                                 FINN
                        I want him alive.

           Eddie flips open and lights a zippo, and forces himself to 
           bring the flame to Molly’s photo.

           EXT. BAR - NIGHT

           Jackie heads down the side alley, shoves his hands into the 
           pocket of his leather jacket.

           CLICK.  He stops.  A REVOLVER inches away from the back of his 
           head.

           We see who is holding the gun on Jackie -- the Thug from 
           earlier at the whorehouse.  Jackie is wearing his coat.

                                 THUG
                        42 long.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Ryan and Finn’s other enforcers creep up to the warehouse 
           corner.  Ryan nods for two to go around back, and they head 
           down the alley.  

           He glances up at a nearby

           ROOFTOP

           Where Declan jacks the bolt action of his rifle and takes aim 
           on the warehouse, scanning the boarded windows.

           His CELL PHONE vibrates in his pocket.

           (cid:13)                   (cid:13)           INTERCUT FROM HERE:

           EDDIE

           Drops the burning photo into the trash bin.

           THE ALLEY THUGS

           Slip into the warehouse loading dock entrance, guns ready.

           EDDIE

           Tenses, hearing something, zippo still burning on the desk.  
           He reaches for a gun, listening.

           RYAN

           Holds beside the front door, nods to the man with him.  Racks 
           a shotgun shell.

           THE ALLEY THUGS

           Pad down a dark rear hallway in the warehouse.

           RYAN

           Swings into action and KICKS the door open.

           EDDIE

           Turns to the office door -- where Mike steps in, Frank behind 
           him.

           RYAN AND THE ALLEY THUGS

           Charge into the main room, guns searching for a target.  
           NOTHING -- it’s a different warehouse.

           Something catches Ryan’s eye, though.

                                 RYAN
                        What the hell?

           On a solitary chair: a RUSSIAN NESTING DOLL sitting atop a 
           WIRED PACKAGE.

           EDDIE 

           Brings a cigarette to his lips--

                                 MIKE
                        It’s done.

           --And brings the zippo flame to it...

           RYAN’S

                                 RYAN
                        Fuck.

           EDDIE’S

           Cigarette IGNITES--

           THE OTHER WAREHOUSE

           EXPLODES, fire and debris bursting from the windows and door.  
           Ryan goes flying like a rag doll to the alley asphalt.

           BACK IN THE CAR

           Finn ducks as chunks of brick SMASH through the windshield.  
           He dives out into the gutter with his gun, shielded by the car 
           door.  

           He watches the roaring flames in shock. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

           The stairwell door SLAMS open and three tattooed RUSSIAN 
           GANGSTERS march out, guns drawn--

           At nothing.  Declan is gone.  They stop.

                                 RUSSIAN GANGSTER
                     (in Russian, subtitled)
                        Where is the cripple?

           INT. WAREHOUSE, OFFICE - NIGHT

           Eddie blows smoke, looks up at Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s Jackie?

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           SMACK -- 42-Long slams Jackie’s swollen, bloody face.

           Jackie, shirtless, hangs by his wrists from a chain.  On a 
           table off to the side: a bat, hammer, and hacksaw.  

           Declan rolls into the light.

                                 DECLAN
                        What did he give you?

                                 42 LONG
                        Dick.  Got an ID.
                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           He tosses Jackie’s wallet to Declan, who reads the ID.

                                 DECLAN
                        Jackie Lombardo.  Say anything else?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah.  
                     (spits blood and a molar at 
                      Declan’s feet)
                        Get fucked.

           42-Long takes another big swing.  Jackie lowers and leans his 
           head into it just in time; 42’s hand cracks on top of it.  He 
           YELPS in pain, rubbing his knuckles.  

                                 42 LONG
                        Motherfucker!  

           Declan chuckles, then tosses him some cash from Jackie’s 
           wallet, eyes never leaving Jackie’s.

                                 DECLAN
                        Why don’t you go get us a couple of 
                        Coca-Colas.
                     (to Jackie)
                        You want something?

                                 42 LONG
                        You want me to get Finn?

                                 DECLAN
                        Get what I said.

           42-Long hesitates, then heads for the stairs, still in pain.

                                 42 LONG
                     (to Jackie)
                        You’re a fucking dead man.

                                 DECLAN
                        Ain’t we all?

           He leaves.  Declan thumbs the weapons on the table.  

                                 DECLAN
                        Afraid he’s right about that.  But 
                        tonight, Mr. Lombardo, you get a 
                        choice few of us do.  See, I have 
                        these questions, I’m sure you’ve 
                        heard them already.  But they all 
                        really come down to that one.  So 
                        tell me, Jackie...

           He pulls out the REVOLVER stowed under his wheelchair and 
           glances at the door where the man intent on torturing him to 
           death will be returning shortly, raising his eyebrows.
                                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 DECLAN
                        How do you want to give up the ghost?

           Jackie hangs his head, swallows hard.  

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Finn, gun in hand, stumbles down the alley, dragging along 
           Ryan -- a charred, quivering mess.

           Ryan collapses in agony, slumped against the wall.  Finn scans 
           the rooftops and shadows around him for some unseen menace.

                                 RYAN
                        Don’t let me go out like this.

           SIRENS scream in the distance.  Ryan grabs Finn’s shirt, 
           drawing him back.

                                 RYAN
                        Listen to me.  I saw 
                        her...Molly...watching her like you 
                        said.  She’s stepping out on you.

           Ryan grabs him harder, almost daring Finn to end his life.  
           Finn stands in disbelief. 

                                 RYAN
                        Do it.  DO IT--

           Finn shoots Ryan in the head.  For a moment he just stands 
           there.  Then he UNLOADS his gun into Ryan’s body.

           Sirens getting closer.  Finn moves with new purpose down the 
           alley.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eddie, Mike, and Frank, packed to leave, head down the 
           hallway.  Eddie on his cell phone.

                                 EDDIE
                     (into phone)
                        Say that again.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The three Russian gangsters driving down the street.

                                 RUSSIAN GANGSTER
                     (into phone)
                        We had a problem.  With the man in 
                        the chair.

WAREHOUSE - SAME

           A BEEP on Eddie’s phone, takes a look -- “JACKIE calling”.  
           Worried now, he clicks over, just as they enter the

           MAIN ROOM

                                 EDDIE
                     (into phone)
                        Jackie.

                                 DECLAN (V.O.)
                     (filtered)
                        An old friend.

           A bat CRACKS across Eddie’s hand and face, smashing the phone 
           and dropping him -- 42-Long.

           Another HOOD emerges from the shadows behind Mike and Frank, a 
           gun on them, and tosses the guns from their coats across the 
           floor--

           Where Declan slaps Jackie’s blood-spattered phone closed, his 
           pistol in the other hand.

           42-Long raises his bat over Eddie again--

                                 DECLAN
                        What did I say!

           He stands down.  Eddie spits blood on his hands and knees.  

                                 DECLAN
                        Sorry about the arm.  Charlie here 
                        used to be a regular Squatty Munson 
                        with the lumber down DeWitt back in 
                        the day.  But look who I’m telling.

           He looks at Eddie for a long beat with genuine admiration, 
           shakes his head.

                                 DECLAN
                        Well I’ll be a monkey’s uncle.

           Eddie looks up through the pain at Jackie’s phone.

                                 EDDIE
                        Where is he?

                                 DECLAN
                        With the Father and the Son.  Like 
                        those warehouse boys you just lit up.  
                        Just business.

                        Always something else with Finn.  It 
                        still is.  Which is why I’m here.

           Declan stows his pistol back under his wheelchair.  Eddie 
           stares at him, unsure what to make of this.

                                 DECLAN
                        We both want something here.  And we 
                        can help each other get it.  

                                 EDDIE
                        What do I want.

                                 DECLAN
                        You want to knock off the king.  I 
                        need someone to wear the crown.  I 
                        can give you Finn -- and everything 
                        he has.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Or what?

                                 DECLAN
                        Then we have a problem.  But men like 
                        us don’t have problems, do we, Eddie?  
                        We have solutions.
                     (looks off reflectively)
                        I met the Priest once, you know?  At 
                        a sit-down with Jimmy back during the 
                        Citroni war.  

           QUICK FLASH: A middle-aged Faria in an immaculately-tailored 
           suit smoking a cigarette with a panther’s cunning detachment.  

                                 DECLAN
                        In a different life...we would be the 
                        ones running things, you know?  
                        Nations, you know, not the fucking 
                        neighborhood. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Well sieg fucking heil, now how am I 
                        supposed to trust you in this one?

                                 DECLAN
                        Because we’re alike.  

           QUICK FLASH: Young Declan in combat fatigues dragging himself 
           through jungle undergrowth, shot through the spine.

                                 DECLAN
                        We are both born twice.

           Eddie finally rises to his feet.  Mike and Frank share a quick 
           glance -- partners communicating.

                                 EDDIE
                        Everything?
                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           Mike slowly twists his cast arm...

                                 DECLAN
                        Everything.

           All in a flash: Mike pulls off his cast arm -- Frank reaches 
           in, pulls out a revolver and SHOOTS the Hood twice in the 
           forehead -- Eddie’s hand darts up his sleeve, whips out the 
           hunting knife and STABS 42-Long in the throat.

           Both bodies crumple to the floor.  And for a moment no one 
           moves -- especially Declan.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re right...

           Eddie walks toward him with the knife.  Declan’s hand creeps 
           toward his pistol.

           Eddie stops -- then sheathes the knife and extends his hand 
           for a handshake.  Declan’s stunned a beat.  

                                 EDDIE
                        We are alike.

           Declan grins and shakes his hand.

                                 EDDIE
                        But we’re not in the same business.

           CLICK -- Eddie slaps a pair of handcuffs on Declan’s wrist.  
           The grin vanishes.

                                                 CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER.  The murky chop of the Hudson.

           SPLOOSH -- Declan’s wheelchair is tossed in, followed by 
           Declan, his wrist cuffed to it.  Smaller splashes follow him 
           in -- his ANGELFISH.

           Declan struggles in vain to stop his descent.  And as he sinks 
           into the black, his terrified eyes meet the eye of one of his 
           fish, which watches with cold, intelligent recognition.

           ______________________________________________________________

           INT. FARIA AND EDDIE’S CELL - DAY (2007)

           The sound of panting.  

           Eddie rises from doing pushups.  Goatee and greasy hair, 
           collection of scars and tattoos, hard as the walls around him.  

           If before he embodied the American dream, he is now a thing 
           from the darker margins our national unconscious.

           CARD.  Turns to find a more wizened Faria holding a cupcake 
           packed with 13 candles.

                                 FARIA
                        Only 712 more days.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           A desperate INMATE sits across a chessboard from an impassive 
           Eddie.

                                 INMATE
                        Please...  Come on, E.--

                                 EDDIE
                        There’s two kinds of people in the 
                        world, Parks: alive and dead.  Pick a 
                        side.

           The Inmate grimaces, then grabs his own index finger and snaps 
           it, HOWLING.

                                 EDDIE
                     (rises)
                        Never steal from me.  Remember who I 
                        am.

           He walks away.

           Eddie bumps into a NEW INMATE -- Donny.  Freezes.

           FLASH: Donny bumping Molly and catching a beating from Finn 
           the night of the engagement party.

                                 EDDIE
                        Donny.

           Donny looks at him, not a hint of recognition.

                                 DONNY
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Donny walks on, as this gravity of what just happened sinks 
           into Eddie.  

           INT. CELL - NIGHT

           Eddie examines himself in the small mirror, that encounter 
           still clearly on his mind.  He is a new person.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie on the bed, staring at an old PHOTO of him and Finn 
           smiling at his law school graduation, Eddie in cap and gown.
                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                       (cid:13)           He draws on a cigarette, then carefully burns a hole through 
           his own face in the picture.

           INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT  

           Eddie digging, the RECESS now several feet in, the collection 
           of worn screwdrivers exponentially larger than it was.  Faria 
           studies him, his drive.

                                 FARIA
                        Who was she?

           Eddie pauses, surprised by the question, which Faria has never 
           once brought up in 15 years.  He digs on, ignoring it.

                                 FARIA
                        I’ve taught you many things, Edward.  
                        But what must be kept in mind before 
                        making any decision: opportunity cost 
                        -- a thing’s value versus its cost.  
                        This is not, however, simply a 
                        question of adding all costs, its 
                        also analyzing the next best 
                        alternative: a choice may appear 
                        profitable, but if a single 
                        alternative is more so, it’s the 
                        wrong one.  Remember this. 

           Eddie looks back at him, then returns to digging, harder now.

                                 EDDIE
                        There is no alternative.

           There is a low, ominous RUMBLING NOISE.

           Faria and Eddie look at each other.  Abruptly, Eddie seizes 
           Faria and pulls him free of the recess just as there is a 
           COLLAPSE, dust billowing over them.

           They lie there, PANTING.  Beat.

           Both scramble wildly for the debris and start clawing through 
           it.

           INT. SEWER SYSTEM - MINUTES LATER

           Old and crumbling from disuse, a large DRAINAGE PIPE at one 
           wall.

           Sounds of DIGGING, as two pairs of hands emerge from the 
           RUBBLE left of one wall.  Eddie wiggles through and pulls 
           Faria behind him.

           They both see the drainage pipe and look back to each other in 
           amazement -- they made it.

           Faria and Eddie crawling.  At the end, faintly: light.

           Faria starts SINGING softly in Italian -- but then he notices 
           something and his face falls.

                                 FARIA
                        No...

                                 EDDIE
                        What?

                                 FARIA
                        No!

           He crawls more rapidly.

                                 EDDIE
                        Joe, what is it?  Joe!

           Faria scrambles to the end of the pipe, IRON BARS grafted over 
           it, moonlight just outside.

           Faria throttles the bars with a heart-wrenching SCREAM.  Eddie 
           pulls at him.

                                 EDDIE
                        Come on, Joe.

           Faria ignores him, raging.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Joe, Joe, you got to calm down.

           Faria is heedless -- but then GASPS and clutches his chest.  
           He slumps.  Eddie’s eyes go wild with panic.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck.  Oh fuck no.  I’ll go get 
                        help, Joe.

                                 FARIA
                     (weakly)
                        No.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re not fucking dying here.

           Faria CLAMPS a hand on Eddie’s arm with alarming ferocity.

                                 FARIA
                        No!

           He winces at the effort.  Eddie is stunned, overwhelmed.

                     (wheezing)
                        If you take them here you’ll rot in 
                        the hole -- ruin everything...  You 
                        get out of here.

                                 EDDIE
                     (in tears)
                        How?

                                 FARIA
                        Listen to me, damn it!  When you do, 
                        you go to the old Hotel Mondragon in 
                        Queens.  Room 177, behind the mirror.  

                                 EDDIE
                        What?  Joe, what’re you--

                                 FARIA
                        A foolish young criminal’s dream, 
                        something I hoped to see again.  Now 
                        I just want to look at the moon here 
                        a while.  Room 177.  You take it and 
                        you rain Hell on the lives of the 
                        ones who sent you there.

           Eddie weeps.  Faria takes his hand.

                                 FARIA (CONT’D)
                        You brought hope into an old man’s 
                        life, my son.  Hope... is a putan.

           He smiles at Eddie, goes limp.  Eddie clutches his body, 
           shoulders wracking.  

           INT. CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

           A bedcheck GUARD strolls down the hall, lazily shining his 
           flashlight into each cell.

           He comes to Faria’s cell and stops cold, his light revealing 
           their beds moved and the HOLE in the cinder block wall. 

                                 GUARD 
                        Motherfucker.

           He fumbles for his walkie.

                        We have a breach.

           SEARCH LIGHTS go on, an alarm WAILS in the night.

CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           THREE GUARDS emerge, radios SQUAWKING.  Faria’s body lies on 
           the ground, Guard 1 takes his pulse as 2 and 3 sweep their 
           flashlights around, seeing the rubble-strewn tunnel.

                                 GUARD 1
                     (into walkie)
                        Prisoner down.

           Guard 2 brandishes his gun and beckons Guard 3 to follow -- 
           they crawl into the tunnel.

           EXT. PRISON - SAME

           Guards canvas with BARKING dogs, a swell of inmates’ WILD 
           CHEERS.

           INT. CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

           Dorleac crouches by Faria, who lies in an open body bag.

           Guards 2 and 3 emerge from the tunnel.

                                 GUARD 2
                        Donovan’s not back there.  Must have 
                        slipped past.

           The Guards rush out.

                                 DORLEAC
                     (to himself)
                        You’re a dead man.

           Dorleac zips up the body bag.

           Behind him -- the sound of RUBBLE STIRRING.

           Dorleac grabs his flashlight and turns to find Eddie right 
           there, a phantom covered in dust, a SHOELACE wrapped around 
           his hands.

                                                 CUT TO:

           Eddie drops Dorleac’s body and drags it to the rubble where he 
           just emerged, then turns to the body bag.

           INT. VAN - DAWN BREAKING

           Faria’s body bag lies on a collapsible gurney, bumping along 
           with the highway.  
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           There is movement within and the zipper comes down.  Eddie 
           sits up with a gasp.

           He glances behind him at the driver’s panel, then looks to the 
           two back doors.

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

           A chill wind blowing over the black water.

           The surface breaks, and like some undead thing, Eddie emerges 
           and strides onto the shore, his eyes burning with one purpose, 
           water dripping from his closed fists.

           ______________________________________________________________

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

           That same black, glittering water.

           Eddie, Mike, and Frank stand beside an open car trunk.  Eddie 
           winces as he digs through his gear.

                                 FRANK
                        You need a doc.

           Eddie produces two severance envelopes similar to the one he 
           gave Jackie and places them on the car.

                                 EDDIE
                        Services rendered.

           He pauses at the trunk, then picks up a sports bag full of 
           CASH from his gear and also puts in on the dock.  

                                 EDDIE
                        For his family.

           They take the money.  Mike stares at him with naked contempt.

                                 MIKE
                        Hope you’ve got your money’s worth.

           They leave and Eddie is truly as he’s always been.  Alone.

           INT. CONDO, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Molly packs a suitcase.  She pulls off her wedding ring and 
           sets it on the dresser.

Something 
           spooky in his eyes.  She goes back to packing.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 FINN
                        To him?

           That freezes her a moment.

                                 MOLLY
                        There is no him.  I thought there 
                        was.

                                 FINN
                        All I ever did was love you.

           It’s then she notices the gun in his hand.  In her face is at 
           the same time animal fear and a kind of hardening.

                                 MOLLY
                        You can’t love, Finn, if you don’t 
                        love yourself.  Why do you think I’ve 
                        hated you since the day I married 
                        you?

           Viciously, he throws her down on the bed and holds her by the 
           fair and presses the gun to her face.

                                 FINN
                        I’ll kill you, you fucking bitch!

           She trembles but meets his eye.

                                 MOLLY
                        I died 15 years ago.

           His eyes animal and crazed and red with desperation 
           heartbreak.  He sees what he is reduced to in his reflection 
           in the dresser mirror and lifts his gun and FIRES.  The mirror 
           explodes.  

           Finn stands, composes himself.  Molly watches, uncertain.  

           Finn goes to the dresser and amongst the shattered glass picks 
           up Molly’s ring.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Finn, stop.

           He ignores her and tries to take her hand.

                                 MOLLY
                        Finn, you’re hurting me--

           ring back on her finger.

                                 FINN
                        Get up.

           She doesn’t.

                                 FINN
                        Come on.  We’re going.

           He seizes her and hauls her up and forces her towards the 
           door.  She claws and struggles, but he is a man with nothing 
           left but this and she is no match.

           Girardi turns as Fisk marches up and slaps down a FILE FOLDER.

                        PD just pulled this out of a Kitchen 
                        warehouse, responding to gunshots, 
                        two bodies at the scene.

           Girardi scans through the file contents, smile spreading on 
           his face.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Gotcha.

           They bolt out of the office.

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

           The water glitters black as Finn’s car enters

           THE DOCKS

           And pulls to a stop by his YACHT.

           INT./EXT. CAR

           Finn gets out, but Molly doesn’t move.  He goes to her door 
           and opens it.

                                 FINN
                        Get out.

           He puts a hand on her throat and clamps it.  She tries to pry 
           him off but can’t.  He squeezes harder and she chokes, eyes 
           throbbing.

                                 FINN
                        You’re.  Still.  My.  Wife.  
                     (roars)
                        Mine!

           He pulls her out and she gasps, holding her throat.

           INT. YACHT, CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Finn thrusts Molly to a couch and kneels to the wall and 
           removes a false panel.  Inside is a strongbox.

           He opens it and is relieved to discover a cache of a couple of 
           hundred grand.

           A sense of command returns to his face -- he is a Morgan, he 
           will survive.

           He starts to exit, pauses.  Looks at Molly, removes a FIREAXE 
           from the wall, and takes it out with him -- LOCKING Molly in 
           from the outside.

           EXT. DOCK

           Finn undoes the rigging.

           INT. CABIN

           Molly is on her feet, searching for some kind of weapon.

           She does not notice 

           OUTSIDE THE PORTHOLE

           A dark figure watching her.

           EXT. COCKPIT

           Finn stands at the wheel.  He turns the key -- click.

           He tries again, and there is not even the sound of the engine 
           failing to turn over -- it’s like there’s nothing there. 

           Alarm in Finn’s face.  He pulls his gun from his waistband and 
           goes

           AFT
                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)

           The engine is gone.

           In its place lies a book: THE INFERNO.  Finn, horrified, lifts 
           it and opens it.  

                                 FINN
                        No...

           Inside: the PHOTO of Eddie and Finn at the graduation, a 
           cigarette burn through Eddie’s face.

           Finn stares in disbelief.

                                 FINN
                        What is this?

           KA-CHUCK -- Finn turns to find Eddie with a gun on him.

                                 EDDIE
                        It’s fifteen years in hell.  Fifteen 
                        years crawling out.

           Finn stares.

                                 EDDIE
                        Say my name.

                                 FINN
                        No...  It can’t--

                                 EDDIE
                     (raises gun)
                        Say it.

           Finn stumbles back and sits on the hatch.  He hunches over, 
           overwhelmed.

                                 FINN
                        Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Wrong.

           Eddie SLAMS Finn in the mouth, dropping him to the deck.  He 
           pulls the gun from Finn’s coat and tosses it into the water.

                                 FINN
                        How?

                                 EDDIE
                        Does it matter?

           Finn spits blood, it all sinking in.  
                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 FINN
                        It was you she was with.
                     (looks up at Eddie)
                        She was always with you.

           Eddie presses the gun to his head, not wanting to hear it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Shut up!

           Finn doesn’t resist, waiting for the bullet.

                                 FINN
                        You won.  You always won.

                        fuck are you waiting for!?

                                 EDDIE
                        I could have put a bullet in your 
                        head with five minutes planning.  

                                 FINN
                        What do you want.

                                 EDDIE
                        What do I want?  What do you think 
                        I’ve been doing.  I want to absolve 
                        you.

           He KICKS Finn hard in the gut, doubling him over to his knees.  
           Eddie looms over him, gun in hand, like God over Man.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m hearing confession tonight.  I 
                        want to hear you say it.  Give me 
                        your confession.  And I go.  

           Finn looks up, surprised at this.  And that surrender begins 
           to turn into something else.  A small, bloody grin begins to 
           form.  He has this left.

                                 FINN
                        Fuck you.

           Eddie is troubled now.  Here he is the victor on every level -- 
           but he can’t see it.  Not without this.

                                 EDDIE
                        Say it.

           Eddie shoves the gun against Finn’s temple, losing control.  
           Finn takes the pain -- and spots the FIREAXE he discarded.

                                 FINN
                        Fuck.  You.

                        Say it!

           Suddenly from inside the cabin: Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

           INT. YACHT, CABIN

           Molly is slamming the lockbox into the window, money 
           fluttering into the air like confetti.  The glass splinters.

           EXT. YACHT, AFT

           In this brief moment of distraction, Finn snatches the axe and 
           swings--

           Eddie dives back, falling hard -- his gun goes skittering 
           across the dock.

           He rolls as the axe CRUNCHES down where he was.  

           Finn jerks it free, clipping Eddie’s head.  Eddie slips in his 
           own blood, dazed.  

           Finn stands tall, looking down at him, axe in hand.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Girardi and Fisk floor it, along with several other NYPD cars, 
           wailers on.  Girardi on his phone.

                                 GIRARDI
                        Where the fuck is my SWAT?  I don’t 
                        care.  Get ‘em down there now!  And 
                        Port Authority!  Now!

           EXT. YACHT, AFT

           Finn swings -- but Eddie catches it and charges, slamming him 
           against the cabin.

           They struggle for the axe, eye to eye.  Finn headbutts Eddie, 
           sends him reeling.

           Eddie dodges as the axe SMASHES through the railing, kicks 
           Finn in the knee, and rushes him, the axe still embedded in 
           the side.

           This is a bloody one, there are no traded barbs or wise-ass 
           remarks -- these are just two bodies locked in mutual 
           destruction.  Noses CRUNCH and ribs SPLINTER and chipped teeth 
           are spat or swallowed as the boat bucks from side to side.

           arm, it soon becomes evident --

           He is losing.

           INT. YACHT, CABIN

           Molly pounds away at the thick, cracking glass, listening to 
           the struggle outside.

           EXT. YACHT, AFT

           Eddie swings wild, and Finn makes him pay with a crushing 
           punch and a knee to the solar plexus.  Eddie stumbles backward 
           to the floor, landing hard against his injured arm.  

           Finn turns his attention to Eddie’s gun.  He staggers toward 
           it onto the

           DOCK

           Eddie’s knife flies and -- THUNK -- imbeds in Finn’s hamstring 
           He collapses with a scream.

           Eddie rises, back on the boat.  He cradles his arm in his 
           shirt and picks up the GASCAN.  He steps onto the dock.

                                 EDDIE
                        We’re not done.  

           The SLAMMING of the strongbox against the window continues.

           Distant SIRENS approaching.

           But Eddie hears nothing.  He tips the gascan and walks slowly 
           towards Finn, leaving a trail of fuel in his path.

           He stands over Finn and empties it in a pool around him, 
           discards the can.  All the while, Finn trying in vain to crawl 
           to the gun.

                                 EDDIE
                        You can end this, Finn.  You can give 
                        me what’s kept me going the fifteen 
                        years you took and you go your way, 
                        I’ll go mine.  Just say it.  Confess 
                        what you did and ask my forgiveness.  

           He PUNCHES Finn.  Finn’s head snaps back, a dark grin 
           spreading on his face.

           Eddie slugs him again.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ask me!
                                     (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)           Finn lets out an unhinged laugh.

           Eddie punches him again and again and again.  Finn’s laughter 
           increases to a maniacal pitch.

                                 EDDIE
                        WHAT’S SO FUCKING FUNNY?

           Finn looks at him through the pulp that was once his face.

                                 FINN
                        I spent my whole life trying to be 
                        you...but you became me.

           IN THE YACHT CABIN

           Molly finally sends the strongbox SMASHING through the 
           porthole glass.

           DOCK

           Eddie goes silent, looking down at Finn’s wretched figure.  
           Eerily calm.  He stands tall -- his ZIPPO now in hand.

                                 EDDIE
                     (voice flat, this is it)
                        Beg me you miserable fucking rat.

           Finn looks at him with lunatic mirth.  This has become a truly 
           grotesque display.

                                 FINN
                     (sings)
                        There’s a darkness on the edge of 
                        town...

           Close on Eddie: the whites of his eyes ignite with ORANGE 
           FLAME -- he’s lit his zippo.

           HIS HAND -- is about to release it when--

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        EDDIE!!

           He freezes -- the TENDONS in the back of his hand rigid.  
           Molly stands several feet away on the dock.

                                 EDDIE
                        Stay away.

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t do it.

                                 EDDIE
                        This has nothing to do with you.  
                        Stay.  Away.

           The FLAME flickers.  Flashes from the past intercut through 
           following...

           -- Young Eddie at the Rose, palming the ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 MOLLY
                        Eddie.  Listen to me.  You can stop 
                        this.  You can come back.

                                 EDDIE
                        That isn’t my name.

           She comes closer.

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes, it is.  It always has been.

           -- Molly weeping and beating the partition as Eddie walks away 
           from her after the conviction.

                                 EDDIE
                        You don’t know anything about me.

                                 MOLLY
                        I know that man is still in there 
                        somewhere.  And he’s the strongest 
                        man I’ve ever met.

           -- Eddie twitching on the end of the noose -- his suicide 
           attempt.

           -- Eddie savagely throttling the Skinhead on the cellblock 
           floor.

           -- Eddie scraping hash marks into his cell wall -- five years.

           -- Young Eddie on the pitcher’s mound, grinning and winking at 
           Molly in the stands.

           Eddie wavers, compensates with rage.

                                 EDDIE
                        He took it all, nothing is taking 
                        this!  Now stay away or so fucking 
                        help me...

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ve all lost so much.  And we’ve 
                        all made our choices.  But as long as 
                        you’re alive your soul is your own.  
                        You’re right -- nothing can take 
                        that.

           And suddenly a thing flickers across Eddie’s face for the 
           first time in years: fear.
                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)

           -- Jimmy Morgan embracing Eddie and Molly at their engagement 
           party.

           -- Eddie carving more hash marks in the wall -- ten years.

           -- Eddie lurching forward in the prison hospital, torn 
           stitches BLEEDING through his gown.

           -- Molly and Eddie fucking in the warehouse office.

           -- Jackie’s body in a pool of spreading blood.

           -- The decoy warehouse Mike sent Finn’s crew to.  Dark and 
           silent as a mausoleum.  TICK.  It explodes in a massive 
           conflagration.

           -- With all the hate in him, Eddie scrapes a final hash mark 
           into the wall -- 15 years.

           And Eddie is coming apart, the last particles of his humanity 
           colliding with so many years dedicated to nothing but this 
           hate.

                                 EDDIE
                        Can’t you fucking see I need this?  
                        Without this there’s...nothing left.

           She draws up to him.

                                 MOLLY
                        I love you.  I’ll never stop loving 
                        you.  But I’ve given nearly half my 
                        life to a monster and I can’t do that 
                        again. 

           He looks into her eyes.  She puts a hand to his face.  He 
           FLINCHES but she lays it there.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who are you?

           THE ZIPPO: a cold wind blows it out.

           BLACK.

                                                  LATER 

           Finn lies there, not a friend in the world.  Sounds of SIRENS.  
           Blue lights flash in the distance.  

           He pushes himself up and picks up Eddie’s gun.

                                                   LATER

           car, gun ready.  The dock is empty, the yacht floating several 
           yards away, unmanned.  

           They look at each other quizzically, holster their weapons.  
           Girardi produces the file folder.

           EXT. CITY - NIGHT

           Blue pre-dawn, day creeping in the east behind the dark 
           buildings...

           INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The view from Finn’s window.

           Finn sits on the floor, clothes soaked through with blood.  A 
           bottle of whisky, Eddie’s gun, and old pictures scattered 
           before him.  

           His voice comes out slow and in barely a whisper.  A song: 

                                 FINN
                        Molly, my Irish Molly, my sweet 
                        acushla dear...

           ON THE STREET

           Tires SCREECH to a halt.

           CONDO

           Finn takes a big drink.  Lost in all those memories.

                                 FINN
                        I’m fairly off my trolley, my Irish 
                        Molly, when you are near...

           IN THE STAIRWELL

           Heavy boots storm up the flights.

           CONDO

           Finn looks up at the door.

                                 FINN
                        Springtime you know is ringtime, come 
                        dear, now don’t be slow...

           HALLWAY

           SWAT team bursts out of the stairwell door and down the 
           hall...
                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                   (cid:13)           INT. YACHT, CABIN - NIGHT (QUICK FLASHBACK)

           Girardi kneels before the empty false compartment, glances at 
           the file folder.

           INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           NOISE out in the hall.  Finn raises the gun at the door --

                                 FINN
                        Change your name, go out with game, 
                        begorrah wouldn’t I do the same...

           Then pulls it back under his chin.  Finger tight on the 
           trigger.  Shaking...

           INT. YACHT, CABIN - NIGHT (QUICK FLASHBACK)

           Girardi removes a panel.  On the floor next to him is the open 
           file folder: a BLUEPRINT of the yacht with an X drawn over 
           this spot.

           FLASH: 

           Of Eddie in prison, on the phone with Molly just after his 
           conviction.

                                 EDDIE
                        Innocent, guilty -- It doesn’t matter-  

           BACK TO SCENE

           Girardi pulls out the SATCHEL Jackie gave Eddie, unzips it and

           CLICK.

           Finn gasps.  He lowers the gun and ejects the clip -- EMPTY.

           A pathetic CHUCKLE escapes Finn.  He looks back up, just as 
           the SWAT team bursts through the front door, surging in at 
           him.

           They see him, a bloody sobbing wreck, and stop.

           The SWAT LEADER looks down on him with a mixture of contempt 
           and pity.

           EXT. CONDO - DAWN

           Surrounded by NYPD vehicles, Finn is wheeled out on a 
           stretcher. 

           Girardi and Fisk, standing by grabbing a smoke, make eye 
           contact with him -- going out with the feeblest of whimpers.

                                 AGENT FISK
                        Fuck-- never thought I’d say this, 
                        but you almost have to feel sad for 
                        the guy.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Yeah...

           As the stretcher passes Girardi sticks out his foot and trips 
           the EMT, who stumbles forward, roughly jostling Finn.

           Girardi looks at Fisk: Sue me.

           The sun rises.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM, BATHROOM - DAY

           Eddie, shirtless, stares at his own freshly shaven reflection.  
           Faucet running.
                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                      (cid:13)

Lets it drip off.  Then more, 
           rubbing it.  

           Harder.  And harder.  His body quakes with the violence of it.  

           EXT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A dive motor inn on a semi-rural stretch of highway.  Eddie 
           steps out, shaved and dressed.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI (O.S.)
                        Morning.

           Eddie spins to find Girardi with a coffee and newspaper on the 
           walkway.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Sorry.  Didn’t mean startle you.  
                        Start to a hell of a day, huh?

           Eddie’s tense, but remains calm.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        For some, at least.

           BRIEF FLASH:

           PRISON.  Finn shuffles into his cell -- and freezes, eyes

           He fishes for something in his pocket.

                        Or whatever you want to call it. 

           Hands Eddie the cigarette burn photo of himself and Finn -- oh 
           fuck.

           Tense beat.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Relax, cowboy.  I think we’ve both 
                        seen enough misery for one lifetime.  
                        I’d say we’ve both earned...a 
                        vacation.

                        Thank you.  Good to meet you, Eddie.

           He heads for his car.

                                 AGENT GIRARDI
                        Yeah, a hell of a day.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who was that?

                                 EDDIE
                        Nobody.  You ready to go?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.

           A subtle but loving touch between them.  As they move to a 
           car, Eddie drops the photo in a trash can.

           BRIEF FLASH:

           Back to prison -- Finn stands staring at 15 HASHMARKS carved 
           into the wall.  EDDIE’S CELL.

           Five SHADOWS suddenly fall over him, but he doesn’t move.  
           Behind him loom two WISEGUYS and three other GANGSTERS he had 
           put away 15 years ago -- SHIVS in hand.

           BACK TO SCENE

           LINGER ON: the photo.  In the background, Eddie and Molly get 
           in the car, start it up, and head down a long stretch of 
           highway.

           In and out of focus, the moments before that photo years ago -- 
           Eddie in his graduation gown joking around with Finn among 
           other graduates.  Molly behind the camera.

                        What’s the matter, Finny?  I heard 
                        little Jenny Byrne said you love 
                        having your picture taken.

                        Hey, that was her idea.  One time.

           They chuckle.  Eddie grabs him.

                                 EDDIE
                        You sure you want this ugly mug in 
                        here, baby, because I can do this 
                        without him.

                                 EDDIE
                        Alright, alright, let’s give her one.  
                        You and me.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)

                        smile.

           They finally go still and smile, arms around their shoulders.  
           Brothers.

                                 FINN
