           FADE IN:

           INT. CINEPLEX - NIGHT

           The run-down movie theaters are empty, the screens dark.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O)
                        Hello and thank you for calling 
                        Movietown Four, Oxford Valley.

           The gaudy pink neon lights of the concession stand blink off. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        The following are movie times for 
                        April third. “Velocity”, R. Four-

           An EMPLOYEE cleans a popcorn popper while ANOTHER EMPLOYEE 
           sweeps the stained carpet. Both wear teal polyester uniforms.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)

           INT. CINEPLEX OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The voice belongs to MADY WRIGHT, 18, annoyed with and 
           beleaguered by life. She wears no makeup and a frizzy 
           ponytail peeks out from beneath her backward visor. Mady’s no 
           supermodel, but she’s by no means unattractive. As she reads 
           from a doodled-on notebook into the phone, MR. FISH, a 
           starched and gangly older man, counts money at a dented metal 
           desk, and a plump thirty-something, LESLIE, eats a hoagie. 
           The room is very neat and very taupe.

                                 MADY
                        “Donkey’s a Daddy”, rated G. One

                        and seven o’clock. 

           Mady flips the page. Her uniform has gunk on the sleeve.

                                 MADY
                        If you have any questions about the 
                        Movietown Four Cineplex, directions 
                        or any other matters, please go 
                        fuck yourself and eat my --

           Mr. Fish looks up. Mady stares at the page, then slams down 
           the phone and sprints out of the office. Leslie chuckles.
           INT. THEATER TWO - LATER

           NICK, 19, a muscly guy with holes in his “Pennsbury High 
           School” T-shirt, uses a leaf blower to blast trash across the 
           floor. He’s obnoxious, but there is something magnetic in his 
           vulgarity. Mady storms in and pushes him in the back. He 
           spins, grins and switches off the blower. 

                                 MADY
                        Douchebag!

                                 NICK
                        Mad Dog! How are ya?

                                 MADY
                        “Go fuck yourself and eat my 
                        asshole”? 

                                 NICK
                        Bend over.

                                 MADY
                        Do you know how long those take?!

                                 NICK
                        You actually read it onto the 
                        thing? Sweet. I spent like an hour 
                        trying to match your handwriting.

                                 MADY 
                        That’s not scary or anything.

                                 NICK
                        The only thing scary is how fucking 
                        awesome I am.

           Mady grunts, turns and fumes up the aisle. Nick follows. 

                                 NICK
                             (sincerely)
                        Wait, Mady.

           She turns and he switches the blower on, pointing it at her 
           face. She falls down, then rises, seething, and tackles him 
           into a pile of trash. Nick easily rolls on top of her. 

                                 NICK
                        Haven’t exercised in a while, huh? 

           Mady violently pushes him off, brushing popcorn and licorice 
           out of her hair. She punches him in the arm, hard.
                                 NICK
                        I think a little pot belly is sexy.

                                 MADY
                        I don’t have a pot belly, asshole. 

                                 NICK
                        You know you want me.

                                 MADY
                        I want you like I wanna jump in a 
                        pool of sharks with chum stapled to 
                        my ass, idiot.

           She gets up and storms out. He smirks after her.

           INT. MADY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The foyer is decorated with needlepoint roosters. Mady enters 
           and the floor creaks loudly. She throws her head back in 
           disgust as loud, ferocious barking erupts in the kitchen. 

                                 MADY
                        Shh! Daffodil, Tulip, it’s just me.

           MADY’S MOM shuffles into the hallway in a flannel nightgown. 
           MADY’S DAD, a bearded lumberjack of a man, appears and heads 
           into the bathroom, apparently unaware of the commotion. 

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Madeline! It’s one o’clock! Now 
                        they’re going to whine all night 
                        again. Can’t you be quiet for once?

                                 MADY
                        Sorry Mom, the floor is loud and --

           Her Mom leans over a gate that barricades the vicious, unseen 
           dogs in the kitchen. She speaks in a high-pitched voice.

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        My poopies, did mean ol’ Mady wake 
                        you up? Do you want some biskies?

           Mady trudges up the stairs.

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The walls of the tiny, messy room are plastered with movie 
           posters like “Amelie”, “Say Anything” and “Super Troopers”. 
           A stuffed Alf is positioned doggy-style behind a Cabbage 
           Patch doll. Mady plops in bed and shuts her eyes. 

           LATER

           Mady breathes heavily, sweating. Her hand clutches the 
           bedspread. The alarm clock blares and her eyes snap open.

                                 MADY
                        Fuck.

           Mady sits up, looking like she’s been tumbling under the 
           wheels of a bus. She gets out of bed, walks by the mirror, 
           stops, steps back and inspects her stomach closely in the 
           reflection. She plops down and does some sit-ups.

           INT. MADY’S CAR - LATER 

           Wet-haired, Mady listens to old school punk music in her shit-
           brown Chevy Celebrity. She parks, hooks a bungee cord from 
           the steering wheel to the brake pedal and grabs her bag.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           A typical suburban PA high school. The huge hallways teem 
           with whitebread kids milling around their puke green lockers. 
           As Mady opens her lock, EMILY, 18, Caucasian, calm and 
           conservatively attired, appears. 

                                 EMILY
                        What’s crack-a-lackin’, home slice?

           Emily and Mady perform an absurdly complicated handshake.

                                 MADY
                        Not much, my Nubian sister.

                                 EMILY
                        You remember a shirt for gym?

                                 MADY
                        Shit. 

           Emily reaches into her bag and hands Mady a folded T-shirt. 

                                 MADY
                        Thanks, you saved my ass. How bad 
                        would it suck to fail gym? 

                                 EMILY
                        Did I tell you I’m failing gym?
                                 MADY
                        Yikes... Lucky you don’t need 
                        grades, Em. You’re hot with big 
                        boobs. You’ll marry some rich dude 
                        and rub elbows with the wealthy.

                                 EMILY
                        I bet their elbows are oh-so-nice 
                        and smooth.

           They head down the hall. When people walk toward them, Emily 
           and Mady are the ones that get out of the way.

                                 EMILY
                        Alas, I’m going to die alone in a 
                        house with fifty cats.

                                 MADY
                        Hey, I’m the boobless one. Wanna 
                        come visit me on Crazy Cat Lady 
                        Lane? I’ll be the one throwing 
                        kittens at the neighborhood kids.

                                 EMILY
                        Shut up, your juglets are perfect.

                                 MADY
                        If you like divots where the 
                        breasts should be.

           A young-looking mullet-ed nerd, Rob, joins them.

                                 ROB
                        You have nice boobies, Mads.

           Mady fixes his errant shirt collar, then cuffs his head.

                                 ROB
                        Hey, I calls ‘em like I sees ‘em, 
                        Perky Town.

           A wad of wet paper towel whizzes by, barely missing Rob’s 
           head, and hits the locker next to them. As they turn to see 
           where it came from, Mady gets wailed in the cheek with 
           another wad. It slowly slides down her face and some JOCKS 
           nearby laugh shamelessly. She wipes her face with her shirt.

                                 ROB
                        Sorry, Mads, I think that was meant 
                        for me. Gotta go, ladies.
           Emily and Rob do a speedy, truncated version of the handshake 
           and he steps onto a swiftly-moving A/V cart, high-fiving the 
           NERD driving it. Mady gives the jocks a long angry look, then 
           she and Emily walk off. After a step, a giant wad of paper 
           towel hits Mady in the back of the head. 

                                 BURLY JOCK
                        Suck it, popcorn girl!

           Mady angrily tries to extricate paper towel from her hair.

                                 MADY
                        I can’t wait ‘til Rob’s rich and 
                        those mongoloids work at 7-11. 

                                 EMILY
                        Ignore them. You busy tonight?

                                 MADY
                        I have to work. Shocking, I know. 

           Two CHEERLEADERS trot by carrying a “SENIOR PROM” banner. 
           Mady and Emily watch the giant letters go by.

                                 EMILY
                        That guy still trying to get into 
                        your pants?

                                 MADY
                        Nick? Yeah. Like I’d even consider 
                        it. My first should be with a guy 
                        who looks at me, in all my pasty, 
                        beached-whale glory and thinks “I 
                        love being with her”, not “Sex, I’m 
                        getting sex! Penis in, penis out, 
                        now let’s get the hell out of here 
                        before the she-beast wakes up.” 

           Mady finally gets a chunk of the paper towel out of her hair 
           and flings it, hitting KAREN, a shy-looking girl, in the eye.

                                 MADY
                        Oh, shit! Sorry, Karen!

                                 KAREN
                        I just got Lasik! Oh God, it burns!

           Mady and Emily slink into their classroom.
           INT. CONCESSION STAND - NIGHT

           SIMON, 17, fiddles with his register. He is tall and pale 
           with a shy smile and a sweet demeanor. FINN, 17, a small, 
           slightly effeminate guy with soap opera hair, eats from a cup 
           of bright yellow popcorn. Mady writes on a clipboard.

                                 SIMON
                        Shit, my register’s flipping out.

                                 FINN 
                        I have a fresh batch of death here, 
                        Mads. If you can handle it.

           Mady takes his cup and eats a couple of kernels. She moans.

                                 MADY
                        Quality salt distribution. How much 
                        oil did you put on this puppy?

                                 FINN
                        About ten Big Macs’ worth.

                                 MADY
                        You have a gift, my friend.

           Mady nudges Simon away from the faulty register. She clears 
           her throat and Simon and Finn turn around. 

                                 MADY
                        Oh, more from my parents today. The 
                        new thing is if I get home after 
                        1:30 I’m not allowed in the house.

                                 SIMON
                        What?! What are you supposed to do?

           Mady pushes a couple of buttons, then hits the corner of the

                        ya later, studs.

           Mady grabs the clipboard and leaves. Simon stares after her.

           Simon tilts his head, confused.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Nick and a red-haired frat boy-type, MIKE, exit a theater. 
           They each carry a “Jerry’s Kids” cup with a few singles and 
           coins inside. Mike reaches in and pulls out the bills. 

                                 NICK
                        What the fuck, dude?

                                 MIKE
                        What do ‘tards do with cash? Run 
                        around chewin’ it, making ‘tard

                        Put it back.

           Mike looks at Nick with a half-smile. When Nick just stares, 
           he stops smiling and puts the money back in the container.

           INT. BACK CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Mady sits on the floor, counting candy. Two PRETTY GIRLS walk 
           by, gabbing loudly. They can’t see Mady.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        I saw her when I came in. She’s 
                        here, like, every day. So pathetic.

                                 PRETTY GIRL TWO
                        If all you can afford is a car the 
                        color of feces, you should get a 
                        new job, am I right?

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Ha ha. She’s probably eating a 
                        whole barrel of nachos back there. 
                                 PRETTY GIRL TWO
                        You’re so mean! I think it’s kinda 
                        sad. I mean, has she ever even 
                        hooked up with someone?

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        Yeah right.  

           They flounce out of earshot. Mady waits, then peeks over the 
           counter. The girls feverishly make out with two studly guys. 
           Mady watches miserably, then sits. Nick knocks on the counter 
           and peers over at her with the “Jerry’s Kids” cups.

                                 NICK
                        Yo, hoebag, can you put these with 
                        the -- are you okay? You look like 
                        Bobby McFerrin raped your grandma.

           She takes the cups from him and goes into the kitchen.

           INT. BOX OFFICE - LATER

           The box office is a tinted glass rectangle with ticket 
           windows in the front and a door to the lobby in back. 
           SHELLEY, 19, pretty with short, precisely-gelled spiky hair, 
           sits on a chair near the window. Mady slumps on the floor.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Fucking skanks! Where are they?!

                                 MADY
                        Easy there, Sugar Gay Lesbo. The 
                        skanks make a valid point. If my 
                        own parents can barely tolerate me, 
                        why should I expect anyone else to?

           Mady leans her head back against the wall. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Ugh, your pity parties are so DULL. 
                        Tell me more about your sex dreams. 
                        In steamy, sweat-drenched detail. 

           Shelley makes porn music sounds. 

                                 MADY
                        They’re not really about sex, 
                        hornball. They represent a need to 
                        be close to someone. Connect. Bond.

           Shelley gives her a long look. 
                                 MADY
                        Okay, okay, they’re about sex, too. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        I knew it! You little slut!

                                 MADY
                        Gotta love that double standard. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Fine, wanting a big ol’ bratwurst 
                        in your nether-regions doesn’t make 
                        you a slut... It makes you a whore.

                                 MADY
                        I want both. That’s my point. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Slut and whore? Fine, slore. Just 
                        get it over with. Ripping the ol’ 
                        hymen isn’t that magical, trust me.

                                 MADY
                        Graphic... Well, I’m torn.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Pun pun pun pun!

                                 MADY
                        Spaz. First of all, I don’t want to 
                        be naked in front of anyone. Ever.

                                 SHELLEY
                        I always wear socks.

                                 MADY
                        Nice visual. Thanks for that.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Argyle socks.

                                 MADY
                        Kinky.
                             (sighs)
                        I’m wasting so much energy on this! 
                        Talking about sex, dreaming about 
                        sex, stressing out about sex, wow, 
                        how many times did I just say sex?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Quite a few. Your point?
                                 MADY
                        Maybe, if I just went out and sated 
                        the biological urge, I could dump 
                        the ‘first time’ stress and focus 
                        on the actual important stuff.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Whoa, what are you saying, slore?

           Mady sits up straight and speaks dramatically.

                                 MADY
                        I’m gonna do it, Shelley. On my 
                        terms and with a worthy male, of 
                        course, but I’m gonna do it. I’m 
                        going to have the sexual relations!

                                 SHELLEY
                        She declared, reminding us why she 
                        was a virgin in the first place.

                                 MADY
                        And soon. I’m getting sick of... 
                        helping myself.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Hey, don’t knock paddling the pink 
                        kayak. I do ten-a-day’s sometimes.

                                 MADY
                        How?! Even with Ryan Reynolds, 
                        naked, feeding me Pop-Tarts, the 
                        best I could do is five or six. 

                                 SHELLEY
                             (raises a fist)
                        I rule.

           An OLD LADY squints into the window. Nick is behind her with 
           a mop handle between his legs, pretending it’s his penis.

                                 OLD LADY
                        One senior citizen, please.

                                 SHELLEY
                        What movie would you like to see?

                                 OLD LADY
                        I’d like one senior citizen ticket.

                                 SHELLEY
                        For which movie, ma’am?
                                 OLD LADY
                        ONE TICKET!

           Shelley prints up a ticket for “Lust & Guts”. As the old lady 
           shuffles into the lobby, Nick trails her with his “penis” 
           erect. She turns around and he quickly goes back to mopping. 
           An obese bald guy, COURTESY CUP MAN, waddles toward the box.

                                 MADY
                        Heads, the Courtesy Cup Man cometh. 

                                 SHELLEY
                             (to Courtesy Cup Man)
                        Can I help you?

                                 COURTESY CUP MAN
                        One for Velocity, please.

           Shelley puts his change down and withdraws her hand quickly.

                                 SHELLEY 
                        Thanks. Enjoy your movie.

           They watch him enter the lobby, walk to the pay phone and 
           insert some coins. Mady looks over at Nick, who pretends to 
           masturbate his mop. The other loitering USHERS crack up. The 
           box office phone rings and Mady picks up.

                                 LESLIE (O.S.)
                        Fish alert.

                                 MADY
                             (to Shelley)
                        Gotta go.

           Mady hangs up, waves to the security camera and hurriedly 
           exits the box. The old lady returns to the window.

                                 OLD LADY
                        This isn’t what I asked for! 
                             (throws ticket at Shelley)
                        Were you even listening to me?!

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Fish, who walks as if he has a deep wedgie, catches Mady 
           trying to rush behind the concession stand.

                                 MR. FISH
                        Mady, stay behind the stand! And 
                        reprimand Finn for eating popcorn.
                                 MADY
                        Sure thing, Mr. Fish. 

           Mr. Fish enters the... 

           BOX OFFICE

           and turns to spy. Through the tinted glass he sees Mady pull 
           Finn aside, talking angrily and pointing her finger at him. 
           Mr. Fish, pleased, turns around.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

                                 MADY
                        I will not stand for you having 
                        such thick, luxurious hair any 
                        longer! You make me some nuclear 
                        death corn right now!

           Finn salutes and heads off. Mady shoves a handful of popcorn 
           in her mouth, walks up to Simon and chews, open-mouthed, in 
           his ear. He doesn’t flinch. Courtesy Cup Man walks up.

                                 COURTESY CUP MAN
                        Could I please have a courtesy cup?

                             (places cup on counter)
                        Sure. 

                                 MADY
                             (to Simon, still chewing)
                        Does this annoy you?

           Courtesy Cup Man ambles off toward the theaters.

                                 SIMON
                        No, it’s great. Do continue.

           JOE, a tall, possibly heroin-addicted employee, walks by with 
           his uniform shirt wrapped around his head. His naked chest 
           sports crosses of black tape over his nipples and his stomach 
           has “I LIKE BAGELS” written on it in Sharpie.

                                 MADY
                        Hey, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Hey guys.

           A MAN IN A SUIT knocks on the counter behind them.
                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        Hello?!

                                 MADY
                        Sorry, sir, what can I get for you?

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        What do you have with no fat or 
                        calories?

                                 MADY
                        Uh... diet soda?

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        What the hell? What kind of fatass 
                        place are you running here?! Fine, 
                        just give me a thing of nachos. 

           Mady looks confused, then hands the man his nachos. He shoves 
           some in his mouth, cheese dripping down his chin, and leaves.

                                 MADY

                        Shouldn’t they be happy?

                        Yeah. Doesn’t mean they are.

                                 MADY
                        No, they act like they’re in hell, 
                        being prodded with pitchforks and 
                        chased by swarms of bees.

                                 SIMON
                        What?

                                 MADY
                        I don’t like bees.

                                 SIMON
                        Oh... kay.

           INT. MADY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mady stands in the foyer, holding mail, staring at a bill.  

                                 MADY
                        Crap.
                                 MADY’S MOM
                        What’s that?

                                 MADY
                        The car repair place is threatening 
                        to go to a collection agency if I 
                        don’t pay part of my bill, but if I 
                        pay, I won’t be able to buy gas to 
                        get to work to pay the rest of it.  

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        You’ll figure out something. Did my 
                        Birdwatcher’s Bi-Weekly come today? 
                        They’re supposed to have a superb 
                        piece on the African Barn Swallow.

                                 MADY
                        Gee, thanks, Mom. When I’m thirty 
                        and still living here because I 
                        couldn’t afford tuition, are you 
                        and Dad going to charge me rent?

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Don’t be a brat. A lot of people 
                        are much worse off than you are.

           Mady clumps up the stairs.

                                 MADY
                        That would be a “yes”.

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mady sits at her desk, which is piled with bills and papers. 
           She tries to focus on homework, but glances at the time and 
           puts down her pen. She slumps, putting her face in her hands. 

           INT. CINEPLEX BREAK ROOM - LATER

           The place is filthy, crowded with a table, a couch and some 
           beat-up lockers. Mady eats from a Styrofoam container. Nick 
           ambles up and massages her shoulders. 

                                 NICK
                        Damn, you’re tense. Whatcha eatin’?

                                 MADY
                        It’s white rice with soy sauce.

                                 NICK
                        What are you, a Chink now?
                                 MADY
                        Racism. Awesome. As much as I’d 
                        love to be up to my neck in 
                        macadamia nuts, I happen to be 
                        broke, and this happens to be sixty 
                        cents at Happy Fun Smile Wok Place.

           She begins to enjoy the massage, despite herself. As she 
           relaxes, she makes a contented sound. He arches an eyebrow.

                                 NICK
                        Just imagine what else I’m good at. 

                                 MADY
                             (snaps out of her reverie)
                        No.

                                 NICK
                        If you’re so hard up for cash, I 
                        can take you out for dinner and a 
                        screw. A lot of ladies have been 
                        happily satisfied with my à la 
                        mode, if you know what I mean. 

                                 MADY
                        Yeah right.

           He tosses his uniform shirt into a locker.

                                 NICK
                        Your loss, sweet tits.

                                 MADY
                        Sweet tits?

                                 NICK
                        I was gonna go with “no tits”, 
                        since you wear such baggy shit, but 
                        take off the top, I’ll size ‘em up.

                                 MADY
                        You take off yours first.

                                 NICK
                        Really?

           Mady nods and Nick pulls off his T-shirt without hesitation. 
           His top half is chiseled and hairless. Mady’s eyes widen.

                                 NICK
                        Now you.
                                 MADY
                        Do you shave your chest?

                                 NICK
                        I wax. Get to the strippin’, woman.

                                 MADY
                        Wow, you’re so... gay. But thanks 
                        for the show, chump.

                                 NICK
                        Cocktease! Does this even out the 
                        recording thing? I am half nude. 

                                 MADY
                        Fine. Feel free to re-clothe now.

                                 NICK
                        Why? Am I making you hot, baby?

           Nick rubs his nipples and makes sex faces. Mady chokes on her 
           rice, laughing, and gets up.

                                 MADY
                        Stop, I’m gonna puke!

                                 NICK
                        Ooh, yeah. You wanna see my O-face, 
                        baby? Oh, oh, oh.

           Simon walks in and sees Nick rubbing his nips. Everyone 
           freezes, then Mady runs out, coughing.

                                 NICK
                        How ya doin’, Simon? 

                                 SIMON
                        Okay. You?

                                 NICK
                        Fine, fine. 
                             (long pause)
                        Well, see ya later.

           Nick slowly lowers his hands from his nipples and exits.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Rob and Emily loiter by the concession stand.
                                 MADY
                        I can’t wait to get out of this 
                        piece of shit town.

                                 EMILY
                        Thanks a lot.

                                 MADY
                        I’ll miss you guys, but come on. 
                        College means no parents, no high 
                        school jerk-offs and no asshole 
                        customers. Sweet, sweet freedom.

                                 EMILY
                        You still have four months ’til you 
                        spoon out of Shawshank, Dufresne. 
                        What are we gonna do about prom? 
                        Mom keeps bugging me about timeless 
                        memories and all that horse shit.

                                 ROB
                        You ladies could be my prom harem.

           Rob points and makes cheesy clicking sounds with his tongue.

                                 MADY
                        You really want to spend a night 
                        with the jerks who go to our 
                        school? Not to mention the dancing.
                             (shudders, repulsed)
                        I say fuck it. Let’s have an anti-
                        prom instead. A slumber party, or a 
                        chick flick marathon or something. 

                                 EMILY
                        Or we can start buying cats for our 
                        inevitable solitary deaths.

                                 MADY
                        Or we could do that.

                                 EMILY
                        Eh, I guess I’m down. We can buy 
                        some pouffy thrift store dresses, 
                        eat junk and watch movies. We’ll 
                        give Rob a manicure.

                                 ROB
                        I said I’m not doing that again.

           Emily notices a group of ushers ogling a hot girl.
                                 EMILY
                        Any of those broom jockeys Nick?

                             (looks over)
                        The one smacking the imaginary ass.

           Nick is, indeed, smacking an imaginary ass.

                                 EMILY
                        He’s cute, Mads. In an “I’m gonna 
                        wrestle a gator and then take you 
                        to the Sizzler” kind of way.

                                 MADY
                        Sadly, he’d probably be proud of 
                        that description.

                                 EMILY
                        We better go. Enjoy unintentionally 
                        seducing Señor Assy-Smacks.

                                 MADY
                        I am quite the seductress.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Mady bends over, cleaning the front of a display case. Her 
           huge underwear is visible, riding up her back. Nick watches.

                                 NICK
                        Pretty sweet pair of granny panties 
                        you’re rockin’, Mad Dog. Do those 
                        undies go up to your neck or just 
                        the armpits?

           She gets up, flustered, and adjusts her pants.

                                 MADY
                        Shut up.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, I’m not knockin’ it. You like 
                        comfort. It’s hot, in an old lady, 
                        really un-hot kind of way.

           INT. BOX OFFICE - LATER 

           Shelley sits in her chair. Mady picks holes in her Converse.
                                 MADY
                        Obviously, the ideal first time 
                        would be a cross between Ryan 
                        Reynolds, The Rock and Stephen 
                        Colbert carrying me to a satin-
                        sheeted bed covered with rose 
                        petals where we’d make passionate 
                        love then fall asleep spooning 
                        amidst a pile of puppies...

                                 SHELLEY
                        Your imagination is a spooky place.

                                 MADY
                        But apparently that’s not feasible.

           Shelley picks up a rubber band ball and quickly throws it at 
           the wall next to Mady. Mady dives and makes a one-handed 
           save. The game continues as they talk, with Shelley pump-
           faking and Mady making most grabs before the ball hits the 
           wall. It’s obvious they’ve played before.

                                 SHELLEY
                        No, it’s not. Pick someone real and 
                        crack your damn poon egg already.

                                 MADY
                        We’re a few steps removed. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Step one: find Nick. Step two: tell 
                        Nick you want little Nick to meet 
                        your cooter. Tah-dah! 

                                 MADY
                        I think my first time should be a 
                        TAD more special than a one-night 
                        stand with a guy who humps 
                        inanimate objects.

           Shelley looks out at the lobby, where Nick sweeps up.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Mads, look at him. You know that 
                        under that tough crust there’s a --

           Shelley launches the rubber band ball. Mady, distracted, 
           doesn’t react in time, and it hits the wall. Shelley cheers.

                                 MADY
                        Cheater!
                                 SHELLEY
                        All’s fair in sex and Band Ball, 
                        loo-zah.

           Mady throws the ball at Shelley, nailing her in the chest.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Ow, my boob! You hit my boob! 

                                 MADY
                        You just said all’s fair, NoHymen 
                        McPlunderedcunty. Wait, was the 
                        crappy first time why you dumped 
                        Pete, or was it the “I like women” 
                        thing?

                                 SHELLEY
                        The real catalyst was actually one 
                        specific incident.

           FLASHBACK - THE SPECIFIC INCIDENT

           Shelley wakes up, groggy. A NONDESCRIPT GUY next to her in 
           bed makes grunting sounds, his eyes closed. She turns and 
           sees him using her hand to masturbate.

           END FLASHBACK

                                 MADY
                        Gross, gross! What did you do?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Pretended to sleep through it and 
                        dumped him that afternoon.

                                 MADY
                        Really?

                                 SHELLEY
                        No, we got married and my hand has 
                        had four of his babies.

                                 MADY
                        See, that’s what I DON’T want.

                                 SHELLEY
                        So, if not the Crusty Humper, who?

                                 MADY
                        Someone who doesn’t make me cringe. 
                        Someone I’d feel comfortable with. 
                        I’m on the prowl for some quality 
                        male tail.
           INT. THEATER THREE - SUNDAY MORNING

           Tired and hungover employees laze in threadbare burgundy 
           seats. Nick naps and Joe sings “Turn On Your Heartlight” as 
           he separates and rubs together two halves of a bagel. Mady 
           wears a Christopher Walken tee and a Phillies hat.

                                 MADY
                        Why do we have to be here butt-ass 
                        early on a Sunday for this?

                                 SHELLEY
                             (eyes closed)
                        Shut up, Guinevere Turner’s giving 
                        me a full body massage.

                                 SIMON
                        Keep dreaming.

                                 SHELLEY
                        I plan on it.

                                 FINN
                        Who’s Guinevere Turner?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Read the credits at the end of that 
                        copy of American Psycho you keep in 
                        the box under the bed, Finny. Oiled-
                        up Christian Bale is in your flog 
                        file, no?

           Mr. Fish enters and the rowdy room gets quiet. 

                                 FINN
                        I am not gay!

           The exclamation echoes and chuckles are heard in response.

                                 MR. FISH
                        Alright people, today I’ll be 
                        showing two videos, one on sexual 
                        harassment and one on sales 
                        techniques. We’re going to have a 
                        sales contest, but I’ll address 
                        that later. First, let’s get to the 
                        sexual harassment.

           The crowd cheers. Mr. Fish frowns and signals the projection 
           booth. A video obviously produced in the 80’s begins to play. 

           VIDEO ON SCREEN
                                 VOICE
                        Sexual harassment is a serious 
                        allegation. Employees must not make 
                        suggestive comments, even jokingly, 
                        as these may be deemed offensive.

           A woman in uniform carries a box of candy. A male employee 
           walks up to her. The acting is terrible.

                                 MALE EMPLOYEE
                        Be careful, Susie. You’re so hot 
                        you might melt that chocolate.

           The actors freeze and a giant red circle with a line through 
           it appears over the scene. 

           IN THE THEATER

           The employees burst out laughing.

                                 NICK

                        Wanna tea-bag my Whoppers, Mady?

           VIDEO ON SCREEN

           The scene changes to an office, where a man in a suit leans 
           close to a female employee in uniform.

                                 SUITED MAN
                        Barbara, you’d go much further here 
                        if you were less uptight. Why don’t 
                        you undo a couple of those buttons?

                                 BARBARA
                        But that’s against the dress code!

                                 SUITED MAN
                        I’m your boss, I make the rules. 
                        Here, let me help you.

           The suited man pulls Barbara’s top three buttons open. The 
           scene freezes and the giant red circle and line appear.

           IN THE THEATER

                                 MADY
                        Sweet Jesus, this is priceless.

           Nick appears behind Mady’s seat. He whispers to her, his lips 
           grazing her ear. She closes her eyes.
                                 NICK
                        Mady, you’d get much further if you 
                        were less uptight. Let me help you. 

           He grabs Mady’s hat and musses up her hair. Mr. Fish stands.

                                 MR. FISH
                        The sales video is next. Pay 
                        attention because these techniques 
                        could help you win the contest.

                                 FINN
                        Well, I just blew a hearty wad of 
                        motivation in my pants.

                                 MADY
                        I wonder what the prize is, like, 
                        thirty bucks? Thirty-seven?

                                 SHELLEY
                        In a row? Try not to suck any dick 
                        on the way to the parking lot!

                                 MADY
                        You complete me. Back in a sec.

           Mady scoots back to Nick’s row. She tries to grab her hat but 
           Nick tosses her into the seat next to him.

                                 MADY 
                        Give it back!

                                 NICK
                        Fine.

           He shoves it on her head backwards. The video begins.

                                 VIDEO TWO (O.S.)
                        For as long as we’ve had products, 
                        we’ve needed people to sell them. 
                        The finer points of sales technique 
                        are our focus in this video. 

           Nick leans over and puts his arm around Mady.

                                 NICK
                        So, when do I get to see the 
                        tittles, Mad Dog?

           VIDEO ON SCREEN

           A toothy actor smiles widely as he performs the techniques. 
           There are unnecessary SLOW MOTION replays and CLOSE-UP shots.
                                 VIDEO TWO
                        Our first technique is called the 
                        peek-a-boo. Tell the customer the 
                        difference in price and volume, 
                        then drop the small into the large.

                        Whatever you’re comfortable with.

                                 MADY

                        Tell the customer the difference in 
                        price, then pull the big cup around 
                        in front of the small one. Sold! 

           IN THE THEATER

           Mr. Fish stands and Mady pushes Nick’s hand off her shoulder. 

                                 MR. FISH
                        The contest starts now and lasts a 
                        month. The prize is three hundred 
                        dollars. Now get to work, people!

           A hush falls over the crowd, then everyone talks at once.

                        the rest of us out for dinner.

                                 MADY
                        You don’t even work concessions.

                        So? Buy me dinner, bitches.
           INT. CONCESSION STAND - LATER

           Mady sweeps the floor. She glances up and sees Nick staring 
           at her. In SLOW MOTION, an EXTREMELY HOT GUY walks around in 
           front of Nick, eclipsing him from view. Mady is completely 
           awestruck by this Adonis in Adidas. The confident newcomer 
           high-fives Mike, who sees Mady drooling and walks him over.

                                 MIKE
                        Mady, this is my buddy Scott. He’s 
                        here for an interview. Can you call 
                        them to buzz him up?

           Mady snaps out of it, spilling dirt on the front of her 
           shirt. She wipes it off, then pushes her hair back, smiling 
           coyly at Scott. A big brown smudge ends up on her forehead.

                                 MADY
                        I’m on my way up, I can walk you.

                        Ew, what is that?

           He points to Mady’s forehead. She hurries into the...

           CINEPLEX KITCHEN

           and looks in the mirror. Finn walks in and gets some ice.

           She wipes off the dirt and goes out to the...

           CINEPLEX LOBBY

           where she and Scott walk together. Nick watches from afar. 
                                 MADY

                        Yeah. We met in first grade. He 
                        dropped his cupcake and I gave him 
                        mine. We’ve been bros ever since.

                        I don’t really get nervous. Except 
                        sometimes at matches.

                                 MADY
                        Oh, what sport do you play?

           She enters her pin code and opens the door. They walk up... 

           THE STAIRS

           and Mady ogles his butt as they ascend. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I practice martial arts. You know, 
                        punching, kicking, breaking boards, 
                        that kind of stuff. 

                                 MADY
                        Like little white jumpsuits and

           PROJECTION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Mady and Scott walk past clicking projectors. Joe treads by 
           with tissue boxes on his feet, wearing a “Freddy Fancy Pants” 
           name tag. Mady walks a step behind Scott, staring. Oblivious, 
           she steps in a trash can, trips over a large canister of film 
           and falls, quickly popping up just before Scott turns around. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Is there a bathroom up here?

                                 MADY
                        Scott someone. He is, no lie, the 
                        most beautiful boy I’ve ever seen.

                                 LESLIE
                        I have to interview him first.

                                 MADY
                        For the love of all things holy, I 
                        will sell you my firstborn child.

                                 LESLIE
                        He’s that good-looking?

           Mady points to her lip.

                                 MADY
                        See that? Drool. He’s so hot I peed 
                        on myself a little bit.

                                 LESLIE
                        Okay, okay. I’ll see what I can do.

                                 MADY
                        Thank you thank you thank you!

           PROJECTION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Mady dashes out of the office, nearly running into Scott. 

                                 MADY
                        Good luck.

                                 SCOTT
                        Thanks.

           She turns, slams face-first into a projector and falls down.

           Mady has a red mark on her forehead. Shelley walks up.
                                 SHELLEY
                        Hey, you wanna see the new Hilary 
                        Duff movie with Mel and I tomorrow?

                                 MADY
                        Yeah, no.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Why not?

           FLASHBACK - MOVIE THEATER - WHY NOT

           Mady gets increasingly depressed as she scans the crowd. An 
           OLD COUPLE kisses sweetly, two HIPPIES gaze deeply into each 
           other’s eyes and a GIRL leans her head on a BOY’s shoulder. 
           Mady sighs and glances at the empty chair to her right, then 
           she looks left, where Shelley and MELISSA are going at it 
           like sex-crazed maniacs, tongues and saliva a-flyin’.   

           END FLASHBACK

                                 MADY
                        Hilary Duff sucks.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Blasphemy! Visiting me today? 

                                 MADY
                        Yeah, I have a double, so I’ll be 
                        barging into your box all day. That 
                        didn’t come out right.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Keep trying to get into my box, 
                        slore.

                                 MADY 
                        Your box is very inviting.

                                 SHELLEY
                        That it is.

           Mady hops the counter, landing behind the concession stand.

                                 MADY
                        Enough of your box. I just made 
                        Leslie hire the hottest guy ever. 
                        He’s sweet, smart, gorgeous and I 
                        almost climaxed looking at him. 
                        Perfect coitus material.
                                 SHELLEY
                        Nice. Well, enjoy your deflowering. 
                        I feel like I should bake you a 
                        cake or something. 

                                 MADY
                        Slow down, Duncan Hymens. See, 
                        ‘cause you said cake, and you talk 
                        about your hymen. God, I’m funny. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Funny like a bus of handicapped 
                        kids on fire.

                                 MADY
                        So, really really funny? This guy 
                        is out of my league. It’s going to 
                        take hard work and finesse to get 
                        him interested. Possibly trickery.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Yes, because what guys DON’T want 
                        is a slice of the tunnel tiramisu. 

           Scott appears, says goodbye to Mike and saunters out of the 
           building. Mady punches Shelley in the shoulder.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Ow! Yes, I saw. A male. Thrilling.

                        Mady, it’s for you. The OB/GYN 
                        wants to talk about your UTI.

                                 MADY
                        So I enjoy the crisp tartness of a 
                        nice cranberry juice. That doesn’t 
                        mean I have a dirty urethra.
                             (takes phone)
                        Hello?

                        Wow.

                                 MADY
                        I know. Well?

                                 MADY
                        Yes! Thank you, Leslie. You’re the 
                        best-est-est-est.

                        I know. You also get to train the 
                        new girl. Her name’s Tia.

                                 MADY
                        Swell. She better not be retarded.

                        Faaan-tastic.

           Mady walks over and opens the door. The girl rubs her head.

                                 MADY
                        Hi. They stay locked until we open. 
                        And... it’s a pull door. It’s safer 
                        to just knock. Let me guess, Tia?

                                 TIA
                        Yeah, how’d you know?

                        I’m psychic.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - LATER

           Mady and Tia walk to the popper, both bored. Nick walks by, 
           blatantly checking out Tia.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, Mad Dog. 
                             (slowly, to Tia)
                        Well hello.

                        Hi.

           Nick walks into a pole as he stares. Mady looks irritated.
                                 MADY
                        This is the popper. You flip this 
                        switch, toss the kernels and salt 
                        in and push the button for oil.

                                 TIA
                        Who is that?

           Tia points at Scott. Mady pauses, staring.

                                 MADY
                        Scott. He’s new. 

                                 TIA
                        He’s gorgeous.

                        almost forgot!

           Mady opens the fridge and pulls out a large plastic 
           container, opening it to reveal some gross hot dogs.

                        That’s the smell of commerce, Tia. 
                        These are the dogs. No one buys 
                        them and we’re not allowed to throw 
                        them out. I call this one Steve. 

           She holds up a slimy dark brown withered moldy hot dog.

                        allergic to the coconut oil we use 
                        here, so sometimes he needs help 
                        with spills or the popper. We have 
                        EpiPens in all the supply closets.

                        I’m in contact with too much, uh...

                                 MADY
                        He has immediate, uncontrollable 
                        diarrhea and vomiting. Then his 
                        throat closes up.

                                 SIMON

                        It’s really not a big deal. I’d 
                        have to be coated with oil or drink 
                        it straight or something to have an

           female blow-up doll with a hot dog sticking out of it’s butt.

                                 SCOTT
                        Actually, I prefer a girl with some 
                        brains. Someone who challenges me.

                                 MADY
                        Riiiight.

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 MADY
                        A, you’re a liar, and B, you’re too 
                        attractive to be smart. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s a nice compliment. You’re 
                        pretty honest, huh?

                                 MADY
                        That’s a nice response. You’re 
                        pretty conceited, huh? Besides, I 
                        implied you’re an idiot.

           She looks over to Tia. Scott looks at Mady, sizing her up.

                                 MADY
                        If you can overlook a slew of 
                        mental deficiencies, then you’d be 
                        an idiot not to try to bang her.

                                 MIKE
                        And I am no idiot. Thanks, Mads.

           Mike and Scott walk away.

                                 SCOTT
                        Is she always like that?

                                 MIKE
                        Like what? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know, like an episode of 
                        Deadwood?

           INT. CINEPLEX OFFICE - NIGHT

           Mady sits on the counter, Leslie eats guacamole at a desk. 
                                 MADY
                        I did that thing where I act tough 
                        and say dirty stuff and curse. 

                                 LESLIE
                        So, you were yourself.

                                 MADY
                             (nodding)
                        It was bad. He’s probably going to 
                        go after Tia anyway, with her big 
                        boobs and Pantene commercial hair.

                                 LESLIE
                        You can’t give up already.

                                 MADY
                        I’m not! This guy is smart and 
                        incredibly attractive. He’s going 
                        to be my first, even if I have to 
                        roofie and rape him. Wish me luck.  

                                 LESLIE
                        I think state law prohibits me.

           Mady exits the office purposefully and goes into... 

           THE CINEPLEX BATHROOM

           where she holds up a box with a picture of a tiny-waisted cow 
           and the name “UDDER CONTROL” on it. “Eye of the Tiger” 
           starts. She opens the box and pulls out a tiny piece of brown 
           fabric. She looks skeptical. She tries to pull it on, but 
           it’s a formidable opponent. She struggles, falling and 
           slamming into walls. Every time she flails past the 
           electronic towel dispenser, it spits out another towel.

           INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Finn walks to the bathroom door, where he hears a loud series 
           of grunts and panting. He looks disgusted and backs away.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mady finally has the stomach-cinching undergarment in place. 
           There is a large pile of paper towels on the floor. She pulls 
           a tank top out of her bag and puts it on, then changes into 
           some tight jeans. She looks very uncomfortable. 
           INT. LOBBY - LATER

           Mike and Scott hang out by the ticket podium. Mady sucks it 
           in and walks past, trying to be nonchalant. 

                                 MADY
                        Night, boys.

                                 SCOTT
                        Good night.

           They stare as she hobbles away.

                                 MIKE
                        Wow. She’s kind of got a hot little 
                        bod. For a dude.

           Nick, on the other podium, sees her and whistles.

           INT. MADY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mady dives into the driver’s seat. “Eye of the Tiger” ends 
           abruptly as she gasps for breath. She tries to pull off the 
           belly-cincher, but it won’t budge. She frantically rummages 
           in her bag, pulls out a pocket knife, cuts off the device and 
           takes a deep breath, then pulls on a baggy sweatshirt.

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mady awakens from a dream, sweaty and breathing heavily. She 
           looks around, realizing where she is, and sighs.

           INT. CINEPLEX - NIGHT

           Mady exits the bathroom and sees Scott on the ticket podium. 
           She steels herself and walks over.

                                 MADY
                        Hey Scott, how are you doing?

                                 SCOTT
                        Fine, you?

                                 MADY
                        Good.

           Crickets. Nick watches them from the other podium.
                                 MADY
                        Uh, I didn’t mean it when I called 
                        you a conceited lying idiot, by the 
                        way. I was just kidding. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, I figured it was a joke.

                                 MADY
                        I am kind of a jokester.

           Tia saunters up to them, swinging her hips.

                                 TIA
                        Hey, what’s up, guys?

           She nudges Mady aside and smiles at Scott.

                                 MADY
                             (turns to Tia, surprised)
                        Not much, we were just talking.

                                 TIA
                        Cool. Scott, did Mike tell you I 
                        know your brother? I went to --

           As Tia blabs on, Mady looks defeated and walks into the...

           CINEPLEX KITCHEN

           where she puts her forehead against the fridge. Simon and 
           Finn enter. Finn opens the freezer. Mady doesn’t budge.

                                 SIMON
                        Are you alright?

                                 MADY
                        Who the fuck says “jokester”? 

                                 SIMON
                        No one, as far as I know.

                                 MADY
                        Jokester. JOKESTER. 

                                 FINN
                        I think she’s broken.

                                 SIMON
                        Snap out of it, Mads. It’s time for 
                        the first rush.
           She checks her watch. The minute hand clicks to six-thirty. 

                                 MADY
                        Let’s do this shit.

           MONTAGE - THE RUSH

           -- Staccato CLOSE-UPS of each person crisply putting on their 
           visor, fastening their name tag and tying up their apron.

           -- SLOW MOTION: Mady and the boys stride like badasses to 
           their registers. Finn slips on oil and lands flat on his back 
           as the front doors open and people rush to the stand. 

           -- Simon is sweaty and frantic. He glances down to Mady, who 
           easily does three things at once. She smirks at him.

           -- Mady does the “eclipse” with dramatic flourish, smiling. 
           Finn tries to copy, using a full cup, but he fumbles it, 
           flinging fruit punch into a LITTLE GIRL’s face. She starts to 
           cry and the girl’s FATHER grabs Finn by the shirt.

           -- Mady slides by Finn - who now has a bandage on his head - 
           and glances down to Tia’s station where a very long line of 
           men smile at Tia, nodding at her. Mady stops, shocked.

           END MONTAGE

           Mady, Simon and Finn stand around, recovering. Nick walks up.

                                 NICK
                        Hey Mad Dog, you gonna let the 
                        airhead beat you at this thing? 

           He indicates Tia’s station where a long line of men waits.

                                 MADY
                             (shouts to customers)
                        I can help someone down here!

           The men look at her, but stay put in Tia’s line. 

                                 NICK
                        Ouch.

                                 MADY
                        Goddamn it! Like her tits are the 
                        fucking Messiah or something. Fuck!

           Mady turns to find two shocked NUNS, one with a LITTLE BOY.
                                 MADY
                             (laughs uncomfortably)
                        Can I help you?

                                 LITTLE BOY
                             (cute toddler voice)
                        Fuck.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady exits the bathroom, sees Tia talking to Scott and heads 
           toward them. Nick breaks from a nearby pack of ushers and 
           intercepts her. His hands are behind his back.

                                 NICK
                        For what it’s worth, I think you’re 
                        sexier than Blondie, Mad Dog. You 
                        looked smokin’ the other night.

                                 MADY
                             (distracted)
                        Thanks.

                                 NICK
                        You should wear stuff like that 
                        more often. Like, say, when we have 
                        our night of Mickey D’s and sex?

                                 MADY
                        Ha ha. Go away, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t be scared of your sexual 
                        attraction. Girls just can’t resist 
                        my mojo. My natural heat. 

           He puts his arm around her shoulder but she shrugs him off.

                                 MADY
                        Seriously, now’s not a good time.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t fight the lust. Let it out.

                                 MADY
                             (irritated and loud)
                        Nick, please. Go away.

           The interaction draws the attention of the ushers. Simon and 
           Finn turn to watch from behind the stand. Mady tries to walk 
           away, but Nick gets in front of her. 
                                 NICK
                        Just one flash of bra. C’mon.

                                 MADY
                        Nick! I don’t want to go to dinner 
                        with you, I’m not gonna show you my 
                        boobs and I sure as hell am not 
                        going to fuck you, so just leave me 
                        the fuck alone! Please!

           Nick’s face colors. He pulls a can of macadamia nuts out from 
           behind his back, tosses it on the floor and leaves. Mady 
           picks it up and looks after him. A DUMB WOMAN approaches her.

                                 DUMB WOMAN
                        Excuse me, do you work here?

           Mady peers slowly down at her uniform, then looks up.

                                 MADY
                        No.

                                 DUMB WOMAN
                        Oh, sorry.

           The woman heads off. Mady sighs and walks up to Tia.

                                 MADY
                        Tia, you can go on break now.

                                 TIA
                        Oh, cool. See you later, Scotty!

           Tia strolls off, Scott watches her go. Mady hops the counter, 
           tossing the nuts under her register as Mr. Fish appears.

                                 MR. FISH
                             (to Scott)
                        What the hell is this?

           Mr. Fish grabs a cup of popcorn off Scott’s ticket podium.

                                 MR. FISH
                        What do you think this is, your own 
                        personal restaurant?

           He throws the popcorn at Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        I, uh, I --
                                 MADY
                        Oh, sorry, Mr. Fish, I left that 
                        there a while ago. I was just so 
                        hungry from all the up-selling.

                                 MR. FISH
                        This is yours, Mady? You know 
                        better than that. Come on!

                                 MADY
                        It’ll never happen again, I swear.

           Mr. Fish gives her a look and wiggles off. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Thanks. What a toolbox.

                                 MADY
                             (teasing)
                        You’re welcome, Scotty.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

                                 MADY
                        Could you be more obvious? You just 
                        about burned a hole in her butt.

                                 SCOTT
                        No I didn’t.

                                 MADY
                             (imitating him)
                        Oh, I’m into brains, I’m so smart, 
                        I don’t care about looks.

           He chuckles.

                                 MADY
                        So predictable. And I thought you 
                        might be different than these other 
                        Cro-Magnons. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I am!

                                 MADY
                             (playfully)
                        Yeah, I’m sure. Oh, hey, I have an 
                        ass. Want to watch me walk away?

           She walks away with an exaggerated hip swivel. He laughs.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mady and Rob sit next to each other at a well-worn table. 
           Mady looks depressed as Rob works on equations.

                                 MADY
                        I even dressed slutty once.

                                 ROB
                        You did?

                                 MADY
                        I know. And nothing. I guess I’m 
                        just too ugly. Or too fat. Or -- 

                                 ROB
                        He could be gay. Or he could have 
                        elephantitis of the genitals and he 
                        doesn’t want you anywhere near his 
                        grotesquely-swelled testicles.

                                 MADY
                        You’re a good friend, Rob. Weird, 
                        but good. 

           Mady opens her anatomy textbook. The page features a detailed 
           diagram of male genitalia, with a former student’s 
           “embellishments” drawn on it. She slams the book shut. 

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - NIGHT

           Mady leans on the counter, staring at Scott. Tia takes note.

           INT. CINEPLEX KITCHEN - LATER

           Mady straightens up the shelves. Tia enters and helps her. 

                                 TIA
                        I have to say something here. Don’t 
                        be offended. I like you, you’re a 
                        nice girl, but you should back off.  

                                 MADY
                        Off of what?

                                 TIA
                        Scott, honey. If you go after him, 
                        you’re gonna get your heart broken. 
                        He’s a player. And he wants me.
                                 MADY
                        How can you possibly know that?

                                 TIA
                        Be honest with yourself, Mady. If 
                        you were a guy, who would you 
                        choose? The beautiful airhead or 
                        the plain Jane bibliophile? 

           Mady opens her mouth to respond, then stops, dazed. Tia nods.

                                 MADY
                        You’re not an idiot. 

                                 TIA
                        Everyone loves a bimbo. You should 
                        try it sometime. You can get away 
                        with anything you want.

                                 MADY
                        You’re truly an inspiration. If 
                        he’s such a jerk, why don’t you 
                        whore it up on someone else? 

                                 TIA
                        I can handle guys like him. You 
                        should go for one of the other 
                        nerds here. They all love you. 
                        It’ll save you the embarrassment. 

           Mady stares at Tia, shakes her head and walks out.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - NIGHT

           Mady counts candy in the back stand, next to the ticket 
           podium where Mike loiters with a crowd of ushers.

                                 USHER 1
                             (to Mike)
                        You should probably get tested.

                                 MIKE
                        Mike’s Pike is clean. Yo, Mady!

                                 MADY
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        How many cuts of meat have you 
                        simmered in your bearded clam?
                                 MADY
                        What?

           He makes a variety of lewd gestures to clarify his meaning.

                                 MADY
                        Like I’d tell you.

                                 MIKE
                        C’mon. How many guys? Two? Thirty? 

           Mady doesn’t respond and Mike grabs her count sheets.

                                 MADY
                        Give those back! That’s like an 
                        hour’s work!

                                 MIKE
                        Sure. Just tell me a number.

           Mike holds up the papers and pretends to start ripping them.

                                 MADY
                        Okay, okay, it’s zero. I’m the big 
                        V. Happy now, you fucking prick?!

           The ushers go silent and turn to look at her, shocked.

                                 USHER 2
                        Are you serious?

                                 MADY
                        A lot of people my age haven’t yet.

                                 MIKE
                        No. I’m pretty sure it’s just you.

                                 USHER 1
                        Are you a religious zealot or 
                        something? 

                                 MADY
                        No! It just hasn’t come up with the 
                        right person yet.

                                 MIKE
                        Ha ha. Come up.

           Mike starts to hand the sheets back to Mady, but then pulls 
           them away when she reaches for them.
                                 MIKE
                        So, how far have you gone? I find 
                        this intriguing.

           Mady lunges across the counter. Mike backs away just in time.

                                 MIKE
                        Feisty! Mad ‘cause you’re secretly 
                        a dirty slut, sucking every dick 
                        you can get a hand on?

                                 MADY
                        You’re confusing me with you, Mike. 

           The ushers laugh. Mike is pissed.

                                 MIKE
                        You don’t want these back, do you?

           Nick walks by, surveying the situation.

                                 MADY
                        Nick, help me out here.

           Mike looks at Nick expectantly, lowering the papers.

                                 NICK
                        I have shit to do.

           Mady watches him walk away, surprised. He stops and leans 
           against the wall nearby, clearly not having “shit” to do. 
           Mike smiles, holding up the papers once again.

                                 MIKE
                        I swear on my cock and balls I’ll 
                        give it back this time. Just tell 
                        me how many dongs you’ve touched.

           Mady fixes Mike with a fiery glare. He holds up the sheets. 
           She looks at the boxes, then at Mike. He pulls out a lighter, 
           flicks it on and puts it up to the papers.

                                 MADY
                        I’ve never seen a penis in person!  

           The ushers gasp. Nick and Mike are stunned. Mady grabs the 
           papers, then Mike’s hair, slamming his head into the counter.

                                 MIKE
                        Ow! No fucking way.
                                 USHER 1
                        I’ll volunteer. Mine’s tiny, not 
                        threatening or scary at all. 

           Mady hops the stand and goes up to Mike, who flinches. She 
           tenderly touches his head where a bump is beginning to form.

                                 MADY
                        I’m sorry I got so mad, Mike.
                             (she leans in close)
                        I just... wanted to do THIS.

           Mady knees him in the nuts and he falls down. She walks off. 

                                 MIKE
                             (high-pitched)
                        It. Was. Totally. Worth. It.

           Scott struts up, eating popcorn, and looks down at Mike. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 MIKE
                        The Virgin Mady took out her sexual 
                        frustration on my nads.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Shelley and Mady enter to see Tia flirting with Scott. 
           Shelley leans over to Mady, riling her up.

                                 SHELLEY
                        She’s disrespecting you, Mads! This 
                        is your house. You gonna let her 
                        take your man, in your house? 

           Mady balls her fists.

                                 MADY
                        I’m so sick of this bitch.
                             (toward Tia)
                        You’re going down, Barbie.

           Shelley smiles as Mady charges over to the stand.
           INT. CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Mady enters, standing behind Tia, who leans close to Scott.

                                 TIA
                        I know how to deal with naughty 
                        boys like you. You need a spanking.

                                 SCOTT
                        I think I do.

                                 MADY
                        Tia, so sorry to interrupt, but 
                        this gentleman is waiting for you.

           She indicates a PATIENT CUSTOMER standing at the counter. 

                                 TIA
                        Could you handle it?

           Tia turns back to Scott. Mady pauses, taken aback, then 
           raises her voice.

                                 MADY
                        Actually, you’ll handle it. Now.

           Tia throws Mady a blistering look and heads over to the man.

                                 MADY
                             (leans over to Scott)
                        Can you please stop distracting my 
                        employees with your sexual charms?

                                 SCOTT
                        I can’t help that I’m so charming.

           He smiles and arches an eyebrow. She laughs at him and 
           returns the smile. Tia fumbles with the register. The 
           formerly patient customer looks pissed. Mady walks over. 

                                 MADY
                        What’s the problem?

                                 TIA
                        I gave him the wrong change. Can 
                        you call Leslie to open this?

                                 PATIENT CUSTOMER
                        How long is this going to take?
                                 MADY
                        Don’t worry, sir, I’ll handle this.
                             (to Tia)
                        Turn around, please.

           Tia stays put and Mady does her complicated register-opening 
           move, then gives the customer his change. He walks off.

                                 SCOTT
                        How did you do that?

                                 MADY
                        It’s a secret.
                             (pats Tia on the back)
                        I know it’s hard to understand all 
                        of this, but you’ll get the hang of 
                        numbers eventually, Tia. Toodles. 

           She walks away, leaving Tia seething. Scott is amused.

           INT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Mady rummages around in her car. Amidst the mess is a huge 
           bag of popcorn and a life-sized cut-out of “Air Bud”. She 
           grabs a book and turns to find Tia standing behind her.

                                 MADY
                             (jumps)
                        Shit! Stalk me much?

                                 TIA
                        Calling me stupid backfired on your 
                        ass, bitch. We’re going on a date. 

                                 MADY
                        Really? What should I wear?

                                 TIA
                        Hilarious. Maybe if you weren’t 
                        such a bitch, he’d have wanted you.
                             (looks her up and down)
                        Then again, probably not.

           She marches off.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - NIGHT

           Mady looks tired and disheveled as she chats with Finn and 
           Simon. She stops mid-thought when she sees Scott exit the 
           bathroom, looking quite suave in his civilian clothes. He 
           sits on a bench and looks toward the door. 
           Moments later, Tia prances in, looking so hot that even Finn 
           stares. Scott stands and Tia grabs his hand as they exit. 

                                 MADY
                        Well, that sucks.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - DAY

           Mady cleans the outside of the stand, sitting on an upside-
           down bucket. Mike and Nick sweep nearby. PATRONS exit a 
           theater into the lobby. Tia walks up.

                                 TIA
                        Last night was so great. Don’t 
                        Scotty and I make a cute couple? 
                        He’s such a great kisser. 

           Mady stands and grabs some paper towels, not looking at Tia.

                                 MADY
                        I hope he likes crabs.

           Scott approaches and Mady turns to look at him. Tia tosses 
           something from her pocket on the bucket. Scott waves to Mady, 
           and she waves back half-heartedly as she plops down on the 
           bucket. Tia smiles. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey Mady. How’s it going?

                                 MADY
                        Awesome. I just love menial labor. 
                        How was the big date, smart guy?

           Scott opens his mouth to speak, but Tia quickly knocks over 
           Mady’s bottle of cleaning solution, spilling it everywhere.

                                 TIA
                        Oops.

           Mady jumps up and bends over, righting the bottle. Tia slides 
           to her left, using her body to hide the bucket, and the 
           ketchup packets she has tossed on it, from Scott’s view. 

                                 TIA
                             (shouting)
                        Ew! Mady bled through her pants!

           Mady whips around, horrified, to see a giant red spot on her 
           pants. Scott looks disgusted and turns away. The patrons 
           milling about make grossed out noises, some chuckle.
                                 TIA
                        Use a tampon, freak!
                             (to Scott)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           Everyone stares at Mady, who looks utterly mortified. Tia 
           smiles and grabs Scott, dragging him away. Mady looks at the 
           bucket. She holds up a ketchup packet.

                                 MADY
                        It’s ketchup! It’s ketchup!

           But Scott is long gone. Nick throws his jacket to Mady.

                                 NICK
                        Here, Big Red.

                                 MADY
                        Thanks.

           Mady ties it around her waist and hurries to the kitchen.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Finn and Simon stand silently for a few moments.

                                 FINN
                        She seems pretty upset.

                                 SIMON
                        I know.

                                 FINN
                        She’s probably seeing red right 
                        now, huh?

                                 SIMON
                        You’re an idiot.

           Simon turns and walks away.

                                 FINN
                        So we shouldn’t rent Red Eye? 
                        Moulin Rouge? Crimson Tide?

           Simon disappears into the kitchen.

           INT. BOX OFFICE - LATER

           Mady and Shelley sit in wheeled desk chairs. Mady, in fresh 
           pants, repeatedly wheels herself into the wall.
                                 MADY
                        I’m the Scary Girl Who Bleeds. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        It’s not over, Mads. 

                                 MADY
                        I’m pretty sure it is, actually.

                                 SHELLEY
                        He wants a bimbo and you want him, 
                        so why don’t you just bimbo it up?

                                 MADY
                        Please tell me you’re joking.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Just a little bit, to get his 
                        attention. Then you can go back to 
                        being your quick-witted awesome 
                        self, and he’ll realize that you’re 
                        what he’s wanted all along. 

                                 MADY
                        I don’t think so, Shell. Even 
                        dressed slutty I’m a beast. Where 
                        would I even start?

           INT. CINEPLEX BATHROOM - LATER

           Shelley leans against the stall door. 

                                 MADY (O.S.)
                        You’re such a lipstick. 
                             (shuffling sounds)
                        Oh dear God. This is so wrong.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Let me see.

                                 MADY (O.S.)
                        I look like an idiot.

           Mady comes out in a uniform two sizes too small. Her hair is 
           straight and she has a thick layer of makeup on. She looks 
           hot, in a very skanky way. Shelley unbuttons Mady’s shirt. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        No, you look like a whore. It’s 
                        perfect! Can you smush those up 
                        further? Almost to your chin?
           Mady readjusts her bra, pushing her boobs even higher.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Nice. Turn around.

           Mady turns away from Shelley, who checks out her butt.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Look at that. It’s like two little 
                        cantaloupes. Ripe, sweet, succu --

                                 MADY
                        I get it, thanks. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Let’s get you out there. Remember, 
                        make him feel smart. You’re just a 
                        little vapid silly cuddly bunny. 

                                 MADY
                        I’m going to punch you in the vag.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady saunters past the concession counter. Simon sees her and 
           bobbles, then drops, a stack of cups. Finn laughs.

                                 FINN
                        What are you supposed to be? 
                        Streetwalker Barbie?

                                 MADY
                        What are you supposed to be? 
                        Sexually Confused Ken?

           Mady ambles up to the ticket podium. Scott gives her the up 
           and down, confused.  

                                 MADY
                        Hey, Scott. You look cute today.

                                 SCOTT
                        Uh, thanks. What’s going on?

                                 MADY
                        I wanted to talk to you and stuff. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why are you dressed like that?
                                 MADY
                        I’m sick of being so uptight. I 
                        just wanna have some fun, you know? 
                        Before I leave for school. Like 
                        earlier, when I pranked you with 
                        the blood. Funny, right?

                                 SCOTT
                        Uh, I guess. What’d you want to 
                        talk about?

                                 MADY
                        Um, I’m sorta having problems with 
                        calculus. Math is just too hard. 
                             (turns away, makes pained 
                              face, turns back)
                        And since you’re smart, I thought 
                        maybe you could give me private 
                        lessons. Privately. In private.

           Tia walks up, sees Mady and narrows her eyes. She puts her 
           arm around Scott.

                                 TIA
                        Hey, baby. Whatcha talking about?

                                 SCOTT
                        Mady needs a math tutor. 

           Tia looks at Mady, surprised, then ramps up her bimbo-sity.

                                 TIA
                        Me too. Math hurts my head. 

                                 MADY
                        I’m totally lost. What’s a limit? 

                                 TIA
                             (rubs Scott’s hair)
                        I’ve never even heard of limits!

                                 SCOTT
                        Maybe I should start a business.

                                 TIA
                             (laughs way too loud)
                        You’re so funny!

           Mady laughs too, and touches Scott’s arm.

                                 MADY
                        You are. It’s so fucking sexy!
           Scott and Tia both go quiet and look at Mady. Mady removes 
           her hand slowly and turns to leave.

                                 MADY
                        Uh, I’m gonna go. Scott, lemme know 
                        if you can help me, kay? 
                             (locks eyes with him)
                        I’ll totally... owe you one. 

           Scott watches her walk off. Tia rubs his shoulders.

                                 TIA
                        If you do tutor her, you better put 
                        a plastic tarp on all your stuff. 
                        So, when are we going out again?

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Finn stacks cups and Mady reclines on the counter. Simon 
           walks by, staring at her chest.  

                                 MADY
                        Simon! 

                                 SIMON
                        You’re sticking them out!

           A SWEATY MAN in spandex comes up to the counter.

                                 SWEATY GUY
                        Hey baby, gimme a large popcorn, 
                        extra butter, nachos, two hot dogs, 
                        Goobers, two pounds of bulk candy 
                        and let’s see... a small Diet Coke.

           He watches Mady lecherously as the employees all set about 
           getting his food. Mady walks to the hot dog warmer. Only two 
           hot dogs are left. One looks unpalatable. 

                                 MADY
                        Steve!

           She sadly puts him in a bun and hands him to the sweaty guy, 
           who stares at her chest. 

                                 SIMON
                        That’ll be sixty-two dollars and 
                        three cents, please.

           The sweaty man pays and collects his mound of food, all the 
           while checking out Mady. He tosses a five at her boobs.
                                 SWEATY MAN
                        That’s for you, sweet cheeks. I 
                        like the way you wiggle.

           Mady looks appalled.

                                 FINN
                        Take good care of him, man.

           The sweaty guy looks at him oddly and walks off with his pile 
           of food. They all watch Steve go.

                                 SIMON
                        He was a good dog. 

                                 FINN
                        That he was.

                                 MADY
                        Hello? Did you not see that?

                                 FINN
                        Hmm. He treated you like a whore. I 
                        wonder why.

           Mady tosses the five on the counter and heads into the...

           CINEPLEX KITCHEN

           where she angrily stacks some boxes on shelves.

                        Mady.

           Mady jumps and looks around. 

                                 MADY
                        What the hell?

                        It’s God.

                                 MADY
                        Nick?

                                 DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                        I said I’m God. Mady, my child, I 
                        command you to stop acting like a 
                        dirty slut.

           Mady puts her hands on her hips. 
                                 MADY
                        Who is this?

                                 DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                        Goddamn it, do I have to draw you a 
                        fucking picture? It’s God! 
                        Reminding you to be yourself. 
                             (ghost voice)
                        Be yourself. 

                                 MADY
                        So you’re a ghost now, God?

           Joe stands up from behind a pile of boxes. He wears a trash 
           bag and carries a broom.

                                 JOE
                        I guess two years at ventriloquist 
                        school wasn’t enough.

                                 MADY
                        When it comes to ventriloquist 
                        school, is it ever enough?

                                 JOE
                        People look up to you, Mads. Don’t 
                        lower yourself for some guy. It’s 
                        beneath you. 
                             (they share a long look)
                        I’m gonna catch the evil hobgoblin 
                        that lives in theater one now. 

                                 MADY
                        Of course you are.

           He brandishes the broom like a sword and marches out. Mady 
           pauses, then walks to the mirror, staring at herself. She 
           slowly wipes off her makeup with a towel, then exits.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Mady sees Tia hanging all over Scott. She picks up her bag, 
           tosses the can of nuts in it and heads to the bathroom, 
           distractedly unbuttoning her top shirt button as she goes. 
           Simon, entranced, pushes his cup up to what he thinks is the 
           soda machine. He takes a deep gulp, then looks into the cup. 
           It’s filled with oil.

           INT. CINEPLEX BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mady starts to change when she hears shouting. She runs out. 
           INT. CONCESSION STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Mady runs up. Simon lays on the floor, not breathing, white 
           foam in the corner of his mouth. Tia looks irritated by the 
           whole scene. Finn holds an EpiPen needle.

                                 MADY
                        Shit! Finn, give him the shot!

                                 FINN
                        Tia! Where’s that little medical 
                        book that came with the pen?

                                 TIA
                        What book? Don’t yell at me! 

                                 FINN
                        Call 911! Get me a marker!

                                 MADY
                        What the hell do you need a marker 
                        for? Give him the fucking shot!

                                 FINN
                        You give him the shot! I don’t know 
                        what the fuck to do!

                                 MADY
                        You have to get it deep into his 
                        thigh muscle. Stab it in there 
                        really hard, then push the plunger. 
                        Do it! On three. One, two --

           CU of the needle point. CU of Simon’s leg. 

                                 MADY (CONT'D)
                        Three!

           Finn holds Simon’s leg steady and raises the needle. He slams 
           it down. Into his own leg.

                                 FINN
                        Uh... 

           Mady hops the counter, grabs another EpiPen out of the supply 
           closet and stabs it into Simon’s thigh. 

                                 MADY
                        Finn, don’t push that plunger down!

                                 FINN
                        Okay...
           He looks down at the needle in his leg, turns white and 
           passes out. Mady holds Simon against her chest.

                                 MADY
                        Come on, Simon. Come on.

           Simon takes a gasping breath, opens his eyes and sees Mady’s 
           boobs against his face. He smiles woozily.

           EXT. BEHIND THE CINEPLEX - LATER

           Joe stands on top of a wall, wearing a trash bag. He flips 
           into a dumpster full of trash, then stands, arms raised. A 
           crowd of ushers cheer. Mady slumps by, headphones on, sipping 
           a milkshake, dressed like herself again. She sits on the 
           curb, dejected. Scott walks up behind her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey.

           Mady is startled at his sudden appearance and coughs.

                                 MADY
                        Hi.

           He sits down next to her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Heard about Simon. You okay?

                                 MADY
                        Little shaken up, but yeah.

                                 SCOTT
                        What are you listening to?

                                 MADY
                        It’s a mix. Ben Folds, The 
                        Decemberists. Who do you like?

                                 SCOTT
                        I listen to a lot of Fergie.

                                 MADY
                        Ew.

                                 SCOTT
                        So, I know what Tia did. With the 
                        ketchup.
                                 MADY
                        Oh. Yeah, no offense, but your 
                        girlfriend’s a total twat.

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s not my girlfriend. She wants 
                        to be. Picked up on that when she 
                        tried to tongue my appendix out.

                                 MADY
                             (dubious)
                        Why were you on a date, then?

                                 SCOTT
                        She said she was going to set me up 
                        with one of her friends, then they 
                        all miraculously bailed at the last 
                        second. She’s crafty for a bimbo.

                                 MADY
                        You’re telling me. So why not just 
                        get an easy piece?

                                 SCOTT
                        Do you have any idea where that 
                        girl’s mouth has been? Oh, what are 
                        you doing on Friday?

                                 MADY
                        Quality segue, supposedly smart 
                        guy. I don’t know yet. Why?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m free for tutoring.

                                 MADY
                        Oh... good. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You don’t need tutoring, do you?

                                 MADY
                        No, no I don’t.

                                 SCOTT
                        Didn’t think so. Wanna come see a 
                        movie with me instead?

                                 MADY
                        Uh, okay. Sure. Me?  

           He takes a sip of her milkshake and stands up.
                                 SCOTT
                        You. I told you, I like a girl with 
                        some brains.

           He smiles and walks off.

           INT. BOX OFFICE - LATER

           Mady is on the floor, bubbling over.

                                 MADY
                        Oh my God oh my God oh my God.

                                 SHELLEY
                        You must chill! You must chill!

           An IDIOT CUSTOMER comes to the window.

                                 IDIOT CUSTOMER
                        Two for “Viscosity”, please.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Pardon me?

                                 IDIOT CUSTOMER
                        “Viscosity”. Nine-thirty.

           Shelley prints out tickets for “Velocity” while Mady pulls a 
           giant ledger titled “Stupid Customer Quotes” out of a drawer.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Oh, add “Vasectomy”, too.

                                 MADY
                        Someone actually called it that?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Yeah, they’re having real problems 
                        with this one. So, where ya going 
                        on your big date?

                                 MADY
                        Here.

                                 SHELLEY
                        What? Why? MegaCinema has stadium 
                        seating! And Slushies!

                                 MADY
                        If we go Dutch, I can’t afford 
                        MegaCinema. Besides, this way I get 
                        to shove Tia’s face in it.
                                 SHELLEY
                        Ooh, turning the tables. I like it.

                                 MADY
                        Did I mention that I’m one step 
                        closer to sharing my precious 
                        flower with the hottest guy ever?!

                                 SHELLEY 
                        Can you leave? Your estrogen is 
                        bugging me. And try not to dress 
                        like my Mom, Prudie McTightTwat.

                                 MADY
                        I don’t dress like a Mom.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Yeah, actually you do.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE - MADY’S ROOM - MADY GETS READY

           -- Mady in front of the mirror, wearing a cardigan and 
           pleated pants, looking very much like a mom. She sighs.

           -- Mady uses a curling iron while applying mascara. She 
           sniffs, turns, and sees the iron smoking. She opens it and a 
           piece of charred hair falls out. She yelps and turns back to 
           the mirror. Mascara is smeared all over her face.

           -- Mady applies “Stinger Lip Plump”. Nothing happens. She 
           tosses the box, disappointed. Suddenly her eyes go wide. She 
           screams and claws at her mouth, running in circles. Her lips 
           are now comically huge. She runs to a window and presses her 
           lips against the glass, whimpering.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           The swelling has gone down, but Mady’s lips are still red and 
           puffy. She wears a tight top and her hair is tamed nicely. 
           Finn and Simon interrogate her as she holds ice on her lips.

                                 FINN
                        Who are you seeing it with?

                                 SIMON
                        You’re going to a movie alone?
                                 MADY
                        Not exactly.

           Finn tries to make eye contact with Mady, but she avoids it.

                                 FINN
                        Oh my God. You have a date!

                                 MADY
                        Shut up, Finn.

           Finn shouts to MIKE, who mans the ticket podium. 

                                 FINN
                        Mady’s got a date!

                                 MIKE
                        Dude or chick, Mady?

                                 SIMON
                        What smells like burnt hair?

                                 MADY
                        I hate you guys.

           Scott enters and looks around. He spots her and walks over.

                                 FINN
                        No. Way.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey guys. Mady, you ready?

                                 MADY
                        I just have to hit the ladies room.

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay, I’ll meet you in the theater.

           He walks off. Finn gives her a thumbs-up and a huge smirk. 
           She makes a face at him as she hurries into the bathroom.

           LATER

           Mady comes out and walks to the ticket podium. A CONFUSED MAN 
           cuts in front of her and Nick rips his ticket.

                                 NICK
                        That’s to your right, sir.

           The man walks by, looks both ways, and goes to the left. Nick 
           rips Mady’s ticket and hands it back without looking at her.
                                 MADY
                        I’m sorry I was such a bitch the 
                        other day. Forgive me? 

           Nick plasters on a fake smile. 

                                 NICK
                        That’ll be to your left, ma’am. 
                        Enjoy your movie.

           She looks at him for a long moment, but he refuses to return 
           her stare. She finally sighs and walks off, looking wounded.

           INT. VELOCITY THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Mady spots Scott and sits next to him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Do you want anything?

                                 MADY
                        No, I’m good. Thanks.

                                 SCOTT
                        I like your lipstick.

                                 MADY
                             (touches lips)
                        Oh, thanks.

           The lights dim.

           LATER

           Loud fighting sounds come from the screen. Scott turns to 
           Mady, leans in close and whispers to her.

                                 SCOTT
                        This fight is insane, right? I 
                        think the guy in black does kempo.

                                 MADY
                        I’m just waiting for someone to get 
                        impaled on that -

           There is a wet ripping sound on screen and they both flinch. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Good call.
           He smiles at her and puts his hand on her leg, then turns 
           back to the screen. She looks down at his hand and takes a 
           deep breath, trying to relax.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady and Scott walk by the concession stand where a tired-
           looking Tia is standing. Mady leans behind Scott as they pass 
           and gives Tia a huge smile and the finger.

           EXT. CINEPLEX PARKING LOT - LATER

           Scott walks Mady to her car.

                                 SCOTT
                        Those wrap-up paragraphs during the 
                        credits were lame. 

                                 MADY
                        I know, I hate those things.
                             (indicates her car)
                        This is me.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sweet ride.

                                 MADY
                        Yeah, I’m thinking of getting rims, 
                        maybe a giant eagle on the hood.

                                 SCOTT
                        Funny. 
                             (touches her hair)
                        You look really great tonight.

                                 MADY
                             (nervous)
                        Thanks, you too. I like the shirt.

           He takes a step toward her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Want to go out again sometime?

                                 MADY
                        Okay. Sure. 

           He backs her against the car and they share a long, intense 
           kiss. A car goes by, beeping.
                                 SOMEONE IN THE CAR
                        Woo! Put your cock in her, Scotty!

           They separate, embarrassed.

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s nice.

                                 MADY
                        Yeah.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, good night.

                                 MADY
                        Good night.

           He kisses her again and strides away. She gets in her car and 
           punches her seat, squealing, as Scott drives off. She turns 
           the ignition key, but the engine doesn’t start. The bungee 
           cord is coiled on the passenger seat.

           LATER

           Nick has the hood of Mady’s car open and jumper cables are 
           attached to his Suburban’s battery.

                                 MADY
                        I forgot the brake lights.

                                 NICK
                        Brake lights?

                                 MADY
                        My brake pedal doesn’t stay up on 
                        it’s own. I have to attach a cord 
                        from the pedal to the steering 
                        wheel or the lights stay on. 

                                 NICK
                        You really need a new car. 

                                 MADY
                        Shitmobile’s all I can afford. Oh, 
                        I washed your jacket. Thanks for 
                        that, by the way.

           She reaches into the car and hands it to him.

                                 NICK
                        Whatever. How was your big date?
                                 MADY
                        How do you know it was a date?

                                 NICK
                        Look at you, you look like a whore. 

                                 MADY
                        No I don’t! I look good. Right?

                                 NICK
                        Try the engine.

           She starts the car and he detaches the cables. 

                                 MADY
                        Thanks, Nick. You’re a really 
                        decent guy sometimes. 

           He tosses the cables into his car and walks off.

                                 MADY (CONT'D)
                        You’re still mad at me? I said I’m 
                        sorry. Jesus, how long are you 
                        going to be pissy about this? 

           Nick shakes his head and turns around.

                                 NICK
                        You really don’t get it. You’ve 
                        treated me like garbage from the 
                        second that little shit showed up. 
                        And now that you need me for 
                        something, we’re best buddies 
                        again? I’m not your bitch, Mady.

           He storms off, leaving Mady shocked. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           Emily and Mady are in gym class, passing a basketball back 
           and forth. Emily is terrible at it. 

                                 MADY
                        I thought it was just an idiom, but 
                        I literally got weak in the knees. 

           Emily throws the ball underhanded and it goes straight up, 
           bouncing right next to her. Mady grabs it and passes it back.

                                 EMILY
                        So, when do we get to meet the 
                        perfect man?
                                 MADY
                        I don’t want to freak him out, but 
                        soon. He’s just so... amazing.

           Emily chucks the ball and it rolls to a stop at Mady’s feet.

                                 EMILY
                        When’s the next date?

                                 MADY
                        We’re going to dinner Wednesday.

                                 EMILY
                        Oh, nice. Just don’t eat garlic. Or 
                        onions. Or peppers. Or --

           Emily throws the ball harder and it hits Karen in the back of 
           the head, knocking her down. Emily cringes.

                                 EMILY
                        Sorry, Karen! 

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        My soft spot!

                                 EMILY
                        I suck at this. I just wasn’t meant 
                        to play with balls, I guess.

           Mady opens her mouth to speak.

                                 EMILY
                        Oh, shut up.

           INT. ITALIAN CHAIN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Mady picks at a salad, avoiding the onions. Scott eats pasta.

                                 MADY
                        The test said I should be a 
                        zoologist, a clergyman or a lawyer. 
                        Thanks a lot, test. A clergyman? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you sure you don’t want 
                        anything else to eat?

                                 MADY
                        I’m not really that hungry, but 
                        thanks. So, Princeton, huh?
                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. My Dad’s alumni, so I think I 
                        got some preferential treatment.

                                 MADY
                        Don’t say that, I’m sure you 
                        would’ve gotten in regardless. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re sweet. Where are you headed?

                                 MADY
                        I got into U. Penn, but I’m going 
                        to State. They gave me a bigger 
                        scholarship. My parents are making 
                        me pay for tuition on my own.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harsh. You must be excited for all 
                        the parties and the football, huh? 

           Mady takes a sip of her drink and looks at him.

                                 MADY
                        Actually...

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

                                 MADY
                        Forget it. How’s your ziti?

                                 SCOTT
                        Nice try. What were you gonna say?

                                 MADY
                        Well... I’m not really that psyched 
                        about leaving. I keep telling 
                        everyone I am, but I’m not.

                                 SCOTT
                        Why not?

                                 MADY
                        I sort of have a good thing going 
                        here, you know? At school, I’ll be 
                        all alone in this huge foreign 
                        place and I’ll have to try to carve 
                        a niche for myself all over again. 
                        It’s scary. I know, I’m lame.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I feel like that a little, too.
                                 MADY
                        You do?

           A WAITRESS appears and picks up their plates.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you anything else?

                                 SCOTT
                        Just the check, thanks.
                             (to Mady)
                        So, what now?

                                 MADY
                        It’s pretty late. I should go home.

                                 SCOTT
                        Want to see my place? I’ll get you 
                        home early. Or you can sleep over.

                                 MADY
                        Yeah, right.

                                 SCOTT
                        We’ll watch a movie. It’ll be fun.

           He shoots her a charming, sexy smile. 

                                 MADY
                        I can’t be out too late.

                                 SCOTT
                        No problem. We’ll watch a movie and 
                        then I’ll drive you straight home.

           INT. SCOTT’S BEDROOM - LATER

           It’s dark, there are no windows. Scott turns a dimmer switch. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Come on in.

                                 MADY
                        Nice room.

           He shuts the door behind them, revealing a Bruce Lee poster.

                                 SCOTT
                        So, what should we watch?

                                 MADY
                        Anything, you pick.
           Scott picks up a Jackie Chan DVD and puts it in. Before the 
           movie even starts, he kisses Mady and pulls her onto the bed. 
           He fumbles with her shirt, trying to pull it off.

                                 MADY
                        You move pretty fast, slick.

                                 SCOTT
                        You make me pretty hot, gorgeous.

           He kisses her, she leans back.

                                 MADY 
                        What about the movie?

                                 SCOTT
                        Just relax.

           He kisses her again. She obviously enjoys it.

                                 MADY 
                        Oh, what the hell.

           She pulls off her shirt, covering her stomach with it. He 
           pulls off his shirt and they make out some more. 

                                 MADY
                        Wait, what about your parents?

                                 SCOTT
                        Not home.

           They continue kissing. He slowly moves his hands down to her 
           pants and unbuttons.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You don’t match your bra and your 
                        underwear?

           She looks at him incredulously.

                                 MADY
                        I didn’t exactly think you’d be 
                        seeing my underthings tonight.

           He tries to pull down her pants.

                                 MADY
                        Wait, wait. I’m not going this far 
                        on a second date.

           He rolls over onto his back with a frustrated sound.
                                 SCOTT
                        Then why did you let me undo your 
                        pants, Mady?

                                 MADY
                        Don’t be mad. This is just moving a 
                        little fast for me. I’m not as... 
                        experienced as you are.

                                 SCOTT
                        Crap, I was just a total dick, 
                        wasn’t I? Sorry. It’s just hard for 
                        me to get so into it and then stop, 
                        you know? I really like you, Mady. 
                        If you need to go slower, we can. 

           He puts his arm around her, pulling her head onto his chest. 
           She looks relieved and smiles, stroking his arm.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - NIGHT

           Emily and Rob sit on a bench. Scott appears on the far side 
           of the lobby, talking with a group of ushers. He does a 
           series of fast-paced karate moves and kicks. Nick walks by, 
           sees the display and shakes his head.

                                 EMILY
                        What the fuck is that?

           Mady comes out of a theater and walks up to her friends. 

                                 MADY
                        Hey guys! Oh, he’s out here. 

           Emily and Rob share a look as Mady motions Scott over.

                                 MADY
                        Scott, these are my friends, Emily 
                        and Rob. They just saw Velocity.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey. Did you like it?

                                 ROB
                        A few too many explosions, but it’s 
                        Bruckheimer, so it’s to be 
                        expected. The cinematogra--

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, this is fun and all, but I 
                        have to go haul some trash. 
           He walks off. Everyone looks after him, surprised.

                                 EMILY
                        What the hell? That’s the guy you 
                        went out with?

                                 MADY
                        He’s usually really sweet. Maybe 
                        he’s in a bad mood or something.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - LATER

           Mady cleans the counter. Scott walks up, whistling. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Your friends are major dorks, huh?

                                 MADY
                        No they’re not! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah they are. You probably can’t 
                        see it because you guys are close.

                                 MADY
                        Then that makes me a dork, too.

                                 SCOTT
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 MADY
                             (punches his shoulder)
                        Hey!

                                 SCOTT
                             (laughs)
                        But you’re a hot dork. Don’t sulk. 
                        I actually came over here to ask 
                        you something.

                                 MADY
                        Oh?

                                 SCOTT
                        My school has this thing called 
                        “the prom” and I was wondering if 
                        you might want to go with me?

                                 MADY
                        Really? 
                             (studies his face, unsure)
                        You hardly know me.
                                 SCOTT
                        I know we’ll have fun. And that 
                        you’ll look beautiful.

           He moves close to her, smiling his charming smile.

                                 MADY
                        Uh... okay, I guess. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I love these things, getting all 
                        dressed up and everything. 

                                 MADY
                        Well, then, do you want to come to 
                        mine, too?

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you kidding? Definitely. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mady bounces up to Emily at her locker.

                                 EMILY
                        Hey, Mads. How’s the contest going?

                                 MADY
                        Okay. Hopefully I win because - I’m 
                        going to the prom with Scott! Aahh!

                                 EMILY
                        Oh, that’s great... for you.

                                 MADY
                        So I guess I have to get a dress 
                        and deal with all the girly crap --

                                 EMILY
                        Wait a second, what about our anti-
                        prom? You’re gonna ditch me and 
                        Rob? The whole thing was your idea.

                                 MADY
                        Well, you guy can probably get a 
                        date to the real prom, too. 

                                 EMILY
                        Probably? I can’t believe this. The 
                        second you get a chance you choose 
                        some jerk over your friends?
                                 MADY
                        He’s not a jerk! Why are you acting 
                        like this? Are you jealous? 

           Emily’s eyes get wide. She looks ready to explode.

                                 EMILY
                        You should really go. Away. Now.

           INT. BOX OFFICE - NIGHT

           Mady yaps and Shelley listens with a bored expression.

                                 MADY
                        I finally have what I want, and 
                        they can’t even be happy for me?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Yeah, yeah. You let Scott swim up 
                        your fish hallway yet?

                                 MADY
                        He wanted to, but I chickened out. 
                        It just didn’t feel right.

                                 SHELLEY
                        OH MY GOD. All you’ve been talking 
                        about is finding a guy to bang and 
                        you just said he’s the one! Fucking 
                        copulate or stop whining already!

                                 MADY
                        I know, I know, you’re right. I was 
                        thinking, it’s cliche and all, but 
                        why not the prom? It could be semi-
                        special, tux, dress and all that. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Yes! She’s gonna captain the beef 
                        boat to the tuna waters, ladies and 
                        gentlemen! Halle-freakin’-lujah!

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - NIGHT

           Customers line up at the registers. Tia has turned up her 
           sales pitch, actually calling people over from other lines. 
           The four buttons of her shirt are open, revealing lots of 
           cleavage. She gives Mady an angry, bordering on crazy, smirk. 
           INT. CINEPLEX OFFICE - LATER

           Leslie eats kippers at her desk. Mady sits on a chair.

                                 MADY
                        She looked at me like she’s going 
                        to boil my rabbit.

                                 LESLIE
                        Well, get it in gear. You only have 
                        two days to catch up.

                                 MADY
                        She’s winning?! 

                                 LESLIE
                        Yeah, but if you up your numbers 
                        ten percent, you should be able to 
                        take over the top spot. 

                                 MADY
                        Fuck! I can’t believe this.  

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - DAY

           Mady peers in the mirror, studying herself from different 
           angles. She tries to calm her hair and put on some makeup, 
           but ends up making a disgusted face at her appearance. 

           INT. MADY’S CAR - LATER

           Mady drives on a busy road. Suddenly, her engine makes a loud 
           noise, cuts out and smoke pours out from under the hood. She 
           climbs out of the car, checks her watch, then looks around. A 
           gas station is visible far off in the distance. 

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - DAY

           Scott and Mike stand at the ticket podium. 

                                 MIKE
                        So have you thought about your 
                        prank? I was thinking, you could 
                        put cum and smegma in the popcorn 
                        oil. I mean, we’ve done it before, 
                        but it would fulfill your duty.
                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, then I could fuck a pie. No, 
                        my prank is happening later today.

           Courtesy Cup Man approaches. Mike rips his ticket.

                                 MIKE
                        That’ll be to your right. Enjoy.

           Courtesy Cup Man walks to his theater.

                                 SCOTT
                        Isn’t he like an hour early?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, yeah, that’s Courtesy Cup Man.

                                 SCOTT
                        Who?

                                 MIKE
                        He comes in, calls a 900 number and 
                        then jerks it in a theater.

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you serious? How do you know, 
                        he... you know?

                                 MIKE
                        He leaves a cup full of evidence.

                                 SCOTT
                        Nasty.

           Suddenly, Mady bursts through the front doors, looking at the 
           lines of customers. She is covered in soot.

           INT. CINEPLEX KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mady pulls her uniform shirt over her T-shirt. Scott enters.

                                 SCOTT
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 MADY
                        Don’t look at me, I look like crap. 
                        I had to walk three miles to get a 
                        tow truck just to get here.

                                 SCOTT
                        You don’t look bad. You just don’t 
                        look... good.
                                 MADY
                        Thanks.

                                 SCOTT
                        Why didn’t you call me?

                                 MADY
                        I don’t have a cell. Can’t afford 
                        one. I have to go. Tia’s probably 
                        wiping the floor with me now.

           Scott gives her a peck as she hurries out. She beams.

           INT. CONCESSION STAND - LATER

           Mady cleans as Mr. Fish calls Tia over and they confer.  

           LATER

           Mr. Fish calls Finn over and discusses something with him. 
           Finn returns and Mady walks up to him.

                                 MADY
                        What was that all about? Did Tia 
                        win the contest already?

                                 FINN
                        No. Uh, I better help that guy.

           He walks off.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mr. Fish looks around his lobby with pride. A couple of PUNK 
           KIDS walk by, laughing at him.

                                 PUNK KID
                        Nice headlights, buddy.

           Mr. Fish instinctively covers his nipples, but when he looks 
           down, there’s nothing wrong with his shirt. Confused, he 
           looks around and notices most patrons are smiling or stifling 
           giggles in his direction. He notices a LAUGHING COUPLE 
           looking back toward the screen in theater three as they exit.

           INT. THEATER THREE - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Fish bursts in, looking around. ON THE SCREEN, in the 
           same format as the typical pre-preview drivel...
           A header reading “A Week With Claude Fish”. Below, a large 
           picture of Mr. Fish, at a hobby shop, deciding between a 
           model kit of a plane or a “Paint Your Own Orc” kit. 
           Underneath it reads “He’s got big plans for Saturday night.”

           It snaps to the next slide, a photo of Mr. Fish in the food 
           court, taking a giant bite of a foot-long hot dog. Underneath 
           it reads “He just loves big, long meat in his mouth”. 

           IN THE THEATER

           Mr. Fish turns red. Patrons turn around and look at him.

           ON THE SCREEN

           Another slide. This one’s a giant photo of a pasty, shirtless 
           Mr. Fish changing in the cineplex office. His nipples are 
           huge. It reads “His nipples are the size of plates.” 

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Fish runs, red-faced and making angry grunting sounds, to 
           the door upstairs. The second the door closes behind him, the 
           ushers crack up hysterically and high-five Scott. 

           INT. CINEPLEX OFFICE - LATER

           Mr. Fish rants at his desk. Leslie eats a gyro.

                                 MR. FISH
                        He had it in for me. Projectionists 
                        are always assholes. He wanted my 
                        job, but this is my kingdom. My 
                        kingdom! And I sent him packing, 
                        didn’t I? Yeah, I did.

                                 LESLIE
                             (not listening)
                        Uh-huh.

           Mady enters and plops in a chair.

                                 MADY
                        You rang?

                                 MR. FISH
                        And now I have to deal with this. 
                        Breathe it out, Claude.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. FISH (CONT'D)
                             (long, successful calming 
                              breath)
                        So, Mady, is there anything you 
                        want to tell me?

                                 MADY
                        About what? 

                                 MR. FISH
                        You’re a valuable asset to our team 
                        here, so I can overlook this if you 
                        just come clean.

                                 MADY
                        Come clean about what? 

           Mady looks at Leslie, who shrugs.

                                 MR. FISH
                        Last night your drawer was three 
                        hundred dollars short. 

                                 MADY
                        What?

                                 MR. FISH
                        If you give the money back today, 
                        I’ll let you keep your job.

                                 MADY
                        You think I stole it?!

                                 MR. FISH
                        You were going to lose the contest, 
                        you needed the money, I understand. 
                        But we could have worked something 
                        out. You didn’t have to do this.

                                 MADY
                        I didn’t, I swear! I’m not stupid!

                                 MR. FISH
                        I know. I’m told you were so smart 
                        as to figure out a way to open the 
                        registers without a key.

           Mady’s jaw drops. 

                                 MR. FISH
                        If you don’t return it, Mady, I’m 
                        going to have to fire you.

                                 MADY
                        I didn’t take it. I swear!
           Mr. Fish considers.

                                 MR. FISH
                        Okay. Go home. You can return the 
                        uniform at your leisure. 

                                 MADY
                        Mr. Fish!

                                 MR. FISH
                        Sorry, Mady.

           Mady wanders out, stunned.

           CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady walks up to the stand. Nick talks to Simon and Finn.

                                 MADY
                        I just got fired.

                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 MADY
                        They think I stole three hundred 
                        bucks from my register. 

           Finn and Simon look at each other, silent for a long moment.

                                 FINN
                        You know, it wouldn’t be that big 
                        of a deal to us if you did do it. 

                                 MADY
                             (shocked, blinking)
                        You think I did it?

                                 FINN
                        You have been talking about the 
                        money thing a lot, Mads, and --

                                 MADY
                        You know what? Fuck you guys.

           She storms out. Nick turns to Finn and Simon.

                                 NICK
                        Are you kidding? The day she steals 
                        something is the day Mike stops 
                        sucking cock. 
                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Your Mom taught me how!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Emily walks by Mady’s locker.

                                 MADY
                        Hey, Ems, do you have an extra T-
                        shirt? I forgot again. 

                                 EMILY
                        No, I don’t. You can’t count on me 
                        for everything, Mady.

           She keeps walking.

                                 MADY
                        Em, wait! 

           Emily turns around from a distance.

                                 MADY
                        I’m sorry about the prom. Scott --

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t fucking care! Enjoy your 
                        prom, Mady. I hope it’s worth it.

           She storms off.

           INT. MALL FOOD COURT - DAY

           Mady dunks waffle fries in a pool of ketchup, depressed. 
           Shelley wears her uniform and drinks coffee. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        She’ll get over it. Give it time.

                                 MADY
                        I’ve never seen her like that.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Let’s change the subject. I don’t 
                        have a dress for Melissa’s prom.

                                 MADY
                        I don’t think I even own a dress.

                                 SHELLEY
                        I know. Guess where we’re going.
                                 MADY
                        Oh no.

           MONTAGE: DRESS STORE - MADY & SHELLEY GO SHOPPING

           -- Mady looks unhappy as Shelley drags her inside. 

           -- Mady and Shelley go through the racks, pulling items. 

           -- Shelley wears a skimpy dress, Mady wears what appears to 
           be Victorian-era garb. They look at each other. 

           -- Shelley and Mady go through the racks again. This time 
           they hand each other the dresses they've picked out. 

           -- Shelley wears an ugly long-sleeve gown. Mady comes out in 
           a tiny, trashy dress, trying to cover herself up. Shelley 
           gives her the thumbs up. Mady shakes her head. 

           -- Mady comes out of the dressing room in a red gown. A very 
           old woman is in front of the mirror in an extremely slutty 
           dress and stripper heels. Mady is surprised and appalled. 

           END MONTAGE 

           Shelley wears a beautiful strapless black gown. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        That’s the one, Mads.

                                 MADY (O.C.)
                        Eh. It’s kind of uncomfortable. I 
                        feel like everyone can see my 
                        kibbles n’ bits.

                                 SHELLEY
                        You don’t know anyone at his 
                        school, anyway, do you?

           Mady looks great in a low-cut, form-fitting silver gown.  

                                 MADY
                        Just Mike, who’s not going. He’s 
                        probably spending the money on 
                        hookers instead. And Joe, who I 
                        can’t imagine attending any prom. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        So get it. 

           Mady looks at the price tag, staggered.
                                 MADY
                        Harry Belafonte! No, I can’t. 

           Shelley pulls out her wallet. 

                                 SHELLEY
                        Then I’m getting it for you.

                                 MADY
                        I’m not letting you buy me a dress.

                                 SHELLEY
                        I know you’re good for the money. 
                        Besides, you have no choice. I’m 
                        buying it, and if you don’t wear 
                        it, then you’ve wasted my money and 
                        you’re a shitty friend.

                                 MADY
                        Well, when you put it that way.

           The two look at their reflection in the mirror. Mady grins 
           despite herself. The old lady appears next to them in her 
           underwear, squealing. Mady and Shelley back away slowly.

           EXT. MADY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Scott knocks at the front door.

                                 MADY (O.S.)
                        Hey, go wait in front of the 
                        garage, okay? I’m going to do a 
                        dramatic reveal.

           He walks around and stands in the middle of the driveway. The 
           garage door hums to life and ascends. Manicured toes in 
           silver heels appear, then the bottom of a silky silver 
           dress... then the garage door makes a giant squealing noise 
           and grinds very slowly and loudly to a halt. Scott cracks up.

                                 MADY (O.S.)
                        Fuck!

           The pretty foot kicks the door violently. After some banging 
           and cursing, Mady emerges from the side door. She looks 
           amazing in her dress with beautifully done hair and makeup.

                                 SCOTT
                        Wow.
                                 MADY
                        Fucking door. It was supposed to be 
                        more “She’s All That” and less 
                        “Sanford and Son”. 

           MADY’S DAD emerges from the house, wearing no socks or shoes.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Hey, not so fast. Your mother wants 
                        to get some pictures.

           Mady’s Mom bursts out of the house, holding two tiny 
           chihuahuas. She squishes the dogs under one arm and starts 
           taking way too many photos. Mady mouths “Sorry” to Scott. 

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        And who is this lucky young man?

                                 SCOTT
                        Hello, sir. I’m Scott.

           Scott extends his hand and they shake. The camera flash goes 
           off non-stop. The dogs bark and it’s clear that they’re the 
           ones who have been making all the noise. 

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Nice to meet you. Wow. My girl is 
                        going to prom. It seems like just 
                        yesterday she was in diapers!  
                             (to Scott)
                        Cloth diapers, too, during our eco-
                        friendly phase. And wow, could she 
                        leave you a big ol’ stink bomb --

                                 MADY
                        Dad!

                                 MADY’S DAD
                             (whisper, to Mady)
                        What? Everybody poops. 
                             (takes a good look at her)
                        You look really beautiful, kiddo. 
                        Like... a young woman. I can’t 
                        believe you’re growing up so fast.

           He tries to shush the dogs, which are quite annoying.

                                 MADY’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        I know we don’t say this enough --
                             (tries to shush the dogs)
                        but your Mom and I are very proud --

           The dogs turn it up as Scott attempts to pet one of them.
                                 MADY’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        of you and we love you very --

           The barking is unbearable. Mady’s Dad snaps, putting his face 
           up to the tiny dogs’ faces.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                             (filled with rage)
                        SHUT UP! I will drown you in your 
                        water dish, you ugly little rats!

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Don’t you yell at them!

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Don’t get me started, Louise!

                                 MADY 
                        Yeah, we’re gonna go.

           Mady’s Dad smiles at them.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Okay, guys. Have fun! Be careful!

           Mady drags Scott to his car.

                                 MADY 
                        I’m so sorry. When other people are 
                        around, they try to act like 
                        parents of the year. Crackheads.

           He smiles and holds open the car door.

                                 SCOTT
                        No problem. You look beautiful. 
                        Ready for the big night?

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

           Mady and Scott enter, scanning the room. Joe appears in a 
           floor-length silver gown. He and Mady look at each other and 
           then down at their dresses. Joe storms off in a huff. They 
           find their table and sit.

                                 SCOTT
                        Want something to drink?

                                 MADY
                        Sure. Sprite?
                                 SCOTT
                             (heads off)
                        You got it.

           LATER

           Prom is in full swing, students get their pictures taken, 
           dance, make out, etc. Joe sneaks up and spikes the punch with 
           O’Doul’s. Mady and Scott dance close. Scott’s jacket is off. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You ready to get out of here?

                                 MADY
                        Let’s go.

           He smiles and grabs his jacket, escorting her out.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Mady looks toward the king-sized bed. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Like it?

                                 MADY
                        It’s a really nice room. Good idea.

           She kicks off her shoes and lays down on the bed, smiling at 
           Scott seductively. He is shocked.

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s gotten into you?

                                 MADY
                        Nothing yet.

           She laughs at his expression and pulls him onto her. They 
           make out, disrobing. Mady’s underwear matches. She takes a 
           deep breath and lets him take off her panties, which he 
           promptly throws across the room. He looks at her body.

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re beautiful, Madeline.

           He leans in, kissing her. After a long period of making out, 
           he grabs his wallet and pulls out a condom. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You ready for this? 
           He kisses her neck, working his way down her chest. She opens 
           her eyes, looking around. As he works back up, she looks at 
           his hair for a long moment. He gets on top of her and puts on 
           the condom. For a long moment, she looks anxious and 
           conflicted. He tries to kiss her again, but she pulls back.  

                                 MADY
                        No, I’m not.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?!

                                 MADY
                        I thought I was ready, but I’m not. 
                        If you care about me, you can wait 
                        for me to be okay with this.

                                 SCOTT
                        Jesus. Do you think I’m not good 
                        enough to be your first or 
                        something?

                                 MADY
                        Wait, how do you know about that?

                                 SCOTT
                        Guys talk, Mady. Don’t be naïve. 

                                 MADY
                        Is that why you’re dating me? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Can we please just try again? I’ll 
                        go slow, I promise. 

                                 MADY
                        I just can’t tonight. I’m sorry.

                                 SCOTT
                             (turns away)
                        You’re gonna stay a virgin forever, 
                        aren’t you? You get off on giving 
                        guys blue balls or something?

           She gets up and wraps herself in the sheet, trying to find 
           her underwear. He stays on the bed, confidently naked.  

                                 MADY
                        Okay, I’m glad I didn’t do this.

           She’s most of the way dressed. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Me too. I was doing you a favor, 
                        you know. You’re never gonna get a 
                        guy like me again, you’re not that 
                        pretty. Chicks like Tia, who I plan 
                        on fucking as soon as possible, by 
                        the way, they get us hot guys. All 
                        you can get is your loser friends.

                                 MADY
                        You mean I’ll never find another 
                        karate loser with no redeeming 
                        qualities...
                             (she looks at his crotch)
                        ...and a miniscule dick? Oh no! 

                                 SCOTT
                        How would you even know it’s small, 
                        Puritan? Get the fuck out.

                                 MADY
                        With pleasure. Hey, have fun being 
                        that guy who’s forty, fat, bald and 
                        alone, wondering why no one loves 
                        him and why he’s crawling with 
                        painful, itchy venereal diseases. 

           She slams the door on her way out.

           EXT. MADY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mady walks to the door. A paper taped to it reads:

           “IT’S AFTER TWO. DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT COMING IN. - M & D”

           She tries the door, groans and stomps back to her car, taking 
           a detour to trample some innocent flowers near the driveway 
           into colorful mush. She climbs back into...

           HER CAR

           and punches the dashboard. She shakes her hand, making a loud 
           angry sound. Tears fall as she stares through the windshield, 
           jaw clenching. Finally she exhales and leans her head back.

           INT. MADY’S CAR - DAY

           Mady wakes up in her dress, makeup smeared, hair everywhere. 
           Her Dad knocks on the window.
                                 MADY’S DAD
                        You can come in now.

           INT. MADY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mady walks in to the usual barking. Mady’s Dad cooks and her 
           Mom reads “O” magazine, clipping out every article. 

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Want some breakfast? I’m making 
                        banana pancakes.

                                 MADY
                        Banana pancakes?! You made me sleep 
                        in my freakin’ car!

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Don’t be so melodramatic, it’s not 
                        like we live in the ghetto. And you 
                        knew the punishment for being late.

                                 MADY
                        It was my prom, Mom! And I HAVE to 
                        come in late all the time. How else 
                        do you think I pay for things?

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        We’ve talked about this. Struggles 
                        like this build character.

                                 MADY
                        I don’t have character? I don’t do 
                        drugs, smoke, I get good grades. 
                        You’re lucky to have a kid like me 
                        and you treat me like a nuisance! 

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Well, you are a nuisance sometimes.

                                 MADY
                        Oh my God! Here’s an idea- why not 
                        show some “character” and handle 
                        YOUR responsibility as a parent?

           She storms out and up the stairs.

                                 MADY’S MOM
                        Madeline, get back in here! Now!

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        Damn it, Louise! Let her be! 
           Mady’s Mom is taken aback and shuts her mouth, blinking.

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - LATER

           Mady lays on her bed, black mascara tears running down her 
           face. There’s a soft knock at the door. Her dad peeks in.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        You okay?

                                 MADY
                        No.

           He walks over and sits on the bed.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        You’re right, Mady. You are a good 
                        kid. But we’re tough on you because 
                        we love you. We’re trying to 
                        prepare you for the world. It can 
                        be a hard place sometimes.

           She laughs, then starts sobbing. He puts his arm around her.

                                 MADY’S DAD
                        What’s wrong, kiddo?

                                 MADY
                        I got fired, dumped, my friends 
                        hate me. Oh, and I deserve it all. 
                        Forget it. Can you just please go?

           He looks at her, then kisses her forehead, rises and exits.

           LATER

           Mady is still in bed. Another gentle knock on the door. 

                                 MADY
                        I just want to be alone, okay?

           The door opens. Emily and Rob enter wearing outrageously bad 
           80’s prom dresses and carrying movies, candy and magazines.

                                 EMILY
                        Too bad.

                                 MADY
                             (sits up)
                        What the hell?
                                 EMILY
                        Your dad called and said you were 
                        really upset. I figured it must be 
                        bad if he was calling me.

                                 ROB
                        It’s anti-prom time, bitch.

                                 EMILY
                        Now, before you tell us what 
                        happened...

           She pulls out a teal dress and tosses it to Mady.

           LATER

           Mady wears her hideous teal taffeta dress. Emily and Rob sit 
           with her on the bed.

                                 EMILY
                        That stupid little shit.

           She hugs Mady, then Rob joins in the hug. After a moment, 
           Mady sniffs and leans her head on Emily’s shoulder.

                                 MADY
                        I don’t deserve this... I know we 
                        don’t do the mushy shit, but I love 
                        you guys. Really. 
                             (long, long silence)
                        Uh, I don’t know about you, but I’m 
                        starting to get uncomfortable here.

           They break the hug quickly, avoiding eye contact and clearing 
           their throats.

                                 EMILY
                        I think it’s candy time. Whopper?

                                 MADY
                        Malt ball me. I’m sorry you had to 
                        deal with the spazzitude, guys. 
                        He’s probably out screwing some 
                        girl, not thinking about it at all. 

           INT. BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Scott, Mike and Usher 1 sit at the table, eating. 
                                 SCOTT 
                        I was on the verge of busting V-
                        chip number eight, but she had to 
                        fuck it up. Frozen tundra snatch.

                                 MIKE
                        You passed lucky seven? Shit, I 
                        have some catching up to do, bro.

           Nick enters, going to his locker behind Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        She actually said she was afraid to 
                        go to college because she didn’t 
                        think she’d make friends. Loser!

                                 MIKE
                        So, what, you just dumped her?

                                 SCOTT
                        It was kind of funny, actually. She 
                        was laying there, naked in the bed, 
                        and I told her to put out or get 
                        her fugly ass out of the room.

           Nick walks by, glaring at Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        You got a problem, musclehead?

                                 NICK
                        You’re a little prick, that’s all.

                                 SCOTT
                        Excuse me?

                                 NICK
                        Mady’s a good chick, and you’re a 
                        worthless piece of shit. So yeah, I 
                        guess I do have a problem.

                                 SCOTT
                        You want to fight, tough guy? I’ll 
                        take this outside right now.

                                 NICK
                        Why walk? 

                                 USHER 1
                        Guys, chill. Let’s all just relax.

           Scott gets up and goes into a karate stance. 
                                 MIKE
                        This is awesome.

           Scott quickly elbows Nick in the face, then tries to do a 
           roundhouse kick. Nick grabs his leg, wrenches it with a loud 
           CRACK, and punches him. Scott goes down, whimpering. 

           INT. MADY’S ROOM - LATER

           Anti-prom remnants are strewn about. Mady pulls her uniform 
           out of her bag and the can of macadamia nuts falls out. She 
           picks it up, staring at it for a long moment.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady enters purposefully, carrying her neatly folded uniform 
           and the can of nuts. Mike is at the podium. When she plops 
           the uniform in front of him, he quickly shuffles his “Marie 
           Claire” under some papers. She looks at him, surprised.

                                 MADY
                        Um, could you send this up to 
                        Leslie when you get a chance?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure. That’s not mine, by the way.

                                 MADY
                        Uh-huh. Do you know where Nick is?

                                 MIKE
                        I think he’s in the supply room. 
                        You here to reward your little 
                        knight in shining armor? 

                                 MADY
                        Knight in shining armor? 

                                 MIKE
                        No one told you? Your boy beat the 
                        crap out of Scott today.

                                 MADY
                        What? Why?

                                 MIKE
                        Scott was talking shit about you 
                        and Nick beat his ass.

           Mady pauses, surprised, before walking down the hall.
           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           The door swings open and Mady is visible in the doorway.

                                 MADY
                        Nick, I want to apologi --

           Her mouth drops when she sees him making out with someone in 
           the corner. Nick steps back, revealing the girl - Tia! - who 
           shoots Mady a haughty smile. Mady turns and hurries out.

                                 NICK
                        Mady, wait!

           INT. CINEPLEX HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 NICK
                             (chasing after her)
                        It’s not what you think. I was just 
                        trying to get inside her --

                                 MADY
                        I don’t want to know about it!

                                 NICK
                        Head! I need to feel her up. I 
                        mean, feel her out. 

                                 MADY
                        I don’t need the details, Nick!

           Mady pushes out the exit door. Nick looks after her.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Mady hurls the can as hard as she can and gets into her car. 
           The nuts hit an OLD MAN in the face. His WIFE looks around.

                                 WIFE
                        What was that?

                                 OLD MAN
                             (peers at the can)
                        Punk threw his nuts on my face!
           INT. MADY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mady is engrossed in a Ryan Reynolds movie when someone 
           knocks. Mady gets up and opens the door to find Shelley, who 
           enters, looking around at the needlepoint rooster pictures.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Wow. That’s a lotta cock. I came to 
                        see how you’re doing. 

                                 MADY
                        I’m alright, I guess. Have a seat.  

           Shelley plops on the couch.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Work just isn’t the same without 
                        you. My box feels so empty.

                                 MADY
                        I’m sure Melissa can help with 
                        that. They ever find the money?

                                 SHELLEY
                        No. No money’s disappeared since, 
                        so they’re convinced you did it.

           They stare at the TV. Mady looks irked.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Tia’s really revelling in your 
                        absence, by the way. She’s been 
                        acting like she’s Popcorn Master or 
                        something, bossing Simon and Finn 
                        around and not doing shit. 

           Mady shakes her head.

                                 SHELLEY
                        And she and Nick are eating each 
                        other’s faces all over the place. 
                        So gross.

           Mady is more irritated.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Finn says she talks shit about you 
                        all the time, too. She said you --

                                 MADY
                             (stands, furious)
                        Goddamn it!

                        I’m so sick of people fucking with 
                        me! It’s like I’m wearing a sign 
                        that says “Shit on me”. What the 
                        hell? I’m a good person. Why don’t 
                        I get respect?

                                 SHELLEY
                        Your fly is down.

                                 MADY
                             (zips up)
                        Thanks. I think it’s time I got 
                        some shit off my chest.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Ooh, hot lunch. Can I watch?

                                 MADY
                        Let’s go.

           INT. CINEPLEX LOBBY - LATER

           Mady and Shelley enter. Simon and Finn are behind the stand.

                                 SIMON
                        Mady!

           She walks over to the stand.

                                 MADY
                        I didn’t steal the money, you guys 
                        are asses for thinking I did, you 
                        hurt my feelings, and I deserve a 
                        fucking apology.

                                 SIMON
                        I’ve been feeling terrible all 
                        week. I’m really sorry, Mads. 

                                 FINN
                        I’m sorry, too. Forgive-sies?

                                 MADY
                        A, forgive-sies? B, it’s fine. I 
                        can see how you jumped to your 
                        errant and hurtful assumption.   

           Finn and Simon look at her, uncomfortable.

                                 MADY
                        Yeah, you’re going to get crap 
                        about this for a while.

                        And now I can pick your pockets and 
                        there’s no way you’ll accuse me of 
                        it. 

           She grins and walks off with Shelley. They reach the door 
           upstairs and Tia bursts out, slamming into Mady’s shoulder.

                                 MADY
                        Watch where you’re going.

                                 TIA
                        What did you say? 

                                 SHELLEY
                             (loudly)
                        I said you’re a dirty WHORE.

                                 TIA
                        Just because you can’t pay a guy to 
                        fuck you doesn’t mean I’m a whore.

                                 SHELLEY
                        I’m gay, you moron.

                        Had to send a spy, huh? Didn’t have 
                        the guts to confront me yourself? 

                                 MADY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 TIA
                        You’re a jealous bitch. Oh, and, 
                        according to Scott, you’re flat and 
                        your ass is covered in cellulite.

           Mady steps forward, straightening up and looming over Tia.

                                 MADY
                        You know I can beat the shit out of 
                        you, right? Best run along.

                        money on vibrators and Ho-Ho’s.

           She walks away.

           STAIRWELL

           where Mady breathes out deeply. Shelley beams.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Since when are you such a badass? 
                        I’m not gonna lie, I’m a little 
                        turned on right now. 

                                 MADY
                        There’s more where that came from.

           INT. CINEPLEX OFFICE - LATER

           Shelley and Mady enter. Leslie smiles as Mr. Fish stands.

                                 MADY
                        Don’t call the cops. I want to say 
                        something, and then I’ll go. I’ve 
                        been working here for two years, I 
                        have a spotless record, you have no 
                        reason to think I’d steal, no proof 
                        that I did, and you’re an idiot for 
                        firing me. Have a nice day.

                                 MR. FISH
                        I know.

                                 MADY
                        Wait, what?

                                 MR. FISH
                        Tia was the one who stole the 
                        money. She lied and told me she saw 
                        you do it. I was about to call to 
                        hire you back.

                                 MADY
                        Really?

                                 MR. FISH
                        Yes. Though I’m not a fan of your 
                        tone, I am sorry about the error. 
                        Hopefully this’ll ease the pain.

           He hands her an envelope.

                                 MR. FISH
                        A check for the time you missed and 
                        the cash for winning the contest.
                                 MADY
                        Holy crap. Thanks.

                                 MR. FISH
                        Yeah, yeah. Get out of here before 
                        I change my mind. 

                                 MADY
                        Wait, how’d you get her to confess?

                                 LESLIE
                        A trap. Wanna see? 

                                 MADY
                        Sure. 

                                 LESLIE
                             (checks her watch)
                        Follow me.

           INT. THEATER THREE - LATER

           Mady, Shelley and Leslie enter. Nick sits in the back with 
           his feet up while the other ushers clean. One uses the noisy 
           trash blower. Leslie points to Nick.

                                 LESLIE
                        There it is. 
                             (to Shelley)
                        We should go.

           They leave and Mady looks confused. She walks over to Nick. 
           They have to shout back and forth to hear each other.

                                 NICK
                        What’s up?

                                 MADY
                        Leslie said they set a trap for Tia 
                        and it’s in here somewhere? 

                                 NICK
                        That would be me. 

                                 MADY
                        What? How? And why would you want 
                        your girlfriend fired?
                                 NICK
                        She’s not my girlfriend, dumbass. I 
                        hooked up with her to find out who 
                        stole the money. I knew you were 
                        too goody two-shoes to do it.

           Mady plops down in the chair next to him.

                                 NICK
                        When she finally confessed, I told 
                        the Fish. Then washed my mouth out 
                        with Clorox.

                                 MADY
                        Wow. Thank you. 

                                 NICK
                        No problem. Missed having you 
                        around, I guess.

                                 MADY
                        Well, I owe you a doubly huge 
                        apology now. 

                                 NICK
                        Yup. 

                                 MADY
                        Sorry I was such a twat. Under the 
                        deviant exterior you’re a good guy. 
                        I should have treated you like it. 
                        Oh, and I missed you a little, too. 

                                 NICK
                        You want me so bad.

                                 MADY
                        Oh, and thanks for the nuts.

                                 NICK
                        I really want to make a joke about 
                        my balls, but I won’t.

                                 MADY
                        Thanks for that. So, can we go back 
                        to the way things were? 

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

           The usher turns off the blower. 
                                 MADY
                             (still shouting)
                        Come on, please?

                                 NICK
                        No Mady, I will not let you blow me 
                        in the break room again!

           The ushers stare. Mady punches him.

                                 NICK
                        Fine. Just do one thing for me.

                                 MADY
                        What?

                                 NICK
                        You know.

           Mady looks confused, then rolls her eyes.

                                 MADY
                        Dick.

           She stands up and flashes him her bra. The other ushers 
           applaud. She pulls down her shirt, embarrassed. 

                                 NICK
                        Spank you very much.

           The ushers pack up and head to the door. 

                                 NICK
                        I better go. Theater two is up. 

           He rises and pulls Mady up. They stand face to face. 

                                 MADY
                        Thanks, Nick. Really.

                                 NICK
                        You’re welcome, Mad Dog.

           She hugs him and they linger in the embrace. When they 
           separate, they stare into each other’s eyes. Mady leans in, 
           closing hers, romantic music swells, and... Nick turns and 
           exits. Mady stands, dazed, then marches out. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mady storms up and grabs Nick by the shoulder. 
                                 MADY
                        WHAT... THE... FUCK?

                                 NICK
                        What? 

                                 MADY
                        What just happened?

                                 NICK
                        Uh, I swept up a candy wrapper?

                                 MADY
                        No, idiot. Why didn’t you kiss me? 

                                 NICK
                        Why would I do that?!

                                 MADY
                        I leaned in! I fucking leaned in! 
                        What the hell do you think is wrong 
                        with me? It’s gotta be big for a 
                        nondiscriminatory pig like you to 
                        not want a piece.  

           He is shocked into silence.

                                 MADY
                        All the times we flirted, what were 
                        you doing, screwing with me? You 
                        know what? I don’t even care. I’m 
                        great, Nick. If you can’t see it, 
                        someone else will. 

           She storms off, he grabs her arm.

                                 MADY
                        What are you doing?

           He pulls her toward a theater.

                                 NICK 
                        I want to answer your question.

                                 MADY
                        I really don’t care. Get off of me!

           He drags her into...

           THEATER THREE

           and turns to her.
                                 NICK
                        You’re a nerd, and you can be mean 
                        and selfish and you make crappy 
                        choices about guys and you use big 
                        words even when you’re mad. 

                                 MADY
                        Gee, thanks. Can I go now?

                                 NICK
                        Shut up! You talk too much, too.

           Steam practically shoots out of her ears. 

                                 NICK
                        Obviously I want you. Doesn’t mean 
                        it should happen.

                                 MADY
                        Wait, what?

                                 NICK
                        I said I want you, retard. But 
                        you’re smart and funny and awesome, 
                        and I’m an idiot and a jerk.

                                 MADY
                        You’re not an idiot.

           He lets go of her arm.

                                 NICK
                        You and I have nothing in common, 
                        Mady. You’re books and PBS, I’m 
                        drive shafts and movies with things 
                        that blow up.

                                 MADY
                        I like things that blow up.

                                 NICK
                        Come on. How are you gonna feel 
                        when you realize the guy you lost 
                        it to is going to community college 
                        and’ll probably end up working at a 
                        gas station like his Dad? You’ll 
                        feel gypped and I’ll feel like a 
                        stupid fucking loser, which is how 
                        I feel around you sometimes 
                        already. You should find someone 
                        more on your level. I --

           She grabs him and kisses him. He leans away.
                                 NICK
                        Didn’t you listen to anything I 
                        just said, woman?

                                 MADY
                        That’s why I kissed you. 

                                 NICK
                             (confused)
                        Oh-kay.

                                 MADY
                        I decide who’s on my level, 
                        jackass. 

           She smacks him in the back of the head, then kisses him 
           again. This time he kisses back tentatively.

                                 NICK
                        And you’re sure?

                                 MADY
                        Oh yeah.

                                 NICK
                        Good.

           He grabs her and pushes her against the wall, kissing her 
           passionately. They fumble into a seat and she straddles him, 
           still kissing. She leans away.

                                 MADY
                        PBS?

                                 NICK
                        I couldn’t think of anything else 
                        snotty and dorky.

                                 MADY
                        You’re an asshole.

           She kisses him again and pulls off his uniform shirt. 

           Courtesy Cup Man turns around in his seat at the front of the 
           theater and watches. He eventually rises, buckles his belt, 
           plops two cups on the armrest and exits. Mady and Nick don’t 
           even notice.

           LATER

           Mady and Nick lie on the floor next to one another, sweaty, 
           out of breath and half-clothed.
                                 NICK
                        Whoa. 

                                 MADY
                        Holy crap.

                                 NICK
                        Oh yeah, I’m awesome. 

                                 MADY
                        You’re a dork.
                             (stretches her legs)
                        Should’ve done that a while ago.

                                 NICK
                        Like I said, I’m awesome.

                                 MADY
                        So, was the big speech all a ploy 
                        to get a piece?

                                 NICK
                        I meant it, but yeah, pretty much.

                                 MADY
                        I figured. So, how do I rate?

                                 NICK
                        Rate?

                                 MADY
                        Compared to your others.

                                 NICK
                        Others?

                                 MADY
                             (wide-eyed)
                        Oh. Really?

                                 NICK 
                             (clears his throat)
                        We better get out of here.

           They get dressed and walk out to... 

           THE LOBBY

           where Nick’s demeanor suddenly turns serious.

                                 NICK
                        I’m not gonna lie, Mady. 
                             (sighs)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        I’m a little disappointed you 
                        weren’t wearing the giant panties.

                                 MADY
                             (laughs)
                        Maybe I’ll let you view them in 
                        their royal enormity another time. 

           They stand in silence for an awkward moment.

                                 NICK
                        So...

                                 MADY 
                        So... when do you get off work?

                                 NICK
                        Same time as always. Why?

                                 MADY
                        Well, I no longer have a curfew. 
                        Maybe we could go for a ride in 
                        your Suburban?

           Mady looks at him suggestively and turns toward the stand. 
           Nick watches her sashay off, then does a grandiose fist pump.

                                 NICK
                        I am the fucking man!

           He continues down the hallway, arms raised and humming the 
           “Rocky” theme. Mady, her back still to him, laughs.
