         THE BLACK LIST was compiled from the suggestions of over 250 film executives, each of whom 
         contributed the names of up to ten of their favorite scripts that were written in, or are 
         somehow uniquely associated with, 2008 and will not be released in theaters during this 
         calendar year.

         This year, scripts had to receive at least four mentions to be included on THE BLACK LIST.

         All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.  THE BLACK 
         LIST apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation 
         identification, and questionable “2008” affiliations.

         It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating: 

         THE BLACK LIST is not a “best of” list.  It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

         Enjoy.
