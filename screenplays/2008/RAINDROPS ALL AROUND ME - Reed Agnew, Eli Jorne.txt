           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           ARTHUR OVERMEYER, mid 30’s, is standing at the front of the 
           classroom. He is an awkwardly bookish high school science 
           teacher with a short trimmed beard. He wiggles his body and 
           gyrates his hips in some sort of BIZARRE DANCE.

           ANGLE ON: The students in Arthur’s class all look disgusted 
           by the seemingly sexual nature of his strange hip thrusts.

           Arthur finishes his dance and catches his breath.

                                 ARTHUR
                        And that is exactly how a forager 
                        bee communicates the location of a 
                        newfound source of nectar. Us bee 
                        enthusiasts like to playfully call 
                        it the “waggle dance.”

           Arthur chuckles. The class remains silent. A slouched jock 
           named GREG raises his hand. He is wearing an upside down 
           visor cocked to the side.

                                 GREG
                        Dude, bees blow.

                                 ARTHUR
                        They blow?

                                 GREG
                        One time, I was trying to bash this 
                        bee hive with a tennis racquet. And 
                        the bees like totally went psycho. 
                        What’s that about?

                                 FAT STUDENT
                        Yeah, that happened to me, too. And 
                        bees like hurt.

           There are murmurs of agreement throughout the class.

                                 ARTHUR
                        When bees feel threatened, they 
                        release pheromones that stimulate 
                        an attack response in other bees. 
                        Does that make sense to you, Greg?

           From the vacant expression on Greg’s face, we can see that it 
           doesn’t. A hot popular girl, SOPHIE, chimes in.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Bees killed my little cousin, so...
                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, Sophie, that’s terrible about 
                        your cousin. But in a way, bees 
                        also give us life. Through 
                        pollination, they provide for one 
                        third of our food supply.

                                 SOPHIE
                        My mom met you at parent-teacher 
                        conferences. She says you’re a 
                        total weirdo and I don’t have to 
                        listen to anything you say.

                                 FAT STUDENT
                        My dad thinks you’re gay.

           The class laughs. Arthur doesn’t get what’s so funny.

                                 GREG
                        Can we go?

                                 ARTHUR
                        We still have 20 minutes left, 
                        Greg. By the way, are you sure your 
                        T-shirt is appropriate for school?

           Greg sits up. We see that his T-shirt reads, “IT AIN’T GONNA 
           SUCK ITSELF,” with an arrow pointing down to his crotch.

                                 GREG
                        What? You read my shirt? Sick, 
                        dude! This message was not for you! 
                        It’s for Sophie, you perv!

           Greg points across the room to Sophie.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Students bustle through the halls between classes. Arthur 
           awkwardly makes his way through the crowd, going against the 
           flow. The students bump into him, barely noticing him.

           Arthur maneuvers around CHUCKIE, a mentally handicapped 
           janitor mopping the floor with a look of overflowing joy.

                                 CHUCKIE
                        Beautiful hallway!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, it is, Chuckie. You’re doing a 
                        great job here.
           Arthur pats Chuckie on the back and presses on.

                                 CHUCKIE
                        Happy hallway!

           INT. SNACK ROOM - DAY

           From outside in the hall, Arthur spots JASMINE TWESTON, a 
           stunningly beautiful blonde teacher in her late 20’s. She is 
           feeding money into a vending machine. Arthur pretends to 
           casually walk up, as Jasmine buys a can of FANTA GRAPE SODA.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Grape soda. Good selection.

                                 JASMINE
                        Thanks.

           Arthur seems to grow nervous as the seconds pass.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You know, I was reading an article 
                        last week about how high sugar 
                        content sodas don’t even contain 
                        trace amounts of vitamin B. So, of 
                        course, you end up with a Thiamin 
                        deficiency, right? And we all know 
                        what that can lead to.

                                 JASMINE
                        I just like the taste, I guess.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Right, the taste. I completely 
                        agree. I love it. Although, the 
                        name can be misleading.

                                 JASMINE
                        Misleading?

                                 ARTHUR
                        If you look at the ingredients: 
                        high fructose corn syrup, tartaric 
                        acid, sodium benzoate, red 40, blue 
                        1... I don’t hear grape, do you? 
                        Maybe they should call it “Tartaric 
                        Acid Surprise.”

           He chuckles. She doesn’t.

                                 JASMINE
                        I should really get to class.
           She starts to leave.

                                 ARTHUR
                        By the way, I wanted to give you an 
                        invitation to a little soirée I’m 
                        having at my place tonight.

           He hands her a really expensive, professional looking 
           invitation for a “FACULTY FUN FEST.”

                                 JASMINE
                        Yeah, I already got the one you 
                        left on my desk. And those other 
                        ones that came in the mail last 
                        week.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, you got those? I wasn’t sure, 
                        because you never RSVP’d on the 
                        website. It should be a good time. 
                        Barry’s going to be there. Linda. 
                        Dan. Love to have you, Jasmine.

                                 JASMINE
                        Actually, it’s Ms. Tweston.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh.

                                 JASMINE
                        It keeps things more professional. 
                        In front of the students.

           There is not one student in sight.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Two teachers, DAN and BARRY, are looking at something on a 
           computer. Arthur appears in the doorway.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, Dan. Hey, Barry. Just wanted 
                        to remind you guys about my big 
                        shindig tonight.

           Dan and Barry burst out laughing at something.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        What’s so funny?
                                 BARRY
                        It’s just something Dan found on 
                        the Internet. But it’s probably the 
                        funniest thing I’ve ever seen.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Show me. I’d love to see it.

           Dan turns the monitor so that Arthur can see the website. 
           It’s just a picture of a penis with photo-shopped eyes. Dan 
           and Barry crack up all over again. Arthur looks confused.

                                 DAN
                        You don’t get it?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think I’m missing something.

                                 BARRY
                        It’s a penis that has eyes. Penis? 
                        Eyes? Hello!

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Right.

           Dan and Barry spin the monitor back around and die laughing.

                                 BARRY 
                        It’s like it’s looking at you!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           The hall is empty. Arthur is filling up his water-bottle at a 
           drinking fountain. He suddenly hears MUSIC coming from 
           somewhere. He follows the music up to a closed classroom 
           door. He peers through the window to see...

           TIM SLAVINGTON, a hip looking teacher in his late 30’s, is at 
           the front of the class. He is playing air guitar along with 
           the classic riff from AC/DC’s Back in Black. The music is 
           blaring from a boombox in the corner of the room. 40 ecstatic 
           students are up on their feet, dancing like crazy.

           The chalkboard reads, “GEOMETRY.” There is a drawing of a 
           trapezoid with a guitar neck protruding from it.

           The school bell rings. Tim dances across the room and turns 
           off the music.

                                 EVERYONE IN CLASS
                        Awwwwwww!!!
                                 TIM
                        I know, I know, AC/DC rocks. But 
                        we’ll all be back here Monday, 
                        cool? And no homework! Enjoy the 
                        weekend! Don’t party too little!

           The students laugh, as they start to collect their belongings 
           and file out of the classroom. A few long haired stoners wave 
           goodbye to Tim on their way out. Tim waves back.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Later, Terry! Later, Bob! Love the 
                        new tattoo, dude! Love it!

           ANGLE ON: Arthur glares jealously at Tim.

           INT. FACULTY LOUNGE - DAY

           The teachers eat lunch together. Arthur sits by himself at a 
           corner table. He observes Tim commanding the attention of a 
           bunch of teachers, including Jasmine, Dan and Barry. Everyone 
           laughs at something apparently hilarious that Tim just said.

           A school janitor, DONALD BERNSTEIN, early 40’s, sets his bag 
           lunch down next to Arthur. He is wearing an old, dirty 
           baseball cap that says, “ROBOTS TOOK OVER THE PLANET, AND ALL 
           I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY HAT.”

                                 DONALD
                        What’s wrong, Arthur?

           Arthur gestures toward Tim.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I hate that guy.

                                 DONALD 
                        Who, Slavington?

                                 ARTHUR
                        The kids love him. The teachers 
                        love him. What does he have that I 
                        don’t have?

                                 DONALD
                        Arthur, the man is an imbecile. If 
                        anyone should be jealous, it’s him. 
                        Did he publish a book about 
                        honeybee colony collapse disorder?
                                 ARTHUR
                        My book is going out of print, 
                        Donald. No one ever bought it.

                                 DONALD
                        I bought it. I loved it. It’s 
                        terrifying to imagine the 
                        implications of a bee-less 
                        existence. What do you think is 
                        going to happen when rice farmers 
                        in Micronesia can no longer 
                        pollinate their crops? In fact, 
                        there was a story in The Economist 
                        last month about how globalization 
                        and increased ethanol production 
                        are seriously pushing up commodity 
                        prices. That is a scary notion.

           Principal SALLY BERNSTEIN, a thin meek woman, approaches 
           their table. She kisses Donald on the cheek.

                                 SALLY
                        Hi, honey. How you guys doing?

                                 DONALD
                        Uh, we’re actually in the middle of 
                        something important here, sweetie.

                                 SALLY
                        Sorry. It’s just that someone said 
                        there’s a vomit puddle in the 
                        gymnasium, and it’s been there 
                        since third period.

                                 DONALD
                        Okay, honey. We get it. You’re the 
                        principal of the school, and your 
                        husband is the janitor. You design 
                        the curriculum, and I clean toilets 
                        for a living.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, no, no, no, I didn’t mean it 
                        like that at all, sweetie.

                                 DONALD
                        Yeah, well, the janitor’s union 
                        says I get 30 minutes for lunch. 
                        And Arthur and I were just 
                        discussing, oh, I don’t know... the 
                        imminent destruction of the world’s 
                        agricultural supply and the end of 
                        humanity?
                                 SALLY
                        Just, when you get a chance--

           Donald holds up his sandwich.

                                 DONALD
                        Also, I don’t know what your 
                        definition of extra mayonnaise is, 
                        but I thought we agreed it was two 
                        dollops.

                                 SALLY 
                        You’re right. I’m sorry, honey. You 
                        guys enjoy the rest of your lunch.

           She kisses Donald again and leaves. Donald shakes his head.

                                 DONALD
                        So annoying.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Donald, why did you decide to 
                        become a janitor? I don’t get it.

                                 DONALD
                        Janitors make more money than 
                        teachers.

           Across the lounge, Tim is receiving high-fives from all the 
           teachers. He does a stupid, goofy dance as everyone laughs.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Arthur and Donald are leaving the school building. Students 
           drive by in black SUVS, blasting FALL OUT BOY. Arthur and 
           Donald cringe at the abrasive volume and tone of the music.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll see you at my party tonight?

                                 DONALD
                        I can’t. I’ve got a Q&A with famed 
                        roboticist Rodney Brooks at 9:30.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Where?

                                 DONALD
                        Cyberspace, obviously. Like Brooks 
                        would ever leave his hyperbolic 
                        laboratory?
           They part ways to head for their separate cars.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, you’ll be missing out, buddy. 
                        It’ll be quite a party to remember. 
                        Everyone is going to be there. 

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The apartment is decorated with Neoclassical art and elegant 
           antique furniture. Untouched bowls of punch and plates of 
           hors d’oeuvres are laid out next to unopened bottles of wine. 
           A happy honeybee shaped piñata dangles from the ceiling. A 
           huge banner reads, “FACULTY FUN FEST 2008!”

           Arthur sits alone on the couch. He looks depressed. A digital 
           clock reads 10:30PM. The only sound we can hear is loud HIP 
           HOP MUSIC, LAUGHTER and the occasional SCREAM all coming from 
           the apartment next door. Arthur glances across the room.

           ANGLE ON: Arthur’s only guest is Chuckie, the mentally 
           retarded janitor. He sits in a chair with a huge smile.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Can I get you anything, Chuckie?

           Chuckie giggles in a weird creepy way. Arthur looks unnerved.

           There is a KNOCK at the door. Arthur leaps up to answer it. 
           He opens the door to reveal his neighbor, BILL, a regular 
           looking guy with a goatee.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Bill. What can I do for you?

                                 BILL
                        Hey, dude. Hope we’re not being too 
                        loud with the music next door.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Not at all. What is that, AC/DC?

                                 BILL 
                        No, it’s Young Jeezy. Listen, I’d 
                        never come over here, but I really 
                        need some condoms.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m sorry, I don’t have any.

                                 BILL
                        What about saran wrap?
                                 ARTHUR
                        Sure, Bill. Come on in.

           Arthur leaves, but Bill stays put in the hall. Arthur returns 
           with a box of saran wrap. He hands it over to Bill.

                                 BILL 
                        Usually I don’t care about 
                        protection. But you should see 
                        these skanks. It’s definitely gonna 
                        be a saran wrap night.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So it’s just you and a bunch of 
                        women? Sounds very Dionysian.

           Bill stares blankly at Arthur then turns to leave.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I’ve got an idea. Why don’t we 
                        combine parties? I wouldn’t want my 
                        ‘79 Krug Clos du Mesnil to go to 
                        waste.

           Bill peers into Arthur’s practically empty apartment. The 
           only person he sees is a happily grinning Chuckie.

                                 BILL
                        Nah, dude. But thanks for the cock 
                        wrap.

           Bill walks away. Arthur sadly closes the door.

           EXT. ED OVERMEYER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Arthur is ringing the doorbell on the front porch of a 
           suburban house. ED OVERMEYER, a grizzled, blue collar, old 
           man in a bathrobe, opens the door. He looks confused.

                                 ED
                        Arthur? What are you doing here? I 
                        thought you were having a party.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It ended a little early. And I 
                        couldn’t sleep. So I thought you 
                        might be up for a late night movie.

           Arthur holds up a DVD and a box of microwave popcorn.

                                 ED
                        A movie? It’s almost midnight.
                                 ARTHUR
                        But I really think you’ll like this 
                        one. I’ll start the popcorn, okay?

           Arthur hands his dad the DVD and heads inside.

                                 ED
                        Ingmar Bergman? Wild Strawberries? 
                        Sounds like a cooze flick.

           INT. ED OVERMEYER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           This is a typical elderly person’s home with fake flowers, a 
           bowl of old candy on a coffee table and plastic on all the 
           furniture. There is a framed picture of General George S. 
           Patton over the mantel.

           In the kitchen, Arthur heats up the popcorn. Ed enters.

                                 ED
                        Why you gotta bother me, huh? Don’t 
                        you have any friends?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re my friend, Dad.

                                 ED
                        No, I’m not. You should be out 
                        downing beers with your buddies and 
                        chasing skirt.

           Arthur notices a full bottle of pills on the kitchen counter. 
           He picks up the bottle and looks it over.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Have you not been taking your 
                        Abiraterone?

           Ed rolls his eyes.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Dad, it’s critical that you take 
                        this. Abiraterone targets proteins 
                        capable of producing hormones--

                                 ED
                        Booooooring!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Fighting your cancer is boring?
                                 ED
                        I got more important things to 
                        worry about.

           Ed points to a framed certificate on the wall. Arthur reads 
           it. It’s a VIP PASS for Ed to the “ETERNAL PARTY OF SOULS,” 
           signed by the REVEREND JACK SHORKO.

                                 ARTHUR
                        “The Eternal Party of Souls?” Dad, 
                        I told you to stop sending these 
                        people money. It’s a fraud. Their 
                        ideas about the afterlife are 
                        baseless and oversimplified.

                                 ED
                        $350 is a small price to pay for an 
                        everlasting celebration of souls at 
                        the core of Starship Earth.

           Ed takes the certificate down and kisses it.

                                 ED (CONT'D)
                        The afterlife is gonna be so fun.

           INT. ARTHUR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Arthur is lying down in a lonely king size bed. One of his 
           pillows is shaped like a giant bumblebee. A poster depicting 
           the different types of bees hangs over his bed. Along the 
           wall, there are a few stacks of unopened copies of the same 
           thick book, Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder and the Varroa 
               Destructor Mite: A Global Disaster, by ARTHUR OVERMEYER.

           Arthur glumly watches a small, old TV. He flips through the 
           channels and comes across a reality show, Mom’s Approval. The 
           host is TANNER SLADE, a good looking guy with a gelled faux-
           hawk. A couple on a couch is describing their blossoming 
           relationship. A chyron gives their names: DOUG and KRISTY.

                                 KRISTY
                        With Doug, it’s not just about sex. 
                        We have so many things in common. 
                        We party together, we drink 
                        together, we go clubbing together.

                                 DOUG
                        We go to after-hours parties 
                        together. Pool parties. We kick it.
                                 TANNER SLADE 
                        Sounds like you two were made for 
                        each other! But let’s see if they 
                        can get... MOM’S APPROVAL!

           The studio audience goes nuts, as curtains part to reveal 
           “MOM.” She stares at the couple and holds out a horizontal 
           thumb. Doug and Kristy look nervous. Will the thumb go up or 
           down?

           Suddenly, Mom’s thumb shoots upward in approval.

                                 TANNER SLADE (CONT'D)
                        Mom approves!

           The audience goes wild. Doug and Christie embrace and begin 
           kissing like porn stars. Doug’s hand rubs Christie’s crotch 
           in a way that’s inappropriate for network television.

           Bewildered by what he’s watching, Arthur turns off the TV.

           Arthur reaches over to his night-stand and picks up a high 
           school yearbook. He opens it to a picture of the beautiful 
           Social Studies teacher, JASMINE TWESTON. He forlornly gazes 
           at her picture, then hopelessly shuts the book.

           He turns out the light and lies on his back, staring at the 
           ceiling. Tears well up in his eyes. He grabs the bee pillow, 
           hugs it and buries his face in the soft comforting fuzz.

           INT. FACULTY LOUNGE - DAY

           Arthur drinks his morning coffee alone at a corner table. He 
           concentrates on a copy of Atlantic Monthly. Tim Slavington 
           approaches and pulls up a chair.

                                 TIM
                        Morning, Mr. Overmeyer.

           Arthur avoids Tim’s gaze.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How are you, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Sorry I couldn’t make it to your 
                        party Friday. I had a jacuzzi date 
                        with a yoga instructor.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t worry about it.
                                 TIM
                        How’d it go, by the way?

                                 ARTHUR
                        It was fun. Music, dancing... 
                        uninhibited inebriation.

           Tim leans in closer to Arthur.

                                 TIM
                        Nobody came, did they?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, they did.

                                 TIM
                        Who?

                                 ARTHUR
                        People you wouldn’t know. I have a 
                        lot of friends outside of work.

                                 TIM 
                        It’s okay, you can be honest with 
                        me, Arthur. I’m here to help.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What? I don’t need any help.

                                 TIM
                        Look, I know exactly what your life 
                        is like. No friends, no dates. 
                        Nobody laughs at your jokes. Nobody 
                        cares about the things you find 
                        interesting. Believe me, I know... 
                        Because I used to be you.

           Arthur is speechless but intrigued. Tim looks around to make 
           sure no one is watching them. He subtly slides a business 
           card across the table to Arthur.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        Check it out.

           Arthur reads the card to himself. He looks skeptical.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Is this a joke?

                                 TIM
                        Not at all. In fact, it’s the best 
                        thing that ever happened to me.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAIRWELL - DAY

           Arthur makes his way down the stairs. He overhears Dan and 
           Barry talking down below. He stops and listens in.

                                 DAN
                        Jasmine was so drunk at the bar on 
                        Friday. Did you see her?

                                 BARRY
                        What was that thing you did that 
                        made her laugh so hard?

                                 DAN
                        Oh, the monkey brain!

                                 BARRY
                        That was genius.

                                 DAN
                        Hey, did you hear about Overmeyer’s 
                        party? The only person who showed 
                        up was that retarded janitor.

                                 BARRY
                        Yeah, big surprise. Overmeyer’s the 
                        weirdest guy ever. All he talks 
                        about is art and politics and bees.

           Arthur looks crushed. He sits down on the stairs.

                                 DAN
                        Last week, he cornered me for an 
                        hour and blabbed his ass off about 
                        the mating rituals of some African 
                        beetle. I tried to switch the 
                        subject to Brangelina, and he 
                        didn’t even know who that was.

           Arthur takes out the business card Tim gave him and looks it 
           over. We now see that the card reads, “DUMB IT DOWN!!!,” with 
           contact information for someone named “RICKY S. ACTION.”

           INT. YMCA BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Folding chairs and a podium have been set up on one end of 
           the court for some sort of seminar. A computer printed banner 
           hanging across the basketball hoop reads, “DUMB IT DOWN!!!”

           Arthur hesitantly takes a seat in the back row. He looks 
           around at the other people attending the seminar. 
           They all resemble him: nervous, socially awkward 
           intellectuals. Everyone sits by themselves. Nobody is talking 
           to each other.

           Arthur meets the apprehensive gaze of a PECULIAR LOOKING 
           WOMAN, 30’s, a few seats away from him. Her understated 
           natural beauty seems intentionally masked by thick glasses 
           and a really bad haircut. She quickly looks away.

           After a beat, she slowly turns back to see if he’s still 
           looking at her. He is.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        Could I borrow a pencil?

                                 ARTHUR
                        How about a pen?

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        Sure.

           Arthur hands her a luxurious chrome pen.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Wow. This is a very nice pen.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Actually, that model’s been used on 
                        all space flights since the Apollo 
                        VII voyage in 1968. The brass and 
                        steel were designed to make it 
                        durable, but I find it sort of 
                        elegant, don’t you?

           The woman is speechless, blown away by Arthur’s knowledge. 
           When Arthur doesn’t receive a response from her, he 
           uncomfortably turns away.

           Suddenly, a SHORT BALD MAN in a tweed sport coat stands up 
           from his folding chair. He looks around at his peers with an 
           unshakable confidence.

                                 SHORT BALD MAN
                        Anybody catch the game last night?

           No one responds.

                                 SHORT BALD MAN (CONT'D)
                        You see that bitchin’ spiral that 
                        dude threw?

           People glance at one another in confusion. The man begins to 
           saunter up the middle aisle.
                                 SHORT BALD MAN (CONT'D)
                        I was at this club last weekend. 
                        Ended up going home with a 5. Jäger 
                        goggles, bro.

           The man swaggers toward the podium.

                                 SHORT BALD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Yo, guess who got into a fight last 
                        night? Me! This guy said he had 
                        next on the pool table. Yeah, 
                        right. That dude got served.

           The man takes his place behind the podium. His demeanor 
           suddenly changes. He is now more articulate and intelligent.

                                 SHORT BALD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Now did you all see what I did 
                        right there? By pronounced 
                        alterations in my speech patterns, 
                        my vocabulary and the focus of my 
                        subject matter, I was able to 
                        transform myself. Did I seem more 
                        likeable? Anyone?

           He searches the audience. A NERDY WOMAN raises her hand.

                                 NERDY WOMAN
                        Not really.

                                 NERDY MAN
                        Yeah, I didn’t relate to anything 
                        you said.

                                 SHORT BALD MAN
                        And that’s exactly why you’re here 
                        tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, up 
                        until this moment you’ve lived your 
                        lives as intellectuals with a self-
                        destructive intolerance for idiocy. 
                        But tonight is the beginning of a 
                        newfound happiness. By overcoming 
                        your urges to act intelligently, I 
                        guarantee you a circle of friends: 
                        girlfriends, boyfriends, bros, 
                        dudes, chicks, and quite possibly a 
                        fuck-buddy. Over the next month and 
                        half, you will all learn how to 
                        DUMB IT DOWN!!!

           The man, RICKY ACTION, rips open his button-down shirt and 
           throws his shirt and jacket to the ground. He is now wearing 
           a tight T-shirt that reads, “I LOVE TITS.”
                                 RICKY ACTION
                        My name is Ricky S. Action. What 
                        does the S stand for? Satisf.

                                 FAT DORK
                        That’s so stupid.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        You know what else is stupid? The 
                        fact that you’ve never seen a 
                        female nipple in real life. But all 
                        of that is about to change. Let’s 
                        begin.

           Ricky Action puts on a pair of dark wrap-around sunglasses.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Now the first and most important 
                        thing you can “dumb down” is your 
                        sense of humor, because idiotic 
                        jokes are the glue of social 
                        bonding. Everyone come up and take 
                        a stack of Hilarity Cards.

           ANGLE ON: There are several home-made stacks of flash cards 
           on a table next to the podium.

           INT. YMCA BASKETBALL COURT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Everyone is sitting in groups of 4. Ricky Action paces around 
           the groups, surveying everyone’s progress. He is still 
           wearing his wrap-around sunglasses.

           Arthur’s group consists of a BUCK-TOOTHED MAN, a TEENAGE 
           TECHIE and the peculiar looking woman from earlier. Arthur 
           seems skeptical of the exercise. The buck-toothed man reads 
           aloud from a Hilarity Card:

                                 BUCK-TOOTHED MAN
                        “I saw a retard at the mall.”

           The woman and the teenager force a fake chuckle. Arthur has 
           trouble mustering up a laugh. The buck-toothed man passes the 
           stack of cards over to the teenager.

                                 TEENAGE TECHIE
                        “Your dad’s balls are fucked.”

           Again, the group affects laughter. The teenage techie passes 
           the cards to the peculiar looking woman.
                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        “I just ripped ass.”

           The man and the teenager force a laugh, but Arthur can’t fake 
           it at all this time. Ricky Action notices and dashes over.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why aren’t you 
                        laughing?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Excuse me?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        What’s your name?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Arthur.

           Ricky Action takes off his wrap-around sunglasses and shakes 
           Arthur’s hand.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Nice to meet you, Arthur. Do you 
                        understand the exercise?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I do. I just don’t find any 
                        of these statements to be  
                        particularly funny.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        It doesn’t matter whether you think 
                        they’re funny. What matters is that 
                        other people think that you think 
                        they’re funny. This seminar is all 
                        about fitting in. Follow me?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I guess so.

                                 RICKY ACTION 
                        Do you understand what it means to 
                        rip ass?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have a pretty good idea.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Flatulence, Arthur. Flatulence is 
                        the central tenet of conventional 
                        humor. It is the Holy Grail of male 
                        bonding. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        If someone tells you that they just 
                        ripped ass and you don’t laugh, you 
                        will be instantly written off as a 
                        stodgy elitist. Now let’s try that 
                        again. Ready?

           Ricky Action takes the card from the peculiar looking woman 
           and squats down in front of Arthur, staring him in the eye.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        “I just ripped ass.”

           Arthur attempts a loud, fake laugh. After a long silent beat, 
           Ricky Action nods and rests his hand on Arthur’s shoulder.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Much better, Arthur.

           EXT. YMCA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Everyone from the seminar is filing out of the building. As 
           Arthur approaches his car, he notices the peculiar looking 
           woman unlocking the adjacent car.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        Hey.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hi.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        That was kind of strange, huh?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, a little. But hopefully these 
                        lessons will help us, right?

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        By the way, just so you know, I 
                        thought what you said about your 
                        space pen was really interesting. 
                        I’m a writer, so I like detailed 
                        explanations. I’m such a weirdo.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Thank you.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN 
                        And I didn’t think the flatulence 
                        joke was funny either.
                                 ARTHUR
                        I guess all that matters is that 
                        people think we think it’s funny.

                                 PECULIAR LOOKING WOMAN
                        Right. My name’s Gertrude Guff.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh. I’m Arthur Overmeyer.

           They extend their arms to shake hands. But they can’t reach 
           each other, because there’s a large car between them.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Bill is standing in the elevator wearing a BestBuy uniform. 
           Arthur hurries in at the last second. Bill looks annoyed.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Good morning, Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Hey.

           The doors close, and they ride down together in silence.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Listen, I hope you don’t think I’m 
                        still angry about what happened 
                        last week.

                                 BILL
                        What? Oh, yeah. My boy McDermott 
                        gets crazy when he’s wasted. I 
                        mean, I can see how he thought it 
                        was funny, but what he did to your 
                        laundry was fucked up.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s no problem. I already rewashed 
                        everything. In fact, I used this 
                        new Shout Remover Gel. It’s got an 
                        ingredient called Tetradecene-1 
                        that’s 99 percent olefinic. So the 
                        stains are pretty much gone.

           Bill futilely punches the already activated lobby button. 
           Arthur seems very aware of the disconnect between them.
           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator doors open, and Bill and Arthur step out. Bill 
           tries to hurry ahead.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Bill. Wait. I just want you to know 
                        that I... I, uh...

                                 BILL
                        You what, dude?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I just ripped ass.

           Suddenly, Bill begins chuckling.

                                 BILL
                        You did what?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I ripped ass.

                                 BILL
                        Just now? While we were in the 
                        elevator?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, Bill.

           Bill bursts out laughing.

                                 BILL
                        Dude! That is hilarious!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I know. It still smells 
                        really bad.

                                 BILL
                        Oh, man! Light a match!

                                 ARTHUR
                        And you know what else?

                                 BILL
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Last night, I saw a retard at the 
                        mall.
           Bill doubles over with intense, uncontrollable laughter.

                                 BILL
                        Dude, you’re insane!

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Arthur walks across the parking lot toward the school. He is 
           wearing wrap-around sunglasses that look absurd on him.

           As Arthur passes a dumpster, Donald’s head pops out of it. He 
           is wearing his janitor’s uniform and covered in filth.

                                 DONALD
                        Hey, Arthur. What are you wearing? 
                        Are those new sunglasses?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah. What do you think?

                                 DONALD
                        Truth? You look like an idiot. And 
                        I don’t even think those lenses 
                        provide you with proper protection. 
                        These babies on the other hand...

           Donald throws on a pair of giant, violet tinted shades that 
           only old people wear at the beach.

                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        Dangerous, photokeratitis causing 
                        UV rays, you are not welcome here.

           Arthur selfconsciously takes off his sunglasses.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What are you doing in the dumpster?

                                 DONALD
                        Some kid lost his retainer. Again. 
                        Although, I really shouldn’t 
                        complain. This dumpster is a 
                        veritable treasure trove.

           Donald holds up a scientific calculator and a beaker.

                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        Ebay? Cha-ching!

           Sally walks up to the dumpster carrying a tray of food.
                                 SALLY
                        Hey, honey. How’s the retainer 
                        search going?

                                 DONALD
                        Oh, it’s one of the most fulfilling 
                        experiences of my life, sweetie. 
                        How’s the sitting at your desk in 
                        an air conditioned office IMing 
                        with your college friends? How’s 
                        that going?

                                 SALLY
                        Donald, you know I’ve been busy 
                        revamping the physical education 
                        program. But I brought you some 
                        waffles in case you get hungry.

                                 DONALD
                        We get it, honey. We get it. You’re 
                        the principal. You have the luxury 
                        of bringing the school janitor 
                        waffles. Congratulations.

                                 SALLY
                        I just know how much you love 
                        waffles, honey.

                                 DONALD
                        Yeah, eating breakfast in a 
                        dumpster, very sanitary. Great way 
                        to start the day.

                                 SALLY
                        Okay, well, I’ll just leave these 
                        here in case you get hungry, 
                        sweetie. Love you.

           She sets the waffles down on a bench and leaves. Donald 
           shakes his head to Arthur.

                                 DONALD
                        So annoying.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Arthur is writing a list on the chalkboard. His usual 
           students are there: Greg, Sophie, etc.

                                 ARTHUR
                        If we remember our taxonomic ranks, 
                        we begin with Life. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        And then comes Domain. And after 
                        that, Kingdom. Then Phylum. Then... 
                        anyone? Anyone know what comes 
                        next?

           Arthur looks around the room. Everyone seems utterly bored. 
           Arthur points to Greg, who, despite his waspy suburban face, 
           has on an Allen Iverson jersey and a huge gold rope chain.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Greg? Do you know the answer?

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Can you tell us what comes next in 
                        the taxonomic ranking?

                                 GREG
                        How the hell would I know?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Did you not do the reading?

                                 GREG
                        Dude, I told you last week. I lost 
                        my book. How can I do the reading 
                        if I don’t have the book?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, I think there’s another reason 
                        why you can’t do the reading.

                                 GREG
                        Oh, yeah? What’s that?

           Arthur takes a nervous breath. He clears his throat.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Because your dad’s balls are 
                        fucked.

           For a moment, the class is stunned. Arthur looks horrified. 
           Then suddenly, the room explodes with raucous laughter.

                                 SOPHIE
                             (to Greg)
                        Sorry, baby! He totally burned you!

           Arthur gets a high-five from a student in the front row. Greg 
           folds his arms and looks down at the floor, embarrassed.
           INT. SALLY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Arthur is seated across from Sally. The nameplate on her desk 
           reads, “PRINCIPAL BERNSTEIN.”

                                 SALLY
                        I got a call from Greg Doyle’s 
                        mother this morning. Apparently, 
                        Greg’s father suffers from a severe 
                        condition called...
                             (reads off a Post-It note)
                        Secondary Hypogonadism.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So what are you saying?

                                 SALLY
                        Greg’s dad’s balls are fucked.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wow, I didn’t realize. I’m really 
                        sorry. This must be bad.

                                 SALLY 
                        It’s not good.

           Arthur bows his head like he knows he’s in trouble.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Having said that, I think your joke 
                        was pretty darn hilarious. Greg 
                        Doyle is one bad, bad apple.

           Sally starts to giggle to herself.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        “Your dad’s balls are fucked.” 
                        Where did you come up with that?

           She breaks down in uncontrollable laughter.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY

           Chuckie the janitor is raking leaves, having the time of his 
           life. A gust of wind scatters the pile of leaves, but Chuckie 
           doesn’t seem to mind. He keeps smiling.

                                 CHUCKIE
                        I love wind!
           We pan over to a nearby bench, where Arthur and Tim are 
           eating sandwiches together.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So your whole personality is just 
                        an act?

                                 TIM
                        Pretty much. You know, ten years 
                        ago I taught Physics over at St. 
                        Bonaventure. I tried to get the 
                        students into Maxwell’s equations 
                        by having them build circuits out 
                        of old radio parts. The kids looked 
                        at me like I was an alien from 
                        another planet. God forbid they use 
                        their brains for once.

                                 ARTHUR
                        This is quite a revelation, Tim. I 
                        thought you were always cool and 
                        hip.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, right. Even the teachers at 
                        Bonaventure called me nerd and 
                        freak behind my back. My social 
                        life was a disaster. No parties. No 
                        friends. No... What’s the word 
                        Ricky Action likes to use? 
                        “Poontang?”

                                 ARTHUR
                        Speaking of Ricky Action. I have to 
                        admit, I don’t find any of his 
                        social tools humorous or even 
                        slightly clever. They all just seem 
                        crass and juvenile.

                                 TIM
                        Have you tried them out yet?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Here and there.

                                 TIM
                        And?

                                 ARTHUR
                        People are really responding to it.
                                 TIM
                        Exactly. Just think of it like 
                        you’re learning a new language. 
                        Believe me, Ricky Action is a 
                        sociological genius. Have you seen 
                        me work my magic in the teachers’ 
                        lounge? My students all think I’m 
                        the cool guy. And when parent-
                        teacher conference night comes 
                        around, who’s the guy fornicating 
                        with Mommy in the janitor’s closet?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You?

                                 TIM
                        That’s right, Arthur.

           A group of HOT SENIOR GIRLS, including Sophie, walks by.

                                 HOT SENIOR GIRL
                        Hey Mr. S.! You still coming to our 
                        volleyball game on Saturday?

                                 TIM
                        You know it!

           Tim nudges Arthur, prompting him to chime in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I just ripped ass!

           The senior girls erupt with laughter.

                                 HOT SENIOR GIRL
                        Awesome! You gotta come, too, Mr. 
                        Overmeyer! You’re hilarious!

                                 SOPHIE
                             (whispers to her friends)
                        He made Greg look like the biggest 
                        loser this morning. He’s like born 
                        again awesome.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Arthur is waiting outside of the building. Jasmine walks out, 
           and Arthur quickly puts on his wrap-around sunglasses.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, Ms. Tweston. Long day, huh?
                                 JASMINE
                        Yeah, I really can’t talk. I’m 
                        running late for something.

           Arthur walks with her.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Did you see the game last night?

                                 JASMINE
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Did you see that bitching spiral 
                        that dude threw?

                                 JASMINE
                        I don’t watch sports. Sports are 
                        for guys.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Right. You know what else is for 
                        guys?

           They arrive at Jasmine’s car.

                                 JASMINE
                        Well, this is my car.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Fighting.

                                 JASMINE
                        Fighting?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I was at this restaurant last 
                        night, and this guy said he had 
                        next on the billiards table--

                                 JASMINE
                        On the what?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Pool. The pool table.

                                 JASMINE
                        They had a pool table at a 
                        restaurant?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, it was a bar.
           Jasmine gets into her car and shuts the door.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        And this guy said he had next on 
                        the pool table, but--

           Jasmine reverses out of her spot and drives away.

           INT. YMCA BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           The buck-toothed man and the fat dork are standing together 
           at the front of the class. They are purposefully trying to 
           act dumb. Ricky Action is overseeing the exercise. Arthur 
           sits in the front row taking notes.

                                 BUCK-TOOTHED MAN
                        Dude, suicide bombers, man. It’s 
                        like, boom, dude. And it’s like 
                        total chaos. We gotta stomp those 
                        Muslims off the globe.

           Arthur feels someone watching him. He turns around to see 
           Gertrude Guff seated in the back row. She sheepishly smiles 
           and waves. Arthur awkwardly nods and turns back around.

                                 FAT DORK
                        Well, at the heart of Islam there’s 
                        a message of peace and acceptance. 
                        So I wouldn’t really say--

                                 RICKY ACTION
                             (to fat dork)
                        Remember, dumb it down!

                                 FAT DORK
                        I mean, fuck those towelheads, bro. 
                        Let ‘em figure it out themselves.

           Ricky Action stands up and claps.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Well done. Very nice. Four classes 
                        in, and you’re making enormous 
                        progress. So what did we all learn 
                        right there? Whenever someone has a 
                        a religious belief you disagree 
                        with, always, always acquiesce. I 
                        can’t emphasize that enough.

           Arthur writes down the phrase “religious belief: always 
           acquiesce” and underlines it 4 times. The buck-toothed man 
           and the fat dork take their seats.
                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Arthur, Gertrude, you’re up.

           Arthur and Gertrude take their places at the front.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Okay, Gertrude, you’re at a bar. 
                        Arthur just bought you a Long 
                        Island Ice Tea. Take it from there.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Wow. Thanks for the drink. Long 
                        Island Ice Teas get you so wasted.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Perfect, perfect. And Arthur, your 
                        response?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I just ripped ass.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Okay, Arthur, look, you can’t keep 
                        using the same line. “I just ripped 
                        ass” is great to have in your 
                        repertoire, but you need to 
                        diversify. Remember your Hilarity 
                        Cards. Go.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Being at this bar makes me wanna 
                        beat some faggot’s ass.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Can I see your abs?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (to Ricky Action)
                        Do I really have to show her my 
                        stomach?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Okay, I’m glad this came up. We 
                        haven’t gone over this yet, but 
                        it’s a perfect opportunity for a 
                        tactic I like to call “Carnal 
                        Bargaining.” Observe.

           Ricky Action takes Arthur’s place in the scene.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Say your line again, Gertrude.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        Can I see your abs?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        You wanna see my six pack? Sure, 
                        I’ll show it to you. Right after 
                        you show me your tit-taaays.

           The class applauds. Ricky Action takes a little bow.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry, you’ll all get there. 
                        I’ve been at this a long time.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        So would I really have to show my 
                        breasts to him?

           Arthur steps back into the scene.

                                 ARTHUR
                        If you don’t wanna show your 
                        titties now, you can show them 
                        later. Back at my place.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Wow. Excellent transition, Arthur. 
                        You’re a fast learner.

           The audience applauds again, this time for Arthur. Gertrude 
           smiles bashfully as she claps.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        What do you do for a living, 
                        Arthur? Professional gigolo?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, I’m actually a teacher. And 
                        sort of an author, I guess.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        You’re an author?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I published a book once.

           Gertrude cocks her head, surprised and intrigued by the 
           mention of Arthur’s book.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        A book, huh? Was it called, How to 
                         Pimp Like a Poontang Pirate?
           Ricky Action pounds his fist against Arthur’s and does a 
           corny pantomime of ramming a girl from behind.

           EXT. YMCA - NIGHT

           Arthur walks out of the building. Ricky Action is chewing on 
           a toothpick just outside of the exit.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, hi, Mr. Action.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Call me Ricky.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Good work in there tonight. You’ve 
                        got a lot of potential.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Thanks. That means a lot coming 
                        from you.

           Ricky Action offers Arthur a toothpick like his.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Toothpick?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, that’s all right.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Hey, free lesson: never turn down a 
                        toothpick.

           Arthur accepts the toothpick and places it in his mouth.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Much better. A toothpick sticking 
                        out of the corner of your mouth 
                        tells the world you just got done 
                        fucking 5 chicks at the same time.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll remember that.
                                 RICKY ACTION 
                        You’re a cool guy, Arthur. Fast 
                        learner. You should come out with 
                        me some time, grab a beer. There 
                        are certain lessons that can only 
                        be learned in the field.

           INT. ED’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           We are close up on a TV screen. A video for Reverend Jack 
           Shorko’s “religion” is playing. A NARRATOR is describing the 
           religion’s creation myth, as shoddily animated visuals 
           accompany the narration.

                                 NARRATOR
                        When the mighty Space Wizard, 
                        Gjorganthaal, created Starship 
                        Earth, he carved out a hole in the 
                        center, a place where the souls of 
                        his believers could gather and 
                        revel in their newfound 
                        bodilessness. When a deceased human 
                        being is buried beneath the surface 
                        of our Life Sphere, the souls of 
                        those who believe will drift 
                        downward to the core, where they 
                        will be greeted by a throng of 
                        euphoric spirits.

           We cut to the Reverend JACK SHORKO, dressed in a white suit 
           with eccentric Einstein hair, seated in a space-age chair.

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        Wizard be with you. I am the 
                        Reverend Jack Shorko. I have seen 
                        what lies beyond and below this 
                        realm. For 14 minutes in the summer 
                        of 1975, I was pronounced dead. But 
                        through circumstances that I can 
                        only describe as miraculous, I came 
                        back. What happened during those 14 
                        minutes of lifelessness was nothing 
                        less than astounding.

           We cut to a shot of a huge party taking place in a bizarre 
           dome-like structure. Tons of old people are dancing to a 
           weird music that’s a combination of Big Band and Techno. They 
           are having a total blast.

           We arrive at Jack Shorko dancing among the old people. He 
           seems much more laid back and festive.
                                 JACK SHORKO (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to the Eternal Party of

                        Space Wizard Gjorganthaal’s 
                        subterranean portal to endless fun! 
                        Posthumous VIP tickets start at 
                        $349.99, but with an additional--

           The TV turns off. We pull out to reveal Arthur and his dad, 
           Ed, sitting on Ed’s sofa watching the television.

                                 ED
                        Still don’t believe me?

           Arthur struggles to stifle his disapproval.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I can see how that makes 
                        sense. The Wizard. The party.

                                 ED
                        But what about you? We gotta sign 
                        you up before it’s too late.

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s all right. I’m okay.

                                 ED
                        Did you or did you not see the 
                        ladies at that party?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Dad, you’re entitled to your own 
                        opinion. But I don’t know if the 
                        Space Wizard is for everyone.

                                 ED
                        Opinion?! This isn’t a matter of 
                        opinion, Arthur! The good Reverend 
                        Jack Shorko was dead for 14 
                        minutes! He’s been to the other 
                        side! It’s a fact!

           Arthur can no longer suppress his true sentiments.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, Dad, it’s not a fact! You’re 
                        just scared of death, of the 
                        unknown! But instead of fighting 
                        off your cancer, you spend your 
                        final days trying to get on the 
                        list for an afterlife party!
           Ed stands up.

                                 ED
                        Get out of my house.

           Arthur softens up and seems to regret his outburst.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Dad, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to--

                                 ED
                        Goodbye.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Maybe we could do a movie night 
                        this Saturday or--

                                 ED
                        I said, goodbye!

           Saddened, Arthur gets up and walks to the door.

                                 ED (CONT'D)
                        Wait.

           Arthur turns around with a hopeful look. Ed lowers his head 
           and holds his open palms out toward his son.

                                 ED (CONT'D)
                        Wizard be with you.

           INT. JUICE BAR - NIGHT

           Arthur is ordering at the counter from a rude GOTH GIRL with 
           a huge Satanic tattoo on her neck.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Can I get a double shot of wheat 
                        grass juice?

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Really? Wheat grass juice is such a 
                        pain in the ass to make.

           Arthur rubs his chin, considering how to handle such bad 
           customer service.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You know what? Fuck wheat grass.

           He points out a photo on the overhead menu of a giant orange 
           shake with whipped cream. It looks extremely unhealthy.
                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Just give me one of those big 
                        orange things.

                                 GOTH GIRL
                             (smiles)
                        Nice, dude.

           The Goth girl leaves to go make Arthur’s drink. Suddenly, 
           Arthur’s cell phone rings. He answers it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hello?... Yeah, this is Arthur... 
                        Who is this?... Who?... Whoa, whoa, 
                        calm down. What’s the problem?

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Arthur knocks on an apartment door. He is holding an extra-
           large orange shake in his hand.

           The door opens. Gertrude quickly steps out into the hall and 
           shuts the door behind her. She is wearing an unflattering 
           cocktail dress and hoop earrings that don’t quite look right.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Arthur, thank you so much for 
                        coming. I tried Ricky Action’s 
                        emergency hotline, but there wasn’t 
                        any answer. So I went down the 
                        contact list, and you were the only 
                        name I recognized.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t worry about it, Gertrude. So 
                        what exactly is going on?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’m such an imbecile. I was at my 
                        cousin’s birthday party tonight, 
                        and I thought I’d try out some of 
                        the stuff we’ve been learning. But 
                        I accidentally slipped into Carnal 
                        Bargaining, and now I have this 
                        creepy guy in my apartment who 
                        won’t leave.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What do you need me to do?

                                 CREEPY GUY (O.S.)
                        I’m ready to see those cantaloupes!
                                 GERTRUDE
                             (whispers to Arthur)
                        Just pretend you’re my boyfriend.

           Gertrude opens the door and pulls Arthur inside with her.

           INT. GERTRUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The apartment is filled with piles of books. Interesting yet 
           bizarre pieces of framed art cover the walls. The CREEPY GUY 
           is sitting on the couch with no shirt on and a huge gut 
           sticking out over his belt line.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Who the fuck is this cockblocker?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Arthur, tell him.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Tell me what?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m her boyfriend.

           The creepy guy stands up, clearly very drunk. He stumbles up 
           to Arthur and looks him up and down for a long beat.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        All right. I’m down for a 
                        threesome.

           There is a tense moment. Gertrude gives Arthur a pleading 
           look. Arthur hesitantly puts his arm around the creepy guy 
           and leads him toward the door.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Listen. Bro. Normally, I would be 
                        totally down for double teaming 
                        some party poon. But this is no 
                        ordinary girl.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                             (whispers)
                        Chick with dick?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, dude, I’m serious about this 
                        girl. Tonight is our anniversary.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Aw, jeez. Really?
                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s right. One year ago I stuck 
                        my face between those bitchin’ 
                        cantaloupes and buried my bone in 
                        her backyard. What can I say? I’m 
                        in love with this cooze.

           The creepy guy seems moved. He touches Arthur’s shoulder.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        That’s beautiful, man.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Thank you.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Now I feel like a dick. Lemme just 
                        grab my shirt and my Pats hat and 
                        I’ll be outta your hair. Happy 
                        anniversary, you two.

           The creepy guy picks up his shirt and throws on a Patriots 
           hat. He exits the apartment. Gertrude double-locks the door. 
           Arthur sighs and catches his breath.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Wow. You are good.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, don’t thank me. Thank Ricky 
                        Action.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I need a glass of wine to calm 
                        down. Would you like one?

           She holds up an expensive looking bottle of wine.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Is that Krug Clos du Mesnil?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Yeah. Is that bad? If you don’t 
                        like it--

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, that’s actually one of my 
                        favorite wines. I’d love a glass.

           She goes into the kitchen. Arthur walks around the room.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        So this is your apartment?
                                 GERTRUDE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, sorry it’s such a mess.

           Arthur notices a glass terrarium with a hamster in it. The 
           terrarium is decorated to look like a tropical paradise with 
           fake palm trees and a miniature cabana. A meticulously 
           crafted, handmade sign reads, “DAVID’S PARADISE.”

           Gertrude reenters with two glasses of wine.

                                 GERTRUDE (CONT'D)
                        That’s David, my hamster.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s quite an impressive set-up.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I know it’s a little bizarre, but 
                        studies have shown that visual 
                        stimuli can increase a hamster’s 
                        lifespan by up to 6 months. And 
                        that’s kind of important. Because 
                        David’s not only a friend, he’s 
                        also a business partner.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I thought you said you were a 
                        writer?

           She goes to her computer and brings up a website for Arthur 
           to see: the home page for americanhamster.com. There is a 
           picture of Gertrude giving two thumbs up. Her hamster, David, 
           is sitting on top of her head. Below the picture are a bunch 
           of links to Gertrude’s hamster writings.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s a combination of fiction and 
                        nonfiction. Kind of like Jane 
                        Goodall meets Stewart Little.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Interesting. I never knew people 
                        were into that sort of thing.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Yeah, we’ve got roughly 43 
                        subscribers from 9 different 
                        countries. So the ads have been 
                        pouring in lately. It keeps the 
                        lights on, right?

           Arthur nods and sips his wine. Gertrude smiles sheepishly.
                                 GERTRUDE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, you must think I’m such 
                        a weirdo. Not many people 
                        appreciate rodentology.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Not at all. In fact, I’m an amateur 
                        entomologist myself with an 
                        emphasis on honeybees.

                                 GERTRUDE 
                        I know.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You know?

           Gertrude walks over to a bookshelf and pulls out a copy of 
           Arthur’s book, Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder and the 
               Varroa Destructor Mite: A Global Disaster.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        How did you get that?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You mentioned you were an author in 
                        class, so I thought I’d check out 
                        your literature. I couldn’t find 
                        your book in any of the stores, 
                        though, so I went on Amazon--

                                 ARTHUR
                        My book’s on Amazon?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Not anymore. But there was a link 
                        to a site called nerdheaven.com? 
                        And they had like 400 brand new 
                        copies. I bought four for a dollar.

           Arthur looks bummed about the price.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           Gertrude walks Arthur to the elevator.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Thanks again for helping me out.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What are classmates for?
                                 GERTRUDE
                        By the way, how’s everything going 
                        with you? Is “Dumbing It Down” 
                        helping you out socially?

                                 ARTHUR
                        So-so. I haven’t made any new 
                        friends yet. And there’s a teacher 
                        at my school I’m still trying to 
                        connect with. Or as Ricky Action 
                        likes to say, I still have yet to 
                        “pound the puss.”

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Oh. A teacher. That’s great. Is she 
                        nice? She must be pretty.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, she’s beautiful. I’ve had my 
                        eye on her for a while now, so...

           They arrive at the elevator. Arthur can tell that he’s 
           accidentally put Gertrude off by mentioning Jasmine.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, who knows what will happen.

           The elevator doors open. There is an awkward silence. 
           Gertrude holds out her hand for a handshake.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, see you at the next class.

                                 ARTHUR
                        See you then, Gertrude.

           They shake hands. Arthur gets into the elevator. As the doors 
           close, Gertrude calls to him:

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Good luck with the puss-pounding!

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           ANGLE ON: Arthur’s old copies of Atlantic Monthly, National 
               Geographic and The Economist are piled up in the garbage can.

           Arthur is seated on the couch. A tall stack of celebrity 
           gossip magazines sits next to him. He flips through a copy of 
               Us Weekly with a photo of Brangelina on the cover. He 
           highlights and takes copious notes.
           Arthur occasionally looks up at his television to observe a 
           SOULJA BOY rap video playing on MTV. Soulja Boy dances 
           around, emanating his typical “gangsta vibe.”

           Arthur rubs his eyes. He looks tired and lonely. He suddenly 
           hears loud SHOUTING and CHEERING coming from next door. 
           Arthur gazes at the wall, an idea forming in his head.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Arthur knocks on the front door of Bill’s apartment. He has a 
           toothpick sticking out of the corner of his mouth. Bill 
           answers the door in a Lions football jersey.

                                 BILL
                        What’s up, dude? We being too loud?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, not at all.

                                 BILL 
                        Oh, your saran wrap. Hold on, lemme 
                        grab it for you.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, Bill, are you guys... 
                        watching the game?

                                 BILL
                        Of course.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Listen, bro. I’d like to apologize 
                        for acting like such a...

           Arthur subtly glances at the palm of his hand. The word, 
           “FAGMEISTER,” has been written in marker.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        ... fagmeister.

                                 BILL
                        No worries, dude. Everyone acts 
                        like a fagmeister sometimes.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Exactly. We’re neighbors, right? We 
                        should be friends. This is for you, 
                        homeboy.

           Arthur holds up a single beer. Bill looks amazed.
                                 BILL
                        Dude!

           INT. BILL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Bill’s apartment has the visual aesthetic of a college dorm 
           room. The only posters on the wall are of professional 
           wrestlers and bikini models with fake breasts. A bunch of 
           Bill’s idiot friends are watching a football game on TV.

           Bill brings Arthur into the room.

                                 BILL
                        Hey everybody, listen up! This is 
                        my neighbor!

                                 BILL’S FRIEND #1
                        Oh, yeah, I heard about you. You 
                        saw a retard at the mall, right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I did. A really big retard.

                                 BILL’S FRIEND #2
                        Sweet toothpick, bro.

                                 MCDERMOTT
                        Hey Poindexter! I hope you redid 
                        your laundry!

                                 BILL
                        Shut up, McDermott. Give the dude a 
                        chance. Why don’t you line up some 
                        shots? Half time’s almost over.

           McDermott reaches behind the couch and grabs a handle of 
           Cuervo. He pours out a bunch of giant shots and hands them 
           out to everyone. Bill gives one to Arthur and raises his 
           Lions coffee mug, which is filled with tequila.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        What are we drinking to?

                                 ARTHUR
                        To sports games.

                                 BILL
                        Yeah! And to Slut Mouth!

           ANGLE ON: SLUT MOUTH, an ugly girl with huge sensual lips.
                                 SLUT MOUTH
                        Come on, no one calls me that 
                        anymore.

           Everyone roars and downs their shot. Arthur drinks his 
           tequila, gagging at the taste.

           INT. BILL’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

           The game has been over for a while now. Everyone is utterly 
           wasted. Arthur is sitting on the couch, drunker than he’s 
           ever been. He has his arm over McDermott’s shoulder. He is 
           lecturing the room, his words completely slurred.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I mean, who says we don’t need bees 
                        to survive?

                                 MCDERMOTT
                        Totally.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s like I say in my book. Show me 
                        a world without bees, and I’ll show 
                        you a world without migratory 
                        contract pollination and a global 
                        agricultural economy that doesn’t 
                        even come close to providing 
                        sustenance for third world 
                        populations.

           Arthur looks around the room. He realizes that nobody 
           understands a word he’s saying. Everyone looks annoyed.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Am I boring you guys?

                                 MCDERMOTT
                        A little bit, dude.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah? Well, how boring is this?

           Arthur grabs the empty bottle of Cuervo and SMASHES it 
           against the wall. Bill jumps up from his seat.

                                 BILL
                        Dude, what the fuck?

           Arthur looks nervous. Bill smiles.
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        SHARD PARTY!

           Everyone cheers. Bill throws his mug against the wall. 
           Everyone in the room begins breaking bottles. McDermott 
           stomps his foot through the glass coffee table. Slut Mouth 
           stands up and punches a ceiling light, shattering it.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Arthur drives behind an extremely slow car. He looks hung 
           over, and he’s now shaved his beard into a goatee.

           Off to the side, Arthur notices Dan and Barry getting out of 
           their cars. Trying to impress them, Arthur turns up his 
           radio, blasting Rihanna’s Umbrella. He lays down on his horn 
           and yells out his window at the car in front of him:

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hurry up! Let’s go!

           Arthur eventually parks beside the slowly moving car. Donald 
           and Sally emerge from the car.

                                 DONALD
                        Jesus, Arthur. What’s with all the 
                        horn honking?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No offense, Donald. But you drive 
                        like a little bitch.

           Dan and Barry look surprised and amazed. Arthur pounds his 
           chest and flashes them the peace sign. They stare in awe at 
           Arthur, as he struts off.

                                 DONALD
                             (calling after Arthur)
                        Uh, are you saying I drive like a 
                        woman? Because statistically female 
                        drivers are almost 15 percent less 
                        likely to get into an accident, 
                        smart guy.

           Dan and Barry shake their heads in disbelief at Arthur.

                                 DAN
                        Was that Overmeyer?
                                 BARRY
                        Did you see his goatee? That’s like 
                        Chuck “The Ice Man” Liddell style. 
                        Goatees are so badass.

                                 DAN
                        I know. God, I should’ve never 
                        shaved off my flavor saver.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Jasmine is walking down the empty hall. She hears music 
           coming from one of the classrooms. She peeks in and sees...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           YOUNG JEEZY is blasting from a boombox stereo. Arthur is 
           dancing like a rapper in a hip hop video, emanating a 
           “gangsta vibe.” He bobs his head, holds his crotch with one 
           hand and does “raise the roof” with the other. He is wearing 
           Greg’s huge gold rope chain around his neck.

           The students are on their feet dancing.

           ANGLE ON: Jasmine looks astonished and impressed.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeeuh! Yeeuh! Droppin’ science on 
                        all y’all!

           Arthur dances over to a Bunsen burner. He lights it, and a 
           huge flame shoots out. The students CHEER like they’re at a 
           concert. He holds the flame up in the air and strikes a pose.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Statue of Liberty, y’all!

           The students burst out laughing.

           ANGLE ON: Jasmine puts her hand over her mouth to stifle a 
           laugh.

                                 GREG
                        Yo, Mr. O.! Can I get my chain 
                        back?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Nah, nah, kid. Maybe at the end of 
                        the day.
           INT. SNACK ROOM - DAY

           Arthur is getting a drink at the vending machine. He is still 
           wearing Greg’s gold rope chain. Jasmine walks up.

                                 JASMINE
                        Hey, Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh. Hey, Ms. Tweston.

                                 JASMINE
                        You can call me by my first name. I 
                        was just joking about the whole 
                        student thing before.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay, Jasmine.

                                 JASMINE
                        My friends actually call me Jazzy.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Jazzy. That sounds like an 
                        attributive adjective.
                             (catches himself)
                        I mean, that sounds cool as fuck.

                                 JASMINE
                        Thanks. By the way, I caught part 
                        of your biology class this morning?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (embarrassed)
                        Oh, god, you saw that? I was just 
                        trying to be goofy.

                                 JASMINE
                        You are an awesome teacher. Those 
                        kids were so into your lesson. 
                        Which is amazing. Because science 
                        is like the boringest, right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I guess science mostly sucks.

                                 JASMINE
                        Right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Right.
                                 JASMINE
                        Anyway, I’m sorry I couldn’t make 
                        it to your party last month. I 
                        totally wanted to come, but I got 
                        the spins really early, and Barry 
                        had to like hold my hair out of the 
                        toilet. “Jazzy Gone Wild.”

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I got pretty wasted, too. It 
                        turned into this crazy shard party.

                                 JASMINE
                        Oh, my god! I love shard parties! 
                        What are you up to this weekend?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Just watching the game. Maybe hit 
                        up some clubs.

                                 JASMINE
                        Well, my old sorority sister Shaz 
                        is coming into town. If you’ve got 
                        a friend, we should like totally 
                        double date or something.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Shaz and Jaz, huh? Sounds like 
                        double trouble.

           Jasmine laughs and touches Arthur’s arm.

                                 JASMINE
                        That is genius! By the way, I love 
                        your new flavor saver.

                                 ARTHUR
                        My new what?

           INT. YMCA BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Arthur and DAREN, the teenage techie from earlier, are in 
           front of the class doing another exercise with Ricky Action.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        All right, today’s lesson is 
                        Aggressive Assertion. We’re in a 
                        night club. The night club is 
                        called Intrigue. Arthur, you’re 
                        Daren’s wing-man. Daren, I just 
                        bumped into you without saying 
                        “Excuse me.” What now?
                                 DAREN
                        Um...

                                 RICKY ACTION 
                        Did you study your Aggression Cards 
                        over the weekend?

                                 DAREN
                        Yes, Mr. Action.

                                 RICKY ACTION 
                        So what now, bitch?

                                 DAREN
                        Honestly, I’d probably just let it 
                        slide.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Take a seat, pussy.

           Daren sits down in the first row.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Arthur, why don’t you show Daren 
                        how to unleash his Inner Destroyer? 
                        You think you can handle that?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, I think I can. But let me ask 
                        you this, was the bump a flagrant 
                        act of aggression or was it an 
                        accident?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Does it matter?

                                 ARTHUR
                        In a sense. If it was only 
                        accidental, I might respond with, 
                        “What’s up, punk?” or “You wanna 
                        die tonight, faggot?” But if it was 
                        on purpose, I think I’d try a more 
                        pugilistic, nonverbal tactic.

           The class looks impressed by Arthur’s reasoning abilities.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Well, what did it seem like to you?

           Arthur thinks it over for a moment. He suddenly PUNCHES Ricky 
           Action in the face. Ricky Action crumples to the ground.

           ANGLE ON: Gertrude gasps.
           Arthur immediately regrets his action. He crouches down next 
           to Ricky Action to make sure he’s okay.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m so sorry, Ricky. I’ve never 
                        punched anyone before in my life. 
                        I’ve always been a pacifist. Do you 
                        want me to call an ambulance?

           Ricky Action sits up. His face is bright red, and his mouth 
           is dripping with blood. Arthur nervously awaits his reaction.

                                 RICKY ACTION 
                        That... was... AWESOME!

           Ricky Action holds out his hand for a high-five. Arthur 
           awkwardly slaps it. Ricky Action unsteadily gets to his feet.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Now did you all see what Arthur did 
                        right there? He answered my 
                        perfectly legitimate question with 
                        an unjustified physical response.

           He spits out a mouthful of blood.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Write this down, people.

           EXT. YMCA - NIGHT

           Arthur leaves the building. Other members of the seminar 
           congratulate him on their way out.

                                 FAT DORK
                        Nice job tonight, Arthur.

                                 NERDY WOMAN
                        Commendable performance.

           Arthur and Gertrude approach their cars together.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        God, I’ve been really struggling 
                        with the Homophobia Worksheets 
                        lately. Would you want to get 
                        together and study on Friday?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I would. But I’ve actually got a 
                        date with that teacher I was 
                        telling you about.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        Oh. The teacher, right. That’s 
                        wonderful, Arthur. I’m glad it’s 
                        working out for you.

           Suppressing her disappointment, Gertrude starts to get into 
           her car. Arthur can’t help but notice her dismay.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, how about Sunday morning?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Sunday? Sure, that could work. I 
                        can bring some cucumber water and 
                        kartoshkas.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Great. I love kartoshkas.

           Suddenly, Ricky Action’s 2005 Mustang Convertible pulls up 
           next to Arthur and screeches to a stop. Ricky Action throws 
           open the passenger door, wearing his wrap-around sunglasses.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Arthur. Get in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Where are we going?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Oh, I don’t know... all night party 
                        fuck jam?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Really?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Would I lie to my number one 
                        student?

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           This is not an “all night party fuck jam.” There are a few 
           mid-life crisis alcoholics at the bar. A handful of ugly 
           middle aged women are dressed like teenagers. Two blue collar 
           GUYS are playing pool in the corner.

           Ricky Action and Arthur take a seat at the bar. The bartender 
           approaches them.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        What’s your poison, Arthur?
                                 ARTHUR
                        I guess I’ll have a beer.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                             (to the bartender)
                        Double shot of Hennessy, a PBR for 
                        my friend, and a round of apple 
                        martinis for the lovely ladies at 
                        the end of the bar.

           Ricky Action winks to a group of ugly barflies who respond 
           with leering, brown toothed smiles.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        First round’s on you, right, playa?

           Arthur reluctantly hands his credit card to the bartender. 
           The bartender walks away to make their drinks.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Did you see the bartender’s 
                        reaction to the word, “playa?” In 
                        two syllables I was able to convey 
                        an air of youthfulness and cultural 
                        sophistication.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Really? I thought he looked kind of 
                        annoyed.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Common misinterpretation. What you 
                        perceived as annoyance was in fact 
                        a gesture of reverence. Subtext, 
                        Arthur. Subtext.

           Arthur nods, suppressing his skepticism. Ricky Action scopes 
           out the bar.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Like I told you before, Arthur, 
                        some of my most valuable lessons 
                        can only be taught in the field. 
                        What’s a better classroom than the 
                        classroom of life? Observe.

           Ricky Action points to the guys playing pool.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Right now those two civilians are 
                        complete strangers. Watch, as I 
                        rope them into my world with a 
                        foolproof physical act of hilarity.
           Ricky Action walks up to the guys at the pool table. He takes 
           a cue stick and slips it between his legs from behind so that 
           it looks like a giant penis. He slides it back and forth on 
           the pool table, scattering the balls on the table.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Check it out! Stick Dick’s in the 
                        hay-ouse!

                                 POOL PLAYER GUY #1
                        What the fuck, asshole! We’re in 
                        the middle of a game!

                                 POOL PLAYER GUY #2
                        Get the fuck outta here!

           They grab the cue stick away from Ricky and throw it to the 
           ground. They push him away from the table.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        All right, I’m Audi-5000. Where’s 
                        your sense of humor, bros?

           Ricky Action takes his seat beside Arthur again. He guzzles 
           his entire glass of Hennessy.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Jeez, those guys were dumber than I 
                        thought. If I’d have known how 
                        idiotic they were, I would’ve gone 
                        straight to my wrist watch routine.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Your what?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Man, it’s getting late. Have you 
                        seen what time it is?

           He nods down to his wrist. Arthur looks down at Ricky 
           Action’s “watch” and quickly averts his eyes in disgust.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Aw, gross. Doesn’t that hurt?

           INT. RICKY ACTION’S CAR - NIGHT

           Ricky Action pulls up to the front of the YMCA. From the look 
           on Arthur’s face, we can see that he has obviously been 
           underwhelmed and irritated by the night out.
                                 ARTHUR
                        My car’s back there.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        I know. I was thinking you could 
                        check out my place, have a few more 
                        beers. I’ve got some cold ones.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Your place?

           INT. YMCA BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Arthur is seated on a bench. Ricky Action opens up a locker 
           and pulls out a couple of warm bottles of beer.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So you live here?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        It’s just temporary.

           Ricky Action hands Arthur a beer and sits down on the bench 
           across from him. Ricky Action pretends to suddenly notice 
           something on the floor by his feet.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Whoa! What’s this?

           Ricky Action picks up a dirty, tattered manuscript. He dusts 
           it off and holds it up for Arthur to see.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Wow, I totally forgot about this. I 
                        must have written this years ago. 
                        Here, check it out.

           He hands Arthur the manuscript. Arthur reads the title: Lose 
               That Frown, Dumb It Down!!!, by RICKY S. ACTION. Arthur leafs 
           through the manuscript, feigning interest.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You wrote this?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Yeah. I think it’s like all of my 
                        teachings in one concise, easy-to-
                        read manual. I guess you could call 
                        it my life’s work or something.

           Ricky Action rubs his chin. An idea seems to be blossoming in 
           his mind.
                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Wait a second. You published a book 
                        once, didn’t you?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        So you probably know some 
                        influential people in the 
                        publishing world. Maybe you could 
                        pass my manuscript along to your 
                        agent? Or maybe we should go 
                        straight to the publisher?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t really have an agent 
                        anymore. And my publisher won’t 
                        even return my calls.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        What? You said you were an author.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I was. My book was a complete 
                        failure.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Isn’t there anyone you can show 
                        this to? Do you have your 
                        publisher’s direct line? I could 
                        call them myself. I don’t mind.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t, sorry.

           Ricky Action chugs his whole beer. He stares Arthur in the 
           eye with a look of drunken desperation.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Arthur, listen to me. I need your 
                        help.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You need my help?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        I am neck deep in a world of 
                        financial pain. My three ex-wives 
                        are like bloodthirsty wolves, and 
                        alimony is their carrion. Two of my 
                        children have brought separate 
                        civil lawsuits against me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        My only source of income is the 
                        Dumb It Down seminar, which barely 
                        gets me by. On top of that, my best 
                        friend-- my own brother, just 
                        kicked me out of his basement last 
                        month.

           ANGLE ON: There is a soiled sleeping bag lying on the floor.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        He said I was acting like an idiot. 
                        No, Brian! You’re the idiot!

           Arthur looks really uncomfortable.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Please, Arthur. If there’s anything 
                        you can do. Anything at all. I’d 
                        really, really appreciate it.

           Arthur avoids eye contact with Ricky Action.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah. Sure. I’ll see what I can do.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! 
                        Thank you! THANK YOU!

           Ricky Action lies down on the bench and loudly SIGHS.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Oh, god, that’s like a giant weight 
                        lifted off my shoulders. How long 
                        do you think it’ll take till I get 
                        my first royalty check?

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Arthur enters. He looks tired and depressed, his illusion of 
           the guru, the great Ricky Action, now utterly shattered. 
           Arthur tosses Ricky Action’s manuscript down on the kitchen 
           table. It flips open to a random page.

           ANGLE ON: There is a hand-drawn, pencil illustration for 
           something called the “DICK BROW.” It shows the face of a 
           sleeping person with a penis draped over their eyebrows.

           Arthur shakes his head at the idiocy of the diagram.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What? That’s so stupid.
           Suddenly, Arthur seems inspired. He picks up a pencil, erases 
           the penis and redraws the same penis over the sleeping 
           person’s upper lip. He crosses out the word “BROW” and 
           replaces it with “MOUSTACHE.”

           Arthur stands back and ponders his correction. He chuckles.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        “Dick Moustache.”

           His chuckling builds into an all out laugh.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        “Dick Moustache!” That is genius!

           INT. FACULTY LOUNGE - DAY

           Arthur is eating lunch with Dan and Barry at a table. He has 
           their rapt attention.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Angelina’s hot and all. But when 
                        you’re Brad Pitt, you can get any 
                        hot chick you want.

                                 DAN
                        Totally.

                                 ARTHUR
                        But if you stick with Angelina, you 
                        have to have those peasant kids 
                        living right in your house with 
                        you. It’s like, dude.

                                 BARRY
                        That’s a really good point.

           Donald walks up and sets his bag lunch down next to Arthur. 
           The table goes awkwardly silent.

                                 DONALD
                        Good afternoon, gentlemen.

                                 DAN
                        Hey.

           Donald pulls out his sandwich, breaks it in half and examines 
           it. He holds up a half for Arthur to see.

                                 DONALD
                        Looks more like three dollops now. 
                        So annoying.
           Arthur avoids Donald’s gaze. Donald opens his thermos and 
           takes a whiff.

                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        Mmm, spirulina extract with a touch 
                        of flaxseed oil. When it comes to 
                        improving your mental acumen by way 
                        of liquid supplements, there is 
                        absolutely no comparison.

           Everyone else at the table looks weirded out.

                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        Arthur, did you get that article I 
                        emailed you on the death of 
                        symmetry?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Dude, no offense, but your drink 
                        smells like puke.

           Dan and Barry stifle a laugh. Donald sniffs his drink.

                                 DONALD
                        I have to disagree with you, 
                        Arthur. Trust me, I know the scent 
                        of vomit. Vomit has a much more 
                        acidic, pungent quality. What 
                        you’re probably smelling is the 
                        chemical combination of--

                                 ARTHUR
                        Booooring!

           Dan and Barry burst out laughing. Barry gives Arthur a fist 
           pound. Donald looks confused.

                                 DONALD
                        What are you guys laughing about?

                                 DAN
                        Hey, man, this is the teachers 
                        lounge.

                                 DONALD
                        I know.

                                 BARRY
                        Are you a teacher?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (under his breath)
                        You don’t smell like a teacher.
           Dan and Barry laugh again. Donald looks slightly offended. He 
           gathers his lunch and stands up.

                                 DONALD
                        Seems as though I’m not wanted 
                        here. I guess I’ll enjoy my lunch 
                        out in the shade of the European 
                        Cutleaf Beech tree I planted last 
                        spring. Coming, Arthur?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Nah, dude.

                                 DONALD
                        “Nah, dude?” What are you, a 
                        disrespectful 13-year-old?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, I’m just a guy having lunch 
                        with his bros. Why don’t you go 
                        make some friends of your own?

                                 BARRY
                        Yeah, go hang out with Chuckie.

           Barry points out the window to Chuckie, who is out in the 
           courtyard jumping through a sprinkler and giggling.

                                 CHUCKIE
                             (from outside)
                        Raindrops all around me!

                                 DONALD
                        Chuckie? Uh, I don’t think so. In 
                        fact, forget the beech tree. I’ll 
                        be having lunch with the principal. 
                        Your boss. My wife. A caring, 
                        intelligent, non-intrusive woman 
                        whom I love and respect and admire 
                        more than any of you could ever 
                        imagine.

           Donald storms off. Arthur shakes his head to Dan and Barry.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What a freak.

           ANGLE ON: Tim is lying on a couch across the lounge. He seems 
           concerned by the whole conversation he has just overheard.
           INT. FACULTY RESTROOM - DAY

           Arthur is washing his hands at the sink. Tim enters.

                                 TIM
                        Hey, Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How’s it going, Tim?

                                 TIM
                        You all right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.

                                 TIM
                        What was that lunch conversation 
                        all about?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Brangelina? I was just bonding with 
                        my colleagues. You know, dumbing it 
                        down.

                                 TIM
                        I got that. But why did you have to 
                        be so cruel to your friend?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Who, Donald? The janitor?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tim, you know as well as I do, 
                        certain sacrifices have to be made 
                        if you’re trying to reinvent 
                        yourself.

                                 TIM 
                        Of course. I’m familiar with the 
                        lesson on Alpha Male Insults. But 
                        there’s a limit to that. Even Ricky 
                        Action himself says that--

                                 ARTHUR
                             (shakes his head)
                        Ricky Action.
                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        That guy’s a joke.

                                 TIM
                        Excuse me?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tim, he lives in the YMCA locker 
                        room. His family hates him.

                                 TIM
                        Does that change the effectiveness 
                        of his lessons?

                                 ARTHUR
                        To be honest, I’m starting to think 
                        his lessons could use a little 
                        improvement.

                                 TIM
                        Oh, so you know more than Ricky 
                        Action now?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Maybe I do.

           Tim suddenly FARTS really loudly.

                                 TIM
                        Because if that’s the case, then--

           Arthur snickers, containing a laugh.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Nothing.

                                 TIM
                        What are you laughing at?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know. It’s just that you...

                                 TIM
                        I what?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You ripped ass.
                                 TIM
                        So? Arthur, it’s just you and me 
                        here. You don’t have to pretend 
                        like it’s humorous.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m not pretending, Tim. I don’t 
                        know why, but it’s really funny. It 
                        sounded like a motor boat.

           Arthur can no longer hold in his laugh. Tim looks troubled.

                                 TIM
                        Arthur, are you okay?

                                 ARTHUR
                        What do you mean?

                                 TIME
                        You don’t seem like yourself.

           Arthur calms himself down.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m fine, Tim. Nothing’s changed 
                        about me except the fact that I’ve 
                        got a lot more social options now. 
                        In fact, guess what I’m doing 
                        tonight.

                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        My neighbor and I are going out on 
                        a double date with Jazzy and her 
                        sorority sister.

                                 TIM
                        Jazzy Tweston? You’re going out 
                        with Jazzy?

           Arthur smiles and nods. Tim looks horrified for him.

           INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           This is a loud, crowded bar. Arthur is standing at a table 
           with Jasmine, who is now dressed like a stripper. Both of 
           them seem pretty tipsy.
                                 JASMINE
                        It’s like, now that we know how to 
                        make escalators, why do we still 
                        have stairs? It’s the stupidest 
                        thing ever, right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, that is kind of stupid.

                                 JASMINE
                        And you know what else? I don’t 
                        think God is like a person. I think 
                        God is like a beam of light that 
                        like talks.

                                 ARTHUR
                        A talking light beam, huh? Or what 
                        if God was this giant space wizard?

                                 JASMINE
                        That would be so cool.

                                 ARTHUR
                        And when it rains, that’s like the 
                        wizard sweating.

                                 JASMINE
                             (laughs)
                        Arthur, you’re so gross!

           Jasmine puts her arms around Arthur. Bill stumbles up to 
           them. Bill has his arm around Jasmine’s slutty sorority 
           sister, SHAZ. Bill gives Arthur a beer and Jasmine a Cosmo.

                                 BILL
                        This round’s on me, dudes.

                                 SHAZ
                        Oh, my god, Jazzy. Your friends are 
                        such pervs. I haven’t had this much 
                        fun since college.

                                 JASMINE
                        Right?

                                 SHAZ
                        Right?

                                 JASMINE
                        Right?
           Arthur leans back to drink his beer, and he accidentally 
           bumps a waitress. She spills an entire tray of drinks. Bill 
           and the girls start laughing hysterically.

                                 BILL 
                        Oh, man! Look at all that broken 
                        shit on the floor!

           Arthur looks down at the waitress cleaning up the mess. For a 
           moment, it seems as though he’s about to feel sympathy for 
           her. Instead, Arthur wholeheartedly joins in on the laughter.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Ever heard of a broom?

                                 BILL 
                        Dude, Arthur, you are the man! You 
                        know what? We should be roommates!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes!

                                 BILL
                        But you gotta move into my place!

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, no! Let’s break down the 
                        wall and make it one big, giant 
                        festivity lair!

                                 BILL
                        A what?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I mean, a party pad!

                                 BILL 
                        Awesome!

                                 JASMINE
                        Oh, my god! That idea is genius!

           Bill and Arthur pound fists. Rihanna’s Umbrella starts 
           playing on the speakers.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, wait! I’ve heard this song 
                        before! This song is so powerful!
                             (singing along)
                        “Ella! Ella! Ella! Eh! Eh! Eh!”

           Bill and the girls join in on the singing. Jasmine pulls 
           Arthur toward her and sloppily makes out with him.
           INT. ARTHUR’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Arthur is lying in bed. He slowly wakes up. He winces at the 
           sunlight through the window. He is obviously hung over.

           Arthur gets out of bed and stumbles toward the bathroom. He 
           looks at himself in the mirror. There are deep, red scratches 
           all over his back. He hears vapid FEMALE LAUGHTER coming from 
           somewhere in his apartment.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Arthur follows the laughter through his living room and into 
           the kitchen. He peers around the corner to see Jasmine 
           watching TV at Arthur’s kitchen table. She is wearing one of 
           Arthur’s large T-shirts. It has a picture of a bumblebee on 
           it with lettering that reads, “BEE YOURSELF.”

           Jasmine looks up and smiles. He tentatively smiles back.

                                 JASMINE
                        Hey, big man. How you feeling?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Pretty good. Fun night last night.

                                 JASMINE
                        Totally. We almost ran out of saran 
                        wrap. When you broke all that shit 
                        at Bill’s place last night, I was 
                        like, this science teacher is the 
                        shard party master.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, what did I break?

                                 JASMINE
                        15 bottles, 4 windows and a ceramic 
                        dog. Shaz had to take Bill to the 
                        hospital to get stitches.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, my god. Will he be okay?

                                 JASMINE
                        For sure. Scars look good on dudes. 
                        By the way, your apartment is so 
                        weird.

           Arthur looks around at his apartment. For the first time, he 
           seems to realize that his set-up is relatively abnormal.
                                 ARTHUR
                        It does look kind of weird.

                                 JASMINE
                        But at least it’s big. You should 
                        totally throw another party.

                                 ARTHUR
                        A party. That’s a great idea. Cinco 
                        de Mayo’s coming up.

                                 JASMINE 
                             (pointing to the TV)
                        Oh, wait, turn this up! This show 
                        is the bomb!

           Arthur turns up the television. The reality show, Mom’s 
               Approval, is playing again. The couple on the couch is new, 
           but the “MOM” is the same actress from before. The couple 
           nervously awaits Mom’s decision.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Is it always the same mother?

                                 JASMINE
                        Yeah, that’s Mom. She’s just an 
                        actress. And trust me, I was on the 
                        show once, and she’s a total bitch.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You actually went on this show?

                                 JASMINE
                        Yeah, and I didn’t even get Mom’s 
                        approval. It’s like, fuck you, Mom.

           On the TV, Mom’s thumb shoots up.

                                 TANNER SLADE
                        Mom approves!

           The studio audience goes wild. The female contestant lifts 
           her shirt up and shakes her pixilated breasts for her 
           boyfriend’s benefit.

           Arthur can’t help but laugh.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, my god. That chick is awesome. 
                        That move was genius.

                                 JASMINE
                        I know, right?
           Arthur sits down next to Jasmine. They continue watching 
               Mom’s Approval. They burst out laughing together. Arthur’s 
           laughter seems eerily sincere.

           INT. COPY CENTER - NIGHT

           Arthur is at a copy center in a mall. He is arguing with one 
           of the EMPLOYEES.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Look, it’s really simple. All I 
                        want the banner to say is “Cinco de 
                        Mayo Tequila-ocalypse.”

                                 COPY CENTER EMPLOYEE
                        I know, dude. But how do you even 
                        spell that?

           Suddenly, a mentally handicapped person shuffles past the 
           front window of the copy center. The employee giggles.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What?

                                 COPY CENTER EMPLOYEE 
                        Check it out. Retard at the mall.

           Arthur turns and looks. He bursts out laughing.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wow. That’s actually really funny.

                                 COPY CENTER EMPLOYEE
                        Of course. A retard at the mall is 
                        one of the funniest things you 
                        could ever see.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Arthur is in a bathrobe. He talks on the phone while slovenly 
           eating uncooked hotdogs straight out of the package.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Dad, I’ll pick you up in 15 
                        minutes, okay? I’m just finishing 
                        up breakfast.

           There is a KNOCK at the door.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        I gotta go, Dad.
           Arthur hangs up the phone and answers the front door. He 
           opens it to reveal Gertrude. She is holding a pitcher of 
           cucumber water and a box of Russian pastries.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Gertrude, what are you doing here?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Oh. It’s Sunday. I thought...

           Arthur suddenly remembers their study date.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Fuck. I totally forgot. I’m about 
                        to take my dad to a lecture at his, 
                        uh... church. I’m so sorry.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Oh, that’s okay. We can do this 
                        another time. I’ll just go.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, hold on. If you’re willing 
                        to wait a couple hours, I can... Or 
                        you’re welcome to tag along?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        To church with your dad?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Never mind, forget it.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No, no. That sounds fun. I’m not 
                        very religious, but I’d love to 
                        meet your father.

           INT. HOTEL CONVENTION HALL - DAY

           The Reverend Jack Shorko is standing at a glass lectern 
           illuminated from within by an eerie green light. He is 
           addressing a huge audience of followers.

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        Each whisker in the Space Wizard 
                        Gjorganthaal’s mighty beard is a 
                        song. And when all of these songs 
                        come together as one, there is an 
                        explosion of ethereal harmony. 
                        This, my children, will be the 
                        subterranean soundtrack to the 
                        Eternal Party of Souls.
           Cosmic music begins to fill the room.

           ANGLE ON: Seated beside Arthur’s father, Gertrude cynically 
           rolls her eyes to herself at the absurdity of Shorko’s 
           religion. Arthur on the other hand seems uncharacteristically 
           interested in what Shorko is saying.

                                 ED
                             (whispering to Arthur)
                        I know you think this is bullshit, 
                        Arthur. But this guy was dead for 
                        14 minutes, and he--

           Arthur SHUSHES his dad and leans forward to listen. Gertrude 
           notices. She seems surprised by Arthur’s attentiveness.

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        Once you have embraced the Eternal 
                        Party of Souls, no longer will you 
                        be bound to any form of mental or 
                        carnal suffering. Feelings of 
                        loneliness and isolation will all 
                        be vanquished by the funky sounds 
                        erupting from the wizard’s 
                        celestial beard.

           A FOLLOWER in the audience raises her hand.

                                 FEMALE FOLLOWER
                        Is there gonna be a dance floor?

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        Of course, my child. But it will be 
                        unlike any dance floor that the 
                        human mind could ever imagine.

           Arthur raises his hand.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You said this party is at the 
                        center of our planet. But I always 
                        thought the Earth’s core was made 
                        of molten lava.

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        That’s exactly what our enemies in 
                        the scientific community would like 
                        us to believe. But have those 
                        scientists ever been dead for 14 
                        minutes?

           Murmurs of support spread throughout the audience.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, so why does it cost so much 
                        to get into this party? Who does 
                        the money even go to?

           The Reverend Shorko lets out a sigh of annoyance.

                                 JACK SHORKO
                        If you had visited my website, you 
                        would know that the money will be 
                        placed in a pod and launched into 
                        outer space. Gjorganthaal will then 
                        incinerate the pod with his fiery 
                        wand in a holy act symbolizing the 
                        triviality of material wealth.

           Ed nods his head reverently. Gertrude shakes her head in 
           disbelief. Arthur looks strangely satisfied with this answer.

                                 JACK SHORKO (CONT'D)
                        Any other questions?

           Another FOLLOWER raises his hand.

                                 MALE FOLLOWER
                        Yeah, at the Eternal Party of 
                        Souls, will there be seated dining 
                        or is it like a buffet?

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Ed, Arthur and Gertrude file out of the convention hall with 
           all the other followers. Ed slowly lumbers with a cane.

                                 ED
                        So what did you kids think of 
                        Shorko? He’s the real deal, huh?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It was very interesting.

                                 ED
                        You’re damn right it was.

           Ed places his hand on Gertrude’s shoulder.

                                 ED (CONT'D)
                        Smart girl. Hang onto this one, 
                        Arthur. And I’m not just saying 
                        that because she’s the only female 
                        who’s ever given you the time of 
                        day.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        That’s really kind of you to say, 
                        Mr. Overmeyer.

                                 ED
                        Yeah, yeah. I gotta go drain the 
                        lizard.

           He shuffles off to the restroom.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Your dad seems nice. Although, you 
                        two are complete opposites.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Really?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, he’s clearly into his 
                        religion, while you on the other 
                        hand are a man of science.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You don’t think science and 
                        religion can go together?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, let me ask you this. Do you 
                        honestly believe all that money 
                        gets put into a space pod and 
                        incinerated by a wizard’s wand?

           She laughs cynically. Arthur doesn’t.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Not literally. But I thought the 
                        Reverend made some interesting 
                        points, didn’t you?

                                 GERTRUDE
                             (lowers her voice)
                        Arthur, we both know what Ricky 
                        Action said about acquiescing to 
                        other people’s beliefs. But you 
                        don’t have to pretend with me.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (embarrassed)
                        Right. Sorry.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s a shame people don’t acquiesce 
                        to scientific assaults on planetary 
                        crises. Like Global Warming. Or the 
                        honeybee catastrophe you describe 
                        so eloquently in your book.

                                 ARTHUR
                        My book. So you started it?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Actually, I finished it last night. 
                        It was amazing, Arthur. I’d always 
                        thought colony collapse disorder 
                        was a product of climate change, 
                        but your findings on the varroa 
                        mite seem practically irrefutable. 
                        Not to mention, the writing borders 
                        on poetic at times.

           Arthur is speechless.

                                 GERTRUDE (CONT'D)
                        The final chapter where you 
                        postulate a world without honeybees 
                        gave me chills. The second I closed 
                        your book, I went online and 
                        ordered five beehives for my 
                        balcony.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You did?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Every little bit helps, right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I totally agree. Every year I send 
                        my whole Christmas bonus to the 
                        National Beekeepers Society.

           They share a warm smile. Ed returns from the bathroom.

                                 ED
                        All right, who’s ready to sign up 
                        for the Eternal Party of Souls? 
                        Arthur, you in?

           Arthur glances at Gertrude. He hesitates to answer, worried 
           what she’ll think of him. Ed grows impatient.

                                 ED (CONT'D)
                        Oh, great! Here we go again!
                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, Dad. I’ll sign up.

                                 ED
                        That’s my boy!

           Arthur avoids Gertrude’s gaze. Ed puts his arm around Arthur 
           and leads him over to Reverend Shorko. Gertrude observes 
           Arthur shaking the Reverend’s hand. She looks concerned.

           INT. YMCA BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Ricky Action is at the front lecturing the class. Arthur and 
           Gertrude are sitting together at the back.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Okay, you’re at a party. It’s a 
                        crowd of hip, attractive men and 
                        women, total fuck-buddy material. 
                        You’ve got some insightful points 
                        to make. But nobody is listening.

           Ricky Action begins to raise his voice as he stomps around 
           the basketball court.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                             (yelling)
                        So what are you gonna do? You’re 
                        not gonna get their ATTENTION by 
                        talking quietly, are you? You gotta 
                        be LOUD! ASSERTIVELY LOUD! Today’s 
                        lesson is about VOLUME, people! 
                        Attention is something you’ve got 
                        to EARN!

           Arthur confidently raises his hand.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know if I agree with that.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        You disagree? Okay. How so?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I just think being annoyingly loud 
                        can turn people off sometimes.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Well, loudness can be subjective, 
                        Arthur. But we can all agree that 
                        you’d want to be heard.
                                 ARTHUR
                        I think a better way to get 
                        people’s attention would be to do 
                        something crazy, like break a 
                        bottle against the wall.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Breaking a bottle is going to help 
                        you make friends?

                                 ARTHUR
                        It helped me.

           A few people turn around in their chairs to listen to Arthur.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Well, either way, that’s not from 
                        any of my lessons, Arthur. That 
                        sounds like an anomaly.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Actually, there are a lot of things 
                        missing from your lessons. And most 
                        of them could use some tweaking.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Look, let’s just try and stay 
                        focused on the lesson at hand.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Like for instance, when you talked 
                        about playing footsie under the 
                        table with a stranger--

                                 RICKY ACTION
                             (yelling loudly)
                        I SAID, LET’S STAY FOCUSED ON THE 
                        LESSON AT HAND!

           Everyone in the class goes dead silent. They all stare at 
           Ricky Action like he’s lost it.

           Ricky Action struggles to regain his composure. The buck-
           toothed man, KEVIN, hesitantly raises his hand.

                                 RICKY ACTION (CONT'D)
                        Yes, Kevin?

                                 KEVIN
                        See, when you were really loud 
                        right there? That didn’t make me 
                        want to listen to you at all. In 
                        fact, it made you seem desperate.
                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Oh, did it, Kevin?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m just saying.

           Daren, the teenage techie, raises his hand.

                                 DAREN
                        Yeah, I have a question about 
                        Thursday’s lecture on good 
                        grope/bad grope? My lawyer and the 
                        judge both agreed that there’s no 
                        such thing as a good grope. I’m in 
                        a lot of trouble now.

           Before Ricky Action can respond, Arthur stands up and 
           interjects.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What happened, Daren?

                                 DAREN
                        There’s this secretary at work. And 
                        all I did was grope her a little.

           Daren holds up his hands and gestures a double-breast grope.

                                 ARTHUR
                        There’s you’re problem right there. 
                        A breast grope is always a bad 
                        move. Good gropes are down here, 
                        where not everyone can see.

           Arthur pantomimes an ass-grab. The class nods, getting it. 
           Gertrude looks slightly offended by Arthur’s gesture.

                                 DAREN
                        Well, Mr. Action never made that 
                        distinction.

           Whispers of discontent spread throughout the class.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Okay, settle down, people.

           The fat dork, PATRICK, turns around and raises his hand for 
           Arthur to see.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, Patrick?
                                 PATRICK
                        Over Thanksgiving my uncle fell 
                        asleep on the sofa. So I did the 
                        Dick Brow like Mr. Action showed 
                        us, and no one in my family 
                        laughed. One of my little cousins 
                        even started crying. It ruined 
                        Thanksgiving.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Patrick, I’m glad you brought that 
                        up. I’ve got a way cooler version 
                        of the Dick Brow. Everyone, write 
                        this down.

           Everyone prepares to take notes. Gertrude looks uneasy.

           ANGLE ON: Ricky Action crosses his arms, barely containing 
           his angst and jealousy.

           EXT. YMCA - NIGHT

           Gertrude gets into her car and starts the engine. Suddenly, 
           Arthur knocks on her window. She rolls it down.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, you took off pretty fast 
                        there. Didn’t get to say bye.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Sorry, I just wanted to get home to 
                        David. He’s got a bladder infection 
                        right now. Besides, it seemed like 
                        you were pretty occupied.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I was just consoling Daren. He says 
                        he might be facing jail time.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s weird. You’re kind of like 
                        teaching the class now, huh?

           Arthur modestly waves her off.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Anyway, what are you up to tonight?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’m probably going to be blogging 
                        about David’s infection.
           Arthur hands her a flyer. She opens it up and reads it.

                                 GERTRUDE (CONT'D)
                        “Tequila-ocalypse?”

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s going to be really good. I’d 
                        love for you to drop by. You can 
                        meet some of my coworkers.

           Gertrude musters up a smile and shrugs.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Any fuck-buddy material?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Totally!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Arthur, I was joking.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The apartment is packed with partygoers: Dan, Barry, Shaz, 
           Bill’s friends, etc. Hip hop music is turned up loud. 
           Everyone is chatting and laughing and having a blast.

           ANGLE ON: Chuckie is sitting in the same chair as before. He 
           is staring off absently and smiling.

           INT. ARTHUR’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Arthur is doing shots at the kitchen table with Jasmine and 
           Bill. All three of them are pretty drunk. Bill has a massive, 
           unsightly scar on his face that starts at his hairline and 
           ends at his chin.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Dude, Bill, it makes you look like 
                        a bad ass.

                                 JASMINE
                        Totally. Scars are like even cooler 
                        than tribal tattoos.

                                 BILL
                        It’s all good, bro.
                             (lifts up his glass)
                        Live by the shard party, die by the 
                        shard party!
           Bill guzzles his tall glass of tequila. Dan stumbles in. He 
           now has the stubble of a goatee. He slaps Arthur five.

                                 DAN
                        Arthur, my man! This party is the 
                        shit! I can’t believe I used to 
                        think you were a fucking idiot. 
                        You’re my dawg!

           Dan hugs Arthur. Barry pokes his head into the kitchen.

                                 BARRY
                        Arthur, there’s some friend of 
                        yours here. She’s like a sexual 
                        maniac. She can’t stop talking 
                        about her...
                             (does hand quotes)
                        “Hamster.” I’m gonna wreck that 
                        later on!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, “hamster?”

           INT. ARTHUR’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           We follow Arthur through the crowd of people. He finds 
           Gertrude talking to McDermott.

                                 MCDERMOTT
                        So you think I could hammer that 
                        “hamster” some time?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Hammer? No, you have to be gentle 
                        with my hamster.

                                 MCDERMOTT
                        I can be gentle.

           McDermott flicks his tongue in a sexual way. Arthur quickly 
           grabs Gertrude and pulls her over to a less crowded area.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, hey. I’m glad you could 
                        make it.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        This is quite a party.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, you gotta throw down for Cinco 
                        de Mayo, right?
                                 GERTRUDE
                        I guess so.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Right?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Yeah, I already agreed with you.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Cool. Do you need a drink?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Sure. What do you have?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Cuervo, Don Julio, Sauza, Petrón, 
                        Petrón Silver, Petrón Gold--

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’m okay. I noticed that bee poster 
                        you have up in your bedroom. Those 
                        illustrations are magnificent.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Aw, shit. I meant to take that 
                        down. Did anyone else see it?

           Jasmine stumbles up to Arthur and Gertrude. She throws her 
           arm around Arthur.

                                 JASMINE
                        Who’s this fugly nerd?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Uh, Jasmine, let me introduce you 
                        to my friend, Gertrude.

                                 JASMINE
                        I’m Jazzy. Arthur’s girlfriend?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s very nice to meet you. I’ve 
                        heard a lot about you.

                                 JASMINE
                        Yeah, well, I’ve never heard about 
                        you. Who is this little skank?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (whispers)
                        Jazzy, relax.
                                 JASMINE
                        Listen, bitch, Arthur’s my man. 
                        We’re totally doing it. So keep 
                        your non-manicured nerd hands off 
                        him.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, I’m really sorry. Jazzy’s 
                        had a lot to drink.

           Barry lurches up and grabs Gertrude’s ass.

                                 BARRY
                        Hot nerd! Lisa Loeb!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Barry, chill out. She’s not into 
                        it, okay?

           Barry tries to kiss Gertrude. Arthur holds Barry back.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        I said chill out, bro.

           Barry pushes Arthur off.

                                 BARRY
                        Fuck you, cockblocker!

           Arthur shoves Barry really hard. Barry loses his balance and 
           falls onto the couch. Barry tries to get back up, but he 
           suddenly seems extremely dizzy.

                                 BARRY (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, dude. Spins.

           He sits back down on the couch and takes a deep breath. 
           Gertrude rolls her eyes to Arthur.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Was that your “Inner Destroyer?”

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, that guy was 
                        disrespecting you.

                                 JASMINE
                        Fighting is so hot!
           Jasmine grabs Arthur and forces him into a sloppy makeout 
           session. Disgusted, Gertrude storms out of the apartment.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Gertrude leaves the apartment. Arthur runs out after her.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, wait!

           He catches up to her outside the elevator. She pushes the 
           button a few times.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Gertrude, what’s wrong?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What’s wrong? You were acting like 
                        an ignoramus in there.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no, that’s not me. That’s just 
                        “Dumbing It Down,” you know?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Honestly, I can’t even tell the 
                        difference with you anymore.

           The elevator doors open. Gertrude gets in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, it’s me, Arthur. The bee 
                        guy? Colony collapse thing? Science 
                        writer? You know who I am. We’re 
                        both really smart.

           Gertrude avoids Arthur’s gaze. The elevator doors close. 
           Arthur looks sad and defeated.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           Arthur kicks a water fountain, knocking it off the wall.

           INT. ARTHUR’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The party is pretty much over. The music is off. There is 
           garbage all over the floor. Most of the guests have left. Two 
           ugly, drunken, haggard SLUTS are snorting cocaine off the 
           kitchen table.
           We pan over to see Arthur sitting glumly on the couch next to 
           Chuckie. Arthur looks depressed.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think I fucked up tonight, 
                        Chuckie.

           Chuckie smiles, seemingly oblivious to what Arthur is saying.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I like all my new friends 
                        and all. And having a girlfriend is 
                        pretty cool.

           ANGLE ON: Jasmine is passed out on the floor. Her hair is 
           caked in vomit.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        But there’s this other girl, man. 
                        She’s kind of a weirdo. But she’s a 
                        cool weirdo. We’ve got so much in 
                        common. And I drove her away 
                        tonight. She hates me now. What 
                        should I do?

           Arthur shakes his head to himself, not expecting any answer 
           from Chuckie. Then suddenly...

                                 CHUCKIE
                        Well, normally I’d recommend 
                        sending flowers. But that woman 
                        didn’t seem like the flower type.

           Arthur slowly turns to face Chuckie. Arthur has an expression 
           of utter disbelief.

                                 CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you try sending her a 
                        link to an obscure website that you 
                        know only she would like. It’ll 
                        make her feel special.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait. Aren’t you like...

                                 CHUCKIE
                        Retarded?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.

           Chuckie crosses his legs and folds his hands over his knee, 
           an unexpectedly sophisticated mannerism.
                                 CHUCKIE
                        I’ve been observing you, Arthur. I 
                        believe that you, more than anyone, 
                        understand what is to be gained 
                        from acting like an imbecile. But 
                        remember, there are limits.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So you’ve just been faking your 
                        retardedness this whole time?

                                 CHUCKIE
                        No offense, Arthur. But I think 
                        it’s time you asked yourself who 
                        the real retard is.

           Arthur lowers his gaze and absorbs Chuckie’s wisdom.

                                 CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got 
                        some business to attend to.

           Chuckie stands up and resumes his imbecilic demeanor. He 
           shuffles into the kitchen and approaches the cokehead sluts.

                                 CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                        Happy boobies!

           The cokehead sluts give him a motherly look.

                                 COKEHEAD SLUT #1
                        Oh, that’s so cute. He wants to see 
                        your boobies.

                                 COKEHEAD SLUT #2
                        Should I show them?

                                 COKEHEAD SLUT #1
                        Yeah, how else is he ever gonna 
                        know what they look like?

           One of the cokehead sluts lifts up her shirt and shows her 
           breasts to Chuckie.

                                 COKEHEAD SLUT #1 (CONT'D)
                        Do you want to touch them?

                                 CHUCKIE
                        Happy touchie boobies!
           INT. YMCA OFFICE - DAY

           Ricky Action is sitting across from the desk of the YMCA 
           DIRECTOR. The director is looking through some papers.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        Okay, Mr. Schitz--

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        It’s Mr. Action.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        According to my records, your name 
                        is Elliot Schitz.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        I’m in the process of having it 
                        legally changed to Ricky S. Action. 
                        Know what the S stands for?

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        Honestly, I don’t care.

           There is an awkward silence. The YMCA Director holds up a 
           handful of printed emails.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Over the past few days, I’ve 
                        received no less than twelve 
                        complaints about your seminar. The 
                        students claim that you’re 
                        unqualified to teach. All of them 
                        are requesting a full refund.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        What exactly are they saying?

           The YMCA Director reads from the emails:

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        “Mr. Action has proven to be a 
                        complete social moron.”
                             (reads from another email)
                        “Not only is Mr. Action offensive 
                        and unknowledgeable, his halitosis 
                        borders on toxic.”
                             (reads from another email)
                        “Mr. Action’s techniques are dated 
                        and generally ineffective. In fact, 
                        it’s obvious to everyone in the 
                        class that one of the students 
                        should be teaching this seminar.” 
           The YMCA Director sets down the emails.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Is this true? Does one of your 
                        students know more about the 
                        subject matter than you?

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Yeah, right.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR 
                        Because if so, Mr. Schitz, maybe we 
                        should be paying your student to 
                        lead your seminar.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        No, no, it’s just this one student. 
                        He’s a disrespectful know-it-all. 
                        But believe me, he won’t be around 
                        next semester.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        There won’t be a next semester.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Excuse me?

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        We’re cancelling your seminar.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        You can’t do that. I’m doing God’s 
                        work here.

                                 YMCA DIRECTOR
                        Also, the custodial staff was 
                        recently called down to the 
                        basement locker room to investigate 
                        an overpowering smell of urine. 
                        They seem to suspect that someone 
                        might be living down there. If 
                        that’s the case, I would hope that 
                        that person would clear their 
                        things out by 8pm tonight.

           EXT. YMCA - DAY

           Ricky Action walks away from the building. He is carrying his 
           soiled sleeping bag, a bunch of files and an old, busted 
           typewriter. A group of custodians on their smoke break watch 
           him leave. They shake their heads scornfully.
           Ricky Action tries to get into his car, but he can’t reach 
           his key. He accidentally drops his typewriter to the ground. 
           He grits his teeth and chokes back his anger.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        Fucking Overmeyer.

           INT. FACULTY LOUNGE - MORNING

           Arthur walks in. The lounge is mysteriously empty and quiet.

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        Good morning, Arthur.

           Arthur turns around to see Donald standing in the doorway. 
           Donald grins sinisterly and approaches him.

                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        Normally, I wouldn’t dare set foot 
                        in such an exclusive lounge. But I 
                        hope you’ll pardon my impudence 
                        just this once.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Where is everyone?

                                 DONALD
                        Funny you should ask. The 
                        principal, my wife, the love of my 
                        life, would like to meet with you 
                        in her office this morning.

                                 ARTHUR
                        For what?

                                 DONALD
                        Let’s just say it’s not about vomit 
                        puddles.

           INT. SALLY’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Arthur is standing across from Sally’s desk. Sally is sitting 
           there with a group of teachers including Jasmine, Dan, Barry, 
           Tim and a few others. Everyone looks pissed.

                                 SALLY
                        The reason why I’ve asked you here, 
                        Arthur, is because we all received 
                        an interesting fax this morning 
                        from a Mr. Ricky S. Action.
           Arthur looks mortified. He glances over at Tim for help. Tim 
           shakes his head in condemnation. Sally holds up the fax.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        It’s apparently a list of your 
                        “Dumb It Down goals.” Would you 
                        like to read for us, Arthur?

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s okay. I’d rather not.

                                 SALLY
                        Then allow me to do the honor.

           Sally reads aloud from the fax:

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        “Goal number one. Find a way to 
                        communicate with all of the 
                        mindless idiots who work at my 
                        school. This includes the teachers, 
                        the students and the principal.”

           Sally gives Arthur a nasty look.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        “Goal number two. I would 
                        especially like to befriend Dan and 
                        Barry, who seem like they’d be 
                        enjoyable friends, despite the fact 
                        that their brains clearly function 
                        at a much lower level than mine.”

           Dan and Barry stare at Arthur with repugnance.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        Ms. Tweston, would you care to 
                        continue?

                                 JASMINE
                        Thank you, Dr. Bernstein.

           Sally gives the fax to Jasmine. Jasmine reads aloud with the 
           speed and articulation of a 5th grader:

                                 JASMINE (CONT'D)
                        “Goal number two. I would 
                        especially like to befriend Dan and 
                        Barry, who seem”...
                             (catches herself)
                        Oops. Sorry. “Goal number three. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JASMINE (CONT'D)
                        I very much hope to have oral, 
                        vaginal and possibly anal sex with 
                        the gorgeous Jasmine Tweston. Even 
                        though everyone says she’s a ditzy 
                        problem drinker, she is still an 
                        extraordinary specimen of physical 
                        beauty.”

           Jasmine scowls at Arthur.

                                 JASMINE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you, Arthur. I thought we were 
                        like falling in love.

                                 SALLY
                        Did you write this, Arthur?

                                 ARTHUR
                        What? No.

                                 SALLY
                        Really? Because we compared the 
                        handwriting with a note that you 
                        slipped Jasmine last week.

           Jasmine takes out a small note and reads from it:

                                 JASMINE
                        “Dear Jazzy. Boy, I thought your 
                        hummers were amazing. But last 
                        night when you did that thing where 
                        you”--

                                 SALLY
                        Okay, Ms. Tweston, we don’t need to 
                        hear everything Arthur’s written.

           Jasmine puts the note away.

                                 SALLY (CONT'D)
                        I’ll ask you again, Arthur, did you 
                        write these things? Is this what 
                        you actually think of us? That 
                        we’re all just morons and idiots 
                        and in some cases sex toys?

           Arthur thinks it over for a long, silent beat. He seems to 
           arrive at some sort of personal conclusion.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes. It’s true. I did write all of 
                        those things. They were my goals 
                        for a seminar I took to learn how 
                        to fit in with people like you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        In all honesty, I do think you’re 
                        all morons and idiots. And no 
                        offense, Jasmine, but we were never 
                        in love. I just used you for sex. 
                        All three types of sex.

                                 DAN
                        What the hell, Overmeyer? You took 
                        a seminar to become cool? You’re 
                        such a loser.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I am a loser. But who’s the bigger 
                        loser, huh? Every single one of you 
                        fell for my act. Dan, you yourself 
                        thought my watch trick was even 
                        better than your monkey brain.

           Arthur walks over to the door.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        But you know what? I don’t need to 
                        fit in with you anymore. I’m okay 
                        with being smart and socially 
                        weird. Because I realize now that 
                        there are other smart and socially 
                        weird people out there just like 
                        me. And I think I’d rather fit in 
                        with them.

           Arthur opens the door and leaves. Everyone left in the office 
           looks shocked and offended.

           ANGLE ON: Tim smiles reverently.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Arthur hurries toward the building’s exit. He sees Donald 
           mopping the floors. Arthur stops and calls to him:

                                 ARTHUR
                        Donald! I’m sorry I’ve been so mean 
                        to you lately! I’ll make it up to 
                        you! Let me take you out for some 
                        wheat grass shots this weekend!

                                 DONALD
                        Really? That sounds great!

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll call you later, okay?
           Arthur dashes out of the building. Donald’s sudden enthusiasm 
           disappears. He resumes mopping.

                                 DONALD
                             (to himself)
                        Fuck that idiot.

           INT. GERTRUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Gertrude is packing up her things into boxes. The haunting 
           music of Mozart’s Requiem fills the room.

           Someone KNOCKS at the front door. Gertrude opens the door 
           with the chain lock still latched. Arthur is standing there.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What do you want, Arthur?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, I’ve made a huge mistake.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Look, I’m not in the mood for this 
                        right now. David’s bladder 
                        infection was worse than I thought.

           ANGLE ON: Gertrude’s dead hamster is lying in a ziplock bag 
           on the kitchen counter.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, my god. Is he okay?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        He passed away last night.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 GERTRUDE 
                        Advertisers are bailing out on the 
                        website, so I won’t be able to 
                        afford this apartment anymore. I’m 
                        moving back to my parents’ house.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What? Gertrude, you can’t leave.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Why not?
                                 ARTHUR
                        Because I need you. You’re the most 
                        amazing human being I’ve ever met.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What about “Jazzy?”

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m done with her. I’m done with 
                        all those people at my party. I’m 
                        done with “Dumbing It Down.” Ricky 
                        Action was the worst thing that 
                        ever happened to me. The only good 
                        that ever came from that whole 
                        stupid class was meeting you.

           Gertrude seems reluctantly touched.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Please. Can I come in? I just... 
                        I’ve fallen in love with you.

           Gertrude melts. She unlatches the door and allows Arthur into 
           her apartment. Arthur takes Gertrude into his arms. They kiss 
           in a tender, classic, non-sloppy way.

           INT. GERTRUDE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Arthur and Gertrude are lying in bed together. She cuddles up 
           to him. He holds her.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        This feels perfect, doesn’t it?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Totally.

           Gertrude looks out the window and watches as dusk settles in.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s already getting dark out. 
                        We’ve spent the whole day in here.

           They share a flirtatious chuckle.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So what do you wanna do?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I don’t know. We could cook up some 
                        dinner. Pour ourselves some wine. 
                        Do a little reading.
                                 ARTHUR
                        What’s on TV tonight?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I don’t have a TV.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You don’t?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I never bought one.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Shit. I think Mom’s Approval is on. 
                        Have you ever seen that show?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s one of those dating shows. 
                        It’s fucking awesome.

           Gertrude looks slightly put off by Arthur’s tone. She moves a 
           few inches away from him. In the next room, we can hear the 
           faint BUZZING of a bee that has entered Gertrude’s apartment.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                        Hey, why don’t we go to a bar 
                        tonight? I wouldn’t mind coming 
                        back here for a little drunk booty.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t tell me you’ve never bumped 
                        uglies when you’re wasted.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I didn’t understand a word of that.

                                 ARTHUR
                        All I’m saying is sloppy slamming 
                        can be really, really fun.

           Gertrude sits up and shoots Arthur a scared look. She can’t 
           believe the idiotic drivel that’s coming out of his mouth.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Arthur, are you okay?
                                 ARTHUR
                        What are you talking about?

           The BUZZING gets louder as the bee enters the bedroom. Arthur 
           looks distracted, as he follows the bee with his eyes. He 
           picks up a copy of his book from the bedside table.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You’re acting like... like a stupid 
                        person.

           The bee lands on the wall next to the bed. Arthur quickly 
           SMASHES his book against the wall, splattering the bee.

                                 GERTRUDE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing, Arthur?! That 
                        was a forager!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, but bees like hurt.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        How can you say that?

           Arthur considers this for a moment. He holds the book in 
           front of him and stares at the dead bee’s guts stuck to the 
           cover. His eyes widen, as a horrific realization sets in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh, my god.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What is it?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think I’ve become stupid. Like 
                        stupid for real. Like I’m not 
                        pretending anymore.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What? That’s impossible. That 
                        doesn’t happen. You can’t just 
                        suddenly become unintelligent.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude, I think my brain’s 
                        breaking down on me. Maybe I 
                        haven’t been using it enough.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No. Arthur, you’re still the same 
                        person who wrote that incredibly 
                        insightful book. You have to be.
           Gertrude points to Arthur’s book. He flips through it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Jesus. I barely remember what’s in 
                        this book. Oh, god! I’m a total 
                        fucking idiot! FUCK!

           Arthur throws the book across the room. He punches the wall 
           as hard as he can, chipping the plaster.

           The two of them sit there together in silence. There is now a 
           huge distance between them.

           Gertrude softly begins to cry. Arthur awkwardly hugs her.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It just seems like we’re meant to 
                        be together, you know? Without you, 
                        I’ve got nothing left in life.

           Arthur can’t help but cry with her.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What can I say? This sucks. I’m 
                        looking at the shit stains in your 
                        underwear right now, and I think 
                        they’re the funniest thing ever. 
                        And I know I shouldn’t think that.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Isn’t there some way we can make 
                        this work?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know, Gertrude. I don’t 
                        think I can go back to what I was. 
                        It’s like I’ve given myself brain 
                        damage and shit.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, if you can make yourself 
                        stupid, then maybe I can, too.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You become stupid? That’s so 
                        stupid!

           Arthur cries even harder. Gertrude stares him in the eye.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Arthur, listen to me. I can’t be 
                        alone anymore. I’m willing to do 
                        whatever it takes to be with you.
           Arthur pulls himself together. There is a long, silent beat, 
           as both of them contemplate what Gertrude has just said.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           SUPERIMPOSE: “ONE YEAR LATER.”

           Over black, we hear the sounds of a studio audience cheering.

                                 TANNER SLADE (O.S.)
                        Welcome back, everybody!

           INT. THE SET OF MOM’S APPROVAL - NIGHT

           Tanner Slade is sitting in a chair, addressing the camera.

                                 TANNER SLADE
                        For those of you just now joining 
                        us, we’re here with one of the 
                        coolest, craziest, most bad-ass 
                        couples we have ever had on this 
                        show. Arthur, Gertrude, you have 
                        one more chance to convince Mom 
                        that you guys are totally awesome 
                        for each other.

           ANGLE ON: Arthur and Gertrude are sitting on the couch 
           together. Gertrude now has long bleach blonde hair and a fake 
           tan. She is wearing a baby-T that reveals her belly button 
           ring. Arthur is dressed in a tank-top and a fedora.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Gertrude totally rocks my world. 
                        We’re like bitchin’ soulmates. We 
                        party together. We hit the gym 
                        together. We both have VIP passes 
                        to the Eternal Party of Souls.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        We both love Two and a Half Men.

                                 ARTHUR
                        We can’t stop talking about it.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s the funniest show ever.

           INT. DONALD AND SALLY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Donald and Sally are sitting on the couch watching Arthur and 
           Gertrude on the television.
                                 ARTHUR
                             (on the TV)
                        Listen, Tanner. If Mom doesn’t 
                        approve, then Mom is a retard.

           The studio audience laughs.

                                 SALLY
                        Would you mind turning it up, 
                        sweetie?

                                 DONALD
                        Honey, I love you to death. But 
                        honestly, the remote is a good 
                        three inches closer to you.

           They keep watching TV. Neither of them touches the remote.

                                 SALLY
                        Sweetie, I think I’d like a 
                        divorce.

           INT. SPORTS BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jasmine, Dan and Barry are wasted. They are watching Mom’s 
               Approval on the barroom television.

                                 BARRY
                        No way! It’s Arthur and that crazy 
                        hamster chick!

                                 JASMINE
                        What the hell is that slut wearing?

           Jasmine throws an ashtray at the TV. The screen shatters. 
           Glass shards rain down on the bar. Jasmine looks depressed.

                                 DAN
                        Shard party?

                                 JASMINE
                        I’m not in the mood.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ed is lying down in a hospital bed breathing through an 
           oxygen tube. He seems deathly ill. Mom’s Approval is playing 
           on TV. Ed recognizes Arthur. His eyes bulge with amazement.

                                 JACK SHORKO (O.S.)
                        And sign here. And right here.
           We pull back to reveal a clipboard on Ed’s lap. The Reverend 
           Shorko is holding a pen in Ed’s hand and moving it around to 
           sign a bunch of documents.

                                 JACK SHORKO (CONT'D)
                        And here. And sign here. And here. 
                        And here. And here. And here.

           EXT. SEEDY DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS 

           A group of homeless people are crowded around outside of an 
           electronics store. Mom’s Approval is playing on a big flat 
           screen TV in the window.

           We see a dirty, scraggly, homeless Ricky Action watching 
           through the window. He pounds his chest and pumps his fist.

                                 RICKY ACTION
                        That’s my dawg, yo! I taught that 
                        cocksucker everything he knows!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CUSTODIAL LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           Chuckie is seated among a bunch of mops, brooms and cleaning 
           agents. Mom’s Approval is playing on a small TV. Chuckie 
           isn’t paying any attention to it. He is too engrossed in a 
           copy of Critique of Pure Reason by IMMANUEL KANT.

           Chuckie hears footsteps coming down the hallway. He turns his 
           book upside down. The footsteps fade away. Chuckie turns his 
           book right-side-up again and resumes reading.

           INT. THE SET OF MOM’S APPROVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Tanner Slade addresses the audience.

                                 TANNER SLADE
                        And now the moment of truth. Let’s 
                        see if Arthur and Gertrude were 
                        meant to be together. Let’s see if 
                        they can get... MOM’S APPROVAL!

           The curtains part to reveal Mom. The crowd goes nuts. Mom 
           steps forward and holds out her horizontal thumb.

           The cheering subsides into a tense silence. Arthur and 
           Gertrude nervously hold hands, their eyes locked on Mom.
           Mom’s thumb hangs in the air. Will it go up or down?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
