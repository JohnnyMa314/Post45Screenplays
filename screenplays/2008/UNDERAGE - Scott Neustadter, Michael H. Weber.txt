        To love is to suffer. 
        To avoid suffering, one must not love. But then, one suffers from 
        not loving. 

        Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to 
        suffer is to suffer. 

        To be happy is to love. 
        To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy. 

        Therefore, to be happy, one must love or love to suffer or suffer 
        from too much happiness.”
        - Woody Allen, Love and Death, 1975

        "The heart wants what it wants. You meet someone and you fall in 
        love and that's that."

           INT SOME RANDOM WOMAN’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           ANDY MASON opens his eyes. He rubs them, orients himself, and 
           gets out of bed. This is not Andy’s bedroom. It belongs to 
           the sleeping WOMAN by his side. Andy is careful not to wake 
           her as he gets out of bed and puts on his pants.

           Instead of just, you know, leaving, Andy finds a pen and 
           paper and writes the girl a note. 

           INSERT: “Dear...”

           Andy stops writing. He realizes he doesn’t know the girl’s 
           name. Shit.

           Andy looks around the room for some clues, seeing none. 
           Finally his eyes fall on a small blue Tiffany box on her 
           night stand. Tiffany... 

           Maybe that’s it? Andy writes “Dear Tiffany, great meeting 
           you. Take it easy, Andy.” He leaves that on her desk, grabs 
           the rest of his clothes, and walks out the door.

           EXT RANDOM WOMAN’S BUILDING - SAME

           Andy emerges half-dressed from the building and walks to his 
           car. In the light we get a good look at him. He’s approaching 
           30. Attractive. Charming. Guys like him. Girls like him a 
           lot. 

           Andy checks himself in the rearview mirror. Likes what he 
           sees. Outside, a GUY IN A SUIT passes, talking on a cell 
           phone. Guy seems real agitated. Andy smiles, shakes his head. 
           Turns up the radio. Drives off.

           Unlike the Suit Guy, Andy is a personal trainer. His close 
           friend/ co-worker BRUCE (6’5”, 80 pounds) is there as well.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey Bruce. What was that girl’s 
                        name last night?

                                 BRUCE
                        The one you went home with?
                            (beat)
                        You don’t remember her name?

                                 ANDY
                        What? These things happen.

                                 BRUCE
                        Tracy.
                                 ANDY
                            (damn)
                        So close.

                                 BRUCE
                        You’re unbelievable.

                                 ANDY
                        How did you do with the friend?

                                 BRUCE
                        How do you think I did?

                                 ANDY
                        Aw man, I’m sorry.

                                 BRUCE
                            (holds up a napkin)
                        No, dude, I got the digits!

                                 ANDY
                        Way to go, Bruce! I’m proud of you.  
                        So when you gonna call?

                                 BRUCE
                        What do you mean? I’ve called twice 
                        already.

           This deflates Andy. He just shakes his head at his friend.

                                 BRUCE
                        Was that wrong?

           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - DAY

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - Andy is helping a very sexy FEMALE CLIENT (30s) do squats. 
           She sticks her shapely ass right smack in his face. Andy 
           smiles. He has the best job in the world.

           - Andy says goodbye to a MALE CLIENT, (50s).

                                 ANDY
                        Ice that knee when you get home, 
                        Steve.

                                 MALE CLIENT
                        Will do. And hey, stop by the 
                        restaurant anytime. On the house.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m gonna take you up on that.

           - Andy stretches a SOCCER MOM early 40s but thinks she’s 
           younger.
                                 ANDY
                        Where does it hurt?

           Soccer Mom moves his hand from her calf to her upper thigh.

                                 SOCCER MOM
                        Here.

           Andy massages her thigh. She moans a little. 

                                 ANDY
                        You need to stretch more, Mrs. 
                        Green.

                                 SOCCER MOM
                        Please... call me Amanda.

           Bruce is watching this, not paying attention to his 70-year 
           old CLIENT, who is nearly crushed by the barbell. 

           INT MCSORLEY’S - SAME

           A hip local bar. Bruce follows Andy as they walk inside.

                                 BRUCE
                        Should I call her again? 

                                 ANDY
                        No.

                                 BRUCE
                        Maybe she lost her phone. Maybe she 
                        didn’t get the message.

                                 ANDY
                        I think you didn’t get the message.
                            (to the Bartender)
                        Two shots, bourbon. 
                            (to Bruce)
                        What are you having?

                                 BRUCE
                        Chardonnay?
                            (off Andy’s look)
                        Beer. 
                            (beat)
                        So what do you think I should do?

                                 ANDY
                        First of all, you should stop 
                        complaining.

                                 BRUCE 
                        Easy for you to say. 
                                 ANDY
                        You know how good you have it? We 
                        both do. We make our own hours. 
                        Dress how we want. Work’s not 
                        exactly stressful, know what I 
                        mean? Then at night, we go out, we 
                        meet girls, we hook up...

                                 BRUCE
                        Well you do.

                                 ANDY
                        ...we got it made, my friend. What 
                        more could you possibly want?

                                 BRUCE
                        I just want a nice girl, Andy. 
                        That’s what I want.

           The drinks come.

                                 ANDY
                        Hate to break it to you buddy, but 
                        this is a bar...
                            (beat)
                        ...there’s no nice girls here.

           Andy downs both shots, grabs Bruce, they go into the crowd.

           LATER. Andy talking to one GIRL. She’s totally interested. 
           Bruce is next to them, his arms crossed, trying to look busy. 

           LATER. Andy pushes Bruce over to a SECOND GIRL. We don’t hear 
           what’s said but Bruce very clearly strikes out. Andy shakes 
           his head.

           LATER. Andy and Bruce back at the bar. More drinks come.

                                 BRUCE
                        See? I’m out there, working it, 
                        throwing pitches... women won’t 
                        give me the time of day.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not that bad.

                                 BRUCE
                            (to Girl at Bar)
                        Excuse me, can you tell me what 
                        time it is?

                                 GIRL AT BAR
                            (looks at Bruce; beat)
                        No.
                                 BRUCE
                            (point proven, right back 
                             to Andy)
                        And you... you just stand there, 
                        with your smile and your... stupid 
                        dimples... you get whatever you 
                        want. I got a nice smile. I’m 
                        taller than you. What the fuck?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s the smell. 

                                 BRUCE
                        What smell?

                                 ANDY
                        You have a smell.

                                 BRUCE
                        What do I smell like?

                                 ANDY
                        Desperation. 

                                 BRUCE
                        It’s Drakkar Noir!

                                 ANDY
                        Well that’s also a problem.
                            (to Bartender)
                        Two more.
                            (back to Bruce)
                        See, women have a keen sense of 
                        smell, Bruce. It’s in their DNA. 
                        You know, like... science and shit.

           The drinks come. Andy downs them both. Signals for more.

                                 ANDY
                        Let me see your game. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Huh?

                                 ANDY
                        Pretend I’m a girl. Pick me up.

                                 BRUCE
                        Um... ok. 
                            (gets into “character”)
                        “Hi, I’m Bruce --”

                                 ANDY
                        There. Already you lost me.
                                 BRUCE
                        But --

                                 ANDY
                        You’re being yourself! That’s not 
                        what girls want.

                                 BRUCE
                        What do they want?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know. They’re crazy. They 
                        all want something different. The 
                        trick is to figure out what it 
                        is... and be that.

           Andy sees a WOMAN across the bar.

                                 ANDY 
                            (head nod)
                        2 o’clock. Vinyl skirt,  tank top, 
                        maybe a tattoo or six...yup, there 
                        we go. So what’s that tell you? 
                        Bruce has no idea) 
                        She likes the bad boy, Bruce. You 
                        go in there all broody and tough, 
                        you’re golden.
                            (pointing to a 2nd WOMAN)
                        How bout her? Pantsuit. Mojito.  
                        Not one but two Blackberrys. This 
                        girl needs to relax. And you’re a 
                        massage therapist. Bam. Guaranteed 
                        sex.

           Bruce isn’t convinced. 

                                 ANDY
                        Ok. Over here we’ve got -- 

           At which point, a GIRL has arrived to interrupt. 

                                 GIRL 
                        Sorry. Is anyone (sitting here)?

           Short 1960s haircut, smooth skin, bright eyes. Hot. Her name 
           as we’ll soon discover is BRADEN MATTHEWS.

                                 ANDY 
                        Uh... no. Please.

           She sits. Andy winks at Bruce. Watch and learn.

                                 ANDY 
                        I’m Andy. 
                                 BRADEN
                        Braden. 

                                 ANDY
                        You don’t belong here, do you 
                        Braden?

                                 BRADEN
                            (beat)
                        Sorry?

                                 ANDY
                        You just seem... out of place. Like 
                        you belong somewhere else.

                                 BRADEN
                        And where is it I belong?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m thinking... Paris. 1964. 

           Braden smiles. He’s got her.

                                 ANDY
                        You know the French New Wave? 
                        Truffaut, Godard... You look 
                        straight out of one of those 
                        movies. 

           Braden starts to laugh.

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 BRADEN
                        Does that line ever work?

           Bruce gets a kick out of Andy being taken to task. 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not a line.

                                 BRADEN
                        Uh-huh. Like you’ve seen any of 
                        those movies.

                                 ANDY
                        Braden, do I look like someone who 
                        lies to impress women?

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re a guy, aren’t you?

           Bruce loves this girl! She’s taking Andy down. Andy, however, 
           is undeterred.
                                 ANDY
                        How bout a drink...?

                                 BRADEN
                        And now you’re trying to get me 
                        drunk.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m just trying to get me drunk. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ll have a water.

                                 ANDY
                        Whatever your heart desires. Why 
                        don’t you sit over there on the 
                        couch? I’ll bring it right over.

                                 BRADEN
                        Ok.

           Braden gets up and walks over to a couch. Andy turns to 
           Bruce, smiles. Bruce can’t believe it! 

           SOME TIME LATER. Andy and Braden on the couch. They laugh at 
           something.  Andy is totally lit.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve been meaning to ask... how 
                        come you’re all alone?

                                 BRADEN
                            (shrugs)
                        Don’t most of those French New Wave 
                        girls end up killing their 
                        boyfriends?

                                 ANDY
                        If you say so.

                                 BRADEN
                        Maybe that’s why.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, you don’t scare me. I like a 
                        challenge.

                                 BRADEN
                        Good. You found one.

                                 ANDY
                        You know, it’s loud in here. You 
                        wanna --?

                                 BRADEN
                        Sure.
           Now Andy is surprised. Just like that?

                                 ANDY
                        Really?

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy... 
                            (smiles)
                        ...you had me at Truffaut.

           Braden stands up and heads towards the exit. Andy follows, 
           psyched. On his way out the door, he throws his car keys to 
           Bruce and winks.

           EXT/INT BRADEN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Andy and Braden enter her place. They move through the living 
           room, climb up the stairs, and make their way into her 
           bedroom, lip-locked the whole way. The door shuts in our face 
           and we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT BRADEN’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Andy wakes up in bed. Tries to orient himself. Sees the 
           sleeping lump next to him. Remembers. 

           Careful not to disturb her, he gets out of bed. He looks 
           around the room -- frilly bedspread, pink wallpaper, stuffed 
           bear on the bed -- a real girly girl lives here. Andy puts on 
           his clothes as quietly as possible and heads out the door. 

           On the way down the stairs, he passes several hanging photos 
           of the girl as a child, including one with her father HAROLD, 
           late 50s, (even in pictures an intense son of a bitch). 

           Andy smiles -- cute kid. Then, for a second, merely having 
           these pictures up seems kinda strange. Andy blinks. Whatever, 
           he’s out of there.

           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - DAY

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - Andy is training a MALE CLIENT (40s).

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks again for the tickets 
                        George. Courtside is amazing.  

                                 MALE CLIENT
                        Anytime I’m not using them, they’re 
                        yours.
           Andy is psyched. The loudspeaker interrupts with an 
           announcement:

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Andy, call on line two.

           Andy finds this odd. 

                                 ANDY
                        Let me see who that is.

           He heads over to reception and picks up the phone. 

                                 ANDY
                        Andy, here.

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Hello, tiger!

           SPLITSCREEN WITH BRADEN, in her bedroom.

                                 ANDY
                            (confused)
                        Hello?

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s me!

           Andy can’t even imagine who this is.

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s Braden.

                                 ANDY
                            (no idea)
                        Um, I think you have the wrong --

                                 BRADEN
                        From last night. Braden.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        Oh, Braden. Right... of course. 
                        Braden. Hi. How can I help you?

                                 BRADEN
                        Just calling to say what’s up.

           Andy looks at the phone like it’s diseased.

                                 ANDY
                        Um... how you did get this number?
                                 BRADEN
                        Oh, right. Duh. That’s what I 
                        called to tell you. Your phone... 
                        you left it at my place.

           Andy feels his pockets. Realizes she’s right, he doesn’t have 
           his phone. Mouths “shit.”

                                 ANDY
                        So I did. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ll be home all day. How bout you 
                        swing by later on, pick it up? 

           Andy mouths “shit, shit, shit.” Weighs his options -- buy a 
           new phone, go back and get this one. 

                                 BRADEN
                        You remember where I live, don’t 
                        you?

           EXT/INT BRADEN’S HOUSE

           Andy rings the bell. Braden answers and gives him a big hug.

                                 BRADEN
                        It is soooo good to see you! 

           Braden is already halfway up the stairs to her room. Andy has 
           no choice but to follow. Which he does very hesitantly. 

                                 ANDY
                        I can’t really stay actually...

           Braden is now in her bedroom. Andy is making sure to remain 
           outside of it. She plops down on the bed like a teenager. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Come here.

                                 ANDY
                        Um... No.

                                 BRADEN
                        Why not? What’s the matter?

           Andy sighs. He’s gonna have to lay the smackdown. He enters 
           the room and sits on her bed. 

                                 ANDY
                            (deep breath)
                        How do I put this?
           Before he continues, Andy sees the stuffed animal on the bed. 
           What’s weird is that it isn’t just the one. There’s like ten 
           of these things. He continues.

                                 ANDY
                        I think maybe you’ve got the wrong 
                        idea. About us.

                                 BRADEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, see, the whole boyfriend/ 
                        girlfriend thing. That’s really not 
                        what I do.
                            (off her look)
                        I’m just... I’m not a one-woman 
                        man, you know? Relationships, that 
                        sort of thing... not for me.

                                 BRADEN
                        But... we had sex last night. 

                                 ANDY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BRADEN
                        You wouldn’t have sex with someone 
                        if you weren’t gonna see them 
                        again, would you?

           Andy is speechless. He stands up.

                                 ANDY
                        You know, I think I’ll just grab my 
                        phone and be --

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy...

                                 ANDY
                        Hmm?

                                 BRADEN
                        Sit down.

                                 ANDY 
                        Nah, I think I’m gonna --. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        Sit. Down. 

           Andy rolls his eyes. Very reluctantly sits. 
                                 BRADEN
                        So it’s like this. I have good news 
                        and I have bad news. Which you want 
                        first?

                                 ANDY
                        The... bad news?

                                 BRADEN
                        Well, the bad news is... I’m not 

           A brief moment of silence.

                                 ANDY
                        Please tell me you’re 19.

                                 BRADEN
                        No.

           At which point, Andy’s world comes crashing down. 

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        Oh fuck me. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Already did that! 

           Andy starts to freak out.

                                 BRADEN
                        Now don’t freak out. There’s good 
                        news too! 

                                 ANDY
                        Is it that I’m dreaming?

                                 BRADEN
                        No.

                                 ANDY
                        Then there’s no good news. Holy 
                        shit...

           Braden moves over to Andy to comfort him. He runs from her 
           like she’s diseased.

                                 ANDY
                        No, get that away from me!

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s not contagious.
                                 ANDY
                        It’s illegal! I’ve committed a 
                        crime! I’m gonna go to jail...! 

                                 BRADEN
                        Only if I say something.

                                 ANDY
                        ...And I was hammered! I don’t 
                        remember...
                            (beat)
                        Wait, what did you say?

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re only in trouble if the cops 
                        find out. And I’m real good at 
                        keeping secrets.

                                 ANDY
                            (relieved)
                        Oh. That is... you would do that?! 
                        You are just... Thank you! Thank 
                        you so much...

                                 BRADEN
                        Braden.

                                 ANDY
                        Right, Braden, yes. This is... I 
                        don’t know what to say. 

           Andy goes over to hug her. Thinks better of it on the way and 
           politely (though quite awkwardly) pats her on the head.

                                 ANDY
                        You belong to a gym? Let me hook 
                        you up with some guest passes. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m good.

                                 ANDY
                        Ok. Well, anything you want, it’s 
                        yours.

                                 BRADEN 
                        I want you to be my boyfriend.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        Say again?

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s the good news! We’re 
                        boyfriend/girlfriend now!
                                 ANDY
                        Uh. Are you completely insane? 

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t think so.

                                 ANDY
                        Cause, when I leave here, which is 
                        happening momentarily, you and I 
                        will never see each other again. 
                        You get that, right?

                                 BRADEN
                        Well that’s up to you. You can walk 
                        out now, take your chances... I’m 
                        sure that “Oz” show exaggerates...

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        And the other option?

                                 BRADEN
                        We go on some dates! See a movie, 
                        hit the pier... hey, you like 
                        hiking? 

                                 ANDY
                        You’ve gotta be kidding me.

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s not permanent. Just till 
                        graduation... 

                                 ANDY 
                        And when, may I ask, is that?

                                 BRADEN
                        On the 10th... Of June. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh for fuck’s sake --

                                 BRADEN 
                        Andy, you committed a crime. You  
                        don’t wanna go to jail, do you? 
                            (beat) )
                        Great. So think of it this way.  
                        Either you’re my bitch... or 
                        someone else’s.  

           Andy looks like he’s gonna throw up. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Come watch my volleyball game 
                        tomorrow.
                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        I can’t deal with this.

                                 BRADEN 
                        You’ll love it. Girls in knee high  
                        socks. Totally your thing. 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not my --

                                 BRADEN
                        3:15, St. Bonnie’s. Don’t be late. 

           Andy wants to say something to Braden but there are no words. 
           So he just turns and walks out. 

                                 ANDY
                        to himself) 
                        Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 

           We follow Andy as he walks down the stairs, passing the 
           photos on the wall he saw before. He notices now, the one of 
           Braden and her Dad where she looks like a child -- it’s 
           labeled “Christmas 2006.” Andy is freaked the fuck out!

           INT CATHOLIC SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Andy’s curse is drowned out by the bell of the fire drill. 

           We see a bevy of students in their Catholic School uniforms 
           file out of classrooms and into the hallway. We favor the 
           uber-fashionable HILLARY, LUCY, and JANE.

           SUPER: SIX DAYS EARLIER

                                 HILLARY 
                        She has to know about it by now. 

                                 LUCY 
                        What if she doesn’t? 

           Braden joins them as they walk outside.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey girls. 

           The girls stop in their tracks. No idea what to say. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        What is it? What’s wrong? 
                                 JANE
                        It’s nothing.

                                 HILLARY
                            (bad liar)
                        Nothing at all. Totally. 

           Hillary is a terrible liar. Braden doesn’t like this one bit.

           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - SAME

           The girls make their way outside. Braden notices they can 
           hardly look at her. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (to Friends)
                        You guys...  

           She also begins to notice all sorts of classmates sneaking 
           glances. Whispering. Looking away. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey!
                            (they look at her)
                        What the hell’s going on?!

           Hillary cracks first. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ask Tim. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Tim? 

           Braden’s eyes fall on handsome, chiseled, athletic, 
           homecoming King TIM COOLEY in a crowd of people. He seems to 
           be showing them something from his IPhone. A steely resolve 
           comes over Braden as she heads towards Tim to find out what’s 
           up. Tim doesn’t see her until the last second.

                                 TIM
                        Oh shit.

           Braden grabs the phone to see what everyone’s looking at. 
           It’s a video file of Tim in bed. He’s not alone. And the girl 
           he’s with -- it isn’t Braden.  

                                 TIM
                        Can I explain?

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t know, can you?

                                 TIM
                        Baby...
                                 BRADEN
                        Don’t baby me. I will punch you in 
                        the cock!

           Tim pulls Braden away from the pack. 

                                 TIM
                        It was nothing. Some little 
                        freshman --

                                 BRADEN 
                        Did you sleep with her?  

                                 TIM
                        She came on to me. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        And you filmed it? 

                                 TIM 
                        Her idea. What was I supposed to 
                        say, no? 

                                 BRADEN
                            (duh!)
                        Yes! 

           Braden’s tough facade begins to crumble as she notices 
           everyone watching them. She’s never been this embarrassed 
           before.

                                 TIM
                        Come on, it meant nothing. You’re 
                        my girl.

                                 BRADEN 
                        Three years we’ve been together, 
                        Tim. How could you do this?

                                 TIM 
                        It’s no big deal. 

                                 BRADEN
                        “No big deal!” Oh you know what...

           Braden’s had enough. She turns to leave, aware of the looks 
           she’s getting from the entire student body. Braden is 
           completely devastated.

                                 TIM
                            (calling after her)
                        So, what, that’s it? Just like 
                        that? 
                            (beat)
                        Braden! 
           Braden gives him the finger without looking back.

           INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - ANOTHER DAY

           Tim is sitting with his friends GARRETT, KEITH, DONNIE, a few 
           others, as well as the girls, Hillary, Lucy, and Jane. 

           Braden comes in, sees them, sees Tim, sits somewhere else. 
           Hillary and Jane walk over.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re still mad?

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s been a day.

                                 LUCY 
                        Look, we understand what you’re 
                        doing... 

                                 BRADEN 
                        I’m not doing anything. He slept 
                        with another girl. 

                                 HILLARY
                        But the prom’s in six weeks and 
                        everything’s set. The limo, the 
                        hotel room...

                                 LUCY 
                        You’re making this very awkward. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        I am? 

                                 JANE
                        He made a mistake. He feels 
                        terrible. 

           Braden looks over. Tim is laughing, flirting, not feeling bad 
           at all.

                                 JANE 
                        Can’t you forgive him? 

                                 BRADEN 
                        I’m sorry. No. I can’t. 

                                 HILLARY 
                        Don’t do this, Braden. Don’t make 
                        us choose.

                                 BRADEN 
                            (disbelief)
                        You’ve gotta be kidding me.  
           EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

           Braden walks home with her less fashionable friend BECCA. 
           Whereas Braden could pass for 21, Becca barely looks 17. 

                                 BECCA 
                        It’s only high school, Braden. 
                        It’ll be over soon.

                                 BRADEN
                        I loved high school.

                                 BECCA
                        That makes one of us.

                                 BRADEN 
                        I lost my boyfriend, my friends 
                        hate me, the prom is ruined, and 
                        everyone thinks I’m a joke. What am 
                        I gonna do, Bec?

           Braden falls apart in Becca’s arms. They hug.

                                 BECCA
                        You know what, fuck those whores. 
                        Fuck everybody. You’re way more 
                        sophisticated than all of them.

                                 BRADEN
                        No I’m not. 

                                 BECCA
                        Of course you are. Look at you.  
                        You’re wasting your time with these 
                        high school boys. You know what you 
                        need? You need a man.  

           They arrive at their neighboring homes.

                                 BECCA
                        Don’t worry Bray. Six months from 
                        now you’re gonna be smothered in 
                        frat boys. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (beat)
                        What do I do until then?

           INT BRADEN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Braden enters her house to find her father, HAROLD, on the 
           sofa engrossed in the “World Series of Poker.” 

                                 HAROLD
                        Hey kid, how was school?
                                 BRADEN
                        K.

           Harold senses something is wrong. Hits pause on the TIVO and 
           freezes his show. Looks at Braden and just raises his 
           eyebrows, “talk to me.” Braden loses it again.

           INT GYM CLASS - DAY

           Hillary, Jane, and Lucy are having an animated conversation 
           off to one side. Braden can sense the exclusion. 

           Braden doesn’t want them to see her getting emotional so she 
           quickly walks past and rounds the corner. In a narrow 
           hallway, she tries to keep from sobbing. 

           Biting her lip, something catches her eye. She stops. Stares. 
           It’s a picture on the wall of the school’s soccer team from 
           long ago -- 1997 Regional Champs. 

           ZOOM IN on the team captain, #9, handsomely posed in the 
           front of the row. We will recognize him as teenage Andy Mason 
           (with a pretty ridiculous haircut). The wheels spin in 
           Braden’s head.

           INT BRADEN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Harold has his bags packed by the front door. 

                                 HAROLD
                        ... emergency numbers on the 
                        fridge. I made a casserole but... 
                        there’s also money for pizza, just 
                        in case. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Thanks. You ready?

                                 HAROLD
                        Big time.

                                 BRADEN
                        Let me see your poker face.

           Harold’s face doesn’t change. (It rarely does.)

                                 BRADEN
                        Perfect.

                                 HAROLD
                            (hugs her)
                        I’ll be back on Monday. Sure you’re 
                        ok?

                                 BRADEN
                        Yup. Win us some dough. 
                                 HAROLD
                        You know it. 

           INT BRADEN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           We’ve been here before. Braden is wearing the dress from the 
           first night we saw her. She puts on her make-up. Fixes her 
           hair. And then, the coup de grace, gets out her fake ID. Like 
           Dirk Diggler, she looks in the mirror and psychs herself up 
           for what she’s about to do.

           INT VOLLEYBALL COURT - DAY 

           Present Day. Braden and Becca warm up on the sidelines.  

                                 BECCA 
                        You did WHAT?! 

                                 BRADEN 
                        Shhh.

           Braden pulls her to the side. 

                                 BECCA 
                        Braden, that’s the craziest thing 
                        I’ve ever heard in my life. 

           Braden grins, sheepishly. 

                                 BECCA 
                        You are fucking awesome!  

                                 BRADEN 
                        Shh!! 

                                 BECCA 
                        No, I’m serious. You are my hero. 
                        Is he cute?  

                                 BRADEN 
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BECCA 
                        Smart? Sophisticated? 

                                 BRADEN 
                        I think so.  

                                 BECCA 
                        Yes, I knew it! So when’s the big 
                        unveiling?  

                                 BRADEN 
                            (looks around)
                        Should be... any minute. 
           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING

           We’re looking at the front of the high school. REVERSE ANGLE 
           to reveal Andy’s car, parked conspicuously in a shadowy spot 
           across the street. 

                                 ANDY
                            (to himself)
                        Nothing to see here. I’m just a 
                        regular guy. That’s all. Just a 
                        regular guy. Hiding in his car. 
                        Watching the high school kids from 
                        across the street. Nothing weird 
                        about that.

           Eventually, students in uniform begin to file out. Andy sits 
           low in the car, trying not to be seen. He doesn’t realize 
           that this makes him look even more pervy. Andy doesn’t see 
           Braden but he does see all sorts of very young-looking kids. 
           Andy can’t handle it. He drives off. 

           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - LATER

           Andy comes in looking worse for wear. On the way to the 
           locker room, he’s stopped by a CO-WORKER (30s).

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Andy, you like kids, don’t you?

                                 ANDY
                        THAT IS A LIE! 

           Co-Worker puts away the fliers for Big Brothers/ Big Sisters.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Fine. Sorry. I’ll ask someone else.

           Over the PA, we hear:

                                 PA ANNOUNCEMENT
                        Trainers to Studio A. All trainers. 
                        Studio A.

           Andy knows this can’t be good.

           INT STUDIO - LATER

           The trainers have been called to the Boss, BILL ROBERTS’s 
           private office -- Andy, Bruce, and three or four others. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        There’s been some talk on the floor 
                        about a member of our staff.

           Bruce holds Andy’s leg to keep it from tapping. Andy is a 
           nervous, fidgety wreck.
                                 ROBERTS
                        Allegations of improper conduct. 

           Andy looks around the room, paranoid. Do they know already?

                                 ROBERTS
                        After some careful consideration, I 
                        had no choice but to let Colin go. 

                                 ALL
                        What?/ No!/ Why?

                                 ANDY
                            (psyched)
                        Fuckin’ A!

           Everyone looks at Andy.

                                 ANDY
                            (bummed)
                        Fuckin’ A.

                                 ROBERTS
                        I know some of you liked Colin, but 
                        our policy is pretty straight-
                        forward on this. We will not 
                        tolerate any salacious behavior, 
                        inside or outside this gym. Any --

           The intercom buzzes.

                        I’m sorry, Bill.

                                 ROBERTS
                        What is it?

                        She’s not here for you. She’s here 
                        for... Andy.

           All eyes on Andy who is white as a sheet.

                                 ROBERTS
                        You need to get that?

           Andy clicks off the intercom as fast as he can. Bruce is 
           intrigued.

                                 ANDY
                        Little (crazy) -- sorry, I’ll be 
                        right back.

           Andy runs out of the room and goes downstairs to reception. 
           Braden is there, still in her volleyball uniform. She’s 
           twirling her gum and acting very immature, practically 
           putting on a show.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey Sis. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (to Receptionist)
                        We’re not --

           Andy grabs and drags her into the elevator. Before the doors 
           shut, she tries to plant a big wet kiss on Andy who pushes 
           her off. The Receptionist is very confused. 

           INT ELEVATOR - SAME

           Braden busts out laughing. She’s loving this. Andy is 
           furious. 

                                 ANDY
                        What is wrong with you?!

                                 BRADEN
                        You missed my game today.

                                 ANDY
                        I have to work. What do you want 
                        from me?

                                 BRADEN
                        I want you to take me seriously.

                                 ANDY
                        Braden, this is my office. You 
                        cannot be here. You can never be 
                        here.
                                 BRADEN
                        Why not?

                                 ANDY
                        Because I like my job and I want to 
                        keep it.

                                 BRADEN 
                        This gym is publicly traded, isn’t 
                        it?

                                 ANDY 
                        Yeah. So. 

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s interesting. I imagine the 
                        last thing the shareholders of a 
                        publicly traded company would want 
                        is an employee whose name appears 
                        on the national sex offenders list. 
                        Don’t you agree?
                            (Andy is speechless)
                        So what should we do? 

                                 ANDY
                        We should take you seriously. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Good. This is your last chance. 
                        Tomorrow night. A date. 

                                 ANDY
                        Fine. Yes. Whatever you want. Just, 
                        please... 

           The elevator doors open. Braden gets off. As the doors close:

                                 BRADEN 
                        Hey Andy...

           He holds the door.

                                 BRADEN
                            (re: uniform)
                        Case you’re wondering... we won 
                        today.

           She smiles. Andy’s face is stone as the doors close.

           INT LAW FIRM - DAY

           Andy in the office of his father, MILT, 60s. 

                                 MILT

                        Aw Christ Andy. I knew this would 
                        happen. It was just a matter of 
                        time.

                                 ANDY
                        You knew this would happen?

                                 MILT
                        Not exactly this but something like 
                        it. It’s your mother’s fault. 

                                 ANDY
                        Dad!

                                 MILT
                        She coddled you. Made you lazy, 
                        irresponsible. Look how you live 
                        your life? A different girl every 
                        night. No job...

                                 ANDY
                        I have a job.

                                 MILT
                        You wear sweatpants to work. That’s 
                        not a job.

           Andy rolls his eyes. Familiar with this argument.

                                 ANDY
                        So, what, am I totally screwed?

                                 MILT
                        What’s the evidence against you?
                            (off Andy’s look)
                        Pictures? Video? A witness?

                                 ANDY
                        No! Nothing like that. Her word 
                        against mine.

                                 MILT
                        Uh-huh. Well she’s a 17 year old 
                        schoolgirl and you’re a CRAZY POON 
                        HOUND! Her word is gonna win, Andy!

                                 ANDY
                        Help me. Dad. What do I do?

                                 MILT
                        Whatever the hell she says.
           EXT. BRADEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andy pulls up in front of the house. He honks. Eventually 
           Braden comes out and gets in the car. She smiles, waits for 
           him to say something. 

           SUPER: MARCH

           Not acknowledging her, Andy drives off.

           EXT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Andy and Braden in line to buy tickets. 

                                 ANDY
                        One, please.

           Andy gets his ticket. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll go get us some seats.

           She looks at him like did he just do that? 

           INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER

           Mostly teens with nothing else to do. Andy has a large 
           popcorn and soda. He finds an empty row and sits in it. He 
           sinks in his seat, paranoid he’s being observed. 

           Braden comes in and sits next to him. Andy moves a seat over. 

                                 BRADEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANDY
                        Let’s spread out. 

                                 BRADEN
                        No! 

                                 ANDY
                        We need a buffer seat.

                                 BRADEN
                        No we don’t.

           She moves next to him again. Again he moves away. This 
           continues until Andy is up against the wall, trapped. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Braden?

           It’s Lucy and Jane, along with several other high schoolers. 
                                 BRADEN
                            (nonchalant)
                        Hey.

           Andy is doing all he can to hide in his chair. Luckily the 
           movie starts. The high schoolers are clearly intrigued as 
           they go to sit down. Braden knows it. She reaches for a 
           handful of popcorn. Andy slaps it away. 

                                 ANDY
                        Get your own.

           Braden can’t believe it.

                                 BRADEN
                        Are you retarded?

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 BRADEN
                        Haven’t you ever been on a date 
                        before?

                                 ANDY
                            (matter of fact)
                        No.

                                 BRADEN
                        What do you mean “no?”

                                 ANDY
                        I mean... I’ve never been on a date 
                        before.

           Now Braden is the one who is dumbfounded.

                                 ANDY
                        What? I meet a girl. We hit it off. 
                        I leave in the morning. There’s no 
                        date.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s how you treat women?

                                 ANDY
                        Sure.

                                 BRADEN
                        But... why? Why would you do that?

                                 ANDY
                            (shrugs)
                        Because I can. 

           Braden is shocked.
                                 ANDY
                            (popcorn in his mouth)
                        What?

           EXT BRADEN’S HOME - LATER

           Andy pulls up in front of the house.

                                 BRADEN
                        I need you to pick me up from 
                        school tomorrow.

                                 ANDY
                        Why am I picking you up all the 
                        time?

                                 BRADEN
                        I like when you do it.
                            (beat)
                        And, cause... I don’t have my 
                        license.

                                 ANDY
                        How old are you?

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m old enough. I just didn’t pass.
                            (beat)
                        The first three times.

           Andy rubs his temples. Braden moves to kiss him goodnight.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, whoa...

                                 BRADEN
                        Why not? 

                                 ANDY
                        Gross.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ve been kissing boys since grade 
                        school.

                                 ANDY
                        What was that, last year?

           Braden pushes her hair behind her ears. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m not a little girl, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        You most certainly are.
           Braden slowly hikes up her skirt. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Look at my legs. 

                                 ANDY
                        No!

                                 BRADEN
                        Are these the legs of a little 
                        girl? 

                                 ANDY
                        Put those away.

           Braden grabs Andy’s hand and puts it on her knee.

                                 BRADEN
                        How does this feel --

                                 ANDY
                            (snatching it back)
                        Ok stop. Halt. We are not doing 
                        this. Uh-uh. There’ll be no 
                        kissing, no touching, and don’t 
                        even think we’re having sex again.

                                 BRADEN
                        Ok.

                                 ANDY
                        Not tonight. Not ever. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Works for me.

                                 ANDY
                        Good. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Fine.

           Silence for a beat.

                                 BRADEN
                        Can you go five months without sex?

                                 ANDY
                        Can I... How do you mean?

                                 BRADEN
                        Well you can’t cheat on me. 

           Slowly it dawns on Andy what she means.
                                 ANDY
                        Oh come on!

                                 BRADEN
                        Fuck that. We’re in a relationship 
                        now. I’ll call the police in a 
                        second if you cheat on me! And 
                        while we’re at it, there’s a couple 
                        more rules...

                                 ANDY
                        How can there possibly be more --?

                                 BRADEN
                        You need to call me. A lot. Maybe 
                        every day. And not just texts.

           Andy wants to die.

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh and I noticed you don’t have a 
                        Facebook page. It’s 2009. I think 
                        you should make one.

                                 ANDY
                        That’s necessary why?

                                 BRADEN
                        Dude it’s so fun. We can write on 
                        each other’s walls, send pokes...

           She pecks him on the cheek before he can push her away. Once 
           out of the car:

                                 BRADEN
                        Bring flowers next time. Girls love 
                        flowers.

           And with that she’s off.

           INT. TOTAL BODY FITNESS - DAY

           And now Andy is at the reception desk computer. We see him 
           building his Facebook page. He looks around to make sure no 
           one is watching. He wants to kill himself.

           INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Braden walking down the hall alone. The girls come up to her.

                                 HILLARY
                        So who’s the guy?

                                 BRADEN
                        What guy?
                                 JANE
                        You know what guy.

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s... no one.

                                 LUCY
                        Didn’t look like no one to me. 

                                 JANE
                        He doesn’t go here does he.
                            (Braden is silent)
                        Does he go to Winchester?

                                 LUCY
                        I told you he was in college!

           Braden just shrugs. Whatever. Walks into the classroom. Class 
           begins. Conversation over.

           INT ANOTHER HALLWAY - LATER

           Braden walks towards the gym on her way to practice.

                                 TIM
                        Hey.

           Tim stands in her way. Tries to get past him.

                                 TIM
                        What’s with these rumors bout you 
                        and some college kid?

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s not in college.

                                 TIM
                        Who is he?

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s none of your business. 

                                 TIM
                        You may as well just tell me. I’ll 
                        find out soon enough.

           Meanwhile, Braden and Tim are framing Andy’s 1997 Soccer 
           Picture while having this conversation. Braden knows it too. 
           She taps him on the arm, smiles, and says:

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m counting on it.
           EXT SCHOOL - LATER 

           Braden walks home with Becca who is complaining about bad 
           grades on her homework. 

                                 BECCA 
                            (re: exam)
                        What are they even talking about 
                        here?  

                                 BRADEN 
                        A to B of F of X. With respect to 
                        X. But that only works if the 
                        function is linear.  

                                 BECCA 
                        I have no idea what you just said. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ll come by in the morning and 
                        show you.

                                 BECCA
                        What are you doing tonight?

                                 BRADEN
                        I might... go over to Andy’s.

                                 BECCA 
                        Really? 
                            (beat)
                        Why? No one can see you there. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        I know. 

                                 BECCA 
                        But... I thought that was the 
                        point.

                                 BRADEN
                            (shrugs)
                        I’d kinda like to see where he 
                        lives. Never been to a guy’s place 
                        before.

                                 BECCA 
                            (beat)
                        I’m so excited for you.

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Andy is playing Halo on the couch by himself. His beagle, 
           Thurston, watches. The phone rings.
                                 ANDY
                        Hello?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Is it true?

                                 ANDY
                        Is what true?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Don’t play dumb with me.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not --

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        You make me sick! Talking to you, 
                        right now, makes me sick. Knowing 
                        you, makes me sick. 

                                 ANDY
                        Mom!

                                 MOM’S VOICE
                        You’re father agrees with me, don’t 
                        you?

                                 MILT’S VOICE
                        We’re on three way...

           Andy rolls his eyes at being bombarded.

                                 ANDY 
                        Attorney client privilege!  

                                 MILT’S VOICE 
                        She’s your mother. 

                                 MOM’S VOICE 
                        How could you be such an idiot!? 

                                 ANDY 
                        Mom, you think I want this? The 
                        girl’s crazy. She’s forcing me --  

                                 MOM’S VOICE 
                        You just can’t keep it in your 
                        pants. 

                                 ANDY
                        No, Mom. It is in my pants. It’s 
                        not even physical. 

                                 MOM’S VOICE 
                        Oh please.  
                                 MILT’S VOICE 
                        Don’t lie to your mother. 

           Andy’s doorbell rings.  

                                 ANDY
                        I have to call you back. Someone’s 
                        at the door.

                                 MOM’S VOICE
                        Is it the cops? Oh god.

                                 MILT
                        You call me right away if it’s the 
                        cops!

           Andy open the door to find Braden. 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not the cops.

           On that note, Braden, still in her school uniform, smiles and 
           kisses Andy on the cheek. She walks right past him, carrying 
           pizza boxes and a grocery bag.

           Andy hangs up the phone. Looks at Braden.

                                 ANDY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BRADEN
                        I brought food!

           Braden plops the bags on the kitchen counter and makes 
           herself at home.

                                 ANDY 
                        That was my mom, by the way. Called 
                        to say I’m a pervert so, uh, you 
                        know, thank you for that.

                                 BRADEN 
                        I’m sorry. I got pizza. Sausage and 
                        mushrooms. And french fries if you 
                        want ‘em. Ooh and for dessert... 
                        Haagen Dazs.

                                 ANDY
                        You can’t stay. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Who’s the coolest girlfriend ever?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m tired. Work in the morning. 
                        Tired. You need to leave.
           She doesn’t move.

                                 ANDY
                        What flavor is that?

                                 BRADEN
                        Coffee. 

           Andy’s weakness. Fuck.

           LATER. Andy is in a chair, eating ice cream and playing XBOX. 
           Braden walks around the place, looking for signs of 
           sophistication. They are few and far between. 

                                 BRADEN 
                        You live here?

           Braden is surprised. The place is messy as hell and there’s 
           more video game systems than furniture. She touches a lava 
           lamp. She examines the wall hangings (Belushi with the 
           “College” sweatshirt, a Reservoir Dogs poster). 

           At his DVD rack:

                                 BRADEN
                        Not a lot of French New Wave.

           Andy just shrugs, busted. Braden picks up a guitar for 
           ROCKBAND.

                                 BRADEN
                        Aren’t you a little old to play 
                        video games?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m a little old for a lot of 
                        things right now.

                                 BRADEN
                        Let’s play something.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m in the middle of this.

                                 BRADEN
                        Would you rather watch “The Hills?”

           LATER. Andy has the guitar. He’s a pro. Braden is on the 
           drums. Trying to get the hang of it. Andy has to “save” her 
           once or twice. Finally they’re “booed” off the stage.

                                 ANDY 
                        I think it’s past your bedtime.  

                                 BRADEN
                        One more and I’ll go.  
           Andy has no choice. Starts the song up again. We see Braden 
           get real into it. Andy watches her. Trying to figure out how 
           he got himself into this mess.  

           INT SCHOOL LUNCHROOM - LATER

           Hillary, Jane, and Lucy are at a table eating lunch. Braden 
           sits with Becca, a few tables away. They can hear the 
           conversation. 

                                 LUCY
                        Cancelled?!

                                 JANE
                        Now Garrett’s parents are staying 
                        home this weekend.

                                 LUCY
                        So no party?

                                 HILLARY
                        Not unless we find somewhere else.

                                 LUCY
                        That sucks!

                                 JANE
                        Sucks hard.

                                 LUCY
                        What are we gonna do?

           Braden has been listening to this with interest. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey, you guys...

           The girls turn to her.

                                 BRADEN 
                        I got an idea.

           EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - NIGHT

           Andy pulls up to Braden’s house, dressed in all black like a 
           ninja. He parks a few houses down and gets out of the car. 
           Andy tiptoes to the door, rings the doorbell...

           and runs. 

           Andy hides behind the bushes, waiting for Braden to come out. 
           Finally she does...

                                 ANDY
                        Psst. Over here.
                                 BRADEN
                            (rolls her eyes)
                        What are you doing?

           Andy whips out flowers from inside his coat.

                                 ANDY
                        Here.
                            (making sure coast is 
                             clear)
                        I’ll go first. 

           Braden can’t help but just shake her head and laugh.

           INT ANDY’S CAR - LATER

           Andy drives in silence, listening to “Cut Your Hair” by 
           Pavement. Braden goes through Andy’s Ipod.

                                 BRADEN
                        What is this crap?

                                 ANDY
                        Pavement. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Classic rock? Ugh. What else you 
                        got?

                                 ANDY
                        Classic rock? This came out in 94!

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah, I was 3.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        That is disgusting.

           The car pulls into a gas station. Andy gets out to pump the 
           gas. Braden continues to fiddle with the Ipod. 

           Meanwhile, a car pulls in at the next pump. The WOMAN driving 
           is late 20s, dark hair, hot. She gets out to pump gas. Andy 
           and this girl have a little staring thing going on. 

           Finally Braden notices.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hey! Get back in the car. 

           Andy rolls his eyes. Obliges. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (to Woman, from window)
                        He’s with me. 
           The Woman looks at the young girl in the car. Then at Andy. 
           She’s grossed out. 

                                 ANDY 
                        It’s not what it looks like! 

                                 BRADEN
                        Yes it is!

           INT PIZZA JOINT  - NIGHT

           Andy and Braden eat pizza at a popular teen hangout. Andy 
           seems very out of place.

                                 ANDY
                        What about your parents? They don’t 
                        they have a problem with this?

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s just my Dad. And I haven’t 
                        told him.

                                 ANDY
                        Where’s your mom?

                                 BRADEN
                        Gone.

           No more is being said on this subject.

                                 BRADEN
                        You want the last slice?

                                 ANDY
                        Hell yeah.

           Andy realizes from Braden’s expression that eating the last 
           slice is probably not chivalrous. He rolls his eyes.

                                 ANDY 
                        We’ll split it. 

           INT ANDY’S CAR - LATER

                                 BRADEN
                        Left up here.

                                 ANDY
                        Where are we going, anyway?

           Braden says nothing. She doesn’t need to. Andy sees kids 
           standing against cars smoking cigarettes. He sees more kids 
           walking down the street in packs, carrying concealed alcohol 
           under their coats. It quickly becomes clear where they’re 
           going.
                                 ANDY
                        Whoa. Hold on. Braden. No way. I am 
                        not going to a high school party.

                                 BRADEN
                        Make the next left.

                                 ANDY
                        Uh-uh. Veto! You can’t -- I’m 
                        putting my foot down. Seriously. My 
                        foot is down. 
                            (beat)
                        Wait. That’s my street.

           They round the corner. More kids are heading in the same 
           direction. The truth hits Andy and he jumps out of the car. 
           He’s instantly gone from resisting the party to running into 
           it.

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           Andy bursts in. His apartment is crammed with very real 16 
           and 17 year olds. Drinking. Hooking up. Partying.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh no no no. This is not 
                        acceptable.

           Braden enters behind Andy. Takes it all in.

                                 BRADEN
                        It’ll be fine, don’t worry.

           A pair of DRUNK KIDS “joust” by them, 300-style, using Andy’s 
           plates as shields and his lamps as swords.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m calling the cops.

                                 BRADEN
                        Really?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes.

           Braden hands Andy her phone. Which makes him realize 
           something -- he can’t call the cops. He’s totally screwed.

                                 ANDY
                            (defeated)
                        Why are you doing this to me?

                                 BRADEN
                            (beat; smiles)
                        Because I can.
           And with that she throws off her coat and joins the party. 
           Someone hands her a beer. Andy just stands in the doorway.

                                 ANDY
                            (yelling after her)
                        You’re too young to drink!
                            (and the other guy)
                        Dude so are you!

           A PARTYGOER passes by.

                                 PARTYGOER #1
                        Well done Braden. This place is bad-
                        ass.

           He takes a picture of Braden and Andy on their phone. 

                                 ANDY
                            (serious)
                        Kid, I’m gonna need that. 
                        Seriously. Give me the camera. Hey!

           Andy chases after the kid. We follow Braden into the crowd. 
           She walks over to Becca. They clink their cans of shitty 
           beer.

           Meanwhile Andy finds his dog sitting happily on his sofa, 
           looking out the window.

                                 ANDY
                        Good job, Thurston. Way to be on 
                        guard.

           Andy takes the dog to his bedroom. He opens the door to find 
           TWO KIDS HARD-CORE MAKING OUT on his bed. He is nauseated.

                                 ANDY
                        Aw, Jesus. Get out of here!

           They ignore Andy and start peeling off each others clothes. 
           Andy counters this by pulling their clothes back on them, 
           trying to touch them as little as possible. 

                                 ANDY
                            (re: sheets)
                        Come on man, I just washed these. 
                            (beat)
                        No! Bra stays on!

           The girl starts touching Andy and he slaps her hand away.

           - LATER. Braden and Becca on the back patio. Hillary, Jane, 
           and Lucy come over.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who lives here anyway?
                                 BRADEN
                        My boyfriend.

                                 LUCY
                        Wait, he has his own place?

                                 BRADEN
                        Yup. He’s... older.

           ANGLE ON Andy making his way into the kitchen where a group 
           of GUYS are pounding on the icebox. It takes a second for 
           Andy to realize there’s someone inside, screaming to get out. 
           It’s some kind of hazing ritual. Andy covers his eyes and 
           hurries out of the room.

                                 ANDY
                        If I can’t see it it’s not 
                        happening!

           He enters the living room where he finds Garrett smoking a 
           cigarette.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey dude, you mind not smoking 
                        inside?

                                 GARRETT
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 ANDY
                        Who the --? I’m the guy that lives 
                        here. And I don’t appreciate your 
                        tone, buddy. 

           Garrett walks right up to Andy and gets in his face.

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                        Dude!

           Andy turns to see Tim, with Donnie and some other kids. 

                                 TIM
                        That’s my cousin. Back the fuck up.

           Garrett backs the fuck up. And yes, Tim means Andy when he 
           says “cousin.”

                                 ANDY
                        Timmy?

                                 TIM
                        What’s up playa!? 

           Andy is happy to see Tim but also slightly embarrassed at 
           being seen in this context. They hug. 
           It should be said: Tim towers over Andy. He’s got six inches 
           and at least 85 pounds on him. 

                                 TIM
                        I haven’t seen you in ages, man, 
                        what have you been up to?

                                 ANDY
                        Oh... this and that --

                                 TIM
                            (to Friends)
                        This guy is such a pimp! You know 
                        you’re like my hero, right?

                                 ANDY
                        What do you mean? I thought you had 
                        that girlfriend. The little pixie 
                        chick I saw at your Confirmation.

                                 TIM
                        Nah dude. Ancient history. Now I’m 
                        playing the field. Andy-style. Know 
                        what I mean?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, sure. Andy-style.  

                                 TIM
                        So what are you doing here?

                                 ANDY
                        I live here.

                                 TIM
                        You live here? Then... what are we 
                        doing here?

           At which point Braden enters the room with Becca. The rest of 
           the girls are close behind.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hi guys.

           She walks right up to Andy and grabs his hand. Andy 
           instinctively tries to pull away but she holds it tight.

                                 BRADEN
                            (to Tim)
                        I hope this isn’t awkward.

           Andy doesn’t know what she means. Tim doesn’t either. He sees 
           the hand-holding and is bewildered.

                                 TIM
                        You guys know each other?
                                 JANE
                        That’s Braden’s boyfriend.

                                 TIM
                        That’s not her boyfriend. That’s my 
                        cousin.

                                 HILLARY
                        I think it’s both actually.

                                 BECCA 
                            (almost to herself)
                        It’s on now. 

           Tim looks at Braden. Looks at Andy.

                                 TIM
                            (beat)
                        Get the fuck out of here.

                                 BRADEN
                        Nope. We’re a couple now. Aren’t 
                        we... handsome? 

                                 ANDY
                            (swallows)
                        We sure are... sweet...cakes. 

                                 TIM
                        Dude. You know who that is, right?
                        That’s the pixie chick.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        What?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. That’s my girl.

                                 ANDY
                        That can’t be. She was... you 
                        were... 

           He means young, basically. Real young. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh Jesus Christ. Excuse us. 

           Andy grabs Braden and pulls her away. Tim watches them 
           angrily. On the outside patio:

                                 ANDY
                        You planned this?
                            (off her shrug)
                        Oh my god, you’re insane!
                                 BRADEN
                        Of course I am. I’m a teenager.

                                 ANDY
                        This is so unfair.

                                 BRADEN
                        Don’t get all high and mighty with 
                        me, you rapist.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not a rape --! You hit on me 
                        that night.

                                 BRADEN
                        And you loved every minute.

           She holds out her hand for him to grab. He reluctantly does. 

                                 ANDY 
                        This ends... 

                                 BRADEN 
                        Graduation. I got it.  

           They walk back inside.

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - SAME

           Braden’s friends have surrounded Andy. Andy looks for Tim but 
           he’s nowhere to be found.

                                 HILLARY
                        What was it like... writing letters 
                        and stuff?

                                 ANDY
                        Um... sorta like email. Just took 
                        longer.

                                 JANE
                        That must have sucked.

           Andy doesn’t know what else to say.

                                 HILLARY
                        So, like, where were you when 
                        Kennedy was shot?

           Andy shoots the girl a look. Shakes his head. It’s at this 
           moment that someone comes in and says:

                                 PARTYGOER #1
                        Keg’s tapped.

           On a dime, pretty much everybody takes off. Andy is relieved.
           - LATER. We see Andy carrying one of the passed out kids to 
           the backyard. He looks both ways to make sure the coast is 
           clear and then dumps the kid over his fence into the 
           neighbor’s bushes.

           Andy returns a moment later and drops a bottled water next to 
           him. 

           He then walks back into the house. He enters his bedroom, 
           ready for sleep. Braden is sitting up on the bed.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes?

                                 BRADEN
                        Just want to say good night.

           Andy rolls his eyes. 

                                 BRADEN
                        So I’ll see you tomorrow then?

                                 ANDY
                        I have a choice?

                                 BRADEN
                        Not one bit.

           Andy collapses on the bed, exhausted.

           INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           Braden eats with Becca. Tim is with his friends, giving her a 
           dirty look. The girls come in, see Tim, see Braden, and 
           decide to sit with Braden.

                                 LUCY
                        That was so fun on Friday!

                                 HILLARY
                        Your boyfriend’s really cute.

           Braden chews her food, unimpressed. The girls look at one 
           another and urge Hillary to speak.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bray, we just wanted to... we’re 
                        sorry, about before, the Tim stuff. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Ok.

                                 JANE
                        And if you --
                                 LUCY
                        And Andy.

                                 JANE
                        You and Andy wanna still ride with 
                        us to the prom, that would be 
                        awesome.

                                 HILLARY
                        Totally.

                                 BRADEN
                        I, uh, I’ll let you know. I might 
                        have made other plans.

           The girls are disappointed. Braden and Becca share a look. 
           Her plan is totally working.

           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - DAY

           Andy is having lunch in the relaxation area when Bruce 
           enters, excited.

                                 BRUCE
                        So our suite’s confirmed. We’ve got 
                        club reservations. A cabana for 
                        Saturday...

                                 ANDY
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 BRUCE
                        Vegas! This weekend!
                            (Andy doesn’t remember)
                        Our annual trip. 

           Andy realizes two things. That the annual trip is coming up. 
           And that there’s no way in hell he can go. Shit.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell me you forgot.

                                 ANDY
                        No, of course not. It’s just... 
                        well, it’s Thurston. He’s... having 
                        an operation.

                                 BRUCE
                        Oh no.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. No, I mean, he’ll be alright. 
                        But I should be there for the 
                        little guy. 
                                 BRUCE
                        I understand. What kind of 
                        operation?

                                 ANDY
                            (grasping)
                        Wisdom teeth?

           Before Andy has to dig himself deeper his cell phone rings. 
           The ringtone is “I’m not that innocent.” 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re phone’s ringing.

                                 BRUCE
                        Not mine.

           It isn’t. It’s Andy’s. Andy picks up like it’s covered in 
           shit.

                                 ANDY 
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT w/ Braden in the school hallway.

                                 BRADEN
                        Like my ringtone?

                                 ANDY
                        Hilarious. What can I do for you?

                                 BRADEN
                        Nothing. What’s up?

                                 ANDY
                        Nothing. What’s up with you?

                                 BRADEN
                        Not much. What’s up with you?!

           Bruce can hear a bit of this conversation and finds it rather 
           odd for Andy.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        Is there a point to this call?

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m bored.

                                 ANDY
                        Can I call you back? I’m sorta in 
                        the middle of something.
                                 BRADEN
                        Ok, but don’t forget you’re picking 
                        me up --

           Andy quickly hangs up. Bruce looks at him for an explanation. 

                                 ANDY
                        Wrong number.

           EXT SCHOOL - DAY

           Andy sits real low in his car, waiting for the kids to come 
           out. He’s startled by a knock on the window. It’s Tim.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey cuz.

                                 TIM
                        The fuck’s going on, Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not what you think, alright. 
                        It’s... complicated.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t give a shit what it is. 
                        Just stay away from her.

           The bell is heard in the distance. Students start filing out.

                                 ANDY
                        You don’t understand, ok. I can’t.   

                                 TIM
                        Dude, you gotta. This is my scene. 
                        How’s it make me look, you swooping 
                        in here all older and shit?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s the last thing I wanna do, 
                        believe me.

                                 TIM
                        Good. Then we won’t have a problem.

           Now Tim is threatening Andy. Braden emerges from the school. 
           Tim sees her, taps on the car, heads off.

                                 TIM
                        Say hi to Aunt Ro for me.

           Andy has all of this weighing on him as Braden jumps in the 
           car, excited.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hi handsome!
           EXT BOARDWALK - MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Andy and Braden playing mini-golf.

           SUPER: APRIL

                                 BRADEN
                        So I’m confident I’ll get off the 
                        wait list but you never know.

                                 ANDY
                        Stanford?! Don’t you need like 1500 
                        SATs to get into Stanford?

                                 BRADEN 
                        I got a 2310. 

           Braden hits a long putt. Lands about 8 feet from the hole.

                                 ANDY
                        Wait a minute. I thought 1600’s the 
                        highest?

                                 BRADEN
                        They changed that like a million 
                        years ago. It’s 2400 now.

                                 ANDY
                        And you got 23... wow. Yet somehow 
                        you can’t pass your driver’s 
                        test...

                                 BRADEN
                        I aced the written. I just get 
                        nervous behind the wheel. Shut up. 
                        Anyway... what about you. Where’d 
                        you go to school?

           Andy lines up his putt. Hits it about 5 feet from the hole.

                                 ANDY
                        I didn’t.

                                 BRADEN
                        No college? Nothing?
                            (off his shrug)
                        How’d you get your job?

                                 ANDY
                        I work at a gym. They asked me to 
                        count to 12 and I nailed it.

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh.
                                 ANDY
                        And I promised to bring in ten new 
                        clients my first week on the job.

                                 BRADEN
                        Which you did.

                                 ANDY
                        Of course I did.

                                 BRADEN
                        Were any of them... male clients?

           Andy’s look at Braden says “don’t be ridiculous.” She lines 
           up to putt.

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know about that line.

                                 BRADEN
                        Silence.

                                 ANDY
                        This is for all the marbles, 
                        Braden. Will you crack under 
                        pressure?

                                 BRADEN
                        I can handle it.

           And with that she lines up, takes the putter back gently, and 
           hits it -- dead center in the hole. 

                                 ANDY
                        Damn.

                                 BRADEN
                        Woo hoo! In your face loverboy. In 
                        your face!

           Braden does a big celebratory dance. She grabs Andy’s hat and 
           musses his hair. She plays keep away with him and he tries to 
           get it back from her. To everyone watching, this looks very 
           much like a couple on a date. 

                                 ANDY
                        Shhh!

           Andy tries to subdue her but it’s tough. We notice Tim’s 
           friends, Garrett and Donnie, off to the side, watching. 
           Ominous. 
           INT ICE CREAM PARLOR - LATER

           Andy and Braden at another popular teen hangout. At the back 
           of the place we recognize waitresses Lucy and Jane, watching 
           Braden and Andy with interest. Braden knows it too. 

           She goes to take Andy’s hand. Andy pulls away quickly. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (quietly)
                        Hold my hand.

                                 ANDY
                        No.

                                 BRADEN
                        Do it.

                                 ANDY
                        Stop it.

                                 BRADEN
                        Take it.

                                 ANDY
                        No.

                                 BRADEN
                            (takes out her cell phone)
                        You have 3 seconds to hold my hand. 

                                 ANDY
                        Who are you calling? 

                                 BRADEN

           Andy grabs her hand with the phone in it. Holds it as limply 
           as he can. Jane comes over with sundaes.

                                 JANE
                        Here you go.

                                 BRADEN
                        Thanks.

           Jane walks away, oggling Andy the whole time. Braden dives 
           into the sundae like an excited teenager. 

                                 ANDY
                        Good?

                                 BRADEN
                        Mmm. Tastes like... victory.
           EXT ICE CREAM PARLOR - PROMENADE - LATER

           On the way out...

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m gonna run to the ladies. 

           Andy hangs outside by himself. He leans on a railing, looking 
           out at the sea. It’s kinda nice. Peacful. And then:

                                 GARRETT (O.S.)
                        Hey Grandpa.

           It’s Garrett, Keith, Donnie and some other super intimidating 
           jocks from the school.

                                 ANDY
                        You talking to me?

                                 GARRETT
                        Yeah you. The old guy likes to hit 
                        on high school girls.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, no, I’m not... 

                                 KEITH
                        What, old? Yeah you are.

                                 DONNIE
                        This aint “Coccoon,” motherfucker. 

                                 GARRETT
                        First you take Tim’s girl. Who’s 
                        next? You gonna take my girl? His?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t want anyone’s --. Guys, 
                        you’ve got the wrong idea.

                                 GARRETT
                        You wanna die, bitch?

                                 ANDY
                        What? No. Why would I wanna die?

           The guys are all up in Andy’s face now. 

                                 BRADEN (O.S.)
                        Andy?

           The jocks see her, back off. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Everything alright?
                                 ANDY
                        Everything’s fantastic!

           The guys walk off, leaving Andy and Braden alone. Andy gets 
           in the car, pissed.

                                 BRADEN
                        What? 
                            (beat)
                        Those guys are harmless.

           Braden gets in after Andy, surprised he’s unhappy.

                                 BRADEN
                        That was fun, wasn’t it?

                                 ANDY
                        Fun? Hmm let’s see...
                            (beat)
                        No. I wouldn’t say fun. Scary, 
                        check. Exhausting, check. Wrong in 
                        so many ways, check. You wanna know 
                        what’s fun? Not committing a crime. 
                        That’s fun. Not being called 
                        “pervert” by my mother is fun. Not 
                        getting my ass kicked is fun. Not 
                        hosting high school parties. Not 
                        not having sex --

                                 BRADEN
                            (realization)
                        You’re right.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        I am?

                                 BRADEN
                        We shouldn’t be doing this. I 
                        should respect your feelings. 

                                 ANDY
                        Um... exactly.

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s gotta be so uncomfortable for 
                        you... at school, at parties, being 
                        seen with a bunch of high school 
                        kids. That can’t be good right?

                                 ANDY
                        Right..
                                 BRADEN
                        So forget high school. From now on, 
                        we’ll just do adult-type dates. No 
                        one would bat an eye at us then.

                                 ANDY
                        But... you’re not an adult.

                                 BRADEN
                        I can look like one. 
                            (beat)
                        Remember?

           Andy is exasperated. He bangs his head repeatedly on the 
           steering wheel. 

           EXT. BRADEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andy pulls up in front of the house, honks. Braden comes out. 

           And she looks HOT!

           Andy watches her get in the car and can only shake his head.

                                 ANDY
                        That should be illegal.

                                 BRADEN
                        It is.

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Braden is seated across from Andy in a restaurant.

                                 WAITER
                        Anything to drink?

                                 BRADEN
                        Vodka soda on the rocks.

                                 WAITER
                        Ok. And how bout for you?

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll have a Coke. We both will.

           Braden makes a face at Andy like “come on!” Waiter leaves. 
           Braden seems to be waiting for something.

                                 ANDY
                        How great is this menu? It’s 
                        enormous.

                                 BRADEN
                        This is your idea of an adult date?
           PULL BACK to reveal they’re at TGIFriday’s.

                                 ANDY
                        This is some gourmet shit. You’ve 
                        tried the potato skins?

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re unbelievable.

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 BRADEN
                        Guess how many mistakes you’ve made 
                        so far?
                            (no idea)
                        You’ve done twelve things wrong in 
                        the last 20 minutes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - QUICK SHOT OF Andy parked in front of Braden’s house, 
           honking the horn.

                                 BRADEN (V.O.)
                        Number one, you don’t honk the horn 
                        on a date.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - QUICK SHOT OF Braden walking to the car.

                                 BRADEN (V.O.)
                        Number two, open the door for me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - QUICK SHOT OF them in the car. Andy’s eyes on the road.

                                 BRADEN (V.O.)
                        A compliment would have been nice.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - QUICK SHOT OF the valet. Braden waits for Andy to help her 
           out of the car. He walks right past her and into the 
           restaurant.

                                 BRADEN (V.O.)
                        Again with the door.

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT RESTAURANT 

                                 BRADEN
                        Should I keep going?

                                 ANDY
                        Where do you get this crap?

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s not crap. It’s dating. It’s 
                        romance.

                                 ANDY
                        No one does that stuff.

                                 BRADEN
                        They do in the movies.

                                 ANDY
                        Remind me the scene in “Die Hard” 
                        where he opens the door for 
                        someone?

                                 BRADEN
                        Romance. :“Pretty in Pink?” “Roman 
                        Holiday?” That’s how you behave. 

                                 ANDY
                        Those are movies?

                                 BRADEN
                        They’re classics!

                                 ANDY
                        Chick flicks, right? I don’t watch 
                        chick flicks.

                                 BRADEN
                        Never? Some of them are amazing. 
                        “Pretty Woman?” “Sixteen Candles?” 
                            (he hasn’t seen any)
                        You’ve never seen “Sixteen 
                        Candles?” Get out of here! 

                                 ANDY
                        You get out of here!

                                 BRADEN
                        “My Best Friend’s Wedding?”
                            (nothing)
                        “Notting Hill?” “Grease?” Oh my 
                        God. No wonder you’re clueless. 
                            (beat)
                        Tell me you’ve seen “Clueless?”
           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - DAY

           Andy is in the reception area with Bruce. A MALE CLIENT (50s) 
           enters.

                                 ANDY
                        My man Geoff, ready for your 
                        workout?

                                 MALE CLIENT
                        You know it.
                            (beat)
                        Hey, was that you I saw at Friday’s 
                        last night? 

           Oh shit. Bruce perks up at this.

                                 ANDY
                        Um... last night?

                                 MALE CLIENT
                        I’m sure it was you. You were with 
                        some girl. A real looker.

                                 ANDY
                        Girl? Hmm. I don’t think so. 

                                 MALE CLIENT
                        Huh. Coulda sworn. Oh well. 
                            (beat)
                        Be out in a sec.

           He enters the locker room. Andy thinks he’s dodged a bullet. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Weren’t you doing laundry last 
                        night?

                                 ANDY
                        Hmm?

                                 BRUCE
                        That’s what you told me.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh. Uh...

                                 BRUCE
                        You were with someone, weren’t you?

                                 ANDY
                        No.

           Andy is a terrible liar. Bruce is disappointed. 
                                 ANDY
                        It’s not what you think.

                                 BRUCE
                        Least you could do is be honest 
                        with me.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s a long story.

           Bruce waits.

                                 ANDY
                            (sighs)
                        I’ve been... seeing someone. 

                                 BRUCE
                        A shrink?

                                 ANDY
                        No. A woman.

                                 BRUCE
                        How do you mean?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m in a relationship.

                                 BRUCE
                        What?!

                                 ANDY
                        Shh. Let’s keep it quiet.

                                 BRUCE
                        The girl from the bar?
                            (off Andy’s nod)
                        Wow I’m speechless. I knew 
                        something was wrong but this is 
                        just... this is great, Andy. This 
                        is just great. 
                            (beat)
                        Now I’ll never get laid again. 

                                 ANDY
                            (sincere)
                        I know, Bruce. I’m sorry.

           INT ANDY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The blinds are drawn. The room is dark. We see two 
           silhouettes on the couch. We hear:

                                 ANDY
                        Such a bad idea. 
                                 BRADEN
                        I promise. You’ll love it.

           What are they doing? Are they about to have sex? 

           No. REVEAL a stack of romantic comedy DVDs on the table.

                                 BRADEN
                        Your choice. “The Wedding Date.” Or 
                        “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days?”

                                 ANDY
                        This is so dumb!

                                 BRADEN
                        And just for that... we’re watching 
                        both. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m missing the playoffs, Braden. I 
                        promised Bruce we’d meet at 
                        McSorley’s and --

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy... 

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 BRADEN
                        Which one are we watching first?

           SERIES OF SHOTS: ANDY WATCHING CHICK FLICKS

           JUMPCUTS of Andy and Braden watching TV in various positions. 
           Braden always seems delighted. Sometimes she wipes tears. 
           Andy, on the other hand, is less enthralled. 

           In the first few cuts, Andy just looks bored. He’s falling 
           asleep. Braden nudges him to pay attention. In others, he 
           literally watches with the XBOX controller in hand, pressing 
           buttons like he’s playing a game, just to make himself feel 
           better.

                                 ANDY
                        So painful.

                                 BRADEN
                        Shhh.

           As it goes along, Andy watches the movies and just gets more 
           aggravated by what he sees. For example:

                                 ANDY
                        Are you kidding me?! 
           And...

                                 ANDY
                        Oh right. Like he’s really gonna go 
                        for the ugly girl now.

           And...

                                 ANDY
                        What, he’s not gonna want his car 
                        tomorrow? People don’t just leave 
                        their cars in the middle of the 
                        street!

           And...

                                 ANDY
                        She’s a prostitute! Hello! 

           And finally...

                                 ANDY
                        Ok stop. Please. I can’t take any 
                        more. 

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s bullshit! 

                                 BRADEN
                        It is not!

                                 ANDY
                        It’s nuts! Look at this guy 
                        running. Tell me... what is his 
                        rush? Whatever he has to say, can’t 
                        he say it tomorrow? Why is he 
                        running?! 

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t know.

                                 ANDY
                        And where did that rain come from? 
                        It doesn’t just start raining like 
                        that out of nowhere. You need 
                        clouds! At least.

                                 BRADEN 
                        Well... it...

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll tell you something else too. 
                        I’ve been in a lot of airports. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (cont'd)
                        And never, not once, have I seen 
                        some guy sprint to the gate to stop 
                        some chick from getting on a plane. 
                        You know why they don’t do that, 
                        Braden? Cause they’ll get tasered. 
                        Cause homeland Security doesn’t 
                        fuck around! You can’t run in 
                        airports. You can’t even jog. It 
                        doesn’t happen. None of this does. 
                        It’s all just phony, cliched fairy 
                        tale nonsense that makes girls like 
                        you think guys like me are 
                        unromantic. When really we’re just 
                        honest, practical, down-to-earth 
                        realists. I know you’re just a kid 
                        and I’m sorry to burst your bubble 
                        but if this is the kinda thing 
                        you’re looking for, sweetheart... 
                        your whole life is going to be 
                        one... big... disappointment. 

           Silence.

                                 BRADEN
                        You finished?

           Andy thinks maybe he’s gone too far.

                                 ANDY
                        Sure.

                                 BRADEN
                            (holds up DVD)
                        Cause we are so “Dirty Dancing” 
                        right now!

           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           It’s gym class and Tim is outside running the track with his 
           boys.

                                 GARRETT
                        She never left, dude, she was there 
                        all weekend.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t believe it.

                                 GARRETT
                        The mousy girl who lives next door, 
                        that’s what she said.

                                 DONNIE
                        Who cares anyway? I thought you 
                        were over her. 
                                 TIM
                        I am but... that’s not the point.
                            (beat)
                        I’m gonna curbstomp that tool.

           INT. STARBUCKS - LATER

           Bruce waits in a line that doesn’t seem to be moving. 

           SUPER: MAY

           In front of him is a gaggle of teenage girls in school 
           uniforms. Bruce tries not to look. The girls finally get 
           their lattes and leave. One passes Bruce and makes eye 
           contact. 

           It’s Braden. Bruce tries to process how he knows her. And 
           then it hits him. This is the hottie from the bar. This is 
           Andy’s girlfriend?! Holy shit she’s a kid! 

           INT. TOTAL BODY FITNESS - THE NEXT DAY

           And now here’s Bruce, walking briskly down a corridor, a man 
           on a mission. He gets to Andy’s who is in the middle of a 
           training session. 

                                 ANDY
                        ...keep your back straight and bend 
                        your knees --

                                 BRUCE
                            (grabbing him)
                        Gym emergency. Back in a second. 

                                 ANDY
                        What the --?

                                 BRUCE
                        Come with me. 

           Bruce walks down the hall. Andy follows. They duck into the 
           Men’s Room. Bruce scours the room to make sure it’s empty, 
           looking under the stalls etc. Then he turns to Andy and says:

                                 BRUCE
                        Your girlfriend is in high school!

                                 ANDY
                        Shhh!

                                 BRUCE
                        What do you mean “shhh?!” Are you 
                        nuts? 

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not that simple.
                                 BRUCE
                        Is she even 18?

                                 ANDY
                        Almost.

                                 BRUCE
                        Dude, this is seriously fucked up!

                                 ANDY
                        Look, I know what you’re gonna say, 
                        and I swear, I had no idea --

                                 BRUCE
                        Hook a brother up!

                                 ANDY
                        ...I thought she was older when I--
                            (beat)
                        What?

                                 BRUCE
                        I want in. Those girls are smoking! 

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        Dude, what is wrong with you?!

                                 BRUCE
                        Think about it. Women are repulsed 
                        by me, are they not?
                            (Andy can’t argue)
                        So no more women for Bruce. Only 
                        girls! You’re a genius! 

                                 ANDY
                        You think this is easy? Dating a 17 
                        year old is work. Hard work. You 
                        have to go on all these dates and 
                        do shit all the time, opening 
                        doors, watching McConaughey movies. 
                        McConaughey, Bruce. You know how 
                        painful that is?

                                 BRUCE
                        I love McConaughey.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not having this conversation.

           Andy pushes him towards the door.

                                 BRUCE
                        Please. I know she has friends, I 
                        saw them! 
                                 ANDY
                        Not happening!

                                 BRUCE
                        Your Facebook page is adorable.

           Andy pushes Bruce out of the men’s room. A beat before he 
           realizes he too is still in the men’s room. Leaves.

           INT/EXT ANDY’S CAR - OUTSIDE ANDY’S PLACE - DUSK

           Braden is behind the wheel in Andy’s car. Andy rides shotgun, 
           trying to show her how to parallel park. He has set up cones 
           with hockey sticks inside to serve as other cars.

                                 ANDY
                        Now just... bring the car almost 
                        parallel to that cone. That’s it... 
                        Ok. Once you’ve lined it up, turn 
                        the wheel.  

                                 BRADEN
                        This way?

                                 ANDY
                        No! The other way. Slowly... there 
                        you go. The key is to not be 
                        nervous. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Right.

                                 ANDY
                        Just relax. Think about something 
                        else. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Like what?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know. What happened with 
                        you and my cousin?

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s gonna help me relax?
                            (beat)
                        He cheated on me. With some 
                        freshman ho-bag. 

                                 ANDY
                        So you decided to get back at him. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Something like that. 
                                 ANDY
                        Kind of a nutty thing to do, isn’t 
                        it?

                                 BRADEN
                        I loved him.

                                 ANDY
                        You loved him. My little cousin. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Yes.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh please...

                                 BRADEN
                        What?

           The car hasn’t moved an inch since this conversation started. 

                                 ANDY
                        You’re 17. What do you know about 
                        “love?” 

                                 BRADEN
                        I know enough.

                                 ANDY
                            (not buying)
                        Uh-huh

                                 BRADEN
                        I do.

                                 ANDY
                            (making fun of her)
                        Let me guess. It’s just like in the 
                        movies.

                                 BRADEN
                        Actually, yeah, it’s exactly like 
                        that. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, come, on! 

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re telling me you’ve never been 
                        in love?

                                 ANDY
                        Um... No.
                                 BRADEN
                        You’re such a liar. I can tell. 
                        Someone did a number on you my 
                        friend.

                                 ANDY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 BRADEN
                        She hurt you real bad, didn’t she. 
                        What was her name? 

                                 ANDY
                        Who?

                                 BRADEN
                        The girl. The one who hurt your 
                        feelings so bad you’re afraid to 
                        fall in love again. 

                                 ANDY
                        I’m a guy. I don’t have “feelings.”

                                 BRADEN
                        You poor, sad, man. 

                                 ANDY
                        Will you drop it already?

                                 BRADEN
                        You know what they say Andy. “Tis 
                        better to have loved and lost.”

                                 ANDY
                        Tis better to have loved and left. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Gross.

                                 ANDY
                        You gonna park this thing or 
                        what...

           Right. Back to the car. Braden cranes her neck to see behind 
           her. Then cranes the other way. This could take forever. 

           Suddenly, a grimace comes over Andy’s face like something’s 
           reeking.

                                 ANDY
                        You smell that?

                                 BRADEN
                        Uh-huh.
                                 ANDY
                        What is that?

                                 BRADEN
                            (shrugs)
                        I farted.

                                 ANDY
                            (beat)
                        You what?!

                                 BRADEN
                        I get nervous.

                                 ANDY
                        What the... How can you just fart 
                        like that?!

                                 BRADEN 
                        It wasn’t that hard...?

                                 ANDY
                        No, but, I mean...

                                 BRADEN
                        What, you didn’t think girls 
                        farted?

                                 ANDY
                        Jesus. What did you eat?

                                 BRADEN
                        We fart. We poo. We do all sorts of 
                        things. If you stuck around long 
                        enough...

           At which point Andy lets one fly.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve been holding that in for 
                        weeks. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh my god, sick!

           At which point they both can’t help themselves and burst out 
           in hysterics. 

           EXT APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

           Row after row of apple trees in every direction. Andy carries 
           a basket a few paces behind Braden, in disbelief that this 
           counts as a date.

                                 ANDY
                        Is it time to go home yet?
                                 BRADEN
                        This is what adults do.

                                 ANDY
                        This is what the Amish do.

           As Andy and Braden walk through the trees, suddenly Braden 
           runs off in the distance. 

                                 ANDY
                        Where are you going?

           Andy’s lost her in the maze of trees.

                                 ANDY
                        Braden?

           He looks around. There’s no Braden. There’s no one anywhere.

                                 ANDY
                        Hide and seek? That’s mature.

           Suddenly an apple goes whizzing by his head. And then 
           another. And then one hits him.

                                 ANDY
                        What the --?

           He ducks for cover. Not sure where the attack is coming from. 
           He spots Braden in a tree.

                                 ANDY
                        Get down from there!

                                 BRADEN
                        Surrender or die!

           She hits him again. He takes cover and returns fire.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh it’s on now.

           Super-mature apple throwing fight.

           INT ANDY’S CAR - LATER

           Andy is dropping Braden off outside her house. They’ve been 
           talking all day but they’re still in mid-conversation.

                                 ANDY
                        You know, you’re not unatttractive.

                                 BRADEN
                        Why Andy, that’s the nicest thing 
                        you’ve ever said.
                                 ANDY
                        I mean, you could get yourself a 
                        real boyfriend... if you wanted.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m leaving in August. A real 
                        boyfriend is the last thing I want.
                            (chirpy)
                        All I want is you, handsome!

           Braden sticks her tongue out at him. She’s too cute. He 
           smiles, can’t help himself.

                                 BRADEN
                        Goodnight Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, yeah, get out of here.

           Braden gets out of the car and walks off. Andy watches her 
           go. Realizes he’s smiling. This disturbs him very much.

                                 ANDY
                        The fuck am I doing?

           INT BRADEN’S KITCHEN - SAME

           Meanwhile, Harold has been watching from the window. He 
           pretends not to be as Braden walks in.

                                 BRADEN
                        Hi Daddy.

           She sits next to him.

                                 HAROLD
                        Did you have fun?

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah. It was nice.

                                 HAROLD
                        Uh-huh.

           Braden is well-aware her father knows more than he’s saying. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Dad, it’s no big deal, I swear.  
                        It’s... an experiment. 

                                 HAROLD
                        An experiment? You’re 
                        experimenting.

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah.
                                 HAROLD
                            (beat)
                        Words every father longs to hear. 

                                 BRADEN
                        You trust me, don’t you? 

                                 HAROLD
                        I’d still like to meet him. He  
                        should come for dinner.

                                 BRADEN
                        Whenever you want. 

                                 HAROLD
                        I’m free tomorrow night.

                                 BRADEN
                        You’re free every night.

                                 HAROLD
                        So how’s tomorrow?

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - LATER

           Andy and Bruce playing Halo.

                                 BRUCE
                        It won’t matter so much when she’s 
                        like... 50.
                            (Andy shrugs)
                        So... you like her?

                                 ANDY
                        Please. Who likes their girlfriend?
                            (beat)
                        She’s kinda funny, though. She 
                        listens... 

                                 BRUCE
                        Wait, you have conversations with 
                        this girl. Like, with words?

                                 ANDY
                        Sometimes. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Wow. This is serious.

                                 ANDY
                        No, no. That’s ridiculous. 

                                 BRUCE
                        You have feelings for her.
                                 ANDY
                        It’s not that. It’s... what’s it 
                        called when you, like, wake up in 
                        the morning... and immediately 
                        you’re thinking of someone, but not 
                        in a sex way, in, like a, hear her 
                        voice and wanna be around her kind 
                        of way. Is that like a palsy or 
                        something?

                                 BRUCE

                        Dude... 

           Andy says nothing. They continue to play for a beat.

           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - END OF DAY

           Andy picks Braden up from school again. He’s in the same 
           parking spot as before but not hiding so much this time. 
           Braden comes out and gets in the car.

                                 ANDY
                            (by rote)
                        Hi honey. How was your day?

                                 BRADEN
                        I need you to do something for me.

                                 ANDY
                        How unusual.

           Andy pulls out, passing Tim and his boys on the sidewalk. 
           Andy waves to Tim as he drives by. Tim doesn’t like it one 
           bit.

                                 BRADEN
                        My Dad wants to meet you.

           Andy slams on the brakes. He shoots her the look of death. 
           Braden sheepishly smiles. “Sorry.”

           EXT BRADEN’S HOME - NIGHT

           CLOSE UP on the front door. An arm with a colorful wristband 
           extends into the frame and rings the doorbell.

                                 BRADEN (O.S.)
                        I’ll get it!

           The door opens. Braden looks out. Her jaw drops.

           ANGLE ON ANDY: he’s wearing a sideways baseball cap, a camo 
           hoody, skinny jeans, and snowboard goggles around his neck.
                                 BRADEN
                        What the hell is this?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m trying to look younger.

                                 BRADEN
                        I said “just be yourself.”

                                 ANDY
                        I’m meeting your father. The last 
                        thing I’m gonna be is myself.

           Braden quickly steps outside, pulling the door shut behind 
           her.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve been watching MTV all morning. 
                        Trust me, I got this.

                                 BRADEN
                        You look retarded. Take that off --

           She starts peeling away layers of his outfit and throwing 
           them in the bushes. Andy tries fighting her off which turns 
           into a sort of wrestling scenario. At which point the door 
           opens. 

           It’s Harold, who thinks he’s seeing his daughter undressing 
           her new boyfriend on the lawn. Braden and Andy are frozen. 

           Without a word, Harold shuts the door and goes back inside. 
           Andy is mortified.

           INT BRADEN’S HOME - LATER

           Andy has taken off his hat and has terrible hat hair. He’s 
           seated around the dining room table with Braden and her Dad. 
           For a while, the only sound is that of silverware on plates 
           and it’s making Andy nervous.

                                 ANDY
                        I must say, sir, great place you 
                        got here.

                                 HAROLD
                        Well thank you Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        One might even say it’s... “the 
                        shizzle.”

           Andy looks confidently at Braden, who visibly winces. 

                                 HAROLD
                        The what?
                                 ANDY
                            (no longer sure he used 
                             that right)
                        The... shnizzle? The shlizz... it’s 
                        nice.

           There’s no response from either of them. Not knowing what 
           else to say:

                                 ANDY
                        Holla!

           Braden and her Dad share a look. His says “who is this 
           clown?” Hers says “I love you Daddy.”

                                 HAROLD
                        Tell me, Andy, how do you know my 
                        daughter?

                                 BRADEN
                        We met at --

                                 ANDY
                        School.

           Braden shoots daggers at Andy.

                                 HAROLD
                        Oh. Do you go to Brighton as well?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeop. Sure do. We’re the same age, 
                        she and I. 

                                 HAROLD
                        Really? You know you look older 
                        than 17, right?

                                 ANDY
                        Genetics. You should see my Mom. 
                        Woman’s 48, looks like she’s 90! 
                        It’s hilarious. 

           Braden looks at Andy: “what’s wrong with you?”

                                 ANDY
                        Actually, it’s really sad. 

           They all continue to eat. The silence is deafening and Andy 
           wants to break it.

                                 ANDY
                        So, uh, what is it you do for a 
                        living, sir?
                                 HAROLD
                        You can call me Harold.

                                 ANDY
                        Ok. Harold.

                                 HAROLD
                        I’m a police detective.

           Andy chokes on his veal.

           EXT BRADEN’S HOME - SAME

           Andy and Braden exit the house. Andy sees Harold, 
           threateningly watching from the window. Fears the worst.

                                 BRADEN
                        Don’t worry. He won’t call the 
                        cops.

                                 ANDY
                        He is the cops!

                                 BRADEN
                        Nah. He just said that to fuck with 
                        you.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, phew. What is he really?

                                 BRADEN
                        A retired police detective. 
                            (off his panic)
                        It’s fine. He trusts me.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m leaving now.

                                 BRADEN
                        Fine. But first let’s talk about 
                        the prom.

                                 ANDY
                        The what?

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s Saturday night so I’d say, be 
                        here, dressed and ready for 
                        pictures, 5-ish?

                                 ANDY
                        Oh no no no. We agreed no more high 
                        school stuff.

                                 BRADEN
                        It’s my senior prom!
                                 ANDY
                        Ok wait, better idea... You ready? 
                        How bout... we skip the prom and we 
                        do... anything else instead. 
                        Literally, anything else you can 
                        think of. How bout that?
                            (off her look)
                        No?

           Andy sees Harold, still watching him from the window. Same 
           intense look on his face.

                                 ANDY
                        5 it is.

                                 BRADEN
                        One other thing. 
                            (beat)
                        My friend’s date cancelled. Know 
                        anyone who’d go with her?

           On Andy’s face, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           BRUCE. In a tux. A big, fat smile on his face. He is...

           EXT BRADEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Bruce stands next to Andy, also in a tux. They’re both 
           carrying flowers. Bruce elbows Andy, excited. The door opens 
           to reveal Braden. And Becca. Bruce’s smile comes right off. 
           So does Becca’s. 

           INT LIMO - LATER

           As the couples get inside Andy looks out the rear window. He 
           sees Harold, giving Andy the stare of death. The limo pulls 
           away.

                                 BRADEN
                        This is so exciting! We’re going to 
                        have so much fun! Are you guys 
                        excited?

                                 ANDY/BECCA/BRUCE
                        Yeah./ Sure. /Whatever.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s the spirit!

           EXT HISTORIC OLD MANSION - NIGHT

           The limo pulls up to the prom, which is taking place in a 
           stately manor house. On the way to the door Braden elbows 
           Andy. He can’t help but to smile.
           INT HISTORIC OLD MANSION - SAME

           All eyes are on our gang as they walk across the ballroom in 
           SLO-MO, making a glorious dramatic entrance.

           Whereas Becca, Bruce and Andy are a little self-conscious, 
           Braden is reveling in the moment.

           INSERT B&W PROM PICS:

           Everyone’s formal photo...

           - Some of the kids we’ve seen so far with their dates. CLICK. 
           CLICK. CLICK. Then:

           - Andy and Braden. She’s beaming. He’s paranoid. CLICK.

           - Bruce and Becca. Not at the prom 15 minutes and they 
           already look like they’re over it. CLICK.

           - Tim and his DATE. Late 30s, bad make-up, a garish sequined 
           dress, sloppy -- she is a COUGAR. Even in the pic Tim is 
           looking around for Braden. CLICK.

           INT HISTORIC OLD MANSION - LATER

           Fashions change, hairstyles change, but Prom will always be 
           Prom. Kids are dancing. Girls are hugging, gossiping, 
           comparing dresses.

           We MOVE to Andy and Braden at the bar. Braden has taken a 
           small airplane bottle of booze from her purse which Andy 
           quickly grabs.

                                 BRADEN
                        What’s one drink? Look around, 
                        we’re the only sober people here.

                                 ANDY
                        No chance.

           Their sodas come. Andy raises his glass to toast. Resigned, 
           she clinks it.

           ANGLE ON a dinner table where Bruce and Becca sit, alone, in 
           silence. Finally:

                                 BRUCE
                        So... you wanna (dance)?

                                 BECCA
                        No.

                                 BRUCE
                        Yeah. Me neither. I hate dancing.
           Awkward silence.

                                 BRUCE
                        You’re just a ball of sunshine, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 BECCA
                        Blow me.

           ANGLE on Andy and Braden, standing by the dance floor. 
           Braden’s friends see her and excitedly race over. The girls 
           hug and yell and talk about how pretty they all look. 

           Meanwhile, one of the chaperones, a NUN, walks right up to 
           Andy. She’s his age, attractive, and, in fact: 

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                        Andrew?

           A look of recognition comes over Andy’s face.

                                 ANDY
                        Lilly!?

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                        It’s Sister Lillian now.

           Andy goes to hug her and then stops. He’s not sure what the 
           etiquette is.

                                 ANDY
                        Jesus Christ. I mean, sorry, it’s 
                        been... junior year...?

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                        Rob Bensen’s house...

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I remember that party. I 
                        drove you home, right? And then 
                        we... oh.
                            (all coming back to him)
                        Oh!

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                        A lot’s changed since then.

                                 ANDY
                        I can see that.

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                        Are you a chaperone?

                                 ANDY
                        Um... sort of.
           More awkward silence. She looks at him. In a way that Nuns 
           are NOT supposed to look at dudes.

                                 SISTER LILLIAN
                            (beat)
                        You still look really good. 

           She starts massaging his arm. Andy’s clearly uncomfortable.

                                 ANDY
                        I should probably... you know, 
                        yeah. 

           Andy grabs Braden and whisks her away. 

                                 BRADEN
                        How do you know the Headmaster?

                                 ANDY
                        They still call her the headmaster? 

                                 BRADEN
                        Yeah. She’s super strict.

                                 ANDY
                        Huh. We called her that too. 
                        Different reason. 
                            (beat)
                        Let’s dance. 

           ANGLE on Becca and Bruce, still at the table, still having 
           the worst time.

                                 BRUCE
                        How bout some bread?

           Becca reluctantly looks at the bread. It kinda looks good.

                                 BECCA
                        Fine.

           Bruce is pleased. He tears off a piece for her.

                                 BRUCE
                        Can I get you anything else? 
                        Cheese? Butter?

                                 BECCA
                        I’m lactose intolerant.

                                 BRUCE
                        Huh. Me too. 

           Silence.
                                 BRUCE
                        I have a terrible stomach.

                                 BECCA
                            (beat)
                        I got a tapeworm once.

                                 BRUCE
                        No way, me too!

           BACK TO Andy and Braden on the dance floor. They are being 
           watched very closely by Tim, who disinterestedly dances with 
           the Cougar. 

           Soon the music stops and the PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT BODY 
           gets on stage to make an announcement. 

                                 STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are 
                        in and it’s time to announce this 
                        year’s Prom King and Queen. Drum 
                        roll please...

           It’s a DJ so there’s no drum roll.

                                 STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT
                        Ok. And the winners are... Tim 
                        Cooley and Braden Matthews!

           Braden looks at Andy with surprise. He claps her for. She 
           makes her way to the front of the room. Tim meets her there. 
           He tries to hold her hand as they’re crowned but she won’t 
           let him.

                                 STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT
                        And now, as is custom, the King and 
                        Queen will take the floor for a 
                        dance. Maestro...

           The music starts up again. With everyone watching, Braden 
           reluctantly lets Tim take hold of her.

                                 BRADEN
                        I like your date. 

           ANGLE ON Tim’s table. The Cougar is doing her nails, yawning.

                                 TIM
                        It was supposed to be you. Everyone 
                        knows we’re meant to be together.

                                 BRADEN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 TIM
                        Let’s go out again.
                                 BRADEN
                        No.

                                 TIM
                        Come on!

                                 BRADEN
                        Not gonna happen, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Why? Cause of my douchebag cousin?

                                 BRADEN
                            (beat)
                        Sure. Let’s go with that.

           ANGLE ON Bruce and Becca, laughing hysterically at the table.

                                 BRUCE
                        You think that’s bad? Please. I got 
                        rejected by EHarmony. Not some girl 
                        on the site. The site rejected me. 
                        I got rejected by a website.

                                 BECCA
                        Oh my god, stop.

                                 BRUCE
                        That’s not the worst one either. 
                        One time, this girl rejected me 
                        from across the room. I wasn’t even 
                        halfway over there yet. She sees me 
                        get up and shouts “Just... no.” My 
                        friends called me “Just No” for 
                        months.

           Becca is practically choking from laughing so hard.

                                 BECCA
                            (once she stops laughing)
                        You’re really funny, you know that?

                                 BRUCE
                        I am?

                                 BECCA
                        Yeah.
                            (beat)
                        I’m still not hooking up with you.

           A beat before they both bust out again laughing.

           ANGLE ON the dancefloor. Braden and Andy dancing. Tim 
           watches, furious. Decides to march over there and grab Andy.
                                 TIM
                        You and me. Family talk. Right now.

           Tim grabs Andy’s arm and yanks him out of the ballroom.

           EXT HISTORIC OLD MANSION - PRIVATE CORRIDOR - SAME

                                 TIM
                        What I tell you, man?

                                 ANDY
                        Did you cheat on her?

                                 TIM
                        One time. So what?

                                 ANDY
                        Dude... you don’t treat girls that 
                        way.

                                 TIM
                        You’re giving me relationship 
                        advice?! That’s hilarious! You 
                        treat women like garbage.

                                 ANDY
                        Least I’m honest with them. I’ve 
                        never cheated on anyone. 

                                 TIM
                        I’m not gonna tell you again, Andy. 
                        Back the fuck off of my girl.

                                 ANDY
                        It’s not that simple, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        I warned you...

                                 ANDY
                        Oh what are you gonna do, hit me?

           Some of the kids sneaking a smoke outside think a fight is 
           about to take place. They excitedly run in and shout “Fight! 
           Fight!” It reverberates through the room and reaches Braden, 
           Bruce, and Becca. 

           BACK OUTSIDE: Tim is in Andy’s face.

                                 ANDY
                        You wouldn’t. We’re family. 

                                 TIM
                        You stole my girlfriend.
                                 ANDY
                        You cheated on her!

                                 TIM
                        One time!

           And now practically everyone spills outside to watch. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy?

                                 TIM
                        Just leave her be and you won’t get 
                        hurt.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry, Tim. I can’t do that.

                                 TIM
                        Then I’m gonna have to kill you.

                                 ANDY
                        Stop acting like a little bitch -

           And with that, Tim punches Andy. Hard. 

           Andy stumbles back. The crowd starts cheering them on. The 
           much bigger, stronger Tim basically kicks Andy’s ass.

                                 ANDY
                        Not the face! Not the face!
                            (more punches)
                        Not the body! Not the body!

           Bruce jumps in to help. He is not a fighter. He tries to pull 
           Tim off but isn’t strong enough and then proceeds to just 
           slap Tim on the head like he’s swatting a fly. Finally...

                                 BRADEN
                        Stop it!

           Per her request, Tim stops throttling Andy. Bruce tries to 
           get Andy back on his feet but he’s a bloody mess. Braden goes 
           to help. Tim steps towards her.

                                 TIM
                        Braden, I just want to--

                                 BRADEN
                            (furious)
                        Don’t. Ever. Talk to me again!

           She pushes Tim away. Andy leans on her and she helps him get 
           into the limo.
                                 ANDY
                            (delirious)
                        What happened?

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - LATER

           Braden and Andy on the couch. She holds an ice pack to his 
           forehead.

                                 ANDY
                        Ow!

                                 BRADEN
                        Sorry.

                                 ANDY
                        He kicked my ass, didn’t he? Shit. 
                        That is one strong kid.

                                 BRADEN
                        He’s a big boy.

                                 ANDY
                        I mean, Christ, he is massive.

                                 BRADEN
                        Not everywhere.

           She removes the ice to inspect his wounds.

                                 BRADEN
                        This is all my fault.

                                 ANDY
                        No it’s not.

                                 BRADEN
                        It is. I’m sorry, Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        For what?

                                 BRADEN
                        For putting you through this. Not 
                        just tonight, I mean everything. I 
                        know it probably wasn’t... the most 
                        mature thing to do. 

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t be sorry. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I am. I shouldn’t have -- 

                                 ANDY
                        Braden... I said don’t be. 
           The two of them look at each other. In other movies, this is 
           the moment where something would happen. But here, they both 
           look away. Neither one knows what to do.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, what time is it? You should go 
                        to your after party. You don’t have 
                        to stay here.

                                 BRADEN
                        I know I don’t have to, douchebag. 
                        I want to.

           And so they sit there. Together. And it’s nice... in a weird, 
           quasi-romantic but totally unacceptable way. She reapplies 
           the ice.

                                 ANDY
                        Ow! Gently!

           INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           Braden sits at a table, surrounded by the girls. Hillary, 
           Jane, Lucy, are all chatting away but Braden is lost in her 
           own universe. With the biggest smile we’ve seen from her yet.

           Eventually Braden notices Becca staring at her, comes back 
           down to Earth. Becca’s look says “you like him, don’t you?”

           INT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - LOCKER ROOM - END OF THE DAY

           Andy is picking up used towels off the benches. Finally he 
           opens the steam room door to see if anything’s been left 
           inside. 

           And someone’s there. It’s Harold, in a terry-cloth robe, man-
           tits hanging out and everything.

                                 HAROLD
                        Hello Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Aah!

                                 HAROLD
                        You lied to me.

                                 ANDY
                        I... uh... well...

                                 HAROLD
                        Sit. Let’s have us a chat.

           Andy isn’t dressed for the steam room (i.e. he’s fully 
           dressed). But he has no choice. Comes in, sits down next to 
           Harold.
                                 HAROLD
                        It’s a crazy world, isn’t it Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        You said it.

                                 HAROLD
                        Do you have any idea how difficult 
                        it is to raise a kid in this day 
                        and age?

                                 ANDY
                        I guess... no. I don’t.

                                 HAROLD
                        No one does. That’s the problem.
                            (beat)
                        But you know what...? Somehow I did 
                        it. I raised a great kid. All by 
                        myself too. My wife, she... well, 
                        long story short, Braden had every 
                        reason to go dark. Dye her hair 
                        some wacky color, pierce all up and 
                        down her face, listen to “They 
                        Might Be Retarded” or whatever 
                        they’re called. She could have been 
                        a whole lotta trouble, you know? 
                        But she isn’t. She’s the sweetest 
                        kid.

                                 ANDY
                            (sincere)
                        She is.

           Silence for a beat.

                                 HAROLD
                        Andy, I can’t say I support this... 
                        thing... you’re doing with my 
                        daughter. But I’m willing to 
                        tolerate it, long as I come home 
                        and see that smile on her face. You 
                        hear what I’m saying?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes sir.

                                 HAROLD
                        I’m saying this girl doesn’t need 
                        another disappointment in her life. 
                        Whatever happens between you two... 
                        you bring her back how you found 
                        her. Ok?

                                 ANDY
                        Yes sir. I promise.
                                 HAROLD
                        Let me ask you something. Why’d you 
                        lie in the first place?

                                 ANDY
                        I just... I’m older. Much older. I 
                        wasn’t sure you’d approve.

                                 HAROLD
                            (beat)
                        I’ll tell you a story. My wife 
                        Helene... She and I were born two 
                        days apart. Bitch left me for the 
                        landscaper. Think I care what your 
                        age difference is? Be a good guy, 
                        we’ll have no problems here.

           Andy nods. He likes this guy.

                                 HAROLD
                            (getting up to leave)
                        Ok then. 

           Andy gets up after him.

                                 HAROLD
                        No, you stay. It’s good for you.

           Andy’s clothes are totally drenched in sweat by this point.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m... kind of suffocating here.

                                 HAROLD
                        0nly at first. Once you get used to 
                        it... starts to feel pretty good.

           EXT SHOPPING MALL - LATER

           Andy, still with a black eye, carries Braden’s bags to the 
           car. 

                                 BRADEN
                        There’s nothing else?

                                 ANDY
                        That’s not the point.

           SUPER: JUNE

                                 BRADEN
                        Sure it is. You should love what 
                        you do.
                                 ANDY
                        I have no job experience, no 
                        marketable skills, I never went to 
                        college, what else can I do? 

           They get in the car. Andy turns the ignition.

                                 BRADEN
                        Whatever you want!

                                 ANDY
                        Ha, spoken like a 17 year old kid.

                                 BRADEN
                        No. Spoken like someone who knows 
                        you. And believes in you. Who 
                        thinks you’re amazing... even if 
                        you don’t.

           Andy can’t help but be moved by this. No one’s ever spoken to 
           him this way. Andy isn’t even sure how to respond. He just 
           turns his attention to the road. They drive, listening to 
           more 90s indie rock. Braden tries to deal for a few beats. 
           Can’t. 

                                 BRADEN
                            (grabbing Ipod)
                        Oh my god, give me this.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey!

           Braden hooks her own Ipod up to the connector.

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t even think about putting on 
                        some of that teenybopper crap. Not 
                        in this car.

                                 BRADEN
                        Teenybopper? Bitch please.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m serious.

                                 BRADEN
                        Shut up and listen.

           The song selected is called “She’s Got You High” by Mumm-Ra. 
           It is definitely not what Andy was expecting. Braden shoots 
           him a look that says “try not to like this.”

           Andy doesn’t say a word. He drives. As the song picks up 
           speed, Andy finds himself kinda digging it. 
           Still we stay with them. Driving in silence. Listening to the 
           song. The windows are down and it’s beautiful out. 

           Andy’s right hand taps along with the beat on the gear shift. 
           It’s very close to Braden’s on the armrest. They may even be 
           touching. 

           The song builds. They don’t look at each other. But they’re 
           both smiling. 

           At which point, we COMMENCE MONTAGE. The song continues over:

           - Andy and Braden stay in and cook dinner together. The 
           kitchen looks like a disaster area seeing as how neither of 
           them knows what they’re doing.

           - Andy changes his “Relationship Status” on Facebook from 
           “Single” to “In a Relationship.” He then changes “In a 
           Relationship” to “It’s Complicated.”

           - Andy and Braden playing Rockband. Guess what -- they’re 
           awesome now.

           - Braden nervously parallel parks. The DMV TESTER nods in 
           approval. Braden’s passed the test. She runs out of the car 
           to celebrate. Andy’s there waiting for her.

           - Back in the car. Only it’s sometime later. The song ends 
           with both Braden and Andy harmonizing the last bit, singing 
           as loud as they possibly can. After which, they burst out 
           laughing. One might even think they were a real couple.

           They arrive at Braden’s place and she gets out.

                                 BRADEN
                        Call you later. 

                                 ANDY
                        Sounds good.

           Andy drives off. Braden goes to her mailbox. There’s a stack 
           of mail. Sorts through it on her way to the house. Stops in 
           her tracks. A letter from Stanford.

           INT ANDY’S CAR - SAME

           Andy is driving. His phone rings (”I’m not that Innocent...”)  

                                 ANDY
                            (answers)
                        That was quick.

           All he hears is giddy screams. 
           INT TGI FRIDAY’S - NIGHT

           Andy and Braden at their favorite restaurant. They raise 
           their Milkshake mugs.

                                 BRADEN
                        To Stanford.

                                 ANDY
                        No. To you. 

           Braden seems more subdued than one might think.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? You should be jumping 
                        up and down.

                                 BRADEN
                        I am. I was. It’s just... 
                        everything’s happening so fast, you 
                        know. First Prom, then graduation’s 
                        in a few weeks... before you know 
                        it, it’s August and I have to 
                        leave.

           It dawns on Andy what she’s saying.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m sorry... graduation is when?

                                 BRADEN
                        Right. Like you haven’t been 
                        counting the days.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh. Yeah, no, totally.

           Andy is bewildered by this. He sorta forgot the end date. As 
           he’s processing this, he hears a voice.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well look who it is.

           It’s his boss, Roberts.

                                 ANDY
                        Mr. Roberts!
                            (to Braden, pointed)
                        How bout that. It’s my boss.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Fancy running into you here. And 
                        who is this lovely -- 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, uh, this... is...
                                 BRADEN
                        Braden. Pleasure to meet you.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Pleasure’s all mine. Watch out for 
                        this one. A real ladykiller.

                                 BRADEN
                        I think I got it under control.

                                 ROBERTS
                        What is it you do, Braden?

                                 BRADEN
                        Me? Uh, I’m a...

           Braden looks at Andy for help. Andy’s got nothing. At which 
           point, Robert’s family joins him. WIFE (late 30s), TWO 
           DAUGHTERS 10 and 14. 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        She’s a senior Dad.

                                 ROBERTS
                        A senior...

                                 ANDY
                        The proper term is “Senora,” little 
                        girl. But good try.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        What’s up, Braden?

           They know each other? Shit. Fuck. Shit.

                                 BRADEN
                            (awkward)
                        Hiya... Steph.

           Roberts is very confused. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        Honey, how do you know Andy’s... 
                        date?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        We were both in the play.

                                 ROBERTS
                        What play?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        The school play. Duh. How do you 
                        know the boyfriend?
                                 ANDY
                        Boyfriend? Did you say 
                        “boyfriend?!” Please. Me and her? 
                        We’re not... No.

           Roberts looks at Braden. Then at Andy. Knows Andy well enough 
           to size up the situation quick. Plus:

                                 DAUGHTER
                        They’ve been hooking up all 
                        semester. Everyone knows about it.

                                 ANDY
                        What? That’s crazy. This is... 
                        babysitting. 

           Daughter makes a “yeah right” face at her Dad. Andy is 
           starting to hate this kid. Makes a menacing face at her to 
           shut her mouth. Doesn’t work.

                                 ROBERTS
                        We’re gonna go now. But I’ll see 
                        you tomorrow, yeah?
                            (off his nod)
                        Good.

           Once they’re gone, Andy turns to Braden. She winces. 

                                 BRADEN
                        How bad was that?

                                 ANDY
                        Um... should be fine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT TOTAL BODY FITNESS - NEXT DAY

           Andy carries his stuff in a box out the door. Roberts, Bruce, 
           and the rest of the gym watch him leave.

                                 ROBERTS
                            (to Bruce)
                        You know about this?

           Playing dumb, Bruce just shrugs. No way.

           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Andy in the car, picking Braden up from school. She comes out 
           and this time is surprised to see him. 

                                 BRADEN
                        You weren’t supposed to pick me up 
                        today.
           EXT PARK - DAY

           Andy and Braden are having a heart-to-heart while sitting on 
           swings. He seems really down. 

                                 BRADEN
                        ...are you ok?

                                 ANDY
                        Besides the fact that I’ve lost the 
                        only job I’ve ever had. I’d say... 
                        not really, no. 

           Braden looks particularly distraught. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy, I can get you your job back.

                                 ANDY
                        How so?

                                 BRADEN
                        What if I go in there and tell him 
                        it was all platonic. That we never 
                        had sex. That would do it, right?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t want you to lie for me. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Ok. But... what if it’s not a lie?

                                 ANDY
                        Hmmm?

                                 BRADEN
                        What if it’s the truth? That we 
                        never had sex. 

                                 ANDY
                        We did. That first night. That’s 
                        why I’m in this mess to begin with.

                                 BRADEN
                            (swallows)
                        Do you remember that night?
                            (he doesn’t)
                        Minute we got to my bedroom... you 
                        fell right asleep.

           Andy lets this sink in for a second.

                                 ANDY
                        You said -- 
                                 BRADEN
                        I know. I... 
                            (beat)
                        I lied. 

           Andy gets up off the swings.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re kidding right? It’s a joke.

           The tears are already starting to well in Braden’s eyes.

                                 ANDY
                            (realizing)
                        Oh my god.

                                 BRADEN
                        I swear, I never meant for any of 
                        this to --

                                 ANDY 
                        What? You never meant what? 

                                 BRADEN

                                 ANDY
                        Do you even know what you did?!

                                 BRADEN
                        Don’t yell at me.

                                 ANDY
                        You made me think I was a criminal, 
                        Braden. You took five months of my 
                        life.

                                 BRADEN
                            (goes to touch him)
                        Andy...

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t touch me. Don’t even think 
                        about touching me. Are you nuts?! I 
                        was fine before you. I had a good 
                        life. A good job. I was happy.  

                                 BRADEN
                        I didn’t mean to --

                                 ANDY
                        Well you did. You ruined 
                        everything. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m so sorry.
                                 ANDY
                        And for what, revenge, popularity? 
                        To look cool to your friends?

                                 BRADEN
                        It was more than --

                                 ANDY
                        What?! Tell me. What reason could 
                        you possibly have to do such a 
                        thing?

                                 BRADEN
                        I just...
                            (beat)
                        I liked you, ok!?!

           Silence.

                                 ANDY
                            (in disbelief)
                        Wow. 

           Andy shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 ANDY
                        You had me fooled. You really did.  

                                 BRADEN
                        Andy --

                                 ANDY
                        You may act older, and you may look 
                        older, but inside... you’re a 
                        child. 

           Andy turns to walk away.

                                 BRADEN 
                        Can I fix it? 

                                 ANDY
                        No. You stay away from me. 

                                 BRADEN
                        But --

                                 ANDY
                        I’m serious. I don’t need you. I 
                        don’t want you. This ends now.

           And with that he walks off, leaving a tearful Braden behind.

           INT BRADEN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Braden storms in, passing Harold at the table.
                                 HAROLD
                        Hey hun, how was --

           But she’s already climbing the stairs. Harold hears her slam 
           the door to her bedroom. Knows she’s upset and doesn’t like 
           it one bit. 

           We stay with him. He sums up all the angst of being a father 
           to a teenage girl in one simple phrase:

                                 HAROLD
                        Oy.

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - SAME

           Andy’s equally distraught. He paces, not sure what to do with 
           himself. He starts playing Rockband alone. Plays like a man 
           possessed. At the climax he starts smashing the guitar. 
           Doesn’t stop until it’s in pieces. Andy’s panting. The game 
           is ruined.

           INT ANDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Andy watches TV in bed, eating ice cream, a copy of “The 
           Secret” by his side. 

           SUPER: JULY

           The opening credits for some Cinemax soft core porn movie 
           comes on. Andy’s not interested. He flips the channels, 
           landing on “Garden State.” The climactic scene where Braff 
           runs through the airport to Portman.

                                 ANDY
                        Ridiculous. 

           Andy changes the channel. “Bridget Jones’s Diary.” It’s the 
           scene where Bridget is heartbroken. She’s in the exact same 
           position as Andy, same look on her face, doing the exact same 
           thing that he’s doing. Andy sees this. Takes a moment to 
           register. Then Andy freaks out!

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, hell no!

           MUSIC UP: “Boogie Woogie Rock and Roll” by Komeda

                                                                CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - Andy’s on the dance floor in a club, surrounded by girls. 
           He drinks straight from a bottle of champagne. Living it up.

           - Andy talking to some women at the bar. The women are 
           attractive, interested, and super old. 
                                 ANDY
                        I’m gonna need to see your IDs.

           The ladies chuckle, flattered.

                                 ANDY
                        No, seriously, I need to see your 
                        IDs.

           Andy is not taking any chances this time. 

           - Andy drinking like a fish.

           - CU on A COMPUTER SCREEN reads “Are you sure you wish to 
           delete your Facebook Account?” Andy deactivates the shit out 
           of his Facebook Account!

           - Andy, dancing, out of his mind, with the group of women. 

           - Andy in bed with like four of those girls.

                                 ANDY
                            (yelling, for absolutely 
                             no reason)
                        I’m having a great fucking time!
                            (then, sadly)
                        So much fun!

           - In the morning, the girls are sneaking off.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, can I call you sometime?

           The girls look at each other, confused.

                                 GIRL #3
                        Why?

           EXT HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD

           A graduation ceremony in progress. Braden’s name is called. 
           She gets her diploma. Shakes the hand of the Prefect. Smiles 
           and waves to her Dad. Involuntarily, Braden looks for Andy 
           (as she did at the volleyball game). Pretends it’s ok she 
           doesn’t see him. Tim, off to the side, sees all this as well.

           EXT APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

           Andy is apple picking with SOME GIRL. There’s no mistaking 
           that she is around Andy’s age. He smiles. And for a moment it 
           looks like Andy may have recaptured what he was looking for.

                                 SOME GIRL
                            (beat)
                        You know they sell perfectly good 
                        apples at the grocery store.
                                 ANDY
                        This is much more fun, trust me.

           Girl’s certainly not finding this any fun. Suddenly an apple 
           flies by her head. The next one hits her.

                                 SOME GIRL
                        Ow! The hell is wrong with you?!

                                 ANDY
                        Nothing, I just thought...

                                 SOME GIRL
                        Jesus Christ that hurt.

           Pissed, she walks away from Andy. Andy just sighs. 

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Andy and Thurston on the couch. Andy has his cell phone and 
           is scrolling through, looking for someone, anyone, to call. 
           There’s no one but Bruce. Andy dials. 

           SUPER: JULY

           SPLITSCREEN w/ Bruce, combing his hair in the bathroom. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Hello?

                                 ANDY
                        Hey Bruce, it’s me.

                                 BRUCE
                        What’s up dude?

                                 ANDY
                        Not much. What’s going on?

                                 BRUCE
                        Nothing. 

                                 ANDY
                        Cool, cool.

           Silence. 

                                 ANDY
                        So what’s up?

           Bruce looks at the phone, confused.

                                 BRUCE
                        Andy... is there something...
                                 ANDY
                        No. Just wanted to say hi. See how 
                        you’re doing.

                                 BRUCE
                        I’m... doing good.

                                 ANDY
                        Good. Me too. I’m doing real good. 

           Silence. 

                                 ANDY
                        You wanna come over later? Watch 
                        Project Runway, have a guy’s night, 
                        you and me?

                                 BRUCE
                        Um... That sounds... weird, Andy, 
                        but I, uh, I can’t actually. 

                                 ANDY
                        No, why not?

                                 BRUCE
                        Believe it or not... I have a date.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh. Good for you. Another time 
                        then.

                                 BRUCE
                            (beat)
                        Andy... you sure you’re ok?

                                 ANDY
                        Me? I’m fantastic. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Ok. Talk to you later, alright?

                                 ANDY
                        Sounds good. 
                            (beat)
                        Wait a sec, you have a date?!

           EXT BECCA’S HOME - LATER

           Becca answers the door.

                                 BRUCE
                        Hello.

                                 BECCA
                        Hello yourself.
           Bruce is dressed up for a night on the town. He looks 
           alright, actually.

                                 BRUCE
                            (re: his outfit)
                        What do you think?

                                 BECCA
                        I like.

           At which point, behind Becca, emerges a woman, early 40s, 
           drop dead gorgeous. This is BECCA’S MOM. Bruce can’t believe 
           it. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Uh... Hi. I’m, uh...

                                 BECCA’S MOM
                        Bruce. I know. My daughter’s told 
                        me all about you. She says you’re 
                        hilarious. 

           She extends a hand to Bruce. Bruce shakes it. In awe.

                                 BECCA’S MOM
                        Shall we...?

           Speechless, Bruce hands her the flowers.

                                 BECCA’S MOM
                        Violets, my favorite.

           Bruce and the Mom walk off. Bruce turns and mouths “thank 
           you!” to Becca. She roots him on.

           INT BRADEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Braden sits on the couch alone, looking forlorn. Harold dims 
           the lights and comes out with a birthday cake. He sings to 
           her. We see her smile but it’s not as bright as it used to 
           be.

                                 HAROLD
                        Happy birthday kiddo.

                                 BRADEN
                        Thanks Daddy.

                                 HAROLD
                        You sure you don’t want to go out 
                        with your friends?
                            (she doesn’t)
                        Rather stay here with your old man?
                            (she does)
                        Don’t blame you. This is way more 
                        exciting. 
           The doorbell rings. At the sound, Braden’s face lights up. 
           Could it be?

                                 HAROLD
                        I’ll get that.

           Braden is clearly excited by the possibility that it’s... 

                                 TIM
                        Happy birthday Braden.

           Tim has buttoned his shirt, tucked it in, the swagger and 
           arrogance nowhere to be found. He hands her a gift.

                                 TIM
                        This is for you.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s so sweet. Thanks. For 
                        remembering.

                                 TIM
                            (beat)
                        You think we can (talk)?

                                 HAROLD
                            (gets the message)
                        Do I hear a phone? 

           Harold goes upstairs. Behind Tim’s back, he signals to Braden 
           that he doesn’t much care for this kid. 

                                 TIM
                        I... um... I also came to tell 
                        you... I’m not going to OSU. I got 
                        offered to start at another 
                        school... so I’m gonna do that.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s great Tim. What school?

                                 TIM
                        Stanford.  

                                 BRADEN
                        Oh.

                                 TIM
                        So I thought... since we’re both 
                        going, maybe you and me could, you 
                        know, get past whatever happened 
                        and... be together again.

                                 BRADEN
                        Tim...
                                 TIM
                        Hear me out, ok? I miss you. I want 
                        to be with you. 

                                 BRADEN
                        Tim, please...

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry I slept with that chick. 
                        And I’m sorry I beat up my cousin. 
                        I won’t do that shit again, I 
                        promise. And I won’t pressure you 
                        to have sex anymore, either. If 
                        you’re a prude, that’s cool. I’m 
                        cool with it. I just... we love 
                        each other, don’t we?

                                 BRADEN
                            (beat)
                        No.

                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 BRADEN
                        I don’t think we do, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Of course we do. You said you loved 
                        me, like, a million times. Were you 
                        lying to me?

                                 BRADEN
                        I wasn’t lying. I just... 
                            (beat)
                        I had absolutely no idea what I was 
                        talking about.

           Tim deflates. 

                                 BRADEN
                        I’m sorry.
                            (beat)
                        But, hey, see you on campus, right? 
                        Go Cardinal!

           Tim doesn’t know what to do. He just storms out. 

           INT MILT’S LAW FIRM - DAY

           And so it’s come to this: Andy, dressed in Khakis and a clip-
           on tie, is pushing a mail cart around his father’s office. 

           SUPER: AUGUST
           He delivers a package to an assistant and see his Dad 
           watching down the hall. Andy waves. The assistant hands Andy 
           back some letters he sorted wrong. The whole thing is a far 
           cry from how it used to be.

           INT ANDY’S PLACE - EVENING

           Andy walks in the door and sees more mail. He sighs. Most of 
           it is bills, which he ignores. But one letter in particular 
           catches his interest. It’s from Elmhurst State University. 
           Andy looks at it oddly. Opens it. Is bewildered.

           EXT ELMHURST STATE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING

           A quaint suburban college campus.

           INT COLLEGE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - SAME

           Andy speaks with an ADMINISTRATOR.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes, hello, my name is Andy Mason. 
                        I got a letter in the mail about an 
                        interview today.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        What did you say your name was?

                                 ANDY
                        Mason, Andy. But I think there 
                        might be some mistake. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Mason. Mason. Yes. Andrew. I have 
                        your application right here.

                                 ANDY
                        Right, see, the thing is, I 
                        didn’t... send an application.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Well somebody did. 

           Andy is still very confused.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Why don’t you have a seat? Should 
                        be just a few minutes.

           Andy sits. He knows there’s only one person who could have 
           done this. 

           While he waits, Andy looks around the room. There’s all sorts 
           of posters and things advertising the school -- “Make a New 
           Start,” and “Seize the Future.” Things that have been on 
           Andy’s mind. As he’s thinking about these things: 
                                 WOMAN
                        Mr. Mason?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh, yes ma’am, that’s me.

                                 WOMAN (MS. DEWALT)
                        I’m Alice DeWalt. Would you follow 
                        me please?

           Ms. DeWalt is an ultra-serious woman in her 50s. Andy 
           follows.

                        Oh. Right. Yeah. Well, um, it... 
                        looks nice. You seem very nice. 

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        And what is it you plan to study?

                        You know... Stuff. Classes.... That 
                        sort of thing. 

           Ms. Dewalt cocks her head at Andy. Is this guy for real?

                                 ANDY
                        I’m blowing it, aren’t I? Look, 
                        ma’am, can I be totally honest with 
                        you? Truth is, I don’t know what 
                        I’m doing.

                        Yeah, see... Hi. Can I stop you 
                        there? I didn’t actually send that. 
                        I have no idea what it says.
                                 MS. DEWALT
                        Do you want to go to school here?

                        Honestly, it never crossed my mind 
                        before today. But now... shit yeah. 
                        I really would.

                        Wait, there’s someone else too. A 
                        girl... 
                            (beat)
                        She’s... no, nevermind.

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        Please, continue. Who is she?

                                 ANDY
                        She’s just this really interesting 
                        girl. She’s an athlete, a genius, 
                        she likes good music, not to 
                        mention, she’s smoking hot. But 
                        then, on the other hand, she did 
                        some terrible things to me.

                        She made me, like, her love slave, 
                        which was not cool, and I had to go 
                        with her wherever she wanted, no 
                        matter how weird or physically 
                        threatening the situation, and 
                        believe me, there were some 
                        situations. Then I lost my job. And 
                        of course all of that was cause she 
                        made me think I raped her, which I 
                        totally didn’t, by the way...

                                 MS. DEWALT
                            (shocked)

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not a rapist.

                                 MS. DEWALT
                            (so confused)
                        How is this someone you admire?

                                 ANDY
                        Well... Cause... she opened my 
                        eyes. I thought she ruined my life -
                        - I didn’t have a life. Six months 
                        ago, I was going nowhere. Today, 
                        I’m sitting here with you. Six 
                        monthts ago I was banging chicks in 
                        the bathroom at Shoney’s...look at 
                        me now! I’m like half a gay. I 
                        started Tivo-ing Ellen. I asked 
                        some girl last week to brunch. 
                        Brunch! I’ve basically gone from 
                        being Samantha to Carrie overnight. 
                        And the weird thing is, I like me 
                        this way. Granted, I’m not having 
                        half as much fun but it’s better. 
                        I’m better. And it’s thanks to her.

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        Can I ask... what happened to this 
                        girl?

                                 ANDY
                        I don’t know. We don’t really talk. 
                        It was... our timing was off. 
                        That’s what it was. If I was born 
                        later, maybe, or she was born 
                        earlier... if we met, say, five 
                        years in the future.... then 
                        maybe... But we didn’t. 
                            (beat)
                        And that’s life. Just gotta move 
                        on. It’s better this way. Yeah. 
                        Definitely better.
           Andy is deep in thought about Braden. Something isn’t sitting 
           right at all. 

                                 MS. DEWALT
                            (back to the interview)
                        Andy, are you ok?

                                 ANDY
                            (standing up)
                        I should tell her that, shouldn’t 
                        I?

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        You mean... now? We’re not quite 
                        finished --

                                 ANDY
                        I was mad and I said some things. 
                        She’s gonna leave thinking I...  
                        she’s gonna leave.
                            (beat)
                        I should go.

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        But... what about your future? 

                                 ANDY
                        Exactly. 

           Andy is halfway out the door when he hears:

                                 MS. DEWALT
                        Andy...
                            (he turns)
                        Let me know how it goes.

           EXT BRADEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Andy rushes up to the door and rings the bell. Harold 
           answers. 

                                 HAROLD
                        You’ve got a lot of nerve coming 
                        here.

                                 ANDY
                        Please sir, just... two minutes... 

                                 HAROLD
                        What I tell you about hurting that 
                        girl?

                                 ANDY
                        You’re right. And I’m sorry. But I 
                        got hurt too, you know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (cont'd)
                        She took advantage of me, she lied, 
                        she toyed with my emotions...

                                 HAROLD
                        So you did nothing wrong, is that 
                        it?

                                 ANDY
                        No, actually... I did everything 
                        wrong. And then I met your 
                        daughter. 

           Harold softens.

                                 HAROLD
                        I’m sorry kid, she’s gone.

                                 ANDY
                        What do you mean, “gone?”

                                 HAROLD
                        She left for school today. 
                        California. 
                            (getting emotional)
                        My little girl. 

                                 ANDY
                        She left... today!?

                                 HAROLD
                        Dropped her off just now.

                                 ANDY
                        You’ve gotta be...! What time is 
                        her flight?

                                 HAROLD
                        3:45.

           Andy looks at his watch. It’s 1pm.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh. 

           Andy was expecting to have to rush to the airport like in the 
           movies. He’s got loads of time. 

                                 ANDY
                        No problem. 

           INT ANDY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Andy drives. Whistling. Not in a rush.

           EXT HIGHWAY - SAME

           We see the car drive onto the highway.
                                 ANDY
                        Long as there’s no traffic... 

           There’s no traffic.

                                 ANDY
                        Yes! Plenty of time.

           INT ANDY’S CAR - LATER

                                 ANDY
                        Making tracks. Uh-huh. This is 
                        me... definitely not rushing to the 
                        airport. 

           “In Your Eyes” comes on the radio. It takes Andy a second to 
           notice, but when he does:

                                 ANDY
                            (changing stations)
                        You shut your mouth, Peter Gabriel.

           EXT AIRPORT - SAME

           Now Andy has to deal with typical airport terminal traffic. 
           Cars stopping in the middle of the street to let people off 
           etc. 

                                 ANDY
                        That’s fine, that’s to be expected. 
                        Shouldn’t take an hour from here to 
                        Terminal 6.

           He’s not yet at Terminal 1. Andy looks at the clock.

                                 ANDY
                        Not worried.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MINUTES LATER.

           He hasn’t moved an inch.

                                 ANDY
                        Whatever. It’s ok.

           Same. Andy sighs. Starts drumming on the steering wheel. At 
           which point there’s a crack of thunder.

                                 ANDY
                            (looks up; that’s weird)
                        Huh.

                                                                CUT TO:
           MINUTES LATER.

           Still the same. Andy looks at his watch. Starting to get a 
           little antsy. 

                                 ANDY
                        I am parking this car. No way I’m 
                        just leaving it. Don’t even pull 
                        that shit.

           Andy cranes his neck. Sees a short-term parking structure to 
           the side. It’s far from where he needs to be but it’ll do. 
           Andy cuts off some cars to the left as he pulls into the 
           structure.

           EXT TERMINAL 1 PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER

           Andy on foot. He comes out of the structure -- into the 
           pouring rain. 

                                 ANDY
                            (disbelief)
                        Come on... seriously?

           Andy starts to walk towards Terminal 6. Andy is getting 
           soaked.

                                 ANDY
                        Dammit!

           INT TERMINAL 6 - CONTINUOUS

           A soaked Andy dashes up to the Departures Monitor. Looks for 
           Braden’s flight. Finds it. Not yet boarding. No problem. 

                                 ANDY
                            (looks at watch)
                        45 minutes. Easy.

           Andy approaches the ticket counter. The TICKET AGENT smiles 
           at him.

                                 ANDY
                        I need to get to Gate 41. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        I’m sorry sir, no one’s allowed 
                        past --

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah yeah, I know, I just... 
                        there’s a... this is so nuts. I 
                        need to see a girl whose plane’s 
                        about to leave. Is there any 
                        way...?
                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Not without a ticket.

                                 ANDY
                        Fine. I’ll buy a ticket then. What 
                        leaves from Gate 42?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        That’s... Flight 87 to Atlanta.

                                 ANDY
                        Awesome. Wait, let me guess... sold 
                        out, right?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Oh no. There’s plenty of seats. 

           Good. Back to reality. Andy is pleased.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        That’ll be 844 dollars. 

           Basically Andy’s life savings. He hesitates but then 
           realizes, shit, what choice does he have?

           INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ticket in hand, Andy rides up the escalator to the security 
           checkpoint. He looks at his watch and decides to walk a 
           little faster up the escalator (but he’s certainly not gonna 
           run.)

           There’s no line at all for the security checkpoint. Andy 
           relaxes. He’ll make it for sure now.

                                 ANDY
                        Phew. 

           Andy gives his ticket to the SECURITY AGENT.

                        has changed. You’re leaving from 
                        Terminal 3 now. 

                                 ANDY
                        No! I can’t! I gotta go through 
                        there. 
                                 SECURITY
                        Not without a ticket. 

           Fuck! Andy looks at his watch. There’s still 20 minutes.

           INT TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Andy dashes to the same ticket counter as before, sees the 
           same female Ticket Agent. He’s gonna have to buy another 
           ticket, spend more money. And the clock is ticking.

           INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Now Andy bounds up the escalator at a much faster clip (but 
           he’s still not running!) He gets to the same security 
           checkpoint which is now of course completely packed. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh for fuck’s sake!

           If the traffic outside was bad, this is a nightmare. Andy 
           tries to push through, cutting everyone ahead of him.

                                 ANDY
                        Excuse me... I’m so sorry... 

           The CROWD is not happy.

                                 CROWD
                        Back of the line! / We want to get 
                        home too!

                                 ANDY
                        Please, I really gotta get through. 

           Crowd still refuses to budge for him.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m going after a girl! Don’t you 
                        people go to the movies?!

                                 CROWD
                            (beat)
                        Fuck off!/ Wait your turn!

                                 VOICE
                        Andy?

           Andy looks to the front of the line and sees: THE GIRL HE 
           SLEPT WITH ON PAGE ONE! Andy runs up to her.

                                 ANDY
                        Tiff... No. That is not your name. 
                        I know your name. I know it...
                            (beat)
                        It’s Tracy! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (cont'd)
                        Tracy, it’s so good to see you! 
                        Please, you’ve gotta help me. I’ll 
                        do anything.

                                 TRACY
                            (thinks)
                        You really going after a girl? 

                                 ANDY
                        I really am.

           She sees that he’s sincere. Lets him in. The Crowd boos but 
           he doesn’t care. He’s through. 

           At the checkpoint Andy tries to pass but he’s told to take 
           off his shoes. He throws them on the belt and sprints to the 
           other side. And then he waits.

                                 ANDY
                        C’mon, c’mon!

           Andy extends his arms to grab his shoes as soon as they 
           appear from the rubber flaps. His shoes poke out for a second 
           but then the belt goes back the other way. 

                                 ANDY
                        Really? That’s how it’s gonna be?

           Back and forth they go on the belt a few more times. Andy’s 
           frustration mounts. He looks at the GERIATRIC HOMELAND 
           SECURITY AGENT who is studying the monitor.

                                 ANDY
                        They’re just shoes!

           The Agent continues to look at the X-Ray. Andy just sighs, 
           shakes his head, turns towards the gates...

                                 ANDY
                        Fuck it.

           ...and SPRINTS!

           INT AIRPORT GATES - MOMENTS LATER

           And so it’s come to this: Andy is RUNNING through the 
           airport! 

                                 ANDY
                        Please don’t taser me!

           INT GATE 41 - MOMENTS LATER

           Andy arrives just in time to see the remaining passengers 
           boarding.
                                 ANDY
                        No!

           Out of breath, soaking wet, shoeless, Andy confronts the 
           people in line to see if any of them are Braden. They are 
           clearly scared of Andy.

                                 ANDY
                            (yelling)
                        Braden!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Andy?

           He turns. Yup. There she is. In line to board.

                                 ANDY
                        I made it!

                                 BRADEN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ANDY
                        I’ve come to see you.

                                 BRADEN
                        Wait a second. Were you just 
                        running through the airport?

                                 ANDY
                        It’s been... a very weird day.

           The final boarding call is announced on the speaker.

                                 BRADEN
                        That’s me. 

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

                                 BRADEN
                        I think I gotta go.

                                 ANDY
                        You do, Braden. You have to go. And 
                        I’m not here to stop you. I just... 
                        I want you to know some things 
                        before you do. Ok? I want you to 
                        know...

           Andy is not good with the articulating. He takes a breath and 
           just lets it fly.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re amazing. You’re an amazing 
                        person. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (cont'd)
                        The rest of your life is gonna be 
                        so awesome and, whether I’m in it 
                        or not, I am psyched for you. I 
                        want you to know that. 

           Braden is touched.

                                 ANDY
                        I want you to know... you changed 
                        me. Obviously I’m not there yet but 
                        I’m getting there. And one day, if 
                        I don’t mess it up, I’m gonna be 
                        someone who deserves someone like 
                        you. That’s my goal.
                            (beat)
                        I also want you to know that I... 
                        I’ve been doing some thinking and 
                        I... 
                            (deep breath)
                        OK, yeah, maybe, probably, I think 
                        most likely... I love you... I do. 
                        But whatever. That’s not important. 
                        What’s important is that... this 
                        love shit is complicated. It’s not 
                        enough to just meet the right 
                        person. You gotta meet them at the 
                        right time as well. And we didn’t. 
                        And that’s not gonna change. 
                            (now Andy starts to tear)
                        But the thing is, Braden, meeting 
                        the right person at the wrong time, 
                        well, that’s still better than 
                        never meeting them at all. So I’ve 
                        come here... more than anything 
                        else... just to say thank you. 
                        That’s it. Thank you for 
                        everything. 
                            (beat)
                        You’re the best mistake I ever 
                        made. 

           Braden laughs as she wipes away the tears. They hug. Andy 
           holds it an extra beat.

                                 BRADEN
                        Thank you, Andy.

                            (letting go)
                        Now... go... conquer, do all those 
                        things you were born to do. And 
                        then, in the future, who knows, you 
                        know, anything can happen, we --

           Before he can finish Braden steps forward and kisses him on 
           the cheek. It’s the most passionate cheek kiss ever. 
           Andy stops talking. Closes his eyes. And then it’s over. Time 
           to move on. She picks up her bag.

                                 BRADEN
                        Call me sometime?

                                 ANDY
                        I will.

                                 BRADEN
                        I’ll be back at Christmas. Maybe we 
                        could --

                                 ANDY
                        May be.

           They look at each other one more time. And then Braden turns 
           to board the plane. Andy watches her walk down the jetway. 
           She doesn’t turn around. He was probably hoping she would but 
           it’s cool. He smiles to himself. Looks down. Looks around. 

           INT JETWAY - SAME

           On Braden as she walks towards the future.

           EXT AIRPORT - LATER

           Andy comes out. He feels pretty good about the whole thing. 
           And about what’s next, whatever it may be.

           INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER

           At the same time, Braden makes her way to her seat, wiping 
           the tears from her eyes. She sits. A ball of emotions.

                                 VOICE
                        Excuse me, Miss?

           She looks up. The Voice belongs to a GUY across the aisle. A 
           really cute guy around Braden’s age. 

                                 CUTE GUY
                        You ok?

           Braden’s face brightens. And it’s on this beat that we:
