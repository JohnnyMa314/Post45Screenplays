           EXT. LOS ANGELES, 405 FREEWAY - DAY

           A CAR RADIO PLAYS as we open on a typical Southern California 
           day: sunshine, big blue sky and bumper-to-bumper, beyond-
           explanation-because-it’s-not-even-rush-hour traffic.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.) 
                        Sometimes a marriage is like a car in 
                        traffic.  You can’t move forward.  You 
                        can’t move back.  You start to wonder 
                        what would happen if you just left... 

           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - DAY  

           CLOSE ON a woman’s hand turning off the ignition.  The radio 
           stops.  The digital clock, which reads 3:46pm, goes black.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        ...Just turned off the engine, opened the 
                        door and got out.  Let the damn car be 
                        someone else’s problem for a while.  

           EXT. 405 SOUTH - DAY

           KATIE CARR, 38, beautiful (though not told so often enough), 
           emerges in SLO-MO like a modern-day messiah and walks 
           gracefully between cars and onto the shoulder of the 405.  
           HEADS TURN to watch her as she passes.  Her dress and hair 
           blow in the wind.  She looks content and enviably free.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        You’d have new problems, sure, like how 
                        to get home from El Segundo, where home 
                        is, what home is.  These are the kinds of 
                        thoughts that keep you in the car... in 
                        the marriage.  Usually.

           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - DAY

           ANGLE ON Katie, still in her car.  She never left.  The radio 
           is still playing.  The clock still reads 3:46.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) 
                        I am on the 405 when I tell my husband I 
                        don’t want to be married to him anymore. 

           Katie looks toward the passenger seat where we might hope to 
           see her husband, but in fact, she’s on her cell phone.

                                 KATIE (CONT'D)
                         (out loud)
                        How is this out of the blue?  You mean 
                        because we’ve been so blissfully happy?
           As she listens to his response, her V.O. continues:

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I only called to remind him to write a 
                        note for Molly’s teacher.  The other part 
                        just sort of... slipped out.  

           A CAR HONKS behind Katie and startles her.  She looks in her 
           rearview, annoyed, and glimpses her backseat: her son’s 
           Legos, her daughter’s books, juice boxes, guilt.  She pulls 
           forward one car length and is stuck in traffic again.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Even though I am, apparently, the kind of 
                        person who tells her husband she doesn’t 
                        want to be married anymore, I didn’t 
                        think I was the kind to say so in a 
                        traffic jam, on a cell phone...  

           INT. SAN DIEGO HOTEL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie, now unable to sleep because of what she seems to have 
           put in motion, lies in bed, bare shoulders exposed, in the 
           kind of nice but generic hotel where conventions are held.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        But for most people, marriage-ending 
                        conversations happen only once, if at 
                        all.  If you choose to conduct yours on a 
                        cell phone on the 405, you can’t really 
                        claim that’s unrepresentative, just as 
                        John Wilkes Booth couldn’t claim that 
                        shooting presidents wasn’t like him at 
                        all.  Sometimes, you have to be judged by 
                        your one-offs.

           She pulls the covers up around her, which puts her eye-level 
           with her wedding ring.   

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I try to remember how we got from Molly’s 
                        note to the end of a marriage in three 
                        minutes.

           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - DAY

           Katie is on her cell phone as before, but the clock on her 
           dash shows it’s three minutes earlier: 3:43pm.

                                 KATIE
                        Hi.
           INT. CARR KITCHEN - SAME TIME (INTERCUT)

           A typical day in the Carr household in Santa Monica.  DAVID 
           CARR, 41, clearly handsome in his prime, now with a little 
           paunch, dishevelled, unshaven, in sweats and a t-shirt, is 
           supporting his chronic bad back and surveying the contents of 
           a plastic trick-or-treating pumpkin.  (It’s one of two kept 
           on top of the frig, the last of the kids’ Halloween candy.)

                                 DAVID
                        Hey.  How’s it going?

                                 KATIE
                        Fine.  Kids all right?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  Molly’s watching TV.  Tom’s over 
                        at Blake’s.

                                 KATIE
                        I just called to say you have to write a 
                        note for Molly to take to school 
                        tomorrow.  About the dermatologist’s?

           A long pause.  She waits for him to speak.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        See?  It can’t be done.  You can’t get 
                        there from here.  But somehow we did.  

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Forget it.

                                 KATIE
                        How can I forget what I never heard?

                                 DAVID
                        What you said.  About just calling to 
                        remind me about Molly’s note.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 DAVID
                        It might be nice, especially when you’re 
                        off to San Diego for two days, if you’d, 
                        you know, call for some other reason.  To 
                        say hello.  To see how your husband and 
                        kids are.
                                 KATIE
                        That was the first thing I asked: “How 
                        are the kids?”

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  Not “How are you?”

           Katie looks out of her car window, weary of this.  Her view 
           is of car dealerships and one of those flailing, long-armed 
           balloon people, which pretty much mirrors her exasperation.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        You don’t have conversations like this 
                        when things are going well.  You have 
                        them after years of perfecting the sport 
                        of spousal button pushing.  

                                 DAVID
                        Do you care how I am?

                                 KATIE
                        I can hear how you are: upset, probably 
                        due to your back, which you refuse to do 
                        anything about, or maybe something new.

                                 DAVID
                        What makes you think I’m upset?

                                 KATIE
                        You’re the definition of upset.  You make 
                        your living being upset.

           INT. DAVID’S HOME OFFICE/RADIO STUDIO - DAWN

           A very rudimentary home radio studio.  David, in t-shirt, 
           boxers and headphones, lies on the floor (his solution to his 
           bad back problem) and rants into a mic.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        This is true, partly.  Every morning, at 
                        an ungodly early hour, David does a radio 
                        segment from our house called The 
                        Angriest Man in Santa Monica.  

                                 DAVID
                        It’s fall here in Southern California... 
                        which means three leaves fell, and twenty 
                        illegal lawn guys were dispatched from 
                        the Home Depot parking lot to pick ‘em up 
                        and stick ‘em in Hefty bags before the 
                        dirty little secret got out that this 
                        strip mall of a city had something 
                        resembling a season!  
           INT. CARR KITCHEN - DAY

           David is now eating a “fun-size” candy bar.  He seems to 
           enjoy this verbal sparring.  Katie, not so much.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m surprised you noticed since you never 
                        bother to fucking tune in.

                                 KATIE
                         (re: his language)
                        Where’s Molly?

                                 DAVID
                        Watching TV in the other room.  
                         (with gusto, just to annoy her)
                        Fuck fuck fuck shit.

                                 KATIE
                        Very mature.  And I don’t tune in because 
                        your rants only air in New York. 

                                 DAVID
                        You can download the podcasts, and FYI, 
                        my “editorials” are ironic.

                                 KATIE
                        Ah.  Well, please excuse the residents of 
                        329 Euclid Street if the humor is lost on 
                        us.  We wake up to the angriest man in 
                        Santa Monica every day of our lives.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s the point of all this?

                                 KATIE
                         (honestly not sure)
                        I don’t know.  You got mad I didn’t ask 
                        how you were.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 KATIE
                        How are you.

                                 DAVID
                        Go to hell.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m so tired of this, David.
                                 DAVID
                        Of what?

                                 KATIE
                        This.  Fighting all the time.  The 
                        silences.  Do you really want to live the 
                        rest of your life like this?

                                 DAVID
                        I‘d rather be starting shortstop for the 
                        New York Yankees, but--  Why?  Are you 
                        suggesting an alternative?

                                 KATIE
                        I suppose I am.

                                 DAVID
                        Care to tell me what it is?

                                 KATIE
                        You know what it is.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course I do, but I want you to be the 
                        first one to say it.

                                 KATIE
                         (difficult to say aloud)
                        Do you want a divorce?

                                 DAVID
                        I want it on record that I wasn’t the one 
                        who asked.  

                                 KATIE
                        Fine.

                                 DAVID
                        You, not me.

                                 KATIE
                        David, I’m trying to talk about a sad, 
                        grown-up thing and you’re keeping score?

                                 DAVID
                        So I can tell everyone you asked for a 
                        divorce out of the blue.

                                 KATIE
                        How is this out of the blue?  You mean, 
                        because we’ve been so blissfully happy?

           SFX: DING! like an egg timer.  The car clock reads 3:46.
                                 STEPHEN (V.O.)
                        Everything okay there?

           INT. SAN DIEGO HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           REVEAL that Katie has been asked this question by the very 
           handsome man in bed next to her, STEPHEN, 38.  He is 
           muscular, clean-cut, groggy and naked.

                                 KATIE
                        What?  Oh, yeah.  Just a little restless.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Right.  I guess I have to explain him as 
                        well.  His name is Stephen... something.  

                                 KATIE (CONT'D)
                         (a beat)
                        I’m gonna get some ice.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hurry back.

           Stephen kisses her neck.  Katie, frozen in place, waits for 
           him to finish kissing her, then gets up.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Gently closing the door behind her, Katie emerges in a hotel 
           robe carrying the ice bucket along with her purse, heels and 
           dress from earlier, and her rolling bag.  

                                 KATIE
                         (to herself)
                        Shit.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This is not looking good for me, I know. 

           She tosses the ice bucket, but is coming undone, literally, 
           and has to hold her robe closed as she hurries down the hall.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But you have to understand, in ten years 
                        of marriage -- many of which, not so 
                        happy -- I never once cheated on David.  
                        I mean... until now.  

           Finally at the elevator, Katie presses the button, then 
           catches her reflection in the doors.  She’s a mess.
                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like I wanted to end my marriage 
                        because there was someone else.  I wanted 
                        to end my marriage, and I told my husband 
                        that, and then I met someone else. 

           Katie presses the button again repeatedly.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So it’s almost like we were separated.  
                        Or, at least, in the process of 
                        separating.  Therefore, is it cheating?
                         (a beat, deflated)
                        Yes.  Probably. 

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                         (to herself, echoing David)
                        Fuck fuck fuck shit.

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           As the elevator doors close she pulls on her underwear, then:

                                 KATIE
                         (to herself)
                        Bra... bra...  I left my bra with Stephen 
                        something.  Pull it together, Katie.

           She shimmies out of her robe; throws her dress over her head, 
           but it’s sleeveless and her arm is where her head should be.  

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                         (to herself, re: dress)
                        This can’t be right.

           The doors open, exposing her to the late-night DESK CLERK, 
           who tries to look away, but she’s too much of a train wreck. 

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Katie fishes around in her purse, finally finds her keys. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I definitely didn’t go to that medical 
                        convention with any intention of meeting 
                        someone.  

           EXT. 405 NORTH - PRE-DAWN

           Katie’s Prius zooms past, heading back to Los Angeles.  
           There’s no traffic because it’s 4:30am.  
           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - CONTINUOUS 

           She’s now talking to herself as one might when one is 
           unraveling, rationalizing and rehearsing one’s lame defense. 

                                 KATIE
                        This is completely unlike me.  I’m a good 
                        person.  I’m a doctor!  I just had one 
                        too many mojitos at the welcome cocktail 
                        hour, and I was vulnerable since my 
                        marriage was breaking up.

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Katie pulls up in front of her modest but nice two-story 
           house in the less pretentious part of Santa Monica.  The 
           lights are out except in David’s home/office.

                                 KATIE 
                        Or rather, since I was breaking up my 
                        marriage.

           She puts the car in park and just sits there a moment.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Yup.  Not looking good for me.

           She looks down, notices she’s still wearing her name tag: 
           “Dr. Katie Carr, Los Angeles People’s Community Clinic.”  She 
           quickly takes it off.

           INT. DAVID’S HOME OFFICE/RADIO STUDIO - MINUTES LATER  

           David is doing his morning rant, lying on his back.   

                                 DAVID
                        This is a town where keeping up with the 
                        Jones’ means your kids have a therapist, 
                        your pet has a psychic, and your wife has 
                        a feng shui expert... 

           INT. HALLWAY/MOLLY’S ROOM - SAME TIME  

           Katie (holding her heels in her hand so as not to wake the 
           children) can hear David downstairs as she quietly opens a 
           door and looks in on her angelic, sleeping 8-year-old, MOLLY.  
           She’s suddenly very aware of what she stands to disrupt -- 
           this home and family, the security of her children. 

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        I’d never heard of feng shui when I lived 
                        in New York.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure some of you are into that, just 
                        like some of you are into three-ways.  My 
                        point is, I didn’t have to hear about it.

           As David continues, we follow Katie into another bedroom...

           INT. TOM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           ...where her adorable 6-year-old son, TOM, sleeps.  Katie is 
           almost overcome with worry now, and curls up next to him, 
           gently kissing the back of his head.  She lies there, holding 
           her son tightly, listening to her husband:

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        I’d like to hear about three-ways, by the 
                        way.  The phone lines are open.  I would 
                        not like to hear from one more Angeleno, 
                        unsolicited, that I might need to 
                        rearrange my living room to unblock the 
                        chi.  Here’s an idea.  Why don’t you get 
                        out?  I think you’re blocking the chi!  

           Katie cracks the tiniest of smiles at this.  Every so often 
           she still finds David amusing, although she’s reluctant to 
           show it.  And now she feels like she already misses him, too.

                                 DAVID (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m David Carr, and you’ve been listening 
                        to the Angriest Man in Santa Monica.

           Katie closes her eyes...

           INT. TOM’S ROOM - AN HOUR OR SO LATER

           ...and wakes to see David standing over her, arms folded.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought you were gone until Wednesday.  
                        And there was something else... what was 
                        it?  What... oh, yeah.  You wanted to 
                        leave me.

                                 KATIE
                         (covering Tom’s ears)
                        Can we please--

           Tom stirs, rubbing his eyes, then opening them.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Morning, sweetie.

                                 TOM
                        Why are you here?
                                 KATIE
                        I live here.

                                 TOM
                        But you went to a convent.

                                 MOLLY
                         (correcting him)
                        Convention.

           Molly, in her pajamas, enters and hugs her dad’s leg.  

                                 KATIE 
                        And I missed you guys too much.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, people.  Time to get dressed for 
                        school.  

                                 KATIE
                        Especially if anybody wants pancakes...

                                 MOLLY/TOM
                        Yay!/I want chocolate chips in mine!

           The kids race off to get dressed.  David looks at Katie.

                                 DAVID
                        Last week I was giving them too much 
                        sugar, now you’re making pancake cookies?  
                        You don’t care what happens to any of us 
                        anymore, do you?  

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David follows Katie downstairs.

                                 KATIE
                        Are you going to be glib about this?

                                 DAVID
                        I haven’t decided how I’m going to be.  
                        It’s still kinda new.

           Katie notices David supporting his bad back.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m calling Dan Silverman today.

                                 DAVID
                        Who’s that?  Your lawyer?
                                 KATIE
                        The osteopath you refuse to see.

                                 DAVID
                        Aw.  You do still care.

                                 KATIE
                         (quietly because of the kids)
                        David, I’m sorry.  This is so upsetting 
                        to even contemplate, and that was 
                        definitely not the way to have that 
                        discussion, and this isn’t either, but...
                         (trying to keep her resolve)
                        It’s a discussion we need to have.  At 
                        some point.  I’m not proud of how I said 
                        what I said, but--

                                 DAVID
                         (torturing her a little)
                        What did you say again?   

                                 KATIE
                         (aware he’s torturing her)
                        That I wanted a divorce.

                                 DAVID
                        Gosh.  That’s not a very nice thing for a 
                        wife to say to her husband.

                                 KATIE
                        David, please don’t do this.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 KATIE
                        Talk to me.  Like a person.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.  You want a divorce.  I don’t.  So 
                        unless you can prove that I’ve been cruel 
                        or neglectful, or that I’ve been sleeping 
                        with someone else, you should be the one 
                        to move out.  And then, after five years 
                        of living on your own, you can have your 
                        divorce. 
                         (off her look)
                        I’d get going if I were you.  Five years 
                        is a long time, don’t want to put it off.

           Katie considers whether to go on; decides she should try.
                                 KATIE
                        What about if I... you know.

                                 DAVID
                        No, I don’t know.

                                 KATIE
                        Adultery.

                                 DAVID
                        You?  Goodie Two Shoes? 
                         (laughs)
                        First, you’ll have to find someone who 
                        wants to adulter you, then you’ll have to 
                        stop being Katie Carr, M.D., mother of 
                        two, and adulter him back.  And even then 
                        it wouldn’t matter, because I still 
                        wouldn’t divorce you.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I am torn between being relieved and 
                        insulted.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        So you’re just going to ignore what I 
                        said yesterday?

                                 DAVID
                        Yep.  Unless it’s advantageous to bring 
                        up in an argument, which I imagine it 
                        will be.  Thank you for that.  

           David smiles.  Katie, not really surprised by any of this,  
           continues into the kitchen, David behind her.   

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a mess, dirty dishes from last night, the recycling in 
           with the regular trash.  Katie starts to say something then 
           thinks better of it, moves some bottles into the proper 
           receptacle, then starts gathering ingredients for pancakes. 
           David takes an INVITATION off the counter.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, given that you want to divorce me, 
                        do I still have to go to this dinner?

           ANGLE ON the invitation, which says: “Los Angeles Woman 
           Magazine honors our Woman of the Year, Dr. Katie Carr.”  
           Katie stops what she’s doing.  She looks sick.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                         (genuinely amused)
                        What?  You forgot about the dinner?

           She doesn’t say anything.  She did forget.  Katie cracks an 
           egg into a bowl, and the shell breaks into tiny pieces.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll still go with you.  I 
                        want to give a rebuttal.

           She looks at him.  Is he actually enjoying this?  David takes 
           a swig of milk directly from the carton.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You know what else?  Since you’re home on 
                        a week day, you can finally take the kids 
                        to school.

           He grins and exits.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - LATER THAT MORNING

           Katie’s Prius passes ST. STEPHEN’S CHURCH, which looms a 
           little large as Katie makes this confession.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I’m a working mother, and like all 
                        working mothers, I complain about the 
                        price I have to pay, the things I’m 
                        missing, the everyday pleasures, like 
                        taking my children to school...    

           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - SAME TIME  

           In the back seat: utter chaos.  Molly and Tom are fighting. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Tom farted!

                                 TOM
                        Because Molly punched me!

                                 KATIE
                         (into the rearview mirror)
                        No farting, no punching, no YELLING!!! 

           Katie’s miserable, just as David knew she would be.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES PEOPLE’S COMMUNITY CLINIC - DAY

           This is where Katie works: a welcoming community clinic 
           where, according to signs in English, Spanish and Russian,  
           “No patient is turned away.” 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The truth is, I like being at work.  I 
                        feel appreciated here.  

           We follow a PATIENT through the doors and into... 

           INT. LOS ANGELES PEOPLE’S COMMUNITY CLINIC - DAY

           ...a family-friendly waiting room, a melting pot, mostly 
           IMMIGRANTS and WORKING POOR, many with CHILDREN in tow, 
           waiting patiently for attention.   

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I rarely feel appreciated at home, 
                        especially by David.  He’s so critical.  
                        I’m always doing something wrong.  Of 
                        course, I have done something wrong now, 
                        I’m a liar and a cheater.  But here, I’m 
                        a doctor. 

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Katie, in her doctor’s coat, has just removed a leg cast for 
           MR. KATSEL, a non-English speaking middle-aged Russian man. 

                                 KATIE
                         (to Mr. Katsel)
                        Good as new.

           The nurse, Katie’s friend BECCA MARTIN, 35 and single but 
           tirelessly looking, is cleaning Mr. Katsel’s leg.

                                 BECCA
                         (to Katie)
                        Did you see America’s Next Top Model last 
                        night?

                                 KATIE
                         (wishing that’s all she did)
                        No.  I was at that medical convention, 
                        but I decided not to stay...
                         (checking movement in his foot)
                        Want to put some weight on it, Mr. 
                        Katsel?  Stand?

           He doesn’t understand, so Katie helps him to his feet.  He 
           leans on her as they walk.  He looks pleased.
                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        That should feel better, huh?

                                 MR. KATSEL
                        Yes.  Spasiba.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re welcome.  But no more ladders for 
                        a while, okay?  
                         (pantomimes “no” and “ladder”)
                        No more ladders?

           He gets it, nods and laughs.   

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                         (patting him on the back)
                        Okay.  Do svidaniya.

                                 MR. KATSEL
                         (happy she’s using Russian)
                        Very good!  Do svidaniya!

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Katie writes in Mr. Katsel’s chart as she and Becca walk down 
           the hall.  Katie, normally a good listener, is too full of 
           guilt to follow Becca’s story today.

                                 BECCA
                        It was a good episode.  I watched it with 
                        this guy I met online, and he said I was 
                        hot enough to be on the show.  That’s 
                        total bullshit, but I love that he said 
                        it.  Unfortunately, he’s four-foot-nine. 

           DAWN, the African-American receptionist, passes them.

                                 DAWN
                         (to Katie)
                        Couldn’t stay away, huh? 

           Katie nods, as if guilty as charged.  She’s clearly well-
           respected and well-liked.

                                 BECCA
                        I thought I’d never do online dating, but 
                        everyone does it.  And everyone hates it.  
                        Except the handful of couples who met 
                        online, and even those people are 
                        reluctant to admit that’s how they met.

                        But because of them, the rest of us who 
                        are single and over 30 have to go through 
                        the motions, or “e-motions” as it were, 
                        just to prove to our parents and friends 
                        and the universe that we’re trying 
                        everything possible to meet someone!  
                        Katie, be so glad you’re married. 

                                 KATIE
                         (finally blurts out)
                        Becca, I met a man... a doctor... at that 
                        medical convention, and--

                                 BECCA
                        You gave him my number?

                                 KATIE
                        What?  No.  

                                 BECCA
                        But you thought of me?

                                 KATIE
                        No.  I--

                                 BECCA
                        What about your brother?  He’s single, 
                        right?  

                                 KATIE
                        My brother is a semi-employed depressive.

                                 BECCA
                        Is that a genetic thing, the depression?  
                        Because if so, that would be a risk.  Not 
                        for a while though.  You don’t see many 
                        depressed kids.  It’s more of a late-
                        onset deal.  And I’m so old already, I 
                        won’t be around when our kids become 
                        depressed adults.  So I’m game if he is.  

                                 KATIE
                        To meet for coffee or have his children?

                                 BECCA
                        Either.   

           EXT. SELF-STORAGE FACILITY - LATER THAT DAY

           A mechanical gate opens painfully slowly as Katie, who just 
           punched in her security code, waits to drive onto the lot.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I remember thinking I had problems when I 
                        was single -- and it can be awful and 
                        lonely, I know -- but what are the 
                        stakes?  If it doesn’t work out, you cry 
                        in your ceasar salad and move on.

           INT. SELF-STORAGE FACILITY - MINUTES LATER

           Katie walks down a long hall of storage units under motion-
           sensitive florescent LIGHTS that FLICKER ON as she passes.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        But once you get married -- the gold 
                        ring, literally -- once you have the 
                        kids, the house, the bulk toilet paper... 
                        then where do you go with your problems? 

           INT. SELF-STORAGE UNIT - CONTINUOUS

           As Katie enters, reveal that she has this metal box of a 
           place organized into a little room of her own.  It’s the one 
           place where nobody can find her, where she can escape.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        There’s no room for doubt after you have 
                        a family.  

           She sits at the bench of a 1930s vanity, surrounded by stuff 
           she had before she was married, then stuff she didn’t 
           want/need once she had kids... boxes marked “record albums” 
           “Katie’s travel journals,” “framed photos,” “breakables”.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There’s no room for a lot of things that 
                        you hang onto, then learn to live 
                        without.  Like your personal space.  And 
                        your childish notions of love.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        But then you have these “snapshot” 
                        moments...

           Katie looks in on a sweet scene: David is reading a bedtime 
           story to Molly and Tom, who are in their pajamas snuggled up 
           beside him, laughing at their father’s dramatic reading. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        They don’t give you the whole picture.  
                        That earlier, Tom was in a mood because 
                        he didn’t get to choose the book.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That later, David’s back will get worse 
                        and he’ll spend the evening barking 
                        orders from the floor like an angry area 
                        rug. 

           David makes room for Katie.  When she joins them, Molly leans 
           against her.  They look, for the moment, like a happy family.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But how can you demand more for yourself, 
                        given the havoc it would cause, while 
                        happy moments are possible.  

           INT. SOCIAL HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           A big charity benefit sponsored by Los Angeles Woman magazine 
           and some fancy vodka.  Katie, looking beautiful, greets 
           FRIENDS and COLLEAGUES.  David, looking sharp in his suit, is 
           at her side.  Katie’s stylish friend, AVA, approaches.

                                 AVA
                        Katie!  Congratulations! 

                                 KATIE
                        Thank you, Ava.  You look amazing.  

           Ava kisses both of Katie’s cheeks.  

                                 AVA
                        It’s the herbs.  You have to see my guy 
                        in Chinatown.  

                                 DAVID
                        Your “guy in Chinatown?”

                        Michelle Pfeiffer’s publicist got me in.  
                        How are you, darling?

           Ava kisses both of David’s cheeks.  

                                 DAVID
                        What’s with the kiss-kiss?  You’re from

                         (loving this)
                        Is this all going in your radio show?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not even going in my food diary.

                                 AVA
                        I keep a food diary!
                                 DAVID
                        Of course you do, darling!

                                 AVA
                         (laughs, then)
                        Aren’t you proud of our girl?  L.A. 
                        Woman’s Woman of the Year?

                                 DAVID
                        Eh.

           Ava laughs even harder.  Katie watches her.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        It’s fascinating to realize that other 
                        people still see your spouse the way you 
                        used to see your spouse.

           Becca looks over silent auction items as Katie approaches.

                                 KATIE
                        Hey, Becca--

                                 BECCA
                         (looking at a bidding sheet)
                        Some asshole keeps bidding one dollar 
                        more than me.  

                                 KATIE
                        That’s the charitable spirit.  Anyhow...
                         (embracing her role as cupid)
                        This is my brother, Mark... 

           Reveal Katie is with her brother MARK KELLOGG, 36.  Mark is 
           uncomfortable at these things, doesn’t wear a suit much.

                                 MARK
                         (extending his hand to shake)
                        Mark Kellogg.  Hi.

           Becca looks up at Mark.  Katie smiles encouragingly.  

                                 BECCA
                        You’re the asshole!

                                 MARK
                        Wow.  Usually takes women months to 
                        figure that out.

           Katie, blindsided by this exchange, is unable to stop it.
                                 BECCA
                        Why do you want a walk-on part on Grey’s 
                        Anatomy?

                                 MARK
                        Nice to meet you, too.

                                 BECCA
                        Seriously.  That’s weird for a guy.

                                 MARK
                        I thought it might be fun?  Are you this 
                        agro to all the men you meet, because 
                        maybe that’s why you’re still single.   

                                 BECCA
                        I’m still single because most men are 
                        assholes who call me things like “agro” 
                        after we’ve only known each other two 
                        minutes!

                                 KATIE
                        Okay, hey!  We’re all sitting together, 
                        so... save some hostility for dinner.

           Katie leaves them and runs into David, who is enjoying his 
           second martini.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        That was a total disaster.

                                 DAVID
                        I thought we weren’t talking about our 
                        marriage tonight.

                                 KATIE
                        I introduced Becca to my brother.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?  So they could have what we have?

                                 KATIE
                        I think they do have what we have.

           INT. SOCIAL HOLLYWOOD - BALLROOM - LATER

           The EDITOR of Los Angeles Woman Magazine stands at a podium 
           and presents Katie’s award as everyone watches a SLIDE SHOW 
           of Katie’s accomplishments... pictures of the clinic, smiling 
           patients, Katie and Becca and the rest of the staff... 
                                 EDITOR
                        The Los Angeles People’s Community Clinic 
                        opened its doors five years ago because 
                        Dr. Katie Carr, a successful private 
                        physician at the time, saw a flawed 
                        system that was turning away more people 
                        than it was serving.

           ANGLE ON Katie at her table.  Despite everything happening in 
           her personal life, she is touched by this tribute, and looks 
           around at the people who are there to support her:

           Her parents, FREDA AND BURT KELLOGG, are beaming.

           Becca is happy to be associated with the clinic, and not so 
           happy to be associated with Mark, who’s seated next to her.  

           Ava’s husband RON, a good-looking entertainment lawyer, puts 
           his arm around Ava as they listen, proud of their friend.

           David, exuding boredom, plays with his spun sugar garnish.

           Katie, trying not to let David ruin her night, looks back at 
           the slide show, where she see more pictures of the clinic...

                                 EDITOR (CONT’D)
                        Katie still works at the clinic five days 
                        a week, rarely if ever taking time off.  
                        Not only is she a devoted wife-- 

           ...then a picture of Katie NAKED, Stephen pressing her up 
           against a wall in the San Diego hotel room.  Katie panics and 
           looks around, but nobody else saw it.  It was in her head.  

                                 EDITOR (CONT’D)
                        --and mother, she’s a completely devoted 
                        doctor.  We all talk about trying to be 
                        good, but here is a woman who is good.

           Katie grimaces.  

                                 EDITOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s why all of us at Los Angeles Woman 
                        Magazine are proud to name Dr. Katie Carr 
                        “Woman of the Year!”

           The editor holds up a glass award, which Katie accepts as 
           everyone APPLAUDS.  

                                 KATIE
                         (into the mic)
                        I’m not that good.  Really, it’s just 
                        such a pleasure to do who you want.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATIE (CONT'D)
                         (horrified)
                        I mean what you want!  What you love.  
                        That’s, of course, its own reward.  But 
                        it’s nice to get validation... for 
                        something other than your parking.  
                         (off their laughter)
                        My husband gave me that line.  Anyhow, 
                        thank you.  Thank you so much.

           Everyone LAUGHS and CLAPS and congratulates Katie (especially 
           at her table) as she takes her seat.  David smiles at her.

                                 DAVID
                        It got laughs.

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  Congratulations on your joke.

           She sets her award down, wishing he could be happy for her.

                                 DAVID
                        You have a roomful of people telling you 
                        how great you are.  You don’t need me to 
                        do it.

           Katie just looks at David.  What a sad, weird thing to say.  
           They’re definitely in a cold war.  

           Meanwhile, the EVENT CO-CHAIR, still healing a little from 
           her last face lift, takes the podium.

                                 EVENT CO-CHAIR
                        And now, one last item of business.  The 
                        raffle winner who gets a second honeymoon 
                        at the Four Seasons Hualalai!

                                 BECCA
                         (to Mark)
                        I love how they assume everybody already 
                        had a first honeymoon.

           Mark turns to hear what she said.

                                 FREDA 
                        Markus!  Your tie!

           Mark looks down and sees that his tie is in his sorbet.

                                 MARK
                        See?  This is why I don’t wear ties.

           Freda tries to get the attention of a passing WAITER.
                                 FREDA
                        Can we get a club soda, please?  Sir?  
                         (to Burt)
                        He just ignored me.

                                 BURT  
                        Because he’s not a waiter.  Freda, just-- 

           The “waiter” (he is dressed like one) sits at a nearby table.

                                 FREDA 
                        Our son’s tie is in his sorbet!

                                 MARK
                        While their daughter is being honored.
                        Welcome to my childhood in a nutshell.

           Everyone laughs, especially David, who understands how Mark 
           feels.  Becca softens a little toward Mark.  As Katie wonders 
           whether this is all a compliment or an insult...

                                 EVENT CO-CHAIR
                        And the winner is...  Oh, this is funny.  
                        It’s our honoree’s husband, David!  

           Katie and David look up.  People CLAP and LAUGH.

                                 KATIE
                        No, no, no!  We don’t need a second 
                        honeymoon!

                                 DAVID
                        Speak for yourself!

                                 EVENT CO-CHAIR
                        This woman refuses to take a vacation!

           LAUGHS from the crowd.  David stands to collect his prize.  

                                 KATIE
                         (grabbing David’s hand)
                        No, really.  We can’t accept this.  I’ve 
                        been given enough tonight.  

                                 DAVID
                        You don’t have to go!  
                         (turning to Ava’s husband)
                        Ron?  Hawaii?

                                 RON
                        Mai tais on me!
           Ava, Ron and the crowd LAUGH some more.  Katie finally lets 
           go of David’s hand.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           David, slightly drunk, is sitting on the bed looking through 
           his goodie bag as Katie gets undressed.

                                 DAVID
                         (dumps out goodie bag contents)
                        How is this charity?  Some company buys 
                        your seat at the table, you put on the 
                        monkey suit, have a five-course dinner, 
                        then there’s the auction, which is really 
                        just shopping, and then you go home with 
                        fucking self-bronzer.  

           He starts putting bronzer on his face.  Katie looks at the 
           second honeymoon brochure and gift certificate they won.

                                 KATIE
                        Remember our honeymoon?

                                 DAVID
                        You’re nostalgic now?

           David continues with his bronzing.

                                 KATIE
                        We were backpacking, and I got that bug?

                                 DAVID
                        A bug is putting it mildly.  I waited 
                        outside every bathroom in South America.
                         (a beat)
                        Good times!

                                 KATIE
                        I remember thinking that was the test of 
                        a marriage.  If we could get through 
                        that...

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  We had no clue the shit we’d have 
                        to deal with.

           Katie tucks the brochure away in her jewelry box, then looks 
           at her husband (who now has a bronze face).

                                 KATIE
                        David, are you happy?
                                 DAVID
                        What’s that got to do with anything?

                                 KATIE
                        I said what I said the other day because 
                        I wasn’t happy.  And I don’t think you 
                        are either.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course I’m not.

                                 KATIE
                        Okay, why not?

                                 DAVID
                        Well, for starters, my wife just asked me 
                        for a divorce.

                                 KATIE
                        The purpose of my question was to help 
                        you understand why your wife asked you 
                        for a divorce.

                                 DAVID
                        You want a divorce because I’m not happy?

                                 KATIE
                        That was part of it.

                                 DAVID
                        How very magnanimous of you.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m not trying to be magnanimous.  I hate 
                        living with someone who’s so unhappy.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, I went to couple’s therapy.  What 
                        else do you want from me?

                                 KATIE
                        You went for a month.

                                 DAVID
                        But I got a year’s worth of material!

                                 KATIE
                        See, this is the problem.  It’s all funny 
                        to you.  Even the fighting.  I feel like 
                        you somehow enjoy this.  I don’t.

                                 DAVID
                        Katie... do whatever the hell you want.   
           INT. CARR KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Katie is in a dark kitchen, illuminated by the refrigerator.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The problem, of course, is that I don’t 
                        know what I want.  I don’t even know what 
                        I want to eat.

           She closes the door.  It’s covered by her children’s art.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I know what I don’t want.  I don’t want 
                        to break up my family.  I don’t even want 
                        to break up my marriage.  I just want 
                        David... not to be David anymore. 

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - DUSK

           Katie, home from work, is unloading groceries from her trunk, 
           trying to carry everything in one trip.  Her cell phone emits 
           a terrible DISCO RING.  She struggles, finds and answers it.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                         (from phone)
                        When are you coming home?

                                 KATIE
                        I’m home now, David.  Can you--  Hello?

           David almost skips out of the house to greet her. 

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        You have to help me change my ring.  I 
                        have a Ph.D. and I can’t find that stupid 
                        list of rings that’s somewhere in this 
                        phone--

           David bows quickly and repeatedly as if she were royalty.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you-- why are you doing that?

                                 DAVID
                        My back!  It’s fixed!   

                                 KATIE
                        You finally saw Dan Silverman?

                                 DAVID
                        Nope.  Saw a guy in Chinatown.

           He helps her with the groceries, proud he can.
                                 KATIE
                        Ava’s guy?

                                 DAVID
                        My guy.  DJ GoodNews.  Capital G, capital 
                        N.  Bad name, good doctor.  Although, 
                        technically, he’s not a doctor. 

                                 KATIE
                        What is he?  An acupuncturist?

                                 DAVID
                        More like a healer.

                                 KATIE
                        How did you find this person?

                                 DAVID
                        I saw his flier at the car wash.

           David lifts the bags like weights, showing off.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re doing this to spite me.  

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 KATIE
                        Because I’m a doctor.  You’re thumbing 
                        your nose at my profession.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, I admit that held some of the 
                        initial appeal, but it turns out this guy 
                        knows his stuff.

                                 KATIE
                        What is “his stuff” exactly?  

                                 DAVID
                        He sort of... lays his hands on you...  
                        And there’s a cream he uses. 

                                 KATIE
                        Nobody can cure a bad back in one 
                        session.

                                 DAVID
                        GoodNews can.  I’m telling you, he’s a 
                        miracle worker.   
                                 KATIE
                        And what does he charge per miracle?

                                 DAVID
                        Six hundred dollars.  But you can go back 
                        as much as you want for free.

                                 KATIE
                        If you’re cured, why would you need to go 
                        back?  Wouldn’t that be the “miracle” 
                        part of it?

                                 DAVID
                        Katie, who cares what it costs?  Who 
                        cares how it works?  I feel great for the 
                        first time in years.  God, why do you 
                        have to be so cynical?  

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           David is pouring Molly cereal when Katie enters, dressed for 
           work.  Katie kisses Tom on the head; pours herself coffee.

                                 MOLLY
                        I didn’t get any raisins.

                                 DAVID
                        You got some.

                                 MOLLY
                        I got three.  That’s more like none than 
                        some.

           Molly reaches into the cereal box and fishes for raisins.

                                 KATIE
                        Molly, that’s not what we do.

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s what Daddy does.

           Katie gives David a look.  He shrugs.  Then shrugs some more.

                                 DAVID
                         (pleased)
                        It doesn’t hurt to shrug anymore.

           He shrugs repeatedly, like he just learned how.  Katie 
           doesn’t know how to react to this person.  Then she notices 
           Tom just staring at her.  Then at David.  Then back to her.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s the matter with you?
                                 TOM
                        Nothing.

                                 KATIE
                        Why do you keep staring at us?

                                 TOM
                        I want to see if you’re getting divorced.

           Everything stops.  The shrugging, the raisins, all of it.

                                 KATIE
                        Why would we be getting a divorce?

                                 TOM
                        Someone at school told me.

                                 DAVID
                        Who? 

           David’s quick question seems to point to him as the leak.

                                 TOM
                        Joe Salter.  

                                 KATIE
                        Of course we’re not getting divorced.

           David looks at Katie, happy to hear this news.

                                 TOM
                        Then why did Joe Salter say you were?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know.  But we know more about it 
                        than he does, and we’re not getting 
                        divorced, right, David?

                                 DAVID
                        If you say so.

                                 MOLLY
                        Will you ever get divorced?

                                 KATIE
                        We’re not planning to.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who would we live with if you did?

                                 DAVID
                        Who would you want to live with?
           Katie can’t believe he just asked that.

                                 MOLLY
                        Daddy!  But not Tom.  

                                 DAVID
                        Tom can go and live with Mommy then.  
                        That’s fair.

           Tom looks to his mother, who looks to David, who shrugs.

           EXT. BAY CITIES ITALIAN DELI - LATER THAT DAY

           Katie and David are sitting on opposite sides of a picnic 
           table in front of a local deli near Katie’s clinic.  David 
           unwraps his hoagie as Katie lectures him.

                                 KATIE
                        My problem is that you alienated brother 
                        from sister, daughter from mother and 
                        father from son in the time it took to 
                        eat a bowl of Raisin Bran.  

                                 DAVID
                         (proud)
                        And I got you to promise not to divorce 
                        me in front of our kids.

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah, I think you might be hard pressed 
                        to find a parenting manual that 
                        recommends involving your children in 
                        these discussions.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not the one who asked for a divorce. 

                                 KATIE
                        No, but you’re the one telling everybody.

                                 DAVID
                        I was upset.  I told one person.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, somehow it got to that big-mouth, 
                        Joe Salter. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m just trying to keep up.  First you 
                        want a divorce, then you tell me we’re 
                        never getting divorced.
                                 KATIE
                        I told the kids we were never getting 
                        divorced.

                                 DAVID
                        So... what?  You lied?  To our children?  
                        And somehow I’m the bad parent? 

                                 KATIE
                        I think I said we weren’t planning to get 
                        divorced.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, nobody plans to get--

                                 KATIE
                        David!  We only have my lunch hour to 
                        sort this out, and... and... 

           Suddenly Katie is overwhelmed.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        ...I don’t see how we’re going to get out 
                        of this mess.

           Katie starts to cry and can’t stop.  She puts her head down.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, now you’ve got hair in your fruit.

           She cries even harder.  David goes around to her side of the 
           table and puts his arm around her, then both arms.  She sobs 
           on his shoulder.  It’s tender.  So tender that she cracks.

                                 KATIE
                        David...  

           Katie breaks the hug and looks into David’s eyes, where she 
           sees genuine love and concern.  

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        I slept with someone else.  But it’s 
                        over.  

           A long pause as David takes this in.  Katie doesn’t breathe.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The thing is, when you confess something 
                        like that, it’s not over for the other 
                        person.  It’s just beginning.

                                 DAVID
                        Can you come straight home tonight?
                                 KATIE
                        Sure.  Yes.  We’ll talk about it then.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s nothing to talk about.  But I 
                        want to do something about Molly’s 
                        eczema, and I need you to look after Tom.

           INT. TOM’S ROOM - THAT EVENING

           Katie sits beside Tom on his bed, holding him tight.  Tom, in 
           pajamas, is reading his “I Can Read” Humpty Dumpty book. 

                                 TOM
                         (reading slowly)
                        All the king’s horses and all the king’s 
                        men...  Where did Daddy take Molly?

                                 KATIE
                        I’m not sure.    

                                 TOM
                        Are they getting a house?

                                 KATIE
                        Oh, no.  No, honey.  They’re just running 
                        an errand or something.

           Tom turns the page, still concerned, as is Katie.

                                 TOM
                        ...couldn’t put Humpty... to get...
                         (sounding out the word)
                        ...together again.

                                 KATIE
                        Perfect.  

           She closes the book and puts it aside.

                                 TOM
                        Why couldn’t they?  

                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Put him together again?

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  I don’t know.  I guess he was broken 
                        into too many pieces.
           Katie and Tom both look beyond depressed.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It occurs to me that Humpty Dumpty is not 
                        a nursery rhyme.  It’s a cautionary tale 
                        about affairs.  All that humping and 
                        dumping, no way to put things right.

           Molly can be heard coming up the stairs, excited.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, Mommy, guess what?

                                 TOM
                         (resigned)
                        They found a house.

           Before Katie can respond, Molly bursts into the room.

                                 MOLLY
                        DJ GoodNews cured my eczema!   

                                 KATIE
                        That’s where Daddy took you?  To this 
                        GoodNews person?  

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s magic.  He can fix anything.  He 
                        fixed Daddy’s headache, too.  

                                 TOM
                        Could he fix Humpty Dumpty?

                                 DAVID
                         (entering)
                        I bet he could.

           David gives Tom a big hug, during which Katie looks at David, 
           hopeful he’s feeling forgiving, but his cold look says it 
           all.  Nobody can put this marriage back together again.  

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Katie and David are both brushing their teeth.  David spits.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m presuming you’ll be moving out over 
                        the next couple of days.

                                 KATIE
                        But... it was just the one time.  And 
                        it’s over.  
                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know about that.  But I do know 
                        that no one asks Elvis Presley to play 
                        for nothing.

           David rinses his toothbrush and brings it into the bedroom.

                                 KATIE
                        What?

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Katie follows David into the bedroom.

                                 DAVID
                        Nixon’s people called Colonel Tom Parker 
                        and asked if Elvis would play for the 
                        President, and Parker said, “Fine, but 
                        how much will we be getting?” 

           Katie struggles to understand how this affects her as David 
           continues, pulling things out of drawers as he speaks.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        And Nixon’s aide said, “Colonel Parker, 
                        nobody asks for money for a private 
                        performance for the President,” and 
                        Colonel Parker said, “I don’t know about 
                        that, but nobody asks Elvis Presley to 
                        play for nothing.”

                                 KATIE
                        David, please stop this.  It’s important.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s just... I was reminded of that 
                        story, and I guess it’s my way of saying 
                        what you do, or what you want... doesn’t 
                        really count for anything anymore.  
                        You’re the President, but I’m the King.  
                        Off you go.
                         (as Elvis)
                        Thank you, thank you very much.  

                                 KATIE
                        You don’t mean that.

                                 DAVID
                         (taking shirts from his closet)
                        We discussed this, remember?
                                 KATIE 
                        Yes.  We established, as most married 
                        couples do, that we wouldn’t tolerate 
                        infidelity, and that if it happened, it 
                        would most likely mean a lot of other 
                        things were wrong, and that’s as far as 
                        we got.  There was nothing about Elvis.

                                 DAVID
                         (pulling out a duffle bag)
                        I’m going away for a couple of nights.

           Katie finally realizes that David’s been packing.

                                 KATIE
                        To where?

                                 DAVID
                        Doesn’t matter.  While I’m gone, I’d like 
                        you to tell the kids what’s going on, and 
                        pack and leave.

                                 KATIE
                        But why am I the one who has to move out?

           David just looks at her, and it’s a look of such contempt, 
           she wants to run away from everything and never come back.  

           INT./EXT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM WINDOW - A LITTLE LATER

           The REV of David’s car starting.  Katie watches from the 
           window, sad and remorseful, as her husband drives away.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Tom, dressed but barefoot, is finishing his cereal.  Molly is 
           doing the Jumble in the newspaper.  Katie loads up their 
           backpacks for school.  

                                 TOM
                        Daddy usually does that.

                                 KATIE
                         (trying to be upbeat)
                        Well, Mommy’s doing it today.

                                 MOLLY
                        Where is Daddy?

                                 KATIE
                        He’s away on business.  
                                 TOM
                        He hasn’t got any business.

                                 MOLLY
                         (sweetly and loyally)
                        Yes, he does.  He yells on the radio.

                                 TOM
                        That’s a job?  

                                 MOLLY
                        What did you think it was?

                                 TOM
                        I thought he just was angry all the time. 

           Molly heads upstairs, shaking her head as if this is the 
           dumbest thing she’s ever heard.  Katie, on the other hand, 
           feels a little validated by Tom’s observation, until:

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Where is he really?

                                 KATIE
                         (caught offguard)
                        He’s gone to stay with a friend.

                                 TOM
                        Because you’re getting divorced?

                                 KATIE
                        We’re not getting divorced.

                                 TOM
                        So why has he gone to stay with a friend?

                                 KATIE
                        You go to stay with friends.  Doesn’t 
                        mean you’re getting divorced.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not married.  And when I go to stay 
                        with a friend, I tell you where I’m going 
                        and I say goodbye.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that what’s bothering you?  That he 
                        didn’t say goodbye?

                                 TOM
                        I just know something’s wrong.
                                 KATIE
                        Nothing is wrong, okay?!  Now where are 
                        your shoes?!

           Tom defiantly stands and heads out.  Katie feels terrible.

           EXT. PUBLIC GOLF COURSE - DRIVING RANGE - LATER

           MEN WHACK GOLF BALLS on the driving range.  Katie, looking 
           lost and out of place, spots someone who looks like he works 
           there, PACO, a young kid, carrying a bucket of balls.

                                 KATIE
                        Excuse me, I’m looking for my brother.  
                        He works here.  I think.  Mark Kellogg?  

                                 PACO
                         (points to the driving range)
                        He’s pushing the picker.

           Katie follows Paco’s finger and sees... in the distance, a 
           lone figure wearing astroturf on his chest and back for 
           protection as balls whiz past him like bullets.  It’s Mark, 
           in what looks to Katie like the world’s worst job, picking up 
           golf balls with a rolling basket.   

           EXT. PUBLIC GOLF COURSE - DRIVING RANGE - A SHORT TIME LATER

           Katie and Mark walk just outside of the driving range.   

                                 KATIE
                        Do people aim for you?

                                 MARK
                        Some, but, you know, it’s not personal.

                                 KATIE
                        And this is what you left law for?

                                 MARK
                        I love golf.  I’ve always loved golf.  
                        And I get to play anytime I want.  No 
                        greens fees.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you get to keep the astroturf suit?  
                        Because that’s a good look for you.

           She’s smiling.  He’s not.

                                 MARK
                        Did you drive across town just to tell me 
                        what a fuck-up I am?
                                 KATIE
                        No, I drove across town to tell you what 
                        a fuck-up I am.

                                 MARK
                        Well, let’s move on to that part of the 
                        conversation, shall we?

                                 KATIE
                        Okay.   
                         (trying to hold it together)
                        I sort of... slept with someone else, and 
                        now David wants me to move out.   

                                 MARK
                        You’re out of your mind.

                                 KATIE
                        I know that’s what it must look like, but 
                        see... I’ve been so depressed.

                                 MARK
                        So write yourself a prescription!  Go 
                        talk to someone!  I don’t see how an 
                        affair’s going to help, and divorce 
                        certainly won’t! 

                                 KATIE
                        Alright, then.  Thanks for the pep talk.

                                 MARK
                        What did you expect me to say?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know:  Want to sleep on my couch?  
                        I’m sorry this is happening to you?

                                 MARK
                        A) I don’t have a couch and B) it’s not 
                        happening to you.  You made it happen.

                                 KATIE
                        I know!  So how do I fix it?

                                 MARK
                        You don’t sleep with someone else.

                                 KATIE
                        You should really be a therapist.  You’re 
                        so good at this.

                                 MARK
                        I’m not going to make you feel better.
                                 KATIE
                        Clearly.  
                         (a beat)
                        Look, I know I screwed up.  I just don’t 
                        see why I have to be the one to move out.  
                        Isn’t it usually the man who moves out?  
                        Then again, isn’t it usually the man 
                        who’s the primary breadwinner?  And who 
                        gets depressed and has an affair just so 
                        he can feel alive again?

                                 MARK
                        And you don’t understand why I want to 
                        work on a golf course and stay single for 
                        the rest of my life?

                                 KATIE
                        Seriously, Mark, this just occurred to 
                        me.  In my relationship, do you see me as 
                        the man?  

                                 MARK
                        No.  I see you as the asshole.  

           Katie nods.  Fair enough, she deserved that.

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Katie is examining a patient’s knees (MRS. CORTEZ) and asking 
           what hurts.  It seems everything does.  Mrs. Cortez is 73, 
           Guatemalan, moves very slowly and wears all black.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        At the clinic we have some patients, like 
                        Mrs. Cortez, who we call “chronics,” 
                        because no matter what you do for them, 
                        they never get better.  Sometimes I wish 
                        they’d stop coming, not because I don’t 
                        want to help them -- I ache to help them 
                        -- but because trying and failing 
                        repeatedly makes me feel like a fraud who 
                        should advertise at the car wash.

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - RECEPTION DESK - LATER THAT DAY

           Katie surveys the crowded waiting area.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        But today I want to fill my day with 
                        chronics.  Chronics who have anal warts.  
                        Only a good person could treat chronics 
                        with anal warts, and I desperately need 
                        to feel like a good person again.
           Suddenly she spots someone familiar.  It’s Stephen with his 
           arm in a homemade sling.  He’s smiling, as if this will be a 
           great and fun surprise for her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hi ya, doc.  

                                 KATIE
                         (strictly business)
                        Can I help you? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah.  It’s about your bedside manner.  

                                 KATIE
                        Okay, um, this is not the place--

                                 STEPHEN
                         (playfully)
                        What’s the deal?  You use me, then don’t 
                        return my calls?  I got charged for a 
                        robe, by the way.

                                 KATIE
                        I really can’t see you now.  Here.

                                 STEPHEN
                        The sign says nobody is turned away from 
                        the People’s Community Clinic.   

                                 KATIE
                        That’s our general policy, but--

                                 STEPHEN
                        ‘Cause something’s wrong with my arm.

           She sees that his sling is clearly homemade.

                                 KATIE
                        Are those tube socks?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I used clean ones.  Anyhow, I think it 
                        might be broken.  In several places.  Can 
                        you take a look?  Over a drink?

                                 KATIE
                        I really can’t, Stephen.  I’m sorry.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Kate...
                                 KATIE
                        Katie...

                                 STEPHEN
                        Katie, we had something special.  It 
                        wasn’t just a hook-up. 

                                 KATIE
                        It wrecked my marriage.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Your marriage was already wrecked.  You 
                        said the dude doesn’t make you feel 
                        loved.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t think I used the word dude.

                                 STEPHEN
                         (taking her hands, proving his 
                          arm is fine)
                        I can make you feel loved.

           She pulls away and starts to usher him out.

                                 KATIE
                         (loudly, for appearances)
                        Just keep it iced.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Casa del Mar.  7pm?

                                 KATIE
                        No, now please... take two aspirin.  
                        Every four hours.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ll be waiting.  Later, gator.

           He smiles and goes.  Katie turns around and runs into Becca, 
           who was watching this exchange and is now completely 
           intrigued and concerned.

                                 BECCA
                         (whispering)
                        Are you having an affair?!

                                 KATIE
                        What?!  No.  

                                 BECCA
                        You are!  That’s what you were trying to 
                        tell me the other day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BECCA (CONT'D)
                         (impressed, but also concerned)
                        He’s hot.  

                                 KATIE
                        I have patients, so--

                                 BECCA
                        What about David?  And the kids?  And 
                        your brother?  Has Mark asked about me? 
                         (focusing)
                        Doesn’t matter.  How long has this been 
                        going on?

                                 KATIE
                        Look, it was a one-time thing.  A 
                        mistake.  The man says “Later, gator.” 
                        I’m not going to see him again.  

                                 BECCA
                        Does David know?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  I told him.  That was my second 
                        mistake.  

           Katie looks like she might cry, and Becca now gets how 
           serious this is, that Katie might lose everything.

                                 BECCA
                         (worried for her friend)
                        Oh, Katie.  Why would you do this?

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE AT THE CLINIC - THAT AFTERNOON

           Katie sits at her desk in a small, cluttered office. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        It’s a fair question.  

           INT. SAN DIEGO HOTEL BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Katie and Stephen are having drinks at the “welcome cocktail 
           hour.”  Everyone has name tags.  His says “Dr. Stephen 
           Something” because this is Katie’s flashback and she still 
           can’t recall his name.  She is telling a story and he is 
           hanging on her every word, finding her hilarious.

                                 KATIE
                        So it’s my first day of medical school at 
                        U.S.C., and we’re getting our cadaver, 
                        which has me anxious already...  

                                 STEPHEN
                        You never forget your first dead body.
                                 KATIE
                         (laughing)
                        Right.  So we pull back the sheet and I 
                        know the guy.  He lived four houses down 
                        when I was growing up!  Mr. Henkel.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No!

                                 KATIE
                        Yes!  The last time I saw him I was 12 
                        and he was mowing his lawn, and now...

                                 STEPHEN
                        How did he look?

                                 KATIE
                        Not so good.  

           Stephen laughs as Katie smiles and sips her drink.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure most people have affairs for the 
                        sex, but for me, the best part was being 
                        with someone who wanted to hear my 
                        stories.  I almost forgot I had stories.  
                        My kids certainly don’t want to hear my 
                        stories, and David stopped listening 
                        years ago.   

           INT. SAN DIEGO HOTEL ROOM - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Katie and Stephen are in the throes of “movie sex”: lots of 
           positions, lots of heavy breathing.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The thing about sex with someone who’s 
                        not your husband... it’s all very 
                        exploratory and exciting, but it’s not so 
                        efficient.  

           Katie is twisted into a position that’s not really working 
           for her.

                                 KATIE (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        A husband, even a bitter, angry one, 
                        knows what works for you.  He knows if he 
                        presses a certain button, the elevator 
                        will go to the right floor.  There’s 
                        something to be said for that.  

           A beat as Katie and Stephen continue having vigorous sex.
                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But this wasn’t the time to say it.

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE AT THE CLINIC - BACK TO PRESENT

           Katie looks at the framed pictures of her kids on her desk.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        In truth, I guess I’ve been unhappy for a 
                        while.  Unhappy enough to suggest 
                        counseling, which just provided David 
                        with material.  Unhappy enough to say I 
                        wanted out, which I never really had the 
                        guts to do.  Unhappy enough to have an 
                        affair, which didn’t solve anything.  So 
                        maybe this is the right course of action.  
                        Not just for me and David, but for our 
                        kids.  Two happy parents in two houses 
                        has to be better than two miserable 
                        parents in one.

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           Katie approaches her house, carrying a pizza.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        And that’s what I plan to tell my kids  
                        tonight.  Somehow.  Of course, they’ll 
                        never be able to enjoy pizza again. 

           Katie, full of dread, puts her key into the lock.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But then, everything changes.

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 DAVID
                        Nice day at the clinic?

           Katie is startled to find David waiting for her.  It seems 
           entirely feasible that he might pull out a gun and shoot her.  

                                 KATIE
                        Yes, thank you.  I... I might not have 
                        enough pizza.

                                 DAVID
                        Actually, I asked your parents to take 
                        the kids out for dinner.  Listen, I 
                        haven’t loved you enough.

           Katie’s not sure if he’s being serious, but he is.  
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t.  I’m sorry.  I do love you, 
                        and I haven’t communicated that properly.

                                 KATIE
                        No.  Well.  Thank you.

                                 DAVID
                        And I’m sorry I said I wanted you to move 
                        out.  I don’t.   

                                 KATIE
                        But... David, I think maybe you were 
                        right.  I think we might need to do this.  
                        You’ve been unhappy, and I’ve been 
                        unhappy, and it’s like a Band-Aid, it’s 
                        going to hurt, so we should just--

                                 DAVID
                        Give me until the end of the year.  

                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        I need a chance to be better.  Six weeks.  
                        After ten years of marriage, that’s not 
                        so much to ask.

           He looks completely sincere and even a little desperate.  And 
           given what she’s put him through, how can she refuse?  

                                 KATIE
                        Okay.  Until the end of the year.

                                 DAVID
                        Good.  And now, Katie... 
                         (as she braces herself)
                        Will you go to the Hollywood Bowl with me 
                        tomorrow?  They added some winter 
                        concerts... fringe benefit of global 
                        warming, I guess.  And I know you like 
                        this kind of thing, so what do you say?  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        This invitation is even more confusing 
                        than David saying he loves me.  He’s 
                        always maintained that this town’s idea 
                        of art is a signed headshot.

           Katie, unable to even speak, shrugs and nods “yes.”
                                 DAVID
                        Great.  Then tonight I’d like us to sleep 
                        in separate rooms, and wake up in the 
                        morning and try to rebuild our lives.

           David approaches Katie (which still makes her nervous), then 
           kisses her on the cheek and hugs her.   

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take the spare bedroom.

           Katie nods, completely confused.  PRE-LAP MUSIC...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT

           The PHILHARMONIC PLAYS under a perfect starry sky.

           David watches and listens, smiling.  Meanwhile, Katie keeps 
           stealing looks at him.  He finally looks back.  

                                 DAVID
                        Are you warmer now?

           Katie nods, as if communicating with a foreigner.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I can’t help but feel that I am on 
                        something like a date with someone very  
                        unlike my husband.  This polite man not 
                        only loaned me his jacket, he said I 
                        looked “adorable” in it.  The whole 
                        experience has been very unsettling.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOWL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Katie and David join a DISORGANIZED CROWD waiting for buses.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a nice night.  Should we walk to our 
                        car?

                                 KATIE
                        Walk four blocks?  In L.A.?

                                 DAVID
                        I know!  It’s so crazy it just might 
                        work.

           EXT. HIGHLAND AVENUE - NIGHT

           Katie and David follow other CONCERTGOERS down the street.  
           They’re actually having a nice time together.  
                                 KATIE
                        So, did you enjoy the concert?

                                 DAVID
                        I did.  Very much.

                                 KATIE
                        But you’ve always hated classical music.

                                 DAVID
                        I think... I think I thought I hated 
                        classical music.  It was a prejudice I 
                        hadn’t examined properly.

           They pass a HOMELESS WOMAN huddled in a sleeping bag.  David 
           feels in his pockets, pulls out his wallet, looks inside.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I forgot to get cash.  Do you have your 
                        wallet with you?

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah.

           Katie pulls her wallet out of her purse and David takes it, 
           removes all the cash, and hands it to the woman.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        Thank you.  God bless you.  

           David hands Katie back her empty wallet.

                                 KATIE
                        What did you do?

                                 DAVID
                        Gave her some money.

                                 KATIE
                        You gave her all of my money.   

                                 DAVID
                        Not all of your money.  You have a 
                        checking account.  

                                 KATIE
                        But that was almost two hundred dollars.  
                        I just went to the ATM.   

           Katie, getting nowhere with David, appeals to the woman, who 
           is still holding the stack of twenties.
                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, this is awkward, but I think 
                        he didn’t mean to give you all of that.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, I did. 

           Katie gives David a “Please let me handle this” look.

                                 KATIE
                         (to the woman)
                        The thing is, we need gas and we have to 
                        pay our babysitter and we’re late already 
                        -- not your problems -- but could we just 
                        have a little back? 

           Katie reaches out her hand.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                         (pressing the bills to her 
                          chest)
                        DON’T TAKE MY MONEY!

           A COUPLE OF CONCERTGOERS stop and stare.  It looks like Katie 
           is trying to take money from a homeless woman.  

                                 KATIE
                        But--
                         (off their looks)
                        It was my--
                         (defensive)
                        I’m a doctor.  I save lives.

           INT. DAVID’S SUV - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Katie is mortified.  David is driving them home in silence.

                                 DAVID
                        Should we stop at an ATM?

                                 KATIE
                        Unless you want to give the babysitter 
                        our house.  

                                 DAVID
                         (explaining)
                        I just wanted to see how that would feel.  

                                 KATIE
                        And how did it feel?
                                 DAVID
                        Good.  Definitely better than walking by, 
                        pretending not to see.  I don’t want to 
                        walk by anymore.

           Katie looks over at David.  He’s smiling, pleased.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s happening to you?  What happened 
                        when you went away?  Where did you go?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sure it’s confusing.  I’m 
                        not sure I can explain it, though.

           A long beat. 

                                 KATIE
                        We should stop.  We’re running on fumes.   

                                 DAVID
                        You said until the end of the year.

           He drives past a gas station.

                                 KATIE
                        The car.  Is on empty.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh.  

           As he makes a U-turn...

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie washes her face.  She’s wearing a comfy t-shirt.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        As if the evening wasn’t eventful enough, 
                        David said he wanted me to sleep with him 
                        tonight in our bedroom, “no pressure.”  
                         (drying her face)
                        I wanted David to be different.  I didn’t 
                        want that voice, that tone, that scowl.  
                        I wanted him to like me, and now he does.  

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Katie peeks into the bedroom, where her husband is lighting a 
           candle and playing PAOLO NUTINI’S “LAST REQUEST” on CD.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I made my bed, I guess I have to have sex 
                        in it.

           David walks over and greets her with a kiss.  A long, 
           romantic kiss.  Then he holds her face in his hands.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        I want to make love to you.

                                 KATIE
                        Okay, fine.  But does there have to be 
                        all this fuss?

                                 DAVID
                        I want to make love, not just have sex.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, what does that involve?

                                 DAVID
                        Communication.  Intensity.  I don’t know.

                                 KATIE
                        But I thought the advantage of being 
                        almost 40 was that I no longer have to 
                        drink beer from a can, stay out past one, 
                        or be “intense.”  

                                 DAVID
                        Please try it my way.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Katie and David are engaged in passionate “lovemaking.” 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        That’s how it happened that my husband 
                        and I actually made love for the first 
                        time in years, and as promised, it was 
                        intense, and soulful, and passionate...

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhhhhh!!!!

           Katie collapses on top of David.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m just not sure it was my husband.
           INT. CARR KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE on a CHUTES AND LADDERS game that David and the kids 
           are playing.  The PHONE IS RINGING AND RINGING.  Katie, just 
           home from work, reaches for the phone.

                                 KATIE
                        Why is no one--

                                 TOM/MOLLY/DAVID
                        Don’t answer that!

                                 TOM
                         (loving this)
                        We’re not answering the phone!

                                 KATIE
                        Why not?

                                 MOLLY
                        Daddy quit his job, and his boss in New 
                        York is very upset.

                                 KATIE
                        You quit your radio show?  

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t want to be the Angriest Man in 
                        Santa Monica.  I don’t want to be angry, 
                        period.

                                 TOM
                        Want to play Chutes and Ladders, Mommy?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, yeah.  Mommy should get in on this!

           INT. WHOLE FOODS CAFE - DAY

           Katie and Becca wait to pay for their salads.

                                 KATIE
                        And then we played Chutes and Ladders 
                        like we were the perfect nuclear family.  
                         (beat)
                        Do you think they call it a nuclear 
                        family because it could explode and kill 
                        everyone involved?

                                 BECCA
                        I can’t believe he quit his job.  
                                 KATIE
                        And this is after begging me for six 
                        weeks to prove he could be “better.”  How 
                        is being jobless better? 

                                 BECCA
                        Why does he have to prove anything?  You 
                        had the affair.

           Katie is taken aback by this, and also wishes Becca hadn’t 
           said that so loudly since they are, in fact, in public.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                         (suddenly)
                        I know what it is.  

                                 KATIE
                        He’s punishing me?

                                 BECCA
                        No.  He has a brain tumor.

                                 KATIE
                        He doesn’t have a brain tumor.

                                 BECCA
                        It might not be a brain tumor.  
                         (gravely)
                        But he only has six weeks to live.

           As Katie thinks about this, not quite on board yet...

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING 

           Katie opens the door and Tom and Molly rush to her, crying.

                                 TOM
                         (clinging to her leg)
                        Daddy gave away my computer!

                                 MOLLY
                        He said Tom has to share mine!  I don’t 
                        want to share my computer!

           David appears in the doorway from the kitchen.  Katie looks 
           to him for an explanation.

                                 DAVID
                        We took it to a women’s shelter.  They 
                        were very appreciative. 
           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           David and Katie are mid-discussion.  Katie is actually 
           concerned about David now.

                                 DAVID
                        Why would you think I have brain tumor?

                                 KATIE
                        Why would you give away a perfectly good 
                        computer?

                                 DAVID
                        Just last Christmas you were worried we 
                        were spoiling them by giving them each 
                        their own.  And now they can’t share?

                                 KATIE
                        It’s not just that.  You quit your job.  
                        And you’re being so... nice.  

                                 DAVID
                         (sighs, then)
                        I guess we need to talk about this.

           David sits on the bed.  Katie sits next to him and puts a 
           supportive arm around him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have a brain tumor!  

                                 KATIE
                         (gently)
                        Some other kind of disease then?

                                 DAVID
                        No!  I just want to lead a better life.  
                        And the fact that you’d think I’d have to 
                        be dying to be “nice” shows how bad a 
                        life I’ve been leading.

                                 KATIE
                        But why now?  Is this all because of--
                         (”the affair,” she thinks)

                                 DAVID
                        --DJ GoodNews.

                                 KATIE
                        What does he have to do with it?
                                 DAVID
                        Everything.  That’s where I went when I 
                        was away, and it changed my life.  Katie, 
                        he doesn’t use a cream.

                                 KATIE
                        For $600 I hope he uses something.

                                 DAVID
                        Please don’t make jokes.  I need you to 
                        understand this:  He cured my back just 
                        by laying his hands on me.  And he cured 
                        my headache by touching my temples.  And 
                        he cured a lot of other things, too.

                                 KATIE
                         (feeling a little sick)
                        By touching you other places?

                                 DAVID
                        Not inappropriately if that’s what you’re 
                        implying!

                                 KATIE
                        You spent the night with this man!  I 
                        don’t know what to think anymore.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not gay, and I’m not dying.  I’d just 
                        like to--

                                 KATIE
                        --lead a better life.  You said. 

                                 DAVID
                        And I’d like us to lead a better life.  
                        That’s what I meditated on.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - DAY

                                 KATIE
                        Frankly, it was easier to imagine him gay 
                        than meditating.

           It’s Thanksgiving.  Katie is basting the turkey while talking 
           to Mark.

                                 MARK
                        Just be thankful you’re still together.

                                 KATIE
                        Mom and Dad are still together.  Is that 
                        love or inertia?
                                 MARK
                        At this point, I think they’re just in it 
                        for the rockin’ sex.   

                                 KATIE
                         (laughing)
                        Okay, that was not necessary.

           INT. CARR DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Katie presents the perfect turkey.  Burt stands, waiting to 
           carve it.  Freda, Mark, David and the kids are seated at the 
           table, which is lavishly set and teaming with food.

                                 BURT 
                        Look at that bird!

                                 FREDA
                        And as usual, there’s enough food to feed 
                        a small country.

                                 KATIE
                        Please don’t give David any ideas.

           Katie laughs a little, but David is getting ideas.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s right.

           Katie gets nervous; the rest don’t know what’s coming.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Venice Beach.

                                 FREDA
                        What about it, dear?

                                 KATIE
                        David, it’s a nice thought, but--

                                 DAVID
                        It’s Thanksgiving.

                                 KATIE
                        Yes, and this is our Thanksgiving dinner.  
                         (an order)
                        Dad, start carving.

           Burt is about to carve, but David stops him.

                                 DAVID
                        No, Burt, wait--
                                 KATIE
                         (to David)
                        We have a frozen lasagna in the freezer.  
                        After dinner we’ll heat that up and you 
                        can give it to whoever you want.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER

                                 TOM
                        I don’t want lasagna.  I want turkey.

                                 KATIE
                        I know, honey.  Me, too.

           Tom whimpers softly as Katie, Burt, Mark and Freda sit in 
           David’s SUV and watch helplessly as David and Molly 
           distribute their Thanksgiving dinner to a motley assortment 
           of VENICE BEACH FOLKS.  Molly smiles as she serves.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Molly has now embraced the role of 
                        assistant do-gooder.  I fear she is 
                        destined to become the type of woman who 
                        chairs guilds and gives unwanted 
                        pashminas to her dula.   

                                 FREDA  
                        I think some of those people are just 
                        tourists.

                                 BURT  
                        What do you want to do, Freda?  Ask them 
                        for proof of not having a residence?

                                 FREDA 
                        I’m just saying if he’s going to give 
                        away our turkey dinner, I want to make 
                        sure he gives it to people who are more 
                        deserving.

                                 MARK
                        I’ve been living on Ramen noodles.  I’m 
                        pretty deserving.  

                                 BURT  
                        You have a law degree.  If you choose not 
                        to use it, enjoy your Ramen noodles.

                                 MARK
                        Now it feels like Thanksgiving.  I’ve 
                        been insulted.

           Tom starts giggling.
                                 KATIE
                        What’s so funny, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        That man over there is peeing!

                                 KATIE
                         (getting impatient)
                        David, Molly, can we go now?

                                 MOLLY
                         (calling back)
                        We still have food left.  

                                 KATIE
                        Then let’s, I don’t know, eat it 
                        ourselves?!

                                 DAVID
                        We can’t.  It’s the principle of the 
                        thing.

                                 KATIE
                        David, fuck your principals!  Fuck the 
                        homeless!

           Her children, her family, and everyone else stares at Katie.  

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                         (explaining)
                        I didn’t mean to say that.  I’m certainly 
                        not anti-...  I mean, come on, I work 
                        with...  I...  
                         (calling out)
                        Who needs seconds?

           Katie gets out of the car, picks up a serving spoon and 
           starts helping.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

           Katie is lying on her bed holding her Woman of the Year award 
           (which is mocking her) as if she’s been buried with it.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        It’s hard to imagine a worse 
                        Thanksgiving.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                         (calling from downstairs)
                        Katie, you have a visitor!
           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Katie’s knees almost buckle when she sees that her “visitor” 
           is Stephen.  He is waiting by the front door, standing next 
           to David.  The kids are watching TV much too close by.

                                 KATIE
                         (unsure about the etiquette)
                        Um, David, this is...

                                 DAVID
                         (calmly)
                        I know who it is.  Stephen introduced 
                        himself.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  Okay.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I wanted to talk to you.  
                         (off Katie’s incredulous look)
                        Both of you.

           David nods and ushers Stephen into the kitchen.  Katie, 
           seeing no other option, heads downstairs.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           When Katie enters Stephen is standing at the kitchen island.  

                                 DAVID
                        Bottled or tap?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Tap is perfect.

                                 DAVID
                        Katie?

                                 KATIE
                         (quickly)
                        Yeah.  I’m here.

                                 DAVID
                        Did you want water?

                                 KATIE
                        No, no.  I’m good.

                                 DAVID
                        I could make a pot of coffee...
                                 KATIE
                        No!  Please, let’s just--

                                 DAVID
                        Right.

           David brings Stephen the water and they all gather around the 
           island.  David and Katie look at each other.  A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Who should start, then?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Maybe I should.  Seeing as I’m the one 
                        who called the meeting, as it were.

           The two men smile.  Katie is confused by the niceness.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to drop by like this, on 
                        Thanksgiving no less, but I left a couple 
                        of messages for Katie and she didn’t 
                        return them, so I thought, hey, why don’t 
                        we just talk about this like adult--

                                 DAVID
                        --erers.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Did you-- say something?

                                 DAVID
                        Adulterers.  Stupid joke.  Sorry.

                                 STEPHEN
                        No, it’s fine.  It’s funny.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I just didn’t hear you.

                                 KATIE
                        If I can interrupt, move things along:  
                        Stephen, what the hell are you doing 
                        here?!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Right.  The big question.  Okay.  Deep 
                        breath.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                        David, I’m sorry if this comes as a 
                        shock, you seem like a decent guy, but 
                        I’ve reached the conclusion that Katie 
                        doesn’t want to be with you.  She’d be 
                        better off with me.  I’m sorry, but those 
                        are the facts.  

           Katie is incredulous.  “The facts?”

                                 KATIE
                        That’s ridiculous.  Stephen, you should 
                        go, before you make an idiot of yourself.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I knew she’d say that.

           He sighs and gives Katie an “I know you so well” smile.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        David, maybe you and I should talk 
                        privately.

                                 KATIE
                        Sure, okay.  I’ll leave the room and once 
                        you two sort this out, just tell me who I 
                        should be with. 

           Stephen seems open to this idea.  

                                 DAVID
                        I think she’s joking.

                                 KATIE
                        Yes, I’m joking.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Alright.  Well, David, I know from 
                        talking to Katie that some things aren’t 
                        great between you two.

                                 DAVID
                        Katie and I have discussed that.  We’re 
                        working on it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        There are some things you can’t work out.

                                 DAVID
                        Like?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Like that Katie doesn’t love you.
           David looks to Katie.  She shakes her head and rolls her 
           eyes, then realizes he needs more of a response than that.

                                 KATIE
                        I never said that.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You didn’t have to.  And then there’s the 
                        sex.

                                 KATIE
                        I definitely never said anything about--

                                 STEPHEN
                        You did.  You said something about the 
                        difference between art and science, and 
                        that you preferred art.

                                 KATIE
                        I never said I preferred art.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You said you were a scientist by 
                        profession, and you preferred art in bed. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m afraid you’ve lost me.

                                 KATIE
                         (to Stephen)
                        I might have said that, but if you must 
                        know, I was trying to be nice.  It was an 
                        explanation for why I didn’t come.

           Silence all around.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I only admitted that to make David feel 
                        better, but apparently bringing up sex 
                        with someone other than your husband to 
                        your husband, even if only to explain 
                        that the sex was less than satisfying... 
                        very dicey territory.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s what you’re saying now.  That’s 
                        not what you were saying when you were 
                        lying on top of me in San Diego.

           David walks away, stung.
                                 KATIE
                        No, we know what I said then -- the thing 
                        about art versus science.  What we’re 
                        doing now is interpreting the words we 
                        agree I used.  Please try to keep up.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Sorry if I’m not quick enough for you.

           Katie and Stephen glower at each other.  David lobs this in:

                                 DAVID
                        I might be speaking out of turn here, but 
                        to be honest, Stephen, Katie doesn’t seem 
                        to like you very much.  And she should at 
                        this stage, right?  First blush and all?  
                        She certainly doesn’t seem eager to rush 
                        off with you.  

                                 KATIE
                        No, I’m not.  I’m not sixteen, Stephen.  
                        I can’t just jump on the back of your 
                        bike.  I’ve got a husband and two kids.  
                        I made a mistake.  I’ve got to live with 
                        it, and so does David.  Now please go.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door SLAMS.  Katie looks at David.  

                                 KATIE
                        Thank you.  Thank you, thank you.

                                 DAVID
                        For what?

                                 KATIE
                        Everything.  I’m so sorry I put you in 
                        that situation.

                                 DAVID
                        I put myself in it, too, I guess.  It 
                        wouldn’t have happened if I’d been making 
                        you happy.  So I’m sorry, too.

           David pours the remains of Stephen’s water into the sink, 
           then drops the glass into the trash, letting it BREAK.  He’s 
           hurt.  This is hard for him, but he’s doing his best.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Katie snuggles up on David’s chest.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I can’t help but love David at this 
                        moment.  He stayed calm when he had every 
                        right to be angry at everything and 
                        everyone, and as a result I feel, for the 
                        first time in a long time, that we are a 
                        unit, a couple, a marriage.  I feel like 
                        I would do anything for this man.

                                 DAVID
                        Katie, there’s a favor I wanted to ask.

                                 KATIE
                        Name it.

                                 DAVID
                        I spoke to GoodNews yesterday, and he’s 
                        got nowhere to live.  His landlord just 
                        gave him notice.  I was wondering if he 
                        could come here for a couple of nights.

           On Katie, knowing she must agree to this...

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT AFTERNOON

           DJ GOODNEWS, with two Hefty bags of his belongings, is at the 
           door being greeted by the Carrs.  He is thirtyish with bright-
           blue eyes, lots of tattoos, and an unsuccessful attempt at a 
           goatee.  Both his eyebrows are pierced and he’s wearing what 
           appears to be brooches over each eye, which fascinates Tom.

                                 TOM
                         (re: the brooches)
                        Are those tortoises?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Nah.

                                 MOLLY
                         (she’s discussed this already)
                        They’re turtles.

                                 TOM
                        What’s the difference?

                                 DAVID
                        Turtles can swim, right?

                                 TOM
                        Why did you want turtles and not 
                        tortoises?
                                 GOODNEWS
                        You won’t laugh if I tell you?

           Katie laughs before he tells them.  She can’t help herself.  
           This is all so absurd.  GoodNews looks hurt.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        That was a bit rude.  I’m surprised at 
                        you.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you know me?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        I feel like I do.  David’s talked about 
                        you.  He loves you a lot, and I know 
                        you’ve had a rough time lately, yeah?

           Katie starts to agree, then realizes his “yeah” is a verbal 
           tic, not a question.

                                 GOODNEWS (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, the turtles.  It was weird, yeah?  
                        ‘Cause I had a dream about blue turtles, 
                        and then Sting, the singer-- I don’t like 
                        him much.  My sister got me hooked on the 
                        Police when I was a kid, but if you ask 
                        me, his solo stuff?  Crap.  Anyway, Sting 
                        came out with an album called “The Dream 
                        of the Blue Turtles.”  So...

           He shrugs.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Apparently, the rest -- the part about 
                        eyebrow piercing and becoming a healer 
                        and advertising at car washes -- was self-
                        explanatory.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        And I’ve always had this thing about blue 
                        turtles.  I’ve always thought they could 
                        see stuff we can’t, yeah?

           The children stare at their father, clearly baffled.

                                 MOLLY
                        What can they see?
                                 GOODNEWS
                        Good question, Molly.  You’re sharp.  I’m 
                        going to have to watch you.

           Molly beams, but Tom notes that GoodNews never answered.

                                 TOM
                        He doesn’t know.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Oh, I know alright.  But maybe now is not 
                        the time.

                                 DAVID
                         (to the kids)
                        Do you want to show GoodNews his room?

                                 MOLLY
                        Sure.  
                         (off Tom’s hesitation)
                        Come on, Tom.  He’s our guest. 

                                 KATIE
                         (re: his Hefty bags)
                        Need help with your... bags... DJ?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Nah.  I only keep what I can carry.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you go by DJ or--

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Just GoodNews.  I’m not a DJ anymore.

                                 DAVID
                         (off Katie’s confused look)
                        He used to DJ in clubs.   

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Before I got the healing gig.  

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  Uh huh.  Cool. 

           Once GoodNews and the kids are gone, David turns to Katie.

                                 DAVID
                        I know what you’re thinking, but try not 
                        to get bogged down in the superficial 
                        stuff.
                                 KATIE
                        What does that leave?

                                 DAVID
                        You don’t pick up a vibe?

                                 KATIE
                        I pick up a scent.  Does he shower?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s interesting Molly and I can feel it, 
                        and you and Tom can’t.

                                 KATIE
                        How do you know Tom can’t?  How do you 
                        know Molly can?

                                 DAVID
                        Tom was rude to him.  If you pick up the 
                        vibe, you wouldn’t be rude.  Molly isn’t 
                        rude.  She got it the first time she saw 
                        him.

                                 KATIE
                        And I was rude.

                                 DAVID
                        Not rude, but... skeptical.

                                 KATIE
                        And that’s wrong?  Given that he’s 
                        staying in our house?  Given that for all 
                        we know, he has body parts in those bags, 
                        and we’re now accomplices to some heinous 
                        crimes where the scene bears the sign of 
                        the blue turtle?

                                 DAVID
                        You can almost see it, what he has, if 
                        you know how to look.

                                 KATIE
                        But you don’t think I do?

                                 DAVID
                        It doesn’t make you a bad person.

           David smiles kindly (the worst affront of all), and goes to 
           join the others.
           INT. CARR KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           Katie, trying to be a good sport, is marinating five chicken 
           breasts when GoodNews enters with David and the kids, almost 
           as if they’re his entourage. 

                                 DAVID
                        There are a few things GoodNews has a 
                        problem with.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        I don’t really agree with beds.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  Okay.  Do you mind if we sleep in 
                        them?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        What other people do is their business.  
                        But I think they make you soft.  Take you 
                        further away from how things really are.

                                 KATIE
                        And how are things?

           David shoots Katie a look worse than hatred: disappointment.  

                                 GOODNEWS
                        That’s the big question, Katie.  And I’m 
                        not sure if you’re ready for the big 
                        answer.

                                 TOM
                         (loyally)
                        You are, aren’t you, Mommy?

                                 DAVID
                        Anyhow, GoodNews would like the bed taken 
                        out of the spare room, because there 
                        isn’t really room for him to sleep on the 
                        floor if it stays there.

                                 MOLLY
                        Can I take my bed out?  I don’t like it.

                                 KATIE
                         (to David, whose fault this is)
                        What’s wrong with your bed?
                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t agree with it.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        I’m causing trouble, aren’t I?  Forget 
                        it.  It’s groovy.  I can cope with a bed.

                                 DAVID
                        No, that’s okay, because the other thing 
                        that GoodNews was -- well, that we both 
                        were -- worried about was where he was 
                        going to heal people.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  I thought he was just staying a 
                        couple of nights.

                                 DAVID
                        Probably he will be.  But he needs to 
                        work.  And he has commitments--

                                 KATIE
                        And the spare bedroom’s no good for 
                        healing?

           David looks at GoodNews, who shrugs.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Not ideal.  Because of the bed.  But if 
                        there’s nothing else...

                                 KATIE
                        Wouldn’t you know it?  We had to choose 
                        between David’s home radio studio and a 
                        healing room, and clearly we made the 
                        wrong choice.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m afraid sarcasm is one of Katie’s 
                        vices.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve got lots of others.  Millions.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I suddenly remember I do have other 
                        vices, one of whom came to visit last 
                        night, so maybe I should shut up.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  We’ll make the spare bedroom 
                        work.  We can put the bed in storage. 
                                 GOODNEWS
                        You’ve definitely got too much stuff if 
                        you need a storage unit.  

                                 DAVID
                        Katie saves everything.

                                 KATIE
                        And David saves nothing.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Except maybe... the world!

           Katie doesn’t even know where to begin with that.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re working on a project... a way to 
                        address the homeless problem. 

           Katie nods, doing her best to avoid sarcasm.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        And the last thing, Katie: GoodNews is a 
                        vegetarian.

                                 KATIE
                         (looking at the chicken)
                        Fine.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        A vegan, actually.

                                 KATIE
                        Even better.  Very sensible.  Healthier, 
                        right? 

           INT. CARR DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a fork picking at a piece of chicken.  The fork 
           belongs to Molly, and Katie is watching Molly’s thought-
           process as Molly eyes GoodNews’ vegetable plate.

                                 MOLLY
                        Mommy, maybe I’m a--

                                 KATIE
                        You’re a meat eater and that’s that.

           A moment as the family and GoodNews eat in silence.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        So Katie, David says you’re a healer too.
                                 KATIE
                        Well, I’m... I’m a doctor.   

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Ergo, you heal people.

                                 MOLLY
                         (trying to help)
                        But she can’t magically fix people like 
                        you can.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, yes.  I am... constrained by the 
                        laws of science.

                                 DAVID
                         (to GoodNews)
                        I don’t know if it’s magic, but if you 
                        knew the number of doctors we dragged 
                        Molly to.  And my back -- Katie thought I 
                        needed surgery!

                                 KATIE
                        Well, you still might.

                                 DAVID
                         (re: Katie)
                        DJ BadNews over here.

           GoodNews and the kids find this hysterical.  Katie just 
           smiles and nods, allowing them to laugh at her expense.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Hey, I’m happy to help.  I believe in 
                        help.  I think God is angry with us 
                        because we don’t help each other enough.

                                 MOLLY
                        Tom didn’t help set the table.  Maybe God 
                        is angry at Tom.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        God is angry at Tom.

           A moment as Tom and family absorb this assertion.  Katie puts 
           her arm around Tom.  He doesn’t like GoodNews at all now.

                                 GOODNEWS (CONT’D)
                        He’s angry at all of us, and if we don’t 
                        start helping each other, something dire 
                        is going to happen.
                                 TOM
                        Like what?

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Like having to let a man with turtles for 
                        eyebrows stay with you indefinitely 
                        because you cheated on your husband?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Like a do-over.  A cosmic do-over.  
                        Something big enough to wipe this town 
                        off the map so we can start fresh.  

           Molly, who believes in GoodNews, is sufficiently scared.

                                 KATIE
                        Who wants to help do the dishes then?

           Tom and Molly raise their hands.  Katie smiles at GoodNews.  
           Maybe he will be helpful to have around after all.

           EXT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - THE NEXT MORNING

           As Katie is entering the clinic, she sees a figure in black, 
           Mrs. Cortez, slowly and painfully approaching.  Katie holds 
           the door open for her.

                                 KATIE
                        Morning, Mrs. Cortez.  How are you?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                         (out of breath)
                        Knees, very much pain.

                                 KATIE
                        The pain medication isn’t helping?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        No, and houses I clean, many stairs.

           Katie nods, sympathetic, as Mrs. Cortez enters.  This hurts 
           Katie’s heart.  She waits outside a moment and thinks.

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - LATER

           Mrs. Cortez eyes GoodNews and his turtles very skeptically.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Hello!  You’re a heartbreaker, aren’t 
                        you?  What’s your name?

           Mrs. Cortez continues to stare at him.
                                 KATIE
                        This is Mrs. Cortez.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        No, her real name.  Her first name.

           Katie is embarrassed to realize that after years of seeing 
           this woman, she has no clue.  She quickly scans her chart.

                                 KATIE
                        Um... Maria.

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (to Mrs. Cortez)
                        Maria!  What are we going to do about 
                        Maria?  You know that song?  West Side 
                        Story?

                                 KATIE
                        I think that’s the Sound of Music one.  
                        The West Side Story one is different.

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (to Mrs. Cortez)
                        You’ve had two songs written about you.  
                        Not surprising.  Pretty girl like you.

           Mrs. Cortez smiles shyly.

                                 GOODNEWS (CONT’D)
                        So what needs doing here?  How can we get 
                        Maria dancing again?

                                 KATIE
                        She’s got chronic inflammation around 
                        most of her joints.  Hips, knees, a lot 
                        of back pain.  

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Is she sad?

                                 KATIE
                        Wouldn’t you be?  With all of that?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        No, I mean like, mentally.

                                 KATIE
                        Is she mentally sad?  You mean sad in her 
                        mind as opposed to sad in her knees?
                                 GOODNEWS 
                        Yeah, all right, I’m not as good at 
                        talking as you, Dr. Smartypants, but 
                        let’s see which one of us can do 
                        something for her.

                                 KATIE
                        I just didn’t...  Does she have to be 
                        unhappy before you can treat her?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        It helps if I can key into that stuff, 
                        yeah.

           Katie moves in closer to Mrs. Cortez.

                                 KATIE
                        Mrs. Cortez, are you sad?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        Sad?  Sadness?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  Sadness.

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        Oh, yes.  Very, very sad.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Why?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        Too many things.
                         (gestures at her black clothes, 
                          eyes filling with tears)
                        My husband.  
                         (then)
                        My sister.  My mother.  My father.  Too 
                        many things...

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I noticed she always wore black, but I 
                        never asked why.  

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        My son...

                                 KATIE
                        Your son’s dead?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        No, no.  Not dead.  Very bad.  He moved 
                        to New Jersey.  Never call me.
           Katie looks at GoodNews.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that enough sadness?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        That all makes sense.  I can feel most of 
                        that.  Explain to her that I will need to 
                        touch her shoulders, neck and head.

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                         (somewhat affronted)
                        I understand.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that okay?

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        Okay.  Yes.

           Katie gets out of the way.  GoodNews sits on a rolling stool 
           opposite Mrs. Cortez and closes his eyes for a while, then he 
           gets up and massages her scalp.  After a moment...

                                 MRS. CORTEZ (CONT’D)
                        Very hot!

                                 GOODNEWS
                        That’s good.  The hotter the better.  
                        Things are happening.

           Katie wants to remain cynical, but she can’t help but notice 
           that things are happening.  The rooms feels a little warmer.  
           The LIGHT in the ceiling GETS BRIGHTER.  Then Mrs. Cortez 
           hops up, startling Katie, and stretches.

                                 MRS. CORTEZ
                        Thank you.  Is much better now.  Much, 
                        much better.

           And with that she walks out at five times her usual speed.  
           Katie looks at GoodNews, waiting for him to gloat.

                                 KATIE
                        So... you can cure old age.   

                                 GOODNEWS
                        She’s not cured.  Of course she’s not 
                        cured.  Her body’s fucked.  But life will 
                        be much better for her.

           He’s pleased, not for himself, but for Mrs. Cortez, and Katie 
           feels small and petty and hopeless.
           INT. KIDS’ BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie sits on the edge of the tub, helping Molly bathe.  As 
           she washes Molly’s arms, she searches for eczema.

                                 MOLLY 
                        It’s still gone.  
                         (off Katie’s innocent look)
                        My eczema.

                                 KATIE
                        Huh.  So it is.  Hey... when you went to 
                        see GoodNews, do you remember what he 
                        said to you?  Did he ask you anything?

                                 MOLLY
                        Like what?

                                 KATIE
                        What you were feeling?

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, yes.  He asked if I was feeling sad.

                                 KATIE
                        And what did you say?

                                 MOLLY
                        That I felt a little sad sometimes.

                                 KATIE
                        What about?

                                 MOLLY
                        Grandma Parrot.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BROWNSTONE - DAY - FLASHBACK - LAST YEAR

           Katie and David carry boxes of belongings out of an old 
           brownstone, past a STONE PARROT.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        David’s mother who died last year, so 
                        called because she had a stone parrot on 
                        her porch.

           INT. KIDS’ BATHROOM - BACK TO PRESENT

           Katie has stopped bathing Molly for the moment.

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  That was very sad.
                                 MOLLY
                        And Poppy.

           Katie nods sympathetically.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The family cat.  Died shortly after 
                        Grandma Parrot.  

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO

           In the glow of the FLASHING RED LIGHT from an ambulance, a 
           chaotic scene.  GRANDMA PARROT is being whisked away on a 
           stretcher.  David runs behind the PARAMEDICS, nervous.  Katie 
           stands in the doorway, holding a crying Tom, as Molly tugs on 
           her blouse, trying to tell her the cat is missing.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        In fact, Molly’s proximity to both of 
                        those deaths was not ideal.  Grandma 
                        Parrot was visiting when she collapsed, 
                        and in our hurry to the hospital we lost 
                        track of the cat.  So when we got home, 
                        sans Grandma, we organized a Poppy search 
                        party thinking it would make the kids 
                        feel better...

           EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Molly sees Poppy in the road ahead and runs to her, calling 
           her name, then starts to scream as Katie rushes to her side.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        ...but it definitely did not, because 
                        Molly and I found Poppy up -- and in and 
                        all over -- the road.

           INT. KID’S BATHROOM - BACK TO PRESENT

           Katie is now washing Molly’s hair.

                                 KATIE
                        That was sad, too.

                                 MOLLY
                        And your baby.

                                 KATIE
                        My baby?

                                 MOLLY
                        The baby that died?
                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  That baby.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I had a miscarriage, two years after I 
                        had Tom.  

           INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - FOUR YEARS AGO

           Katie sits on the edge of an exam table in a bathrobe, 
           crestfallen.  David has pajamas on under his coat.  He takes 
           Katie’s hand.  She has tears in her eyes, and although he’s 
           trying to be strong for her, he’s fighting tears, too.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I guess we stopped trying after that.  In 
                        more ways than one. 

           INT. KIDS’ BATHROOM - BACK TO PRESENT

           Katie is now rinsing Molly’s hair.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I can’t for the life of me remember 
                        telling Molly about it, but we must have, 
                        and she must have mourned it in her own 
                        way.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Did that make you sad?

                                 MOLLY
                        Of course it did.  That was my brother or 
                        sister.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, kind of.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I want to make her feel better, but eight 
                        seems too young for the fetuses and souls 
                        talk.  We only just did Santa Claus.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Anything else?

                                 MOLLY
                        I think I was sad about you and Daddy, 
                        too.

                                 KATIE
                        Why were you sad about us?
                                 MOLLY
                        Because you might get divorced.  And you 
                        will definitely die.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh, Molly.

           Katie is unsure how to console her daughter.

                                 MOLLY
                         (brightly, as if consoling her 
                          mother instead)
                        But I don’t worry about any of that now.  
                        GoodNews made it all go away.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Katie tucks Molly in, kissing her forehead, and watches her 
           drift off to sleep.  Molly’s room seems sweet and safe.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        What has happened to Molly in her first 
                        eight years?  More or less nothing.  We 
                        have protected her from the world as best 
                        we can.  She has two loving parents.  She 
                        has never been hungry.  She’s getting an 
                        education that will prepare her for the 
                        rest of her life, and yet she’s sad.  

           INT. SELF-STORAGE UNIT - THE NEXT DAY

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        And that sadness is not, when you think 
                        about it, inappropriate.  

           Katie is sitting in her storage unit, looking through Molly’s 
           baby things -- receiving blankets, booties, her rattle, pink 
           sleep suits -- things possibly saved for the baby that was 
           not to be.  And Katie is despondent, in part because it’s a 
           little more crowded in there due to the recent addition of 
           the bed from their spare bedroom.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The state of the relationship between her 
                        parents makes her anxious.  She has lost 
                        a loved one.  And a cat.  And she has 
                        realized that such losses are going to be 
                        an unavoidable part of her life in the 
                        future.  
                         (a beat)
                        Apparently, you don’t have to lead a 
                        tragic existence to experience sadness.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You just have to love someone.  

           As this possibly profound thought sinks in, BAD, LIVE ROCK 
           MUSIC shakes the walls and startles Katie, who hits her head 
           on the headboard of the spare bed.

           INT. SELF-STORAGE FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

           Rubbing her head, Katie follows the music to a nearby unit 
           where three teenage boys: a LEAD GUITARIST, DRUMMER and BASS 
           PLAYER, rehearse for a gig that will probably never happen.

                                 KATIE
                        Excuse me?  Excuse me!

           Their music slowly grinds to a messy stop.

                                 LEAD GUITARIST
                        Hey!  How’d we sound?

                                 KATIE
                        Loud.  Can you keep it down?  Please?

                                 DRUMMER
                        Um... no.

                                 LEAD GUITARIST
                        Why do you think we got a storage unit?

                                 KATIE
                        Not for storage, I’m gathering.

                                 LEAD GUITARIST
                        This is the one place where no grown-ups 
                        can tell us to keep it down. 

                                 BASS PLAYER
                        Word!

                                 KATIE
                        But this is the one place where...  I 
                        come here...  I... 

           As they look at her, not understanding or caring:

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  
                         (fist up lamely)
                        Rock on.

           As the band STRIKES UP again...
           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I am a grown-up, which means I should be 
                        able to do what I want in my house.  The 
                        thing is, it doesn’t feel like my house 
                        anymore.  

           Katie sits with Molly and Tom on the couch, almost like one 
           of the kids now.  Molly watches television.  Tom plays with a 
           GameBoy.  Katie reads a magazine.  Suddenly David appears in 
           front of the TV and turns it off.   

                                 DAVID
                        That’s enough TV for today.

                                 KATIE
                        But they were just about to say who’s 
                        getting kicked off.

                                 DAVID
                        We are ready to tell you about our 
                        project!

           David nods to GoodNews, allowing him the honor.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Homeless for the holidays!

                                 KATIE
                        I am not living on the streets.

                                 DAVID
                         (to GoodNews)
                        See, that’s what I thought might happen 
                        with that title.  It sounds like you’ll 
                        be the homeless one.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Alright, we’ll work on that, but the idea 
                        is to take in a homeless person for the 
                        holidays, yeah?

                                 KATIE
                        And this is an ad campaign?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s more grassroots than that.  We want 
                        everyone on our street to invite a 
                        homeless person into their house for a 
                        year.
                                 MOLLY
                        Will we get a homeless person?

                                 KATIE
                         (delicately)
                        Haven’t we got ours already?

                                 MOLLY
                        Who else gets one?

                                 DAVID
                        Anyone who wants one.

           This makes Katie laugh.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Why is that funny?

                                 KATIE
                        Um... it’s not.  Sorry.

                                 DAVID
                        No, why don’t you share the joke.

                                 KATIE
                        --with the class?

           Tom and Katie both laugh now.

                                 DAVID
                         (to Tom)
                        Why are you laughing?

                                 TOM
                         (through giggles)
                        Because.  It’s like Mommy is being 
                        naughty, and you’re the teacher.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, I’m trying to talk about something 
                        important, and she finds it hysterical.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s just... you made it sounds like it’s 
                        this year’s Harry Potter book.  Like 
                        everyone will be scrambling for a 
                        homeless person.  

                                 DAVID
                        Hopefully they will.

           Katie and Tom see that he’s serious and act accordingly.  
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                         (showing Katie the list)
                        Now the way we see it, there are about 
                        forty spare bedrooms on this street.  
                        Isn’t that incredible?  Forty bedrooms, 
                        and thousands of people without a bed.

           Katie looks at David’s list.  It has house numbers and 
           sketchy corresponding information like “Not known,” “Simon 
           and Richard,” “Old lady (old man also?)  Makes no difference 
           if sharing a bed,” “Nice Asian family (4?),” “For Sale,” 
           “Wendy and Ed,” “Not-nice Asian Family (6),” “Amy and Pete?”

                                 GOODNEWS
                        We should shoot to fill ten of them.  I’d 
                        be happy with ten.

                                 DAVID
                        This is pretty hard to say no to, if we 
                        pitch it right.

                                 KATIE
                        You think?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Yeah.  Some people just won’t get it.

                                 KATIE
                        Some people might need their spare rooms 
                        for other things.

                                 DAVID
                        Like what?

                                 KATIE
                        Working.  You used to work in one of our 
                        spare rooms, for example.

                        That’s not a great office.  The feng shui

           Katie can’t wait for David to respond, but all he says is:

                                 DAVID
                        Exactly.  But okay, let’s say five out of 
                        the forty are used as offices.

                                 KATIE
                        David, you have no idea about our 
                        neighbors lives.
                         (re: list)
                        You don’t even know half their names.
                                 DAVID
                        I know more than you do.

                                 KATIE
                        I know Pete is a dog, not a husband.

                                 DAVID
                        I had that as a question mark.

                        I’ll fix that.

                        Honestly, what gives you the right to 
                        tell people how to use their spare rooms?

                        Their mortgages!  These are homes we’re

                        You’re just afraid of the embarrassment.

                                 KATIE
                        That’s not true.

                        It is, though.  I wish they were doing 
                        something more socially acceptable, like 
                        opening a Pinkberry.   

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        How do you plan to go about this?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        We’ll have a party, here at the house.  
                        And David will speak, and it’ll be great.

                                 KATIE
                        Awesome!

           Katie returns to her magazine.  Tom returns to his GameBoy.

           EXT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - MORNING

           Katie arrives at the clinic, happy to be out of the house.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The good news about GoodNews, I no longer 
                        feel like the man of the family.  I don’t 
                        even feel like one of the adults.  Which 
                        is why I look forward to going to work.  
                        Or, at least, I did...

           INT. COMMUNITY CLINIC - RECEPTION DESK - DAY

           A bunch of OLDER GUATEMALAN WOMEN, all dressed in black, 
           crowd the reception desk waving their hands and saying:

                                 OLDER GUATEMALAN WOMEN
                        Hot!  Very hot!

           Then they mime sudden sprightliness, which, since they are 
           not sprightly, is mostly suggested with their eyes and 
           gestures.  They also make faces to show they are sad. 

           REVERSE ANGLE on Katie, Becca and Dawn (the receptionist), 
           who stare politely as if watching a bad play.

                                 DAWN
                         (to Katie)
                        What did you do? 

                                 KATIE
                        Nothing.  Well, I had this guy in.  A 
                        masseur.  For Mrs. Cortez’s back.   

                                 DAWN
                        Is he really hot or something?

                                 KATIE
                        No, no.  He... uses some kind of cream... 
                        that makes you feel... some kind of heat.

           The PHONE RINGS.  Dawn fields calls as Becca confronts Katie.   

                                 BECCA
                        The rumor is that he has hot hands and 
                        he’s a friend of yours.  
                         (sotto)
                        Who was it?  The Mistake?

                                 KATIE
                        The Mistake is gone.  This is Spiritual 
                        Healer Guy, the one who gave David the 
                        brain tumor.  He’s moved in with us.

                                 BECCA
                        But you’re not sleeping with him?
                                 KATIE
                        No!  I thought you might be more 
                        interested in his apparent ability to 
                        heal the sick by touching them than who 
                        he’s sleeping with.

                                 BECCA
                        Not really.  I just figured... hot hands.

                                 KATIE
                        And also, just because I had one affair, 
                        that does not mean I’ll be making a 
                        career of it. 

                                 BECCA
                        Well, you’re gonna need a new career with 
                        this guy around.  We all will. 

           Becca leaves to attend to a patient.  Dawn taps Katie on the 
           shoulder.

                                 DAWN
                        Dr. Carr, you have a call on Line One.

                                 KATIE
                        Who is it?

                                 DAWN
                        The principal’s office.

                                 KATIE
                         (wincing)
                        Did they say what it’s regarding?

                                 DAWN
                         (delicately)
                        Apparently Tom was caught stealing. 

                                 KATIE
                         (disbelieving)
                        Tom?  My Tom?  

                                 DAWN
                        Dr. Carr, I’ve got a roomful of 
                        Guatemalan grannies to deal with, so--

                                 KATIE
                        Right.  I’ll take it in my office.

           Katie starts to leave.
                                 DAWN
                         (stopping her)
                        No, no, wait!  What do I tell them?

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  What.  Yes.  Well... at the drug 
                        store, you can get, you know, those rubs, 
                        like Icy Hot.  That might achieve the 
                        same thing.  Maybe you could write the 
                        name down on a piece of paper for them: I-
                        C-Y... 
                         (to the women, brightly)
                        Alright?  Good.

           Katie hurries off to take the call, trying to appear in 
           control.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE on the GameBoy that Tom had earlier.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Tom doesn’t own a GameBoy.  I knew this, 
                        and so did David.  And yet, we both saw 
                        him playing with one last night and 
                        didn’t give it a second thought.  

           The GameBoy sits on the desk between David, Katie, Tom and 
           the principal, JEANIE FIELD, a kind woman, who up until now 
           enjoyed the fact that Tom and Molly weren’t problem children.

                                 JEANIE
                        There’s more.

           She dumps a bag out on the desk, revealing some DVDs (games 
           and music), some Pokemon stuff, an LA Dodgers t-shirt, a half-
           eaten bag of gummy worms and an envelope of photos from 
           someone else’s family trip to Disneyland.  

                                 KATIE
                         (looking through the photos)
                        We never went to...  Who are...  What did 
                        you want these for?  

           Tom just shrugs.  He’s hunched up in his chair, hugging 
           himself.  He won’t make eye contact with anyone in the room.

                                 JEANIE
                        He’s basically been taking anything 
                        that’s not nailed down.  Have his home 
                        circumstances changed in any way?

           As Katie considers how to answer this...
                                 DAVID
                        Yes.  We’ve had some difficulties.  To 
                        begin with--

                                 KATIE
                         (quickly)
                        Tom, will you wait outside, please?

           Tom doesn’t move, so Katie takes his hand and marches him out 
           of the room. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My newest problem: David doesn’t get 
                        embarrassed anymore.  About anything.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Katie plants Tom in a chair outside the office.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        He views shame as just another bourgeois 
                        hang-up we’re better off without.  

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Katie returns just in time to hear this:

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sure Katie won’t mind me saying that 
                        she had an affair.

                                 KATIE
                        I do mind you saying that, actually.

                                 DAVID
                         (genuinely baffled)
                        Oh.  
                         (explaining to Jeanie)
                        It was my fault.  I was inattentive and 
                        angry, generally a pain-in-the-ass to 
                        live with.  I didn’t love her enough, or 
                        appreciate her.  But I... my shortcomings 
                        were revealed to me when I met a 
                        spiritual healer, and I’m trying to 
                        change.  Wouldn’t you say I’ve changed, 
                        Katie?

                                 KATIE
                        Oh, you’ve changed.

                                 DAVID
                        And the spiritual healer is currently 
                        staying with us, and we’re... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        ...examining some of our lifestyle 
                        choices... and I’m just thinking out loud 
                        here, but maybe some of this has 
                        unsettled Tom?

                                 JEANIE
                        I’d say that was a possibility, yes.

           There’s a knock on the door and Tom returns.

                                 TOM
                        Have you finished?  I mean, with the 
                        stuff I can’t hear, like about Mom’s 
                        boyfriend and everything?

           Katie looks at her feet.  She didn’t realize Tom knew.

                                 JEANIE
                        Sit down, Tom.

           Tom sits in a chair in the corner so they all have to turn 
           and face him.

                                 JEANIE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been talking about what might have 
                        made you do this.  Whether there’s 
                        anything you’re unhappy about at school, 
                        or at home...

                                 TOM
                         (suddenly and angrily)
                        I haven’t got anything!

                                 JEANIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 TOM
                        I haven’t got anything at home.  He keeps 
                        giving it away.
                         (nods toward his dad)

                                 DAVID
                        Tom, that’s silly.  You’ve got so much.  
                        That’s why we decided together to lose 
                        some of it.

                                 KATIE
                        Wait.  Tom, are you telling me there are 
                        things other than the computer?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.  Tons of stuff.
                                 DAVID
                         (impatient)
                        It wasn’t tons.

                                 KATIE
                        When did this happen?

                                 TOM
                        Last week.  He made us go through our 
                        toys and get rid of half of them.

                                 KATIE
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I address this question to Tom rather 
                        than David, which is indicative of 
                        something.

                                 TOM
                        He told us not to.

                                 KATIE
                        Why did you listen to him?  You know he’s 
                        a loonie tune lately.

           Jeanie stands.

                                 JEANIE
                        Some matters, I think, are better worked 
                        out at home.  But thanks for coming in.

           The Carrs get the hint and start to gather their things.

                                 JEANIE (CONT’D)
                        And Tom?  My cards?

           Tom, caught, puts her business cards back in their holder.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           As Katie and David walk together to their cars, Tom isn’t 
           talking to his parents, and Katie isn’t talking to David.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        David explained that the toys went to the 
                        children’s hospital.

           EXT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - DAY - FLASHBACK

           David, Molly and Tom enter with re-usable burlap grocery bags 
           full of toys.  The doors close behind them.  
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Tom was on board initially, but Molly 
                        raised the stakes, saying it needed to be 
                        toys they actually liked for it to mean 
                        something, and Tom complied, but, 
                        according to David, “might have regretted 
                        it.”

           David, Molly and Tom exit empty-handed, but this time David 
           has to drag Tom away, a la Sophie’s Choice.   

                                 TOM
                         (wailing)
                        I want my remote-controlled helicopter!

           EXT. SCHOOL - BACK TO PRESENT

           They arrive at David’s SUV first, and Tom gets in and closes 
           the door.  David and Katie linger outside for a moment.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m getting lost.  I’m not sure what any 
                        of this is supposed to achieve anymore.

                                 DAVID
                        Any of what?

                                 KATIE
                        You’re turning our kids into weirdos.

                                 DAVID
                        Is it weird to worry about what’s 
                        happening in the world?

                                 KATIE
                        No.  You can worry all you want.  You 
                        just can’t try to fix everything.

                                 DAVID
                        I can try.  You try.  Your clinic serves 
                        people who can’t get help elsewhere.

                                 KATIE
                        Right.  Exactly.  So... I’ve got us 
                        covered.  You can stop. 

                                 DAVID
                        It doesn’t work that way.  You don’t get 
                        into heaven as a plus one.
                                 KATIE
                        This is about heaven?  You’re the one who 
                        said, “Heaven is a marketing hoax, the 
                        ultimate VIP room.  It’s not about 
                        getting in, it’s about keeping people 
                        out.  Peter’s not a saint, he’s a 
                        bouncer!”

                                 DAVID
                         (surprised and touched)
                        You’ve been listening to my podcasts.

                                 KATIE
                        Sometimes.  When I miss you.  

                                 DAVID
                         (tenderly)
                        I’m right here.

                                 KATIE
                        No, the other guy!  My husband, who was 
                        sarcastic and funny and would have hated 
                        you!  I don’t know what to tell people 
                        anymore.  Ava and Ron want to see us for 
                        dinner, and I keep making up excuses.

                                 DAVID
                        Why don’t you invite them to the party?

                                 KATIE
                         (not sure what he’s talking 
                          about, then remembering)
                        Oh, David, please don’t have that party.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s too late.  Invitations went out.  

                                 KATIE
                         (a beat, small)
                        I have a headache.

           David looks at her and grins.  He has another helpful idea. 

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie sits, unhappily, in the “healing room” with GoodNews’ 
           hands on her head as David watches.  Nothing seems to be 
           happening, which makes Katie feel vindicated.   

                                 KATIE
                        Nothing.  I don’t feel anything.
                                 GOODNEWS
                        That’s the problem, yeah?

                                 KATIE
                         (amused)
                        Oh, so it’s my fault it’s not working?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        It’s not your fault, but you’ve got no 
                        juice, spiritually speaking.  You’re like 
                        a dead battery. 

           David nods, as if to say, “See what I’ve been dealing with?”  
           Katie is offended, and also worried it might be true.

                                 GOODNEWS (CONT’D)
                        It’s sad.

                                 KATIE
                        Sad like we can use it, or just sad?

                                 GOODNEWS
                        Just sad.

           Katie nods.  That’s what she figured.

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The house is now decorated for Christmas, the party is 
           underway, and much to Katie’s dismay, David is standing on a 
           chair about to speak to a decent number of NEIGHBORS who are 
           there, seemingly enjoying themselves.  

                                 DAVID
                        Good evening, everyone!

                                 MALCOLM
                        Good evening!

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        This man, Malcolm, formerly known to 
                        David as Pete the dog, appears to be A 
                        Character.  Every party needs one.

           Molly and GoodNews are serving appetizers.  Tom, not 
           supportive of this whole idea, sulks and eats them.

                                 DAVID
                        When our invitation arrived in your 
                        mailbox you probably thought, “What’s the 
                        catch?  Why is this guy we don’t know 
                        from Adam inviting us to a party?
                                 MALCOLM
                        I’m only here for the free booze!

                                 OLD LADY
                         (to David)
                        Can you speak up, please?  

                                 MALCOLM
                        I SAID I’M ONLY HERE FOR THE FREE BOOZE!

           This prompts some laughter, which prompts a 45-ish woman, 
           AMY, to say to the crowd:

                                 AMY
                        Please.  Don’t encourage him.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Amy, Malcolm’s wife.  Seems sweet.  
                        Brought cookies, asked what this was all 
                        about.  I told her it was hard to 
                        explain, but that I was sorry.

           David clears his throat and speaks up.

                                 DAVID
                        I’d love to tell you there isn’t a catch, 
                        but there is.  A big one.  Tonight I’m 
                        going to ask you to change people’s 
                        lives.  And your own life, too. 

                                 RICHARD
                        This isn’t about The Secret, is it?  
                        Because Simon already made me watch the 
                        video.

           Simon punches Richard playfully in the arm.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Simon and Richard, a gay couple who just 
                        moved to our street.  They were pleased 
                        to be invited.  Said they were worried 
                        this neighborhood was homophobic.  Oh, 
                        how they will long for homophobia.   

                                 DAVID
                        How many of you have got a spare bedroom?

                                 MALCOLM
                        It’s where I’m sleeping tonight, I think.  

                                 AMY
                        You got that right.
           A little more laughter from the group.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        David and I used to tease each other like 
                        this.  I used to think it was unseemly to 
                        have our problems leaking out in public, 
                        but maybe it was healthy, because now 
                        nobody’s in on the joke.  Not even us.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, that’s one spare bedroom.  Any 
                        more?

           Most people look into their wine glasses.

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (sotto to Katie)
                        It’s going well, yeah?

           Katie turns and finds herself face to face with GoodNews.  
           She nods vigorously and takes a cheese puff from his tray.

                                 DAVID
                        Here’s the deal.  I’m 41 years old, and 
                        I’ve spent half my life regretting that I 
                        missed the Sixties.  I imagine the 
                        energy; what the music would have sounded 
                        like if you hadn’t heard it a thousand 
                        times before, back when it actually meant 
                        something.  I’ve always been sad that the 
                        world is different now.  But then again, 
                        what have I ever protested?  Other than a 
                        parking ticket?  

           A few laughs and nods from the crowd.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        The thing is, the problems... they’re too 
                        big.  And they’re never going away.  We 
                        can’t change the world.  But we can 
                        change our street.  And maybe if we 
                        change our street, other people will 
                        change theirs, too.  

           Katie is nervous to look around, but she steals a look, and 
           David seems to have everyone’s attention.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We have handpicked ten kids who have it 
                        pretty rough, and need some help.  
                        They’re good kids.  They’re not junkies 
                        or violent or mentally unstable.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        They’re just people who got off track 
                        through no fault of their own.  Maybe a 
                        stepfather was abusive, maybe a parent 
                        died and they couldn’t cope, maybe life 
                        on the street seemed better than the life 
                        they knew... But we can vouch for them.
                         (with purpose)
                        Now, if I can find ten spare bedrooms for 
                        these kids, I’d feel it was the greatest 
                        thing I’d ever done.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Are you taking one?

                                 DAVID
                        Of course we are.  

           This is news to Katie:  We are?

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How could I ask you to do this if I 
                        wasn’t prepared to?  Now, is anyone else 
                        interested?

           To Katie’s amazement, four hands go up: Amy (daring Malcolm 
           to protest), WENDY and ED (in their 50s, standing next to 
           Katie), Simon and Richard (who seem completely in sync on 
           this), and an ASIAN COUPLE who have TWO YOUNG KIDS there.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Four’s no good to me.  I need more.

           Katie can’t believe David’s pushing it, but one more hand 
           goes up.  The old lady.   

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Okay...  Half now.  Half later.

           And with that, the room breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and  
           Katie, despite everything, feels like she could cry the kind 
           of tears you cry at the end of a sappy film.  

                                 WENDY
                        You must be very proud of him.

           Katie smiles politely and says nothing.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie and David are in bed.  David is concerned.

                                 DAVID
                        Is five enough?
                                 KATIE
                        Are you kidding?  I didn’t think we’d get 
                        five people to the party.
                         (a beat)
                        That’s what you’re concerned about?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, why?  What are you concerned about?

                                 KATIE
                        Um, a few things.  Like what if that old 
                        woman who was hard of hearing thought she 
                        was joining a book club?  Or... what if 
                        one of these kids gets desperate and robs 
                        a neighbor blind?  Did you think about 
                        that?  

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 KATIE
                        Are you going to think about it?

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 KATIE
                        Why not?

                                 DAVID
                        Because I want to change the way people 
                        think.  And I can’t change the way people 
                        think if I think like everybody else.  I 
                        want to believe the best of everybody.  
                        Otherwise, what’s the point?

           David kisses her on the forehead, turns out the light, and 
           closes his eyes.  Katie studies him a moment.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Here’s a disturbing thought:  What if 
                        David is not insane?  What if he and 
                        GoodNews are like Jesus and Ghandi, 
                        visionaries we all say we’d love to have 
                        dinner with?  And now I get to have 
                        dinner with them every night... and all I 
                        want to do is talk about which 
                        celebrities have eating disorders like 
                        everybody else.
           EXT. EUCLID STREET - DAY

           An inspiring SONG FROM THE 60s PLAYS (maybe Magic Bus, The 
           Weight, Shelter from the Storm or I’ll Take You There).

           A mini-van rolls up the street, bringing the FIVE TEENS 
           (three boys, two girls) who are moving into the neighborhood.

           Some neighbors who didn’t “adopt” are still out on their 
           porches, waving and welcoming the kids.

           Katie, standing with Molly and Tom, begins to feel like their 
           street is, in fact, special, and David might have done 
           something rather significant here.

           David and GoodNews greet each kid as they get off the bus, 
           and make introductions and point out their new homes. 

           Simon and Richard greet CRYSTAL, a young girl who looks a 
           like she could be anywhere from 12 to 18.  Wendy and Ed meet 
           ROBBIE, 17, who looks like he might be a little scared but 
           hides it with swagger, and as other introductions are made, 
           MONKEY, 18, tall and thin, steps off the bus and David greets 
           him and points to Katie.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - DAY

           Katie is making a pot of tea.  Monkey rolls a cigarette at 
           the table as Tom and Molly watch.

                                 KATIE
                        So... Monkey?  That’s what we should call 
                        you?

                                 MONKEY
                        Monkey works.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that a nickname or...

           Monkey shrugs and keeps rolling his cigarette.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you doing, Monkey?

                                 MONKEY
                        Rolling a cigarette.

                                 MOLLY
                        Do you smoke?

                                 TOM
                        Duh?
           Molly looks at her mother.

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you gonna let him smoke in the house?

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Monkey, SMOKING, home for the night, enters the empty living 
           room and dumps change into the bowl that holds the mail. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        One thing I will say for Monkey.  I don’t 
                        know what he does all day, but sometimes 
                        he leaves me large amounts of change to 
                        cover food and whatnot.  And I accept 
                        this from him, not just because I want 
                        him to feel like a contributing member of 
                        the family, but because he is the only 
                        other contributing member of the family.

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - MORNING

           A SMALL CAMERA CREW from the local news affiliate is there 
           filming.  A pretty reporter, ADRIANA ALVAREZ, stands next to 
           David and GoodNews.  Katie and Monkey are there, along with 
           some of the other teens and neighbors who took them in.

                                 ADRIANA
                        They say charity begins at home, and in 
                        this Santa Monica neighborhood that’s 
                        certainly true.  “Homeless for the 
                        Holidays” was the brainchild of these two 
                        men, David Carr and DJ GoodNews.

           David and GoodNews nod to the camera, a little awkwardly.

                                 ADRIANA (CONT’D)
                        With Christmas less than three weeks 
                        away, these good Samaritans decided--   

                                 ED
                        David!

           Ed pushes his way through the crowd.  A CAMERA MAN gives Ed 
           the signal to please be quiet.

                                 SIMON
                         (whispering)
                        Ed, this is live.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        C’mere, Ed.
                         (welcoming Ed into shot)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GOODNEWS (CONT'D)
                        Ed is one of the people making it all 
                        happen.  He and his wife took in a young 
                        man named Robbie--

                                 ED
                        --and he stole our plasma TV!

                                 ADRIANA
                        You... your TV is gone?

                                 ED
                         (to David, accusatory)
                        Yes.  And so is our microwave, our Tivo 
                        and God knows what else.  

           The crowd, especially those who took in kids, gasp. 

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s not jump to conclusions.  We don’t 
                        know that Robbie did it.   

                                 KATIE
                        Who do you think did it?   

           Everyone turns to look at Katie. 

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  Are we still filming?

                                 DAVID
                         (for Katie’s benefit as much as 
                          for the cameras)
                        The point is, we don’t want to 
                        stereotype.  These are not bad kids.  
                        They’ve had a rough time, and they’re 
                        doing the best they can.  Like Monkey 
                        here.  He’s doing great.  So let’s give 
                        Robbie the benefit of the doubt.

                                 MONKEY
                        Yeah.  I think Robbie did it. 

                                 DAVID
                        But--  Okay--  But, it’s not that simple.  
                        The question becomes... why would a kid 
                        like Robbie do something like that?

                                 MONKEY
                        ‘Cause he’s a lying, thieving piece of 
                        shit.

                                 ADRIANA
                         (quickly into the camera)
                        This is Adriana Alvarez and...

                                 ADRIANA (CONT'D)
                         (not sure how to wrap up)
                        This is Adriana Alvarez.

           INT. DAVID’S HOME OFFICE/RADIO STUDIO - DAY

           David is in his office, head in his hands, when Katie enters 
           holding the cordless phone.  She just got off a call.  
           David’s office has been rearranged since we saw it last.  

                                 KATIE
                        My mom saw us on the news.

                                 DAVID
                         (in need of good news)
                        And?  What did she say about it?  

                                 KATIE
                        Just... that she saw us.  
                         (off David’s disappointed nod)
                        You rearranged in here.

                                 DAVID
                        Better chi. 

                                 GOODNEWS (O.S.)
                         (calling)
                        Monkey’s back.  And he’s got Robbie with 
                        him! 

           David breathes a big sigh of relief, and they head into the 
           living room to see...

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           GoodNews is holding the front door open for Monkey (who 
           carries a Tivo) and a bruised and slightly bloodied Robbie 
           (who carries a microwave).

                                 MONKEY
                        He sold the plasma, but he’ll give ‘em 
                        the money.

                                 KATIE
                        What happened to him?  Is he okay?

                                 MONKEY
                        There was a problem.  I took care of it.

                                 DAVID
                         (not sure what to say)
                        Well... thank you, Monkey.  
           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           David sits on the bed as Katie turns down the covers.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m just so disappointed in them.

                                 KATIE
                        I know.  

                                 DAVID
                        He paid for the TV.  They can’t give him 
                        a second chance?

                                 KATIE
                        You’re disappointed in Wendy and Ed?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  And the rest of them.  They all 
                        want out now.  I thought they were made 
                        of tougher stuff than that.

           Katie doesn’t know what to say.  She’s just about had it.  

           PRE-LAP the BAD BAND PLAYING loudly and badly.

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - MORNING

           CLOSE ON Katie’s jewelry box, sitting on the vanity in the 
           storage unit.  The bad band is playing down the hall, maybe a 
           cover of Foo Fighter’s “The Best of You.”  

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I’m not proud of the fact that I put my 
                        jewelry in storage while Monkey was with 
                        us, but eventually he moved out.  I guess 
                        life on the street was preferable to life 
                        in our house.  I get that.

           Katie sees something tucked in the back of the jewelry box... 

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But I didn’t want to move out.  I wanted 
                        my old life back.  And not the one in 
                        storage.  The one on Euclid Street.

           It’s the CERTIFICATE and BROCHURE for a second honeymoon.  
           Katie knows what she needs to do.

           INT. CARR LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Katie enters, brochure in hand, feeling energized.
                                 KATIE
                         (calling)
                        David?

           She’s greeted by a large, crying 6-year-old, CHRISTOPHER. 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Tom punched me!

           Tom, playing with his Legos, refuses to look up.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m sorry, who are you?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                         (whimpering)
                        Christopher.

           Christopher stands behind Katie as if Tom is a monster who 
           could lunge at him at any second.  

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (proudly)
                        Christopher is Tom’s reversal.

           Katie looks to GoodNews, then to David.  They both stand in 
           the doorway to David’s office, where they often work now.

                                 KATIE
                        Tom’s what?

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (to David)
                        You didn’t tell her about reversals?

                                 DAVID
                        She can be so negative.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m right here!

                         (jazzed to explain)
                        Okay, reversals are about righting a 
                        wrong... undoing something you regret.  
                        For example, Tom hit Christopher, yeah?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Yeah.
                                 DAVID
                        No, the other day, at school, Tom hit 
                        Christopher at recess, so Tom invited 
                        Christopher to the house to--

                                 KATIE
                        Hit him again?

                                 GOODNEWS
                         (still selling the idea)
                        No, to play.  To make up for hitting him.

                                 DAVID
                        This most recent hitting was not part of 
                        the reversal.  

                                 KATIE
                        Right, ‘cause that would be more of a  
                        repetition than a reversal.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        It’s true.
                         (to David)
                        She is a bit negative.

           INT. CARR KITCHEN - THAT EVENING

           Katie is making dinner, taking out her frustration on a 
           carrot she’s chopping when David enters.

                                 DAVID
                        Christopher’s mom was very understanding.     

                                 KATIE
                        He probably gets punched a lot.  Seems 
                        like that kind of kid.  
                         (still chopping)
                        So now what?  How does Tom reverse the 
                        reversal?  Invite Christopher to a movie, 
                        then kick him in the balls?  

                                 DAVID
                        You used to be such a nice person.   

                                 KATIE
                         (nostalgic)
                        I know!  I came home today to do 
                        something nice!

                                 DAVID
                        What?
                                 KATIE
                        I don’t think I can do it now.

                                 DAVID
                        Try.   

           Katie stops chopping and tries to regain her will to save 
           this marriage.

                                 KATIE
                        Okay.  It’s about what I think we should 
                        do for Christmas.

                                 DAVID
                         (as if on the same page)
                        Soup kitchen?

                                 KATIE
                         (she just looks at him, then)
                        You know how I never take time off from 
                        work?  Well, I’m thinking it’s time.  I 
                        found a flight.  There’s a room 
                        available.  The kids can stay with my 
                        parents... 
                         (showing him the brochure)
                        Let’s do this trip now.

                                 DAVID
                        Why now?

                                 KATIE
                        Because we need it.  Desperately.   

                                 DAVID
                        We don’t need it.  There are many people 
                        needier--

                                 KATIE
                        Not for a second honeymoon!  Not for a 
                        final chance to save our marriage!  
                        David, we are in crisis!

                                 DAVID
                        Crisis?  You want to talk about a crisis--

                                 KATIE
                        No!  Not if you’re going to bring up 
                        Darfur, or New Orleans, or anyplace two 
                        feet outside of this kitchen.  Look, I 
                        care about everything you care about, but 
                        I also care about us.  
                                 DAVID
                        I care about us.

                                 KATIE
                        Then go to Hawaii with me.

                                 DAVID
                        But shouldn’t we be with our kids for the 
                        holidays?

                                 KATIE
                        We’ll be back before Christmas Eve, and 
                        by the way, this is all they want for 
                        Christmas: two parents who love each 
                        other.  We owe it to them.  And to 
                        ourselves.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.  It’s a very nice idea.  

           Katie feels hopeful finally.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        But what about my work?

                                 KATIE
                        What work?!

                                 DAVID
                        The work GoodNews and I are doing.  We 
                        just started this reversal thing and I’m 
                        halfway through a book proposal, 
                        nonfiction, called “How to Be Good”--

           Katie just looks at him, disappointed.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like the title?

                                 KATIE
                        David, you wanted until the end of the 
                        year.  The year is ending.  I’m going to 
                        Hawaii to save our marriage.  I hope 
                        you’ll go with me.

           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - DAY

           Katie and Molly are returning from Target.  Molly is in the 
           passenger seat.  There are shopping bags in the back.  Katie 
           is looking out the window as she drives.
                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        In an effort to remain hopeful, I have 
                        purchased every level of sunscreen plus 
                        new swimsuits for myself and David... but 
                        nothing seems to be doing the trick.

           Katie passes a sign that says, “LET GOD RECHARGE YOUR 
           BATTERIES.”  She pulls over to the curb.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why are we stopping here?

           Molly follows Katie’s gaze up the steps of St. Stephen’s...

           EXT. ST. STEPHEN’S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           ...where CHURCHGOERS are going in.  It’s mostly older folks. 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Most people don’t expect a “sign from 
                        God” to be an actual sign, but I guess in 
                        my case, God wasn’t taking any chances.

           INT. ST. STEPHEN’S CHURCH - DAY

           A pretty, little neighborhood church.  Katie and Molly, 
           definitely underdressed, sit in a back pew while an OLDER 
           PARISHIONER reads from Corinthians. 

                                 OLDER PARISHIONER
                        And though I have all faith, so that I 
                        could remove mountains, and have not 
                        charity, I am nothing...

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Most people don’t go to church looking 
                        for a way to bolster an argument with a 
                        spouse, but sometimes you get lucky.

                                 OLDER PARISHIONER
                        Charity suffereth long, and is kind; 
                        charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not 
                        itself, is not puffed up... 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I’ve heard this passage a hundred times, 
                        but I never “understoodeth” it until now.  
                        David is puffed up.  He’s been vaunting 
                        and puffing all over the place.  That’s 
                        why he needs to go to Hawaii, and as soon 
                        as I get home, I will explain this to 
                        him. 
           Katie looks around, feeling very happy with herself.  She 
           spots someone familiar... her brother, Mark.  He senses 
           someone looking, sees her as well. 

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        It’s like meeting in a brothel.  

           EXT. ST. STEPHEN’S CHURCH - DAY

           Katie laughs and nods.  She and Mark are talking outside the 
           church.  Molly plays with another LITTLE GIRL nearby.

                                 KATIE
                        How long have you been going here?

                                 MARK
                        Since I didn’t want a second date with 
                        this woman at St. Vincent’s.  Be so glad 
                        you’re married.

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah, everyone says that.  Until they’re 
                        married. 

                                 MARK
                        How is the marriage?

                                 KATIE
                        Well, tomorrow I might be going on our 
                        second honeymoon alone, so, you know, 
                        terrific.

           Katie tries to play this off as a joke, but saying it aloud 
           puts her on the verge of tears.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Want to go to Hawaii?  You could pass as 
                        David, borrow his driver’s license...

                                 MARK
                        As tempting as it sounds to possibly get 
                        arrested, I can’t take time off.

                                 KATIE
                        Nobody else can pick up golf balls?

                                 MARK
                        I got promoted.  I’m the new Kiddie Pro.  

                                 KATIE
                        Not to be confused with kiddie porn.
                                 MARK
                        Yeah, ha ha, everybody makes that joke.

                                 KATIE
                        Sorry.  What’s a--

                                 MARK
                        Kiddie pro.  I teach kids to play golf.  
                         (sincere)
                        It’s pretty great, actually... to see 
                        them, you know, “get it” for the first 
                        time.  The look on their face when they 
                        hear that THWACK.  We have to get Tom and 
                        Molly out there.

                                 KATIE
                         (off his ear-to-ear smile)
                        You seem -- what’s the word? -- happy.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.  We got to get you some of that.

           She nods, and leans on his shoulder.

           INT. DAVID’S HOME OFFICE/RADIO STUDIO - LATER THAT DAY

           David is working on his book proposal when Katie looks in on 
           him, home from church.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re puffed up.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me?

                                 KATIE
                        Charity vaunteth not itself, is not 
                        puffed up.  I can move mountains, but--

                                 DAVID
                        --if I lack love, then I am nothing.  
                        That’s that Lauryn Hill song.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s Corinthians.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s also Lauryn Hill.   

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know that song, but--
                                 DAVID
                        Yes, you do.  We heard her sing it in 
                        concert at the Bowery Ballroom.

                                 KATIE
                        That was some other tomato.

           David starts looking through his drawers, opening folders...

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Anyhow, I was thinking about the meaning 
                        of--  Are you even listening to me?

           David finds what he’s looking for and hands Katie TWO TICKET 
           STUBS for Lauryn Hill at the Bowery Ballroom, September 1997.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  Okay.  We saw Lauryn Hill.  

                                 DAVID
                        It was our third date.  You were wearing 
                        a blue...
                         (indicating a top he can’t 
                          describe, but he can see)
                        ...thing with a thing.  We got a fresh 
                        cannoli in Little Italy after.  You were 
                        just starting your residency at N.Y.U., 
                        but you said you wanted to go back to 
                        L.A. to practice.  And I knew one day-- 

                                 KATIE
                        You’d hate me?

                                 DAVID
                         (tenderly)
                        I don’t hate you.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t hate you, too.  

           A moment.  This is as good as it gets for them right now.  
           Katie looks at the tickets, amazed David saved something, 
           amazed he was sentimental.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        So... will you come to Hawaii with me?

                                 DAVID
                        Can’t it wait?

                                 KATIE
                        Can’t your work wait?
                                 DAVID
                         (frustrated she doesn’t see it)
                        Katie, what I’m doing right now... it’s 
                        important.

                                 KATIE
                        That’s puffed up.  That’s what I came 
                        home to tell you.  Charity is not 
                        supposed to be... vaunted... because 
                        without love...  I’m paraphrasing, but 
                        the point is, Hawaii is more important.  
                        At least it is to me.

           Flustered, she drops the stubs on his desk and leaves.    

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           As Katie finishes packing, she takes a framed WEDDING PHOTO 
           off the night stand and looks at it.  In the picture, she and 
           David are looking lovingly into each other’s eyes.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Look at these idiots.  We were completely 
                        unprepared.  What nobody tells you is...

           INT. CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK/FANTASY, TEN YEARS AGO

           A younger Katie and David, just as they were in the photo, 
           listen intently as the PRIEST tells them the truth:

                                 PRIEST
                        Some days you will despise your spouse.  
                        You will look at him and regret ever 
                        exchanging a word with him, let alone a 
                        ring and bodily fluids.

           The younger Katie and David struggle to remain optimistic as 
           the priest continues:

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        And although you can’t imagine having 
                        affairs... when you get to that stage in 
                        life -- and everyone gets there sooner or 
                        later -- you won’t think about the sick 
                        feeling you get in your stomach when 
                        you’re conducting them, their inherent 
                        unhappiness...

           INT. SAN DIEGO HOTEL BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK/FANTASY

           Katie and Stephen, wearing name tags, the night they met.
                                 STEPHEN
                         (takes her hands in his)
                        I can make you feel loved.  I can also 
                        make you feel ashamed, guilty, dirty, 
                        dishonest, diseased... like a hooker, 
                        except you won’t be getting paid.  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK/FANTASY (SAME AS BEFORE)

           The Priest is still talking.  He’s on a roll.

                                 PRIEST
                        ...nor do you think about your husband 
                        waking up in the morning and being 
                        someone you don’t recognize.  If anyone 
                        thought about any of these things, no one 
                        would ever get married.  In fact, the 
                        impulse to marry would come from the same 
                        place as the impulse to drink a bottle of 
                        bleach, something we should ignore rather 
                        than celebrate.  

           Burt, seated next to Freda, nods thoughtfully, as if moved by 
           a good sermon.  PAN the WEDDING GUESTS, including Mark, all 
           getting increasingly depressed.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        So what do we do?  We kid ourselves that 
                        it’s possible to enter these partnerships 
                        and be faced only with “cute” problems -- 
                        she always burns the cookies, he leaves 
                        socks on the floor -- then eventually we 
                        become unhappy and take Prozac and get 
                        divorced and die alone.

           Katie and David are now overwhelmed with concerns.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        You may kiss the bride.

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - AS BEFORE

           Katie sets the photo down.  She zips up her suitcase as 
           LAURYN HILL’S “TELL HIM” STARTS TO PLAY.

                                 LAURYN HILL
                        LET ME BE PATIENT, LET ME BE KIND, MAKE 
                        ME UNSELFISH, WITHOUT BEING BLIND...  

           Katie leaves David an e-ticket and the hotel brochure with a 
           note: “Save the world, but first save our marriage.”

           The SONG CONTINUES over the following montage.
           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           A full plane.  A STEWARDESS asks Katie if the seat next to 
           her is taken.  Katie hesitates, looks toward the front of the 
           plane, hopeful, believing...

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        I just had a feeling he’d show.  

           Suddenly a man rushes on board, the LAST PASSENGER before the 
           doors close!  Katie stands.  But it’s not David. 

           Katie indicates to the stewardess that the seat is open, and 
           a VERY LARGE MAN sits down next to her and smiles.

                                 LAURYN HILL
                        THOUGH I MAY SUFFER, I’LL ENVY IT NOT, 
                        AND ENDURE WHAT COMES, CAUSE HE’S ALL 
                        THAT I GOT...  

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HUALALAI - LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

           One of the most beautiful, romantic places on earth.  Katie 
           steps out of a limo and is greeted by two smiling HAWAIIAN 
           WOMEN, each with a LEI.  She explains she’s alone.  They look 
           sad for her, then give her both leis.

                                 LAURYN HILL (CONT’D)
                        AND TELL HIM... TELL HIM I NEED HIM, TELL 
                        HIM I LOVE HIM... AND IT’LL BE ALRIGHT... 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HUALALAI - SUITE - SUNSET

           Katie tips the BELLHOP and is alone in her gorgeous room.  
           Maybe it will be alright.  Who doesn’t love a nice hotel?

           She opens the shuttered windows.  What a view!  Palm trees.  
           Ocean.  And a WEDDING.  On the lawn.  Right outside her room. 

           She closes the shutters.

                                 LAURYN HILL
                        NOW I MAY HAVE FAITH TO MAKE MOUNTAINS 
                        FALL, BUT IF I LACK LOVE, THEN I AM 
                        NOTHING AT ALL... 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HUALALAI - LAWN - DAY

           Katie tries a hula class.  It’s mostly YOUNG GIRLS and her.  
           The HULA INSTRUCTOR moves her hips at an impossibly fast 
           speed.  Katie tries it, and is sort of enjoying it, but 
           misses having somebody to laugh with. 
                                 LAURYN HILL
                        I KNOW I’M IMPERFECT, AND NOT WITHOUT 
                        SIN, AND NOW THAT I’M OLDER, ALL CHILDISH 
                        THINGS END...  

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HUALALAI - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Katie sits at an outdoor table, trying to be okay with being 
           alone.  A WAITER brings her some delicious-looking food.  
           Around her, COUPLES in love, laughing, kissing.  Katie asks 
           for her food to go.

                                 LAURYN HILL
                        I CAN GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING I POSSESS, BUT 
                        WITHOUT LOVE, THEN I HAVE NO HAPPINESS. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Katie walks on an empty strip of beach, carrying her camera, 
           enjoying her time away from all the couples.  

           Up ahead she sees a SURFER GUY giving something to his BIKINI-
           CLAD GIRLFRIEND, who SCREAMS.  It’s a ring.  They kiss.  

           Katie starts to turn the other way, but the guy spots her; 
           gestures if she would be willing to take their picture.

                                 LAURYN HILL
                        I’LL NEVER BE JEALOUS AND I WON’T BE TOO 
                        PROUD, ‘CAUSE LOVE IS NOT BOASTFUL, AND 
                        LOVE IS NOT LOUD... 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HUALALAI - SUITE - EVENING

           Katie looks at the pictures on her digital camera, her room 
           service dinner beside her.

           Pictures of that couple’s engagement... then pictures from 
           Halloween of the kids, Tom dressed as Spiderman, Molly as a 
           princess... pictures David took of Katie where she looks 
           annoyed... a sweet picture of David and the kids... snapshot 
           moments of a happy family...

                                 LAURYN HILL (CONT’D)
                        AND TELL HIM... TELL HIM I NEED HIM, TELL 
                        HIM I LOVE HIM... AND IT’LL BE ALRIGHT...

           Katie starts packing her things.  She’s going home.

           INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - NIGHT

           Katie tries to find an earlier flight back to Los Angeles.  
           Everything is booked.   
           INT. AIRPORT CONCOURSE - NIGHT

           Katie sleeps with her head on her suitcase next to a sad 
           Hawaiian-themed Christmas tree.   

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Katie is in the back of a crowded flight.  Below she sees:  
           Freeways... the inviting SMOG of sprawling Los Angeles.  
           Katie smiles, happy to be home.  

           EXT. CARR HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Katie finally arrives at her house.  There are two cars in 
           her driveway (one nice, one not), so she parks on the street.

           As she approaches, she can see through the dining room window 
           lots of people having Chinese take-out: David, GoodNews, the 
           kids, Monkey and a few more she doesn’t recognize.

           It’s a motley crew, but it’s her crew, and Katie no longer 
           wants to be on the outside looking in.  

           David sees her and breaks into a big smile.  She smiles back.  
           The kids see her and run to the door to meet her.  THE MUSIC 
           ENDS.

           INT. CARR DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Katie and David catch up as this odd group finishes their 
           take-out dinner.  Tom sits on Katie’s lap.  

                                 DAVID
                        So you missed us?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  I didn’t want to be in Hawaii with 
                        strangers.  I wanted to be home with 
                        strangers.  Who are these people?

                                 TOM
                        Reversals.  

           David looks at Katie.  Is she going to be critical?

                                 KATIE
                        Hey, this is the new, relaxed and fully 
                        supportive me.  This is my reversal. 

                                 DAVID
                         (smiles, then)
                        Well, it was Molly’s idea to invite 
                        Monkey.
                                 KATIE
                         (trying to stay positive)
                        To move back in with us, or...

                                 DAVID
                        Just for dinner.  She felt badly that she 
                        never said goodbye.  And GoodNews invited 
                        Cantata.

           He nods in the direction of a busty, redheaded woman, 
           CANTATA, 35, who is sitting next to GoodNews and finishing a 
           large glass of wine.

                                 TOM
                        His sister.  

                                 KATIE
                        Ah, see, he didn’t mention that when he 
                        introduced her.

                                 DAVID
                        They had a falling out eight years ago, 
                        didn’t speak that whole time, but we 
                        tracked her down, and here she is!

                                 KATIE
                         (trying too hard maybe)
                        Yay!  And that couple I met briefly...

           She nods toward a couple talking to Monkey and Molly... NIGEL 
           RICHARDS, 41, good looking, expensive clothes, and his young, 
           beautiful Polish girlfriend, BASIA, in a hot party dress.

                                 DAVID
                        Nigel Richards and Basia.  He’s my 
                        reversal.  

                                 KATIE
                        What are you reversing?

                                 DAVID
                        I used to beat him up in grade school 
                        back in Brooklyn.  He was this awkward, 
                        chubby kid, sort of my Christopher.  I 
                        always felt terrible about it, and I’d 
                        heard he was here in Los Angeles--

                                 KATIE
                        I love that.  Should we go talk to him?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s... okay.  I talked to him already.
           Katie notes something strange in David’s tone.  But it’s too 
           late -- Nigel sees them looking at him and brings Basia over.

                                 NIGEL
                        David, this was... really nice, but I’ve 
                        got some other holiday parties I better 
                        make an appearance at.  You know, 
                        business stuff.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry about the misunderstanding.  

                                 NIGEL
                        Hey, a dinner party is still a party.

                                 BASIA
                        We just thought big bar, big band...

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  No.

           Katie now understands some of the awkwardness; tries to help.

                                 KATIE
                        What is your business, Nigel?

                                 NIGEL
                        I run Yahoo.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh.  So you’re doing well.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, he’s doing well.

                                 MOLLY
                        And Basia was in Sports Illustrated.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, she’s a swimsuit model... so...

           Katie smiles.  This almost seems like the old David who 
           actually got jealous and had flaws.  Then suddenly: 

                                 GOODNEWS
                        I never called the police!  That was Mom!

                                 CANTATA
                        Fuck off.

                                 GOODNEWS
                        No, you fuck off!  YOU fuck off!  
           Cantata grabs the bottle of wine and leaves.  GoodNews goes 
           to his room.  Monkey is covering Molly’s ears.  Nigel smiles 
           at David.

                                 NIGEL
                         (sarcastic)
                        Again, thanks for the swell party.

           David PUNCHES Nigel in the nose.  Basia SCREAMS.  Monkey and 
           the kids are speechless. 

           INT. KATIE AND DAVID’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Katie and David are in bed.  David is icing his hand.

                                 DAVID
                        You know the worst part about tonight?

                                 KATIE
                        Hard to choose, I imagine.

                                 DAVID
                         (laughs, then)
                        I actually enjoyed punching him.

                                 KATIE
                        Some people just need to be punched.  
                        Tom’s words, not mine.   

                                 DAVID
                        As long as I’ve taught my son something.

                                 KATIE
                        David... that was sarcastic.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 KATIE
                        You don’t know how much I’ve missed your 
                        sarcasm.  And everything else about you.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re the reason this all started, you 
                        know.  I wanted to prove that I could be 
                        a better person.   

                                 KATIE
                        And somehow... the better you were, the 
                        worse I was by comparison.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s how I used to feel all the time.
           A moment as Katie realizes she sort of cast him that way.

                                 KATIE
                        So what will you and GoodNews do next?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.  Maybe nothing.  

                                 KATIE
                        You can’t fault him for tonight.  He’s 
                        only human.  And for some people...
                         (herself included)
                        ...it’s easier to help strangers than 
                        family.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not that.  I don’t really believe in 
                        what we’re doing anymore.  I haven’t for 
                        a while.

                                 KATIE
                        So, you might just... stop?

                                 DAVID
                        I might still write the book.  Or is that 
                        crazy?

                                 KATIE
                        No, I think it’s great. 

                                 DAVID
                         (a beat)
                        I still care.  So I guess you keep trying 
                        until you believe again.  

                                 KATIE
                        Like a marriage.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 KATIE
                        David, I’m sorry I stopped trying.  I’m 
                        sorry I put you through so much.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve put you through some things, too.

                                 KATIE
                        But you were trying.  I was... a dead 
                        battery.  Just watching, and judging, and 
                        feeling sorry for myself in our Hawaiian 
                        hotel suite.
                                 DAVID
                        How was it?  Swanky?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.  And lonely.  Next time we should 
                        definitely take a romantic vacation 
                        together.

                                 DAVID
                        But what would we do?  Just a lot of 
                        this?

           He kisses her, sweetly at first, then passionately...

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        For Christmas I told David I wanted my 
                        family back.  And that’s what I got. 

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        GoodNews found another place to live.

           GoodNews is sleeping on the floor of the storage unit 
           enjoying the sounds of the BAD BAND PLAYING down the hall.  
           They’re actually getting better.  As their MUSIC CONTINUES...

           INT. ST. STEPHEN’S CHURCH - DAY

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        We stopped trying to fix people's lives.  
                        We left that in the hands of God.  

           Katie and Molly bring Becca to St. Stephen’s, where they “run 
           into” Mark.  Katie acts like it’s a huge coincidence.  Mark 
           is happy to see Becca again; invites her to sit by him.

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Well, for the most part.  

           EXT. EUCLID STREET - DAY

           Richard and Simon are outside gardening... 

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        And some seeds of change that we planted 
                        in the winter...

           ...with Crystal (looking her age, 14) who apparently stayed.  
                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...were still blooming in the spring.  It 
                        was just the one girl.  But that’s 
                        something.

           INT. TOM’S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        And our family was back on solid ground.  

           The light fixtures RATTLE.  

                                 KATIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Sort of.

           Tom’s Humpty Dumpty book FALLS off a shelf, waking Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Mommy?  Daddy?

           Katie rushes in and picks Tom up.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s okay, honey.  I’m right here.    

           David rushes in, carrying a sleepy Molly.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s going on?  Is God angry?  Is this 
                        the do-over?!   

                                 KATIE
                        No, no, no.  It’s just an earthquake.

           As Molly and Tom react, scared...

                                 DAVID
                        Under the mattress.  Let’s go.

           David pulls Tom’s mattress on top of them as toys CRASH down.

                                 TOM
                        All my stuff is breaking!

                                 DAVID
                        Not all of it.  Most of it I gave away.

           David grins at Tom.  Tom is still scared, but has to laugh.  
           Molly and Katie laugh, too.  They huddle together, laughing, 
           as things around them break, but the family is not broken.
           INT. KATIE’S PRIUS - SUNSET - ANOTHER DAY

           And as the sun sets, the Carrs return from Disneyland.  David 
           is driving, Katie in the passenger seat.  The kids are in the 
           back, wearing mouse ears, fast asleep, bathed in gold light.  
           Katie looks at her husband, who looks handsome and happy.

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        The thing is, when you hate your husband, 
                        you can’t remember how you could ever 
                        love him.  And when you love him again, 
                        you can’t remember how you could ever 
                        hate him.  Love, whether you’re married 
                        or single, demands a certain amount of 
                        emotional amnesia.  Much like the 405.  

           EXT. 405 FREEWAY ON-RAMP - CONTINUOUS (INTERCUT)

           Katie’s Prius climbs up the freeway on-ramp, almost like 
           they’re getting on a ride.   

                                 KATIE (V.O.)
                        Despite all the pain it’s caused you in 
                        the past, you are ever hopeful that this 
                        time, because it’s 7pm on a Saturday, 
                        because it’s not a holiday weekend, 
                        because you’re feeling lucky... this 
                        time, There Will Be No Traffic.

           Katie watches as they reach the top of the ramp, anticipation 
           building, until she sees... GRIDLOCK for miles.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Nooooooooo!

           Katie is deflated.  Almost despondent.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s okay.  We’re a carpool.

           David maneuvers rather magnificently through lane after lane 
           of thick, annoying traffic until they reach their lane.  The 
           carpool lane.  Which has no traffic at all.  

           Katie smiles at David.  And the kids.  Her carpool.  She’s so 
           happy she’s could almost cry. 

           EXT. 405 NORTH - SUNSET

           Katie’s Prius ZOOMS along, past those less fortunate, and 
           KEEPS MOVING as MUSIC COMES UP and CREDITS ROLL.

                                    THE END
