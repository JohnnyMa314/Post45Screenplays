                 And he gets rid of these dark thoughts.
                 And what could he say,
                 And what could he do,
                 That's any better?

                        To My Beloved Friend.  I am writing 
                        you this mail after several 
                        internal battles in me, if I am 
                        doing the right thing.  Though I 
                        have not met you before, I believe 
                        one has to risk confiding in 
                        someone, to succeed sometimes in 
                        life.

           A YOUNG AFRICAN MAN’S FACE, looking right at us.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My name is Joseph Otumbo, and it is 
                        my pleasure to contact you for a 
                        business venture which I intent do 
                        establish in your country.

           He grins, shit-eating style.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRIBAL CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           DRUMS beat and NAKED WOMEN with huge breasts dance and some 
           animal or person is roasted over a spit.  Joseph sits 
           patiently listening to an older man, presumably his FATHER.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Last year my father placed me in 
                        charge of assignment to seek a 
                        reliable individual/company who can 
                        assist us to invest the sum of 
                        $138,000,000 into a viable and 
                        lucrative business.  

           Joseph nods attentively as Father lectures him and points to 
           BURLAP SACKS OF CASH stacked to the side.
                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I promised to help him, but before 
                        I secured the reliable, my father 
                        and mother were kidnapped and 
                        killed by unknown gun men who stole 
                        almost all of the money.

           Suddenly there are GUNMEN coming in a Jeep and shooting 
           everyone and grabbing the money and those naked women are 
           running and the roasted animal crashes into the fire--

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My father’s last wish, before he 
                        was kidnapped and killed by unknown 
                        gun men, was I would use the rest 
                        of the money to do something good 
                        for the people who need it.

           Father is held by the gunmen, but still has time to explain 
           this to Joseph, who is holding the remaining sack of money. 

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He also said that he regretted that 
                        he was always hostile to people and 
                        only focused on business.

           When Father finishes they start to lead him away, but Father 
           turns back one more time, a lot on his mind--

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And he also said and that there is 
                        more to life than just wanting to 
                        have or make all the money in the 
                        world.

           Joseph nods, taking this wisdom to heart.  Father finally 
           tells the gunmen he is finished talking and they can go, so 
           one of them grabs a machete and chops his head off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY (MOS)

           Joseph sits across the desk from A DOCTOR in his office.  He 
           looks anxious.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Now I don’t want you to feel sorry 
                        for me, because I believe everyone 
                        will die some day.  I know this to 
                        be true because on this day, I have 
                        been diagnosed with Ideopathic 
                        Pulmonary Fibrosis.
           Doctor tells him this, accompanied by a big drawing of LUNGS.  

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This is a terminal illness which 
                        affects the lungs.  It has defiled 
                        all forms of medical treatment, and 
                        right now I only have about a few 
                        months to live, according to 
                        medical experts.

           Joseph tries to ask a question, but is consumed by a HACKING 
           COUGHING FIT.  As Joseph continues to cough, the doctor pulls 
           out a large MONTHLY CALENDAR on an easel, trying to pin down 
           Joseph’s exact date of death.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY (MOS)

           Joseph stands on a stage.  He wears a suit but there is an 
           oxygen tank next to him.  As flashbulbs POP, he hands a GIANT 
           CHECK to someone.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Now that God is about to call me, I 
                        have decided to give to charity 
                        organizations, as I want this to be 
                        one of the last good deeds I do on 
                        earth.  So far I have distributed 
                        to Algeria--

           And we see an ALGERIAN accept the check, and the others--

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --Sudan, Bulgaria, and Europe.

           For Europe it is a group of people.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Joseph is at a table, trying to write out another giant 
           check.  But he is coughing so violently that he cannot hold 
           the giant marker to do it.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        But my health is failing and there 
                        is nothing much I can do towards 
                        achieving this last wish of mine, 
                        all by myself because of my 
                        bedridden state in hospital.
           Joseph falls to the ground.  DOCTORS and NURSES rush in to 
           revive him.  It is very traumatic and exciting.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Basically a bank.

                        What I want is to make you the next 
                        of kin/beneficiary of the ramining 
                        money and thereafter distribute the 
                        money to the less privileged and 
                        hungry.

           VAULT under heavy guard and with great ceremony.

                        The total ramining huge cash 
                        deposit is $3,500,000 that I have 
                        with a security company abroad.

           Joseph is declining.  He is hooked up to a respirator and 
           many other tubes.  His eyes are wide, and he blinks 
           irregularly and very exaggerated.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        I have set aside 30% for your time, 
                        services, and expensives.  My 
                        beloved friend please if you can 
                        perform this task, please do not 
                        hesitate to write telling me about 
                        your passion to help the less 
                        fortunate.  Yours sincerely, Joseph 
                        Otumb--

           He blinks again.  REVEAL a NURSE holding a small board with 
           the ALPHABET and pointing to letters.  When Joseph blinks, 
           she stops at certain letter and types it onto a LAPTOP:

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --o.

           The nurse hits SEND and we cut:

                        Dear Joseph.  Thank you so much for 
                        your email.

           INT. PATRICK’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Quiet and dim.  We PAN ACROSS the room towards the blue light 
           of the computer screen, hearing the keyboard as we see: 
           framed photos of a SMALL BOY on a FISHING TRIP, a stack of 
           UNOPENED BILLS, a bottle of GLENLIVET, more empty than not...

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        I won’t take up too much of your 
                        time, as it sounds like you’ve got 
                        your hands full.  With the gunmen 
                        and the money and the cancer and 
                        all.

           At his desk: PATRICK KEMP.  Handsome at mid-life but a bit on 
           the ropes, sipping at a scotch that is not his first, staring 
           at the screen pleased with his own wit, intently studying the 
           glow as if all of life’s answers will be found there.  

           But first: he reconsiders.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  That was rude.  You’ve 
                        taken the time to write to me, and 
                        offer me a business venture, and 
                        you deserve better than that.  Even 
                        if you’re not real.  And I get 20 
                        emails just like yours every day.

           Patrick pours some more scotch.  Stretches.  Looks over at 
           the unopened stack of real mail, and then back at the screen.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But let’s not worry about that just 
                        now.  If we’re going to work 
                        together and do some good in the 
                        world, why don’t I tell you a 
                        little about myself?

                        My name is Patrick Kemp.  I’m 40 
                        years old and I live in a place 
                        called Naperville, Illinois.  It’s 
                        about 30 miles west of Chicago, 
                        right in the middle of America.  

           He drives in a residential/suburban area on a nice fall day.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Chicago’s really big but Naperville 
                        is still a pretty big place on its 
                        own.  The traffic isn’t bad and the 
                        schools are pretty good, and they 
                        just opened a second Costco over in 
                        Downer’s Grove.

                        Do they have Costco in Nigeria, 
                        Joseph?  Probably not.  It’s this 
                        store where you can get anything 
                        you want in, like, enormous 
                        quantities and at a pretty good 
                        price.  I mean trash bags, 
                        rugelach, vitamins, or a gallon of 
                        yellow mustard.

           Patrick picks up a MUSTARD-- and sees it is pre-packaged with 
           a second.  He almost drops it.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Wait not just one gallon-- two of 
                        them, wrapped in this fucking 
                        impossible shrink wrap bullshit so 
                        you can’t even lift it-- 

           He’s at the REGISTER now arguing with the CHECKOUT GIRL--

                        --and don’t even think of going up 
                        to the register with just one, 
                        because the God Damn Costco Nazis 
                        won’t let--

           And now he’s arguing with a MANAGER, they look beyond them, 
           where a STOCKBOY is holding up the left-behind gallon of 
           mustard covered in MANGLED SHRINKWRAP.  Patrick is busted.

                        Anyway that’s not the point.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        I’m Patrick Kemp, Deputy Manager 
                        for Financial Planning at First 
                        Midwestern Bank. 

           INT. PATRICK’S OFFICE - DAY (MOS)

           Not special but a nice view of the parking lot.  Across from 
           him, a young COUPLE, the wife pregnant, Patrick charming them 
           and laying out various financial options.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        I deal mostly with first time home 
                        owners and young investors.  I get 
                        to help people achieve their 
                        financial dreams, or at least get a 
                        good head start on them.  Kind of 
                        like you, I guess.

           The couple looks overwhelmed but Patrick expertly tells a 
           joke and puts them at ease.  They smile, relieved.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Which reminds me, Joseph... how did 
                        you find me?  What made you think I 
                        might be the kind of person who 
                        would be receptive to your plans?  
                        Did you know how much we have in 
                        common?  Not just how we help 
                        people, but... well...

           LATER Patrick shakes hands and leads them out of the office, 
           nodding to his SECRETARY-- another job well done.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I need to be honest with you, 
                        Joseph.  I too have had a bit of a 
                        setback lately.
           But then Patrick looks up and sees his boss FLEMING (50s, 
           white) shaking hands with JEFFERSON (30s, black) and leading 
           Jefferson out of his office...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FLEMING’S OFFICE - (LATER THAT) DAY

           Patrick shakes hands with Fleming and sits down across from 
           him.  Upper-middle management, distracted WASP prick.  Golf 
           clubs lean against his shitty corporate black leather couch.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        You see, I was up for this 
                        promotion.  Actually I wasn’t “up 
                        for it,” it was mine.  I was moving 
                        up from Deputy Manager for FP to 
                        Junior Vice President.  

           Patrick sits down.  Nervous.  Fleming is laughing into the 
           phone as he finishes up a call.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I would have been supervising 
                        several branches instead of 
                        managing just one.  I’m not going 
                        to lie, Joseph.  The salary bump 
                        was significant.  Plus an expense 
                        account, a week at the regional 
                        office timeshare in Hilton Head-- 
                        the works, really.

                                 FLEMING
                        I’m going with Jefferson.

                                 PATRICK
                        Jefferson?

           Fleming squints, trying to put his grand thoughts into words.

                                 FLEMING
                        You’ve done great work, don’t get 
                        me wrong.  But it’s a different 
                        time, Patrick.  A different world.  
                        Things are moving so fast.  And in 
                        this fast-paced world, we need 
                        someone--

                                 PATRICK
                        Black?

                                 FLEMING
                        Bold.
                                 PATRICK
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that.  
                        Tony’s a great guy--

                                 FLEMING
                        Did you know his name’s not really 
                        “Tony?”  Or “Anthony?”  It’s 
                        Antoine.  He grew up in Belgium.  

                                 PATRICK
                        I didn’t know that.

                                 FLEMING
                        That’s because he doesn’t talk 
                        about it.  But he’s so worldly.  
                        He’s been all over the world.  It’s 
                        a kind of multicultural perspective 
                        this company needs right now.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Didn’t he move to Pittsburgh when 
                        he was three?

                                 FLEMING
                        But he goes back.  It’s in his 
                        blood, Patrick.  It’s like a 
                        calling for these people.

                                 PATRICK
                        Belgians?

                                 FLEMING
                        Jefferson is really gonna help this 
                        company grow.  And move forward.  
                        Into the fast different future 
                        world.

           Patrick isn’t sure how to respond to this.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  They’ll be other 
                        positions, you know that.  You’ve 
                        been here long enough.

           Fleming is joking but for Patrick it stings.  He nods, smiles 
           politely, gets up to leave the office.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        So instead of me, it was Jefferson 
                        who was “movin on up,” as they say.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That’s either funny to you or it’s 
                        not, Joseph, depending on how much 
                        American television from thirty 
                        years ago you get in Nigeria.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           BOYS in early teens play quasi-competitive soccer as 
           overbearing PARENTS watch from a safe distance.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        That was last week, Joseph.  But 
                        I’m still pretty pissed.  I can 
                        live without the job, but let’s be 
                        honest.  I was counting on the 
                        money.

           Patrick sits on the hillside watching, cheering, but 
           distracted.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m not rich by any standard, but I 
                        do like nice things.  I collect 
                        hockey memorabilia, for instance.  
                        And I like a good steak or cigar 
                        now and then.  But there were also 
                        some nice things -- big ticket 
                        items -- that I wanted, and I can’t 
                        get them now.  

           He checks his Blackberry, then ignores it.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Can I live without them?  Of 
                        course.  But in my mind I already 
                        bought them.  It’s hard to go back 
                        from that.  And yes, if you must 
                        know, a couple of them I actually 
                        did buy.  Like my new car.  So what 
                        am I supposed to do now, return it?  
                        And go back to a lesser car?  Then 
                        people will say “what happened to 
                        your new car?  Why are you driving 
                        that older, not as nice car?” It’s 
                        humiliating, Joseph.  

           A dark-haired BOY (10) has the ball, dribbles with some 
           skill, shoots and misses.  Patrick’s son LIAM.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s my son, Liam.
           The game ENDS.  Liam is with his mother DIANE (40).  
           Practical and easygoing.  Patrick approaches.

                                 DIANE
                        Hey.

                                 PATRICK
                        Hey yourself.

           She studies him.  Maybe she sees the bad news on his face.

                                 DIANE
                        Everything okay?

                                 PATRICK
                        Fine.
                             (to Liam)
                        You were close on that last one.

                                 LIAM
                        It wasn’t that close.

                                 PATRICK
                        Really?  From my angle you just 
                        barely missed.

           Liam looks at him.

                                 LIAM
                        Come here, Dad.

           Patrick leans down.  Liam pretends to have a spray bottle in 
           his hand.  He “sprays” Patrick’s eyes and cleans them with a 
           “squeegee.”

                                 PATRICK
                        Wow that’s very clever.
                             (to Diane)
                        We should send him to mime camp.

                                 LIAM
                        Not mime camp.  Space camp.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        “Space Camp.”  Joseph, have you 
                        ever heard of “Rocket City Space 
                        Camp?”  Trust me, you’re much 
                        better off.

           INT. MCDONALDS - DAY

           Patrick in a booth across from Liam.  Liam speaks 
           passionately, French Fry in hand.
                                 LIAM
                        But that’s only the first week!  
                        After that you begin actual cockpit 
                        training-- 

                                 PATRICK
                        “Actual cockpit training--”

                                 LIAM
                        On an authentic lunar module!

                                 PATRICK
                        “Authentic lunar module.”  Wow.

                                 LIAM
                        Stop repeating me.

                                 PATRICK
                        But I want to make sure I 
                        understand and it’s all so exciting 
                        and complicated and expensive--

                                 LIAM
                        Only ten kids get in and I have to 
                        write an essay and get my teachers 
                        to send stuff and we have to send 
                        that video from my science fair 
                        project-- did you know that three 
                        of the astronauts on the last 
                        Shuttle mission are veterans of 
                        RCSC? 

                                 PATRICK
                        There’s no live ammunition at this 
                        place, is there?

                                 LIAM
                        Dad, I’m being serious.

                                 PATRICK
                        I know.

                                 LIAM
                        This is my dream.  Didn’t you say I 
                        should have a dream?

                                 PATRICK
                        Somebody else said that.  I just 
                        repeated it.

                                 LIAM
                        Wait I have the brochure right 
                        here... this is so awesome...
           He pulls it out of his SOCCER SOCK.  Patrick is amazed.  And 
           as Liam yammers on--

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        You don’t have kids.  And I am 
                        sorry for you that you never will.  
                        Because they do drive you nuts, and 
                        they cost you money... but to hear 
                        your son’s voice, the energy and 
                        yearning of it all...

           Close on Patrick, pride and delight mixed with sadness as 
           Liam continues to wax rhapsodic--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - (ANOTHER) DAY

           Patrick works at his desk.  He looks up and Diane stands in 
           the doorway.

                                 DIANE
                        He got in.

                                 PATRICK
                        Shit.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t let him down, Joseph.  I 
                        just can’t.

           He looks up at Diane, ashamed.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Diane I don’t have--

                                 DIANE
                        I know.  I’ll tell him.

           She starts out.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wait-- no.  I’ll, uh, I mean--

                                 DIANE
                        Patrick it’s 13,000 dollars.  It’s 
                        fine. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay.  But I’ll tell him.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PATRICK’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick and Liam watch APOLLO 13.  

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        I had him for the whole weekend.  
                        But I couldn’t do it.  

           Liam is completely mesmerized.  Patrick watches the movie and 
           his son. 

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s what he wants.  We should all 
                        get what we want.

           He takes a big gulp of scotch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIAM’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Liam asleep.  Patrick looks at him.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        Maybe you’re right, Joseph.  Maybe 
                        you do have to take risks in life.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATRICK’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Back where we started, staring at the screen and typing away.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        I take this risk, and write you 
                        back, to help my son have a better 
                        life.  And hopefully I can help you 
                        too.

           Patrick looks at the clock-- after two AM.  

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Well I think I’ve said enough for 
                        now.  And I think at this point I 
                        need a small favor from you: can 
                        you convince me this isn’t total 
                        bullshit?  Your friend, Patrick 
                        Kemp.

           He presses SEND.

           INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Patrick is on a date with a DIVORCED WOMAN.  It seems to be 
           going okay but not great.  His Blackberry BUZZES.  He looks 
           at it:

                         Re: Re: Help Me Spread Goodness

           He starts to read, tuning her out:

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Dear Patrick.  I have received your 
                        message and thank you very much for 
                        the detail.  You asked how I found 
                        you, and it was because of your 
                        numerous certificates and awards.  
                        I see that two years in a row you 
                        have won an award in your state.  I 
                        hope you win again this year.

           She’s still talking, he’s still reading.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry to hear about your 
                        problem with wife, job, camp, 
                        mustard, and car.  I have seen that 
                        car, some of our government 
                        ministers drive it.  You should 
                        most certainly keep it!

           He looks up at his date, who wonders why he isn’t listening.

                                 PATRICK
                        Sorry.  It’s the sitter--

           He puts the Blackberry aside and tries to pay attention to 
           her.

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - (LATER THAT) NIGHT

           Patrick leans against the wall, reading the rest of it.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        I understand that you have some 
                        concern about this proposal.  This 
                        is very normal.  It is difficult 
                        for us here in Nigeria, for those 
                        of us who are honest.  There are so 
                        many dishonest people.  That is why 
                        it is better for my charity to be 
                        controlled from outside our 
                        country.
           Patrick looks up and moves away from the sink, letting 
           someone pass.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        If you think about it Mr Patrick, 
                        if this was fraud, why would I send 
                        it from Nigeria?  That is not good 
                        for trust.  I would sent it from 
                        another country, like South Africa 
                        or London.

           Patrick smiles slightly, amused at the logic but hardly 
           convinced.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I would very much like to speak to 
                        you to answer all of your 
                        questions, but my medical condition 
                        does prevent that.  However I am 
                        preparing a portfolio of selected 
                        documents which I will have 
                        delivered to your home or office.  
                        This will give you further 
                        information on the security 
                        company.

           LATER

           Patrick is back at the table.  Chatting and friendly.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I have retained a barrister to 
                        handle the legal arrangement out of 
                        London England.  All that is needed 
                        is a wire transfer of 2000 US 
                        dollars to begin paperwork.  At the 
                        below is the account where you 
                        should send monies and also please 
                        send me your account information so 
                        I may accelerate the transfers.

           She’s laughing, loving him.  

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Please do so as soon as possible to 
                        continue process as my health 
                        continues to not improve.  I am so 
                        glad you have replied to me.  We 
                        will do great things together.

           The woman sleeps in Patrick’s bed.  But he isn’t there.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        Dear Joseph.  Sorry for the delay 
                        in responding but I just finished 
                        an important meeting.

                        Thanks for getting back to me but I 
                        have a lot more questions.  I’m 
                        sure you understand I won’t send 
                        you any money until you send me the 
                        documents and I have them examined 
                        by a lawyer.  Can you send them 
                        tomorrow?  My fax number is listed 
                        below.  

           He thinks on it, the woman walks past him, naked, towards the 
           kitchen...

           LATER

           Patrick flipping through the late night channels.  There is 
           an infomercial for PEOPLE WITH HARELIPS.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        And will 2000 dollars cover all of 
                        the legal fees?  Based on my 
                        understanding of inheritance and 
                        estate planning, the fees may end 
                        up being much more and I’d rather 
                        know that now than have a rude 
                        surprise later.  Let me know.  
                        Thanks.  Patrick.

           Patrick is morbidly fascinated by the harelips... and then 
           resumes flipping through a MOTORBOAT CATALOG.

           smiling.  They hand him a PLAQUE.  Patrick claps politely.  
           Massively faking it.

                        Joseph.  It’s been three weeks and 
                        I’m still waiting for your fax.

                        I thought you were serious.  But I 
                        guess I was wrong.  I think you 
                        will need to find someone else to

                        State, Nigeria.  I am writing to 
                        you with some sad news.

                        In reviewing his will and testament 
                        and computer records, I became 
                        aware of his correspondence with 
                        you and your role in assisting him 
                        in the distribution of his 
                        inheritance.  And I apologize that 
                        he became so unreliable in his 
                        response.  But it also appears that 
                        he did not hear from you for some 
                        time, so perhaps you are no longer 
                        interested in his fate or any good

                        Mr. Abacha-- Yes.  I am still 
                        interested.  It was your nephew who

                        one who has been doing research on 
                        the various charities.  Are you

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He was going to send me some 
                        documents, did he leave them with 
                        you?  Patrick.

           INT. PATRICK’S OFFICE - (NEXT) DAY (MOS)

           Patrick arriving in the morning, bundled up from the cold.  
                                 ABACHA (V.O.)
                        Dear Mr. Patrick.  I am very happy 
                        to move forward with you.  I am 
                        also aware that you requested some 
                        documents from my nephew to confirm 
                        the reality of this, and that they 
                        were never sent.  My secretary has 
                        acquired your office fax number and 
                        will be sending them shortly.  

           As he sheds his coat, he stops at his secretary’s desk to 
           finish reading the email on his Blackberry.  

                                 ABACHA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        However I do have some bad news.  I 
                        am sorry to tell you that upon 
                        further inquiry, perhaps due to 
                        delirium or pulmonary shortage, my 
                        nephew gave you an incorrect amount 
                        for the legal fees due to our 
                        family barrister in the United 
                        Kingdom.  The amount due in full is 
                        9,000 British Pounds or 
                        approximately 17,000 US dollars.

           Patrick looks behind his SECRETARY-- pages are rolling out of 
           the fax machine.  

                                 ABACHA (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
                        I know this is more than has been 
                        discussed, but I think you will 
                        agree that it is still a small 
                        amount compared to the larger total 
                        you will be receiving.

           Patrick smiles slightly, asking her for the pages-- 

                                 ABACHA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Once you have reviewed the 
                        documents, please contact me at my 
                        office or mobile number listed 
                        below and I can answer any final 
                        questions you may have.

           Patrick waits.  LAUGHTER makes him look up-- Jefferson and 
           Fleming, from across the office.  Patrick not in on it.

           He takes the fax pages into his office and SLAMS the door.  
           The secretary is startled-- and notices the light on her 
           phone turn bright as Patrick picks up an outside line.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PATRICK’S STUDY - DAY

           Patrick is home and unshaven, going through several files of 
           financial paperwork.  There’s a KNOCK at the door.  He 
           ignores it as Abacha continues:

                                 ABACHA (V.O.)
                        If the transaction is still of 
                        interest, you can then please 
                        initiate payment to the routing 
                        numbers which Joseph provided you, 
                        as I do not have access to them 
                        because they were kept 
                        confidential.  

           The KNOCKING persists.  Finally he walks over and opens it.  
           Diane is standing there, bundled up in the snowstorm.

                                 DIANE
                        I tried to call but you didn’t 
                        answer.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh shit.  Was I supposed to shovel--

                                 DIANE
                        It’s not about that.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Is Liam with you?

                                 DIANE
                        He’s at Scott’s.  Patrick there’s 
                        something wrong with the bank 
                        account.

                                 PATRICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 DIANE
                        Can I come in?

           She’s freezing.  He snaps out of it, lets her in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Patrick finishes stirring milk into a mug of tea.  Abacha’s 
           words continue to ring:
                                 ABACHA (V.O.)
                        Upon receipt of your transfer and 
                        your own bank routing information, 
                        you will receive security passcodes 
                        for the charitable account, plus a 
                        one time lump sum payment of 
                        1,500,000 dollars.

           Patrick walks the mug of tea to Diane.

                                 DIANE
                        I got the statement on the 529 
                        account.  You know, Liam’s college 
                        fund--

                                 PATRICK
                        I know what it is.

                                 DIANE
                        It’s not right.  It’s off by like 
                        15,000 dollars.

                                 ABACHA (V.O.)
                        1,500,000 dollars--

                                 PATRICK
                        You must have read it wrong.

                                 DIANE
                        I have it right here.  I went 
                        online and printed it out.

           She hands it to him.  He looks at it.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh wait.  I must have forgotten to 
                        tell you.  I moved it.

                                 DIANE
                        You moved it?

                                 PATRICK
                        I found a better rate.  Vanguard.  
                        It’s complicated because we have 
                        rules at First Midwestern about 
                        employees moving money out of the 
                        bank.

                                 DIANE
                        Oh.
                                 PATRICK
                        I think the Vanguard statements are 
                        quarterly so you won’t see it 
                        until, um, March or something.

                                 ABACHA (V.O.)
                        One million five hundred--

           Patrick gets up.

                                 PATRICK
                        You should get home.  I don’t like 
                        you driving in this.

           She smiles at him.

                                 DIANE
                        If only you cared this much when we 
                        were married.

           He leads her to the door.

                                 PATRICK
                        Call me when you get home, all 
                        right?

           She nods.  He closes the door.  Exhales.  

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Dear Mr. Abacha.  Thank you for 
                        speaking with me yesterday.  As you 
                        suggested, I have thought about 
                        what you said and I have come to a 
                        decision.

           He hurries back to his study.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I am sending the money.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATRICK’S STUDY - (LATER THAT) NIGHT

           It is snowing hard outside.  Patrick is at the ELECTRONIC 
           BANKING website of First Midwestern.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        With currency exchange rates as of 
                        market close on Friday, the total 
                        comes to 17,670 US dollars.  Per 
                        your instructions, it will be wired 
                        into the account directly. 
           The screen asks “CONFIRM?”  Patrick confirms without 
           hesitation.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATRICK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick lies in bed, eyes open, staring at the ceiling.  
           Excited, nervous.  Can’t sleep.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        My condolences to you and your 
                        family over your recent tragedies.  
                        But I hope with this news of my 
                        commitment, that there will be good 
                        days ahead for all of us.  I look 
                        forward to your confirmation and 
                        continuing your nephew’s good 
                        works.  Sincerely Patrick Kemp.

           He looks out the window-- the snow has stopped, the sky is 
           clear and cold.  A CRESCENT MOON and shiny stars are visible.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CONDO - (ANOTHER) DAY

           Patrick shovels his tiny front driveway.  He is unshaven.  He 
           shovels with aggression.  A NEIGHBOR calls out to him but he 
           ignores her.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick is watching APOLLO 13.  He is drinking and brooding.  
           All the lights are off.  The phone rings but he doesn’t get 
           up to answer it.  He watches the movie without expression.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NAPERVILLE - DAY

           Patrick sits across from a DETECTIVE (50s).

                                 DETECTIVE
                        When did this happen?

                                 PATRICK
                        A couple of weeks ago.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        How much did this client of yours 
                        lose?
                                 PATRICK
                        Not sure exactly.  I think it was 
                        around 17,670 dollars.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Around that.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah.

           Detective chuckles.  

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Well.  Better him than me.

           Patrick gets defensive.

                                 PATRICK
                        Actually he’s a pretty smart guy.  
                        I think it was for his son, he was 
                        going to space camp.  They have an 
                        authentic lunar module.  

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Sounds like the son is smarter than 
                        his dad.

                                 PATRICK
                        It was very convincing.  There were 
                        faxes, and phone numbers in Nigeria 
                        and in London, with real people.  
                        He spoke to someone.  All the 
                        questions were answered.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Of course they were.  It’s a con.  
                        That’s why people fall for it.

                                 PATRICK
                        Nevertheless-- I just thought I 
                        would check to see if there’s 
                        anything the police could do.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        It’s tough.  We don’t have 
                        jurisdiction, he could go to the 
                        FBI maybe, but the odds-- I mean 
                        the guy wasn’t real.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Well the story wasn’t real, but the 
                        guy is a real guy--
           Detective searches on his desk for a note pad.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        What’s his name?

                                 PATRICK
                        Emmanuel Abacha.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        “Emmanuel Abacha?”

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh I thought you meant-- you mean 
                        the guy who lost the money?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Yeah.

                                 PATRICK
                        I can’t really tell you that.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Maybe this client should come and 
                        talk to me himself.

                                 PATRICK
                        I think he’s a little embarrassed.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Well there’s not much I can do if I 
                        don’t talk to him.  

           Patrick nods, resigned.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        He could always go to Nigeria.  Get 
                        some answers that way.  Get some 
                        justice, Africa-style.  Why not?

           The Detective amuses himself.  Patrick smiles, playing along.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                             (yelling to Cop)
                        Hey Wallace!  You’re Nigerian, 
                        right?

           WALLACE is black but not Nigerian.  He looks at the detective 
           like he is an asshole.  The detective turns back to Patrick.

                                 DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        Tell your guy to make a vacation 
                        out of it.  If he has any money 
                        left.
           They share a chuckle.  Patrick exits, and as he turns away he 
           walks with the energy of a brand new bad idea.  

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Patrick sits down at his computer.  He goes to COMPOSE and an 
           empty email window pops up.

           He types in Emmanuel Abacha’s email address.  No subject.  
           And then:

                        I AM COMING FOR YOU MOTHERFUCKER

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATRICK’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Patrick is pulling things out of the dresser and laying them 
           on the bed next to an open suitcase.

                                 DIANE
                        You’re doing what?

                                 PATRICK
                        I have to go to Africa for a week.  
                        It’s for work.  I have to... fix 
                        something.

                                 DIANE
                        Bullshit.  You’re taking some 
                        floozy on a cruise ship.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Do you want to see my passport?  

                                 DIANE
                        You have a passport?

                                 PATRICK
                        Very funny.  I got the visa today.  
                        I expedited it.

           She’s laughing.

                                 DIANE
                        Really?  The “visa for Africa?”  Is 
                        that like an all access pass?

                                 PATRICK
                        You’re not helping.
                                 DIANE
                        What do you want me to do?  Where 
                        exactly are you going, Patrick?

                                 PATRICK
                        East Africa.  

                                 DIANE
                        Where in East Africa?

                                 PATRICK
                        Nigeria.

           She’s about to speak but he waves her off.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re gonna say.  But 
                        it’s not going to be dangerous.  

                                 DIANE
                        What I was going to say is that 
                        it’s not in East Africa.

                                 PATRICK
                        Really?

           He scrambles through some papers, there’s a map printed on 
           the back of one--

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You’re right, look at that.  My 
                        God, they must have a thousand 
                        countries...

                                 DIANE
                        Are you going by yourself?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.

                                 DIANE
                        Patrick is this about the money?

                                 PATRICK
                        No.  Well, I mean, everything’s 
                        about money really, when you think 
                        about it...

           He walks over to her.  Touches her shoulder reassuringly.
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll be careful.  
                        It’ll be just like Club Med when 
                        you leave the resort.  Even though 
                        we didn’t ever really do that.

                                 DIANE
                        Because we were scared.  You were 
                        terrified.  

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t remember it quite like 
                        that.

                                 DIANE
                        Of course you don’t.  And what 
                        should I tell your son?

                                 PATRICK
                        Like I said.  It’s for work.

                                 DIANE
                        I mean after you’re murdered.

           She walks out.  Patrick contemplates for a moment, then holds 
           up a couple of shirts to see which goes better with khakis.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MURTALA INTL AIRPORT - LAGOS, NIGERIA - MORNING

           The CUSTOMS AREA is drab, broken tables, a few enthusiastic 
           anti-AIDS posters nailed to the walls.  It’s in desperate 
           need of a paint job, or some other social call from the 21st 
           century.

           Patrick waits to approach PASSPORT CONTROL.  He looks 
           exhausted.  He notices other people simply walking right by 
           the counter but has no idea why.

           He steps up.  The CUSTOMS OFFICER is a bored, beefy man, not 
           smiling.  Patrick hands over his passport.  The officer 
           studies his visa form.  Skeptical.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        Tourist visa?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        You come to visit family?
                                 PATRICK
                        No, uh--

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        We do not have tourist facility 
                        here in Nigeria.

                                 PATRICK
                        I thought there was a museum, the 
                        tour book says--

           Patrick scrambles in his bag, pulling out the tour book, a 
           sleep mask and a big CASH ENVELOPE falling to the floor, he 
           scrambles to pick them up.  

           The customs officer watches, amused.  Patrick flips through 
           the tour book, flustered...

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Here.  The National Museum.  
                             (reads)
                        “The most interesting exhibit is 
                        the car of Murtala Mohammed, one of 
                        Nigeria’s more popular leaders, a 
                        black limousine in which...”
                             (realizing)
                        “...he was assassinated in 1976.”

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        You come to see that.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  Among other... sites.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        You can pay dash fee here.

                                 PATRICK
                        “Dash?”

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        Yes.  To me.

           Patrick knows this is bullshit, but he has little choice.

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay.  How much?

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        10,000 Naira.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s like 85 dollars.
                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        It is a very nice museum.

                                 PATRICK
                        I haven’t changed any money yet.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        You can pay in US dollars, that is 
                        no problem.  

           Patrick nods, gets out his wallet--

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Then it will be 100 dollars even.

           Patrick shakes his head.  Hands over a hundred dollar bill.  
           The officer stamps and returns the passport.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Nigeria.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AIRPORT - MORNING

           Patrick outside with his suitcases.  Everyone else seems to 
           have a car or driver and is quickly hurrying away, but he 
           scans the horizon and seems to be coming up empty.

           A couple of GUYS leaning against beat-up sedans take note of 
           this.  One hustles up and approaches him.  His name is 
           KINGSLEY.  40s, skinny.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Taxi?

                                 PATRICK
                        Someone from the hotel is supposed 
                        to meet me.

           Patrick takes out his cell phone and a folded hotel invoice, 
           finding the number and trying to make a call.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Which hotel?

           He can’t get the phone to work.  Frustrated.

                                 PATRICK
                        Moorhouse.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        He just left.  I take you.
           The humidity is punishing and a thick haze hangs over the 
           landscape.  Patrick starts to sweat.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s okay.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        I am a driver for the hotel.  It is 
                        no problem.

           Meanwhile the other guy has taken Patrick’s second suitcase 
           and is loading it into a car.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wait what are you doing--

                                 KINGSLEY
                        This is taxi.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s not a taxi.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Let’s go.

           Patrick hesitates but feels himself whisked along the current 
           of events... he follows Kingsley to his car.  They get in.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           A beater PEUGEOT, religious stuff dangling from the mirror.  
           Patrick gets in back.   As they speed away he realizes--

                                 PATRICK
                        Wait!  My bag is in the other car!

           He looks behind where the other driver is waving at them.  
           Kingsley SLAMS on the brakes and backs 100 feet recklessly to 
           pull up next to it.

           The other driver starts YELLING at Kingsley.  They look 
           instantly, fiercely angry.  Both pulling at the bag.  Patrick 
           can’t understand anything they are saying:

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Abeg come ansa dis question quick 
                        quick!

                                 OTHER DRIVER
                        Chai!  Dem don chop chance me!

                                 PATRICK
                        Guys...
           A THIRD MAN in some kind of uniform comes over to mediate and 
           calm them.

                                 MAN IN UNIFORM
                             (to Patrick)
                        Sorry boss.  It be over soon.

                                 PATRICK
                        What language are they speaking?

                                 MAN IN UNIFORM
                        English.

           Finally it seems settled.  Kingsley returns.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        It is okay.  We go now.

                                 PATRICK
                        Great.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        We must pay them a reservation fee.

                                 PATRICK
                        Fine.

           He hands over some small bills.  Kingsley passes them out the 
           window.  They head off to the gate at the end of the airport 
           drive.  Another GUARD comes over to them and talks to 
           Kingsley.  Another heated discussion.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        He says we must pay a fine.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why?

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Because the road is one way and I 
                        went back.

                                 PATRICK
                        Jesus.

           It is taking him ten years just to get out of the airport.  
           Patrick hands over more money.  The guard wants more.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Tell him that’s it.  Let’s go.
           The guard relents and lifts the gate.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TAXI - TRAVELING - DAY

           Here is LAGOS-- population 17 million, all of whom seem to be 
           visible to Patrick during this rush hour wild taxi ride.  

                                 PATRICK
                        “Kin-ley?”

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Kings-ley.

           Patrick takes it all in: small vans and yellow buses loading 
           and unloading passengers and cargo under the freeway 
           “flyovers,” schoolkids in uniforms dodging cars, motorbikes 
           zipping in between all of them, buzzing like insects.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Moorhouse very nice.  Best hotel, 
                        best quality.

           Patrick is barely listening.  It is a complete sensory 
           overload in every direction.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Here is my card.

           Kingsley hands him a remarkably professional-looking business 
           card: SUNRISE CAR SERVICE with his name and mobile number.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        I will be the driver for your 
                        entire visit to Lagos, “the city of 
                        excellence.”  I hope you will enjoy 
                        our country very much.

           Kingsley is driving like a LUNATIC.  Swerving, honking, 
           slamming on the brakes.  He has GEORGE JONES country music 
           blaring on the car radio.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                             (singing along)
                        If I could find that Lonely Street      
                        where dim lights bring  
                          forgetfulness                   
                        where broken dreams and mem’ries 
                          meet...
           Kingsley drives over a dirt median, past market stalls with 
           small kerosene fires cooking breakfast meats, up onto the 
           enormous THIRD MAINLAND BRIDGE, where he comes to a dead stop 
           and joins the queue.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        “Go slow.”

                                 PATRICK
                        How much further?

                                 KINGSLEY
                        To Moorhouse?  Not far.  Ikeja.  
                        Six, seven kilometers.

           Patrick looks at the traffic.  Resigned.

                                 PATRICK
                        And how long...

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Two hours.

           Kingsley’s cell phone RINGS-- “William Tell Overture.”  He 
           answers and begins to speak, unintelligible.

           LATER

           they are still up on the bridge, not moving.  

                                 PATRICK
                        What does “dash” mean?

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Bribe.

           Patrick looks out to his left, where miles of SHACKS have 
           been built on stilts out over the water, the water slick and 
           shiny with bobbing oil and planks of rotted lumber.  

           Meanwhile a parade of VENDORS makes its way between the cars.  
           Men and women, all ages, some children.  Expressionless.  And 
           selling everything-- bicycle tires, crackers, dictionaries, 
           shaving kits.  Patrick doesn’t like to look at them.

           LATER

           They’re finally moving.  Swooping down off the bridge, the 
           nonstop cityscape of LAGOS ISLAND around them, decrepit 
           skyscrapers or tenement housing ten stories high or huddled 
           low to the ground and everywhere absolute SWARMS OF PEOPLE.
           It’s wrong to call it humbling-- it’s just impactful.  And 
           almost indescribable, even for the well-traveled, which 
           Patrick is not.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - POOL BAR - NIGHT

           A moderately nice hotel by States standards but in Lagos this 
           passes for opulent.  The pool bar has a few dozen tables, bad 
           pop music playing, a smattering of customers.

           Patrick sits at the bar drinking a beer.  He looks worn out, 
           thrown head first into the deep end.  He tries again with his 
           cell phone-- no luck.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        You need an MTN card.

           Patrick turns-- a very attractive and somewhat dressed YOUNG 
           NIGERIAN WOMAN takes the seat next to him.

                                 PATRICK
                        Pardon me?

                                 WOMAN
                        An MTN card.  That’s the network 
                        here.  
                             (to bartender)
                        Chapman’s please.
                             (to Patrick)
                        Otherwise you pay through the nose.  
                        My friend can get you one.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s okay.

                                 WOMAN
                        American?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  

                                 WOMAN
                        My cousin, she lives in New York 
                        City.  First time in Nigeria?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  That’s quite a dress you’re 
                        wearing.

                                 WOMAN
                        I know.  I wear it to celebrate.  
                        Today is a very happy day.
                                 PATRICK
                        Your birthday?

                                 WOMAN
                        No.  It is the day I meet you.

           Patrick smiles.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Wow.  That’s very good.  I think my 
                        wife has that dress.

                                 WOMAN
                        Really?  Is she in possession of 
                        your wedding ring as well?

           He’s tired but he laughs, energized by the banter and 
           flattery.  She gets her drink-- some red fruity concoction.

                                 PATRICK
                        Can I ask you a question?  The 
                        traffic--

                                 WOMAN
                        Very bad.  Always.

                                 PATRICK
                        And the weather--

                                 WOMAN
                        Humid and hot.  Unless it is rainy 
                        season.

                                 PATRICK
                        So it’s nicer then?

                                 WOMAN
                        Lagos is built out of the water.  
                        Sea level.  When the rain comes, 
                        the water bites back.  Roads gone.  
                        Disease.  Holes in the ground, 
                        young boys and girls fall into them 
                        and drown.

                                 PATRICK
                        So it’s never really nice here.

                                 WOMAN
                        What do you mean?  Lagos is always 
                        beautiful.

           She smiles.  Quite lovely, actually.  She extends a hand.
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Tina Turner.

           Patrick is charmed.  He shakes her hand.

                                 PATRICK
                        “Tina Turner.”  That’s an 
                        interesting name.

                                 WOMAN
                        I bet you will remember it.

                                 PATRICK
                        Indeed I will.

                                 WOMAN
                        So if you would tell me your name 
                        and your number, I will decide if 
                        yours is as interesting as mine. 

                                 PATRICK
                        My phone doesn’t work.

                                 WOMAN
                        I meant your room number.

           Before Patrick can respond to this delicate, by-the-hour 
           dance of seduction, ANOTHER WOMAN taps him on the shoulder.  

           She’s white, attractive and sensibly dressed and tan, but 
           Africa-worker tan, not beach tan.  Her name is SERENA CARSON 
           (30s).

                                 SERENA
                        Excuse me-- are you Mr. Fontaine?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes I am.

                                 SERENA
                        Serena Carson, from Project BUILD.  
                        Sorry I’m late, we drove in from 
                        Benin City--

                                 PATRICK
                        I understand.  Let’s grab a table. 
                             (to Tina Turner)
                        It’s been a pleasure.

           Tina Turner gives him a finger wave and smiles as he walks 
           off with Serena.
                                 SERENA
                        I appreciate you taking the time to 
                        meet with me, I brought copies of 
                        the materials you requested plus we 
                        have a brand new CD-ROM--

           She’s businesslike, not desperate.  They’ve moved far enough 
           out of Tina Turner’s earshot--

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m sorry.  I’m not Mr. Fontaine.

           Serena stops short.

                                 SERENA
                        You’re not? 

                                 PATRICK
                        No.  I just wanted to get away from 
                        her.  The act was wearing thin.  

           Patrick laughs but Serena isn’t as friendly anymore.

                                 SERENA
                        Her act or yours?

                                 PATRICK
                        Whoa.  Let’s start over here.

                                 SERENA
                        I’m late for a meeting.  Excuse me.

           She walks away, leaving him.  Patrick watches her go, then 
           looks back at Tina Turner, who has already moved on to 
           someone else.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - (NEXT) MORNING

           Patrick emerges, looking somewhat refreshed.  He approaches 
           the BELLMAN.

                                 PATRICK
                        Excuse me, I need a taxi?

           Suddenly Kingsley is up in Patrick’s face--

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Mr. Patrick, good morning suh!

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh.  Uh--
                                 KINGSLEY
                        Let’s go!

           As Kingsley leads him to the car, yammering the whole time--

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        I sleep here!  In my car, last 
                        night!  So I would be ready to take 
                        you!  I told you I would be your 
                        driver, yes?  You must trust your 
                        friend Kingsley!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TAXI - TRAVELING

           They are heading out of the gated hotel entrance.  Kingsley 
           is still enthusiastic.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        I get some new music for you, suh.  
                        Nigerian music!  Fela Kuti!

                                 PATRICK
                        Wonderful.

           He puts in a new cassette, suddenly the car is filled with 
           AFRO-BEAT music.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        My uncle, he played with Fela.  

           But Patrick is studying a piece of paper.

                                 PATRICK
                        We need to go to Suru-ler-e.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Surulere, yes.

                                 PATRICK
                        42 Masha Road.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Very good.

           They head off.  Patrick has a sheaf of printed-out emails 
           from Abacha-- and this is listed as his office address.

           LATER
           they are in traffic, not moving.  Patrick again taking it in.  
           Kingsley is on his cell phone.  He hangs up.

                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        My daughter.  She is in University.

                                 PATRICK
                        Ah.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Do you have children?

                                 PATRICK
                        I have one son.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Wonderful.

                                 PATRICK
                        He’s an astronaut.

           Kingsley looks confused.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        He’s going up in space in a rocket.  
                        He’s in final training now on the 
                        lunar module.

           Kingsley doesn’t get it.  He looks up ahead.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Masha Road.  We are here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. “TASTEE FRIED CHICKEN” - DAY

           Nigeria’s knockoff KFC.  Kingsley and Patrick stand outside.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        42 Masha Road.  This is it.

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s supposed to be an office 
                        building.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        It is only an office of chicken.

           They just stare at it.  Patrick looks like he expected this. 
           People come and go.  Many stop to look at Patrick.
                                 KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you hungry?

                                 PATRICK
                        Let’s go to the police station.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        The police?

                                 PATRICK
                        The nearest station.  The local 
                        district office, or whatever.  

                                 KINGSLEY
                        I do not understand.

                                 PATRICK
                        The police.  You do have police 
                        here, don’t you?  I need to report 
                        a crime.  I thought you said you’d 
                        take me anywhere.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        The police cannot help you.  This 
                        is Lagos.  You can only help 
                        yourself.

           Patrick weighs Kingsley’s words. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Take me to the police, or take me 
                        back to the Moorhouse and I’ll hire 
                        a different driver.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICE STATION - SURULERE - DAY

           A run down building, no markings.  An unpaved road, more 
           residential and dicey.  Kingsley pulls up outside.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        Here.  

           Patrick looks at it.  

                                 PATRICK
                        No way.

                                 KINGSLEY
                        See that?  “NPF?”  Nigeria Police 
                        Force.  I wait here.
           Patrick again must decide.  He sees no one going in or out.

                                 PATRICK
                        Don’t leave.

           Patrick gets out.  He looks around-- people moving with a 
           purpose, the usual stares, but no one seeming to size him up.  
           It doesn’t seem any more or less safe than anywhere else.

           INT. POLICE BUILDING - DAY

           Patrick peeks his head in.

                                 PATRICK
                        Hello?

           And Kingsley is right but he’s wrong-- it used to be a police 
           station.  Now all that’s left are a few metal desks, an 
           overturned trashcan, a dented file cabinet.

           As Patrick takes it in-- he turns at the sound of Kingsley’s 
           CAR pulling away.  And in the wipe appear four rough-looking 
           YOUNG MEN, bloodshot eyes, hard faces.  One is the leader.

                                 LEADER
                        How now Oyibo!

           Patrick instinctively takes a step back.

                                 PATRICK
                        I was looking for the police...

                                 LEADER
                        No police here.  You need a friend?

                                 PATRICK
                        Not really.

                                 LEADER
                        Ah ne fresh fish.  Joba be your 
                        friend.

           The others talk amongst themselves and laugh--

                                 PATRICK
                        Look I’ll give you all my money.  
                        Just take me to the police station.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ACTUAL POLICE STATION - SURULERE - DAY

           The station doesn’t look that different from the crummy place 
           where Patrick was before.

           Patrick stands across from a baby-faced police CONSTABLE 
           (20).  Patrick is dirty and drenched in sweat. 

                                 PATRICK
                             (repeating it)
                        I’m from America.  And I have some 
                        fraudulent activity to report.

           He pulls out one of his remaining papers, folded and mashed.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I was told the business was located 
                        at 42 Masha Road, but when I--

                                 CONSTABLE
                        42 Masha Road?  That is Tastee 
                        Fried Chicken.

                                 PATRICK
                        I know it’s Tastee Fried Chicken--

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Were you served some improper 
                        chicken?

                                 PATRICK
                        I was told that it was the office 
                        of a lawyer.  Emmanuel Abacha.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Ah.

           Constable smiles.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why are you “ah”-ing?  What does 
                        “ah” mean?

                                 CONSTABLE
                        You were the victim of 419.  Fraud.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes!  

                                 CONSTABLE
                        That happened today?
                                 PATRICK
                        No.  Today I was abandoned by my 
                        driver and then mugged by a few 
                        other guys.  They were pretty nice 
                        about it, from what I could 
                        understand.  The fraud was a couple 
                        of weeks ago.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        So you wish to file a report about 
                        the mugging or the 419?

           LATER

           Patrick sits with a SERGEANT as the Constable watches and 
           learns.

                                 SERGEANT
                        “Abacha” is a very common name in 
                        Nigeria.  It was also our 
                        President’s name.  

                                 PATRICK
                        So I guess you can rule one person 
                        out.

                                 SERGEANT
                        He is dead.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Either this person does not exist 
                        or he will be impossible to find.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’d still like to file a report.

                                 SERGEANT
                        There is a fee to open a file.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t have any money.  

                                 SERGEANT
                        Then you can just give me your 
                        credit card number.

                                 PATRICK
                        You don’t understand.  I was just 
                        mugged.  I don’t have a wallet.
                                 SERGEANT
                        I see.

           Sergeant puts the lid back on his pen that he was writing 
           nothing down with.

                                 PATRICK
                        Actually I need to call my credit 
                        card companies I think.  And I have 
                        no idea really where I am, and I 
                        have no way to get back to the 
                        hotel.

           Sergeant nods, contemplating this.  Patrick starts to laugh.  
           It’s all so absurd.

           EXT. SURULERE MOTOR PARK - DAY

           The crowded and boisterous depot for buses and vans.  Patrick 
           has been deposited here by the police, taking the last few 
           steps as he staggers across the Rubicon.

           A couple of MEN aggressively pursue him, but he seems to 
           shrug them off.

                                 PATRICK
                             (asking randomly)
                        Moorhouse Hotel?  To Moorhouse?

           People ignore him until--

                                 DRIVER
                        Moorhouse ya...

           A driver leads him to his “DANFO” bus, a small yellow van 
           with seating for a dozen.

           INT. DANFO - DRIVING - DAY

           The small bus is completely full, speeding through traffic 
           then slamming to a halt.  Patrick sits at the window, the 
           only white person.  He has a peaceful smile on his face.

           As the danfo picks up speed, he leans his head out to feel 
           the breeze, like a dog.  Then he leans back in, completely 
           oblivious as another danfo races by which would have cut his 
           head off.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - POOL BAR - NIGHT

           Tonight there is a FEMALE SINGER and BAND.  They are 
           terrible.
           Patrick is alone at a small table.  He has cleaned up 
           physically, at least.  He pushes a french fry through some 
           ketchup.  He is in a daze.

           Suddenly the power GOES OUT at the entire hotel.  A few 
           seconds, then generators kick in and the lights come back.  
           Patrick pushes the french fry for the duration.

           He looks up and sees Serena has arrived again at the bar.  
           She is talking on her cell phone.  She sees him.  He doesn’t 
           even smile, just goes back to his food.

           This intrigues her.  She finishes her call and walks over.

                                 SERENA
                        You look like hell.

                                 PATRICK
                        Long day.  Are you looking for your 
                        man?

                                 SERENA
                        He’s a public relations VP at 
                        Chevron.  That’s why I assumed he 
                        was the white guy with the 
                        prostitute.

           Patrick has to chuckle at this.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry if I was short.

                                 PATRICK
                        Not a problem.

                                 SERENA
                        Anyway, he’s not coming.  Again. 
                        His office just called.  He’s in 
                        Port Harcourt and he’s been 
                        detained.  Actually he’s been 
                        kidnapped, I think.  She wasn’t 
                        clear.  May I?

           She moves towards a seat.

                        You look like you need some 
                        company.  Non-transactional of 
                        course.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m Patrick Kemp.  
                                 SERENA
                        Serena Carson.  I may have said 
                        that before, when I thought you 
                        were someone else.

                                 PATRICK
                        Someone important.

                                 SERENA
                        He’s not important.  He just has 
                        money.  

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s all about money, isn’t it?

                                 SERENA
                        And PR.  Which his company could 
                        use a healthy dose of, considering 
                        they’re in the process of raping 
                        this country.

           Patrick just nods.  Weary.  

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        What-- you want to argue with that?

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know enough to argue.  I 
                        don’t really know anything about 
                        this place.

                                 SERENA
                        Well you know that you don’t know.  
                        That’s something.  So what do you 
                        do, if you don’t mind me asking?

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m in finance.  

                                 SERENA
                        Me too.  Corporate or non-profit?

                                 PATRICK
                        Much more non-profit than I’d like 
                        it to be.

           Serena laughs at this, motioning to the waiter.  Patrick 
           notes this.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I can’t-- I don’t really have any 
                        money.
                                 SERENA
                        I was getting your check.  I hate 
                        this place.  How much was that 
                        burger, forty dollars?

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know.  The prices are all 
                        in some weird foreign currency.

                                 SERENA
                        Are you willing to step outside the 
                        ex-pat bubble and have an actual 
                        Nigerian meal?

                                 PATRICK
                        Only if you promise I won’t have to 
                        talk to any actual Nigerians.  And 
                        I’ll need a ride back.

                                 SERENA
                        You don’t have a driver?

                                 PATRICK
                        I did.  But he, uh, lacked courage 
                        at a critical moment.

                                 SERENA
                        You’re funny.  Let’s go.

           She gets up.  He follows.

           INT. “BOGO CHILI” - VICTORIA ISLAND - NIGHT

           An upscale boho jazz lounge and restaurant.  As good music 
           plays, Serena and Patrick sit at a small table.

                                 PATRICK
                        So that was it.  I sent the money, 
                        and of course they disappeared and 
                        nothing happened.  So I set up this 
                        trip because I thought that if I 
                        got over here I’d track them down, 
                        or the police would help... I don’t 
                        know.  When someone fucks with you 
                        like that, you just want to do 
                        something.  I was just so pissed.

           Serena listens, but it’s not clear how she feels.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        But what the hell was I thinking?  
                        How many people live here?  800 
                        gabillion?
                                 SERENA
                        Almost.

                                 PATRICK
                        And those kids on the street, the 
                        ones who took my money--

                                 SERENA
                        “Area boys.”  A Lagos original.

                                 PATRICK
                        It was so weird.  They were 
                        organized, but then on drugs I 
                        think, but also sort of passive-
                        aggressive--

           The power goes out in the bar.  Darkness for a moment...

                                 SERENA
                        It’s a shakedown.  They don’t want 
                        to hurt you.  But they will of 
                        course.

                                 PATRICK
                        I feel like I’ve been here a year.

           The power comes back on.  Patrick is shaking his head.

                                 SERENA
                        I was in the Peace Corps for four 
                        years right out of UT.  And we had 
                        a saying. “If you go to Asia, you 
                        come back a mystic.  If you go to 
                        Latin America, you come back a 
                        revolutionary.  And if you go to 
                        West Africa... you come back 
                        laughing.”

           Patrick laughs.

                                 PATRICK
                        Where did you serve?
                             (thinking)
                        Is that how they say it, do you 
                        “serve” in the Peace Corps?

                                 SERENA
                        Cambodia.  But for the last six 
                        I’ve been here.  Ghana, Burkina, 
                        Mali.  I’m only in Nigeria once a 
                        month.  
                                 PATRICK
                        Mali.  Madonna has a kid from 
                        there.

                                 SERENA
                        Actually that was Malawi.

           But Patrick is not really listening, still fixated on what 
           happened to him.

                                 PATRICK
                        The thing is, he seemed totally 
                        sincere.  

                                 SERENA
                        Who?

                                 PATRICK
                        Abacha.  Even that Joseph Otumbo 
                        person before, the one who died.  I 
                        believed them.  Maybe I was 
                        blinded.  In wanting to help them.

           Patrick ponders this.  

                                 SERENA
                        So you’re a humanitarian now?

                                 PATRICK
                        I wouldn’t go that far--

                                 SERENA
                        If he had offered you the money, 
                        and you didn’t get a cut, would you 
                        have been so eager to help?

                                 PATRICK
                        Maybe not.  I don’t know--

           Loud LAUGHTER at the bar.  Patrick looks over: a group of 
           YOUNG NIGERIAN MEN joke with the BARTENDER.

                                 SERENA
                        What happened to you today, it 
                        totally sucks.  But what got you 
                        here-- that’s on you.  

                                 PATRICK
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SERENA
                        There are lots of way to help 
                        people, Patrick.

                        But there’s not always a bag of 
                        money at the end of that rainbow.

                                 PATRICK
                        If the person helping gets 
                        something out of it, what’s wrong 
                        with that?

                                 SERENA
                        Nothing.  But it should be the side 
                        effect.  Not the motive.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why?  I like nice things.  I want 
                        my son to go to space camp.  

                                 SERENA
                        You really don’t get it, do you?  
                        “Space Camp?”  No offense, but 
                        Patrick-- what the hell?

                                 PATRICK
                        They have a lunar module.  

                                 SERENA
                        Of course they do.

           They agree to disagree.  Patrick motions for another beer. 

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        You should come with me tomorrow.  
                        I want to show you something.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know...

                                 SERENA
                        Do you know how to say “I don’t 
                        know” in Nigerian?

           Patrick shakes his head.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        “Yes.”

           Patrick smiles.  It’s true, he has nothing to do...

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll pick you up at eight.

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay.  I gotta--

           He starts to get up, motions...
                                 SERENA
                        Behind the bar to the left.

                                 PATRICK
                        Thanks.

           He heads off.

           INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick finishes at the urinal.  As he flushes and moves to 
           the sink, two of the young men from the bar come in.  

           One has short DREADLOCKS and is muscular.  The other is tall 
           and LEAN.  They are drunk and laughing.

           Patrick gives them a quick look and nod, then resumes washing 
           his hands.  They seem friendly enough, entering the bathroom 
           midconversation...

                                 DREADLOCKS
                        Why you just de copy copy?  E

                                 LEAN MAN
                        Na na dem dem Otumbo for Biodun...

           Patrick freezes as he hears the name.  He keeps washing his 
           hands, doesn’t look up--

                                 DREADLOCKS
                        And then you have to tell her you 
                        are broke.  Your oshelengen too 
                        much!

                                 LEAN MAN
                        That is a lie--

                                 DREADLOCKS
                        Credits and a loaf of bread!
                             (mimicking)
                        “If dat girl no take time dey make 
                        yanga, she go chop-beans one day!”

           Dreadlocks is in hysterics and they are both pushing at each 
           other.  Patrick looks at them in the mirror.  Finally the 
           skinny one -- Otumbo -- is ready to use the sink.  

                                 OTUMBO
                        Excuse me, brother.

           Otumbo smiles politely.  Patrick snaps out of it, then 
           stumbles out of the washroom.
           INT. BOGO CHILI - NIGHT

           Patrick returning to the table, looking sort of dazed.

                                 SERENA
                        You see a ghost in there?

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know.  How common a name is 
                        “Otumbo?”

                                 SERENA
                        It’s not “Smith.”  Why?

           Otumbo and Dreadlocks have rejoined the other two guys and 
           are about to head out.  Patrick hesitates, finishes his beer 
           in one gulp, and then hurries after them to the door.  

           He taps on Otumbo’s shoulder.

                                 PATRICK
                        Excuse me.

           Otumbo turns around, smiling.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Did you say your name was “Otumbo?”

                                 OTUMBO
                        Yes.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Do you know a Joseph Otumbo?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I am Joseph Otumbo.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wait-- you’re Joseph Otumbo?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I am Joseph Otumbo.  Who are you?

                                 PATRICK
                        I thought you were dead.

           Otumbo chuckles.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Do I look dead to you?
                                 PATRICK
                        You died.  You had Ideopathic 
                        Pulmonary Fibrosis.

           None of this seems to mean anything to Otumbo, who is growing 
           impatient.

                                 OTUMBO
                        What do you want?  My friends, we 
                        are late for a party.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m Patrick Kemp.  From America.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I don’t know this man.

           Now Patrick is irritated.

                                 PATRICK
                        This man is me.  Patrick.  You 
                        stole from me.  You and Abacha--

           Now he has Otumbo’s attention--

                                 OTUMBO
                        Abacha?

                                 PATRICK
                        You and Abacha.  You stole my 
                        money.

           Otumbo takes off running, out the door.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Patrick squeezes past Otumbo’s friends, who have no idea what 
           has happened, and is out the door after him.

           EXT. BOGO CHILI - NIGHT

           Patrick runs onto the street, sees Otumbo dart to the left; 
           like many areas of Lagos after dark, there is no electricity.  
           So it is pitch black except for an occasional small kerosene 
           fire, or a motorbike headlamp, whizzing by.

           Patrick takes a few strides to the left, maybe a block or so, 
           Serena coming out of the bar to look for him--

           Then Patrick stops: he’s lost sight of Otumbo and is about to 
           turn around when a car HONKS and almost hits him, flashing 
           BRIGHTS but then headlights off as it passes.
           With the car brights fading from his eyes, he can see even 
           less than before.  He stands in the middle of the street, 
           panting for breath.

                                 PATRICK
                        Damn it.

           Patrick looks down-- a SMALL BOY is standing there, around 9 
           or 10, hard to see in the dark.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  

           The boy doesn’t answer.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen a guy running?  Black 
                        guy.  Black hair...  

           Patrick laughs to himself.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Goes by the name Blackety 
                        McBlackBlack.  Fuck it.

           He turns to walk away-- and the boy points.  DOWN.  Patrick 
           is confused, and then he looks down and sees... the top of 
           Otumbo’s head, peeking out of a DITCH.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  Get up here!

           Otumbo doesn’t move.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I see you.

           Still nothing.  He looks at the boy, who is holding a small 
           piece of concrete for him.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                             (to boy)
                        Thank you.

           Patrick throws the concrete, hitting Otumbo in the back. 

           Otumbo gets up.  Now he is ANGRY.  Patrick takes a few steps 
           back, suddenly not sure what he is doing.

                                 OTUMBO
                        You should not have done that.
                                 PATRICK
                        Hey.  I don’t want to hurt you--  

                                 OTUMBO
                        Maybe I want to hurt you.

                                 PATRICK
                        I just want to find Abacha.  Just 
                        do that and it’s like we never met.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 PATRICK
                        He’s the one who actually stole 
                        from me.  You just, uh, attempted 
                        to steal from me.  I want Abacha.

           Otumbo thinks about this, sizing Patrick up.

                                 OTUMBO
                        No.

           Otumbo starts walking away.  Patrick looks back at Bogo 
           Chili, sees Serena talking to a few people out front.  He 
           knows he only has a moment.

                                 PATRICK
                        Look-- I’ll give you a cut.  Ten 
                        percent of whatever I get back.

           This gets Otumbo’s attention.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Twenty.

                                 PATRICK
                             (amazed)
                        You really think you’re in a 
                        position to negotiate?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Yes.

           Patrick thinks about it.  He realizes Otumbo is actually 
           right.

                                 PATRICK
                        Fine.  Twenty.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Tomorrow then.  One o’clock.  I 
                        will be here.
                                 PATRICK
                        Okay.  See you here.  Tomorrow.

           Patrick starts walking back to the club.

           EXT. BOGO CHILI - NIGHT

           Patrick walks up to Serena.  She frowns.

                                 SERENA
                        When you chase people into the 
                        dark... in Lagos sometimes you 
                        don’t come back.

                                 PATRICK
                        Sorry.  I thought it was him.

           Patrick walks back inside the bar.  Serena follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IKEJA NEIGHBORHOOD - (NEXT) MORNING

           A residential sidestreet that passes for “middle class” in 
           Lagos-- one story housing with actual brick or concrete 
           walls, private generators powering fans or lights.  

           But the road is still dusty unpaved gravel, and indoor 
           plumbing is available only here or there.

           And here as in everywhere in Lagos, people seem BUSY-- moving 
           through the streets on one form of transport or another, 
           bargaining in business, repairing something.

           INT. WOMEN’S MEETING - MORNING

           A dozen NIGERIAN women, ranging in age from 20s to 50s, sit 
           in a rough circle in this local meeting room.  Serena and 
           Patrick are there as well, standing on the perimeter.

           One older woman-- the BOOKKEEPER -- is collecting wads of 
           money and writing it down in an ACCOUNT REGISTER.  Some sort 
           of heated conversation is going on with two of the women.

                                 PATRICK
                        What’s going on?

           A young woman acting as TRANSLATOR stands next to Patrick.

                                 TRANSLATOR
                        The one woman has been sick and 
                        cannot pay her loan.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRANSLATOR (CONT'D)
                        So they are figuring out which of 
                        the others will make payment for 
                        her.

           A lot of raised voices but it all seems civil, as if this is 
           how they do it.  Patrick watches.

           LATER

           Patrick and Serena have joined the circle.  Serena is an 
           executive and white; they are taking this opportunity to air 
           their grievances.  

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        [Hausa dialect]

                                 TRANSLATOR
                             (to Serena)
                        She says they would like the loans 
                        to be bigger.

           Serena smiles.  She hears this a lot.

                                 SERENA
                        I’m sure she would.  
                             (to group)
                        How many of you would like bigger 
                        loans?

           All but one of the women raise their hands, many muttering 
           and talking as well.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                             (to young woman)
                        Well we raise some more money, 
                        maybe we can do that.  What cycle 
                        are you on here?  Fourth?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Fifth.

           Patrick looks at Serena, confused.

                                 SERENA
                        Each loan is a cycle.  The first 
                        loan is 1200 Naira, around 100 
                        dollars.  They pay that back over 
                        three months at 22 percent 
                        interest.  Then the second cycle 
                        starts, a bigger loan.

                                 PATRICK
                        22?  That seems high.
                                 SERENA
                             (to young woman)
                        Tell him what you paid the local 
                        lender in interest when you try to 
                        get money from him.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        60 percent.

           Patrick reacts to this.  Surprised.

                                 PATRICK
                        Where are the men?

           He asks Serena, but the bookkeeper answers.  As she does, 
           Patrick sneaks a look at his watch-- his other appointment 
           never far from his mind.

                                 BOOKKEEPER
                        This is a women’s lending group.

                                 PATRICK
                        So men aren’t allowed?

                                 BOOKKEEPER
                        Let them have their own group.

           The other women agree, nodding and talking amongst 
           themselves.

           EXT. IKEJA STREET - DAY

           Withering heat and humidity.  They are in a market area, 
           where several of the women run shop stalls, or hair salons, 
           or “chop” stands (restaurants).

                                 SERENA
                        It’s mutually reinforcing.  When 
                        they start as a group, there’s 
                        social pressure for each of them 
                        not to default.

                                 PATRICK
                        And what about the men?

                                 SERENA
                        We don’t generally lend to men.  
                        It’s not a hard and fast rule, but 
                        microfinance works better with 
                        women.  They’re better at saving, 
                        more likely to work together, and 
                        the profit is spent in the home, on 
                        nutrition and child care.

                                 SERENA (CONT'D)
                        So it has an added effect.  Not 
                        just raising economic standards 
                        overall, but helping the next 
                        generation directly.

                                 PATRICK
                        100 dollars at a time.

                                 SERENA
                        You’d be surprised how far it can 
                        go.

           Patrick looks over at the shop stalls.  Impressed.  But then 
           he remembers and looks at his watch--

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh shit.  I’ve got to get back.

                                 SERENA
                        Why?

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m meeting the guy from the 
                        Consulate at the Moorhouse.  He has 
                        my new credit cards.

                                 SERENA
                        Which guy from the Consulate?

                                 PATRICK
                        I can’t remember... Turner?  
                        Tanner?

           Serena just shrugs.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I need a taxi--

                                 SERENA
                        Komi will take you.  I’ll get a 
                        ride back.

                                 PATRICK
                        You sure?

                                 SERENA
                        No problem.

                                 PATRICK
                        This was really interesting.  Maybe 
                        this is something that my bank 
                        would like to help out with.
                                 SERENA
                        That would be terrific.  I’ll call 
                        you later at the hotel?

                                 PATRICK
                        Great.

           He smiles at her.  She waves to the end of the block, where 
           her driver KOMI (40s) is leaning against the car.  Patrick 
           jogs over to the car.

           As he reaches the car, he waves and smiles at Serena one last 
           time.  Then he turns to Komi, his face serious.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Bogo Chili.

           Komi nods.  They get in the car.

           EXT. BOGO CHILI - DAY

           Komi’s car pulls up and Patrick hops out.  He checks his 
           watch, looks around-- there are black guys around, but Otumbo 
           isn’t one of them.

                                 PATRICK
                        Shit!

           He’s about to get back in the car when someone WHISTLES.  
           Patrick turns-- Otumbo is on a motorbike at the end of the 
           block.  Patrick walks towards the bike as Otumbo motors 
           towards him.

                                 OTUMBO
                        We have to go now.

                                 PATRICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Abacha.  He is playing football at 
                        Yaba Stadium.  We have to hurry.  
                        Get on.

                                 PATRICK
                        On the bike?  No.  We’ll take my 
                        car.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Okada is faster.  You are already 
                        late one time.
                                 PATRICK
                        If anything happens-- I’ve left 
                        information with the Consulate, and 
                        my bank, and there’s the driver, 
                        right over there--

                                 OTUMBO
                        Don’t worry.  You will be safe.

           Patrick hesitates.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t trust you.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I don’t trust you either.  

                                 PATRICK
                        You wouldn’t have a helmet I could 
                        borrow--

                                 OTUMBO
                        Get on.

           Patrick gets on the bike, grabs Otumbo around the waist, and 
           they ride away.

           EXT. YABA FOOTBALL PITCH - DAY

           Not a stadium, just a dirt field in another residential area.  
           About a dozen YOUNG MEN are playing, split between two teams.

           Otumbo parks his okada and both men get off.  They walk to 
           the edge of the field.  Look out at the players.

                                 PATRICK
                        Which one is Abacha?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I don’t see him.  

           He takes out his phone and dials.  Patrick watches the game 
           as Otumbo speaks in Pidgin and then hangs up.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        My friend says he is coming.  

                                 PATRICK
                        When?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Soon.  We will wait.
           Otumbo walks over to the edge of the field where there are 
           some overturned plastic tubs.  He sits down on one to watch.  
           Patrick has no choice but to follow.

                                 PATRICK
                        Like five minutes, or an hour...

                                 OTUMBO
                        We cannot know.

                                 PATRICK
                        Well we could know, if your friend 
                        told you... it’s not like a great 
                        mystery of the universe or 
                        anything...

                                 OTUMBO
                        Here we are on Niaga time.  Not go- 
                        go London time.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m from America.

           Otumbo doesn’t answer.  Patrick sighs and sits down on a tub.  
           Not comfortable.

           LATER

           The match is still going.  Patrick checks his watch.  He is 
           filthy and sweaty again.  Otumbo dozes off, then wakes back 
           up.  It’s a sleepy hot afternoon.

           Patrick takes out his cell phone.  Gives it another try.

                                 OTUMBO
                        You need an MTN card.

                                 PATRICK
                        I know.  A prostitute told me that.

                                 OTUMBO
                        My friend can get you one.

           Otumbo yells to one of the PLAYERS.  The player turns and 
           runs off towards the neighborhood.

                                 PATRICK
                        Everyone here has a friend.  Or 
                        wants to be my friend.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Nigerians are very friendly people.
           Otumbo smiles slightly, for the first time.  Patrick has to 
           laugh.  He looks at Otumbo, watching the ragged action.

                                 PATRICK
                        You don’t look like what I 
                        pictured.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Really?  Did you think I would have 
                        a spear in my hand? 

                                 PATRICK
                        Well you are from a village, aren’t 
                        you?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I live in Lagos all my life.

                                 PATRICK
                        You said your father was a tribal 
                        leader.

           Otumbo gives him a look.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Is that what I said?  In the 
                        message that I wrote?

                                 PATRICK
                        You didn’t write it?

                                 OTUMBO
                        We sell our names.  500 Naira.  
                        Then the yahoo boys do what they 
                        want with it.

                                 PATRICK
                        For five dollars?  So then Abacha 
                        might not be real either.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Oh he is real.  He’s the “oga.”  
                        The boss.  You see, that is how it 
                        works here.  Everyone has an oga.  
                        Everyone answers to someone.

           Patrick nods.  He gets this.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        You have an oga, yes?
                                 PATRICK
                        My ex-wife.  Capital One.  Lexus 
                        Financial Services.  Antoine.  That 
                        prick Fleming.  Lots of ogas.  Too 
                        many ogas.

           The BOY from the game runs up and has a back and forth in 
           pidgin with Otumbo.

                                 OTUMBO
                             (re: boy)
                        He says 1000 Naira for the SIM 
                        card.

                                 PATRICK
                        Tell him 800.

           Otumbo takes some pleasure in Patrick trying to bargain, but 
           the boy balks.

                                 OTUMBO
                        He says fixed price.

                                 PATRICK
                        Tell him 500 after I know that it 
                        works.

           Otumbo starts laughing.  The boy tugs on Otumbo’s arm.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Okay he take 800.

           Patrick takes a wad of small bills out of his pocket and 
           counts out eight 100 Naira notes.  Patrick hands his phone to 
           Otumbo, who puts in the new SIM card, hands the phone back to 
           Patrick.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        Go.  Call your girlfriend.

           Patrick tries the phone-- it works.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m calling the driver.  Abacha 
                        isn’t coming, is he?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I am sorry.  I get bad information.

           Resigned, Patrick hands the phone to him.

                                 PATRICK
                        Tell him where we are.
           Otumbo nods and speaks Pidgin to the driver.  Hangs up and 
           returns the phone to Patrick.

                                 OTUMBO
                        He is coming.

                                 PATRICK
                        So you don’t write the emails?  
                        You’re not a “yahoo boy?”

                                 OTUMBO
                        I was.  But I stopped.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s good.  It’s cheating people, 
                        you know.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Did someone force you to reply?

                                 PATRICK
                        I was misled.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Okay.  That is how you see it.  But 
                        what I see is that there are no 
                        jobs.  Even for those of us who 
                        know computers and can write.  So 
                        419 is what we do.  

           Otumbo stands up to go.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        You have a good job.  You don’t 
                        need to lie to get ahead.  

                                 PATRICK
                        You don’t know anything about me.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I know you are not a victim.  You 
                        are a fool.  All those ogas you 
                        have, those are because of you.  
                        Here no one gives us a choice.

                                 PATRICK
                        You can say no.

                                 OTUMBO
                        So can you.

           It’s not anger in Otumbo’s voice.  It’s reality.  And it 
           finally has sunk in, at least a little, for Patrick.
                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        Your car is here.  Your driver 
                        followed you.  He was two streets 
                        away this whole time.  If I see 
                        Abacha I will call you.

           Otumbo starts to walk away as the car pulls up.  Patrick 
           calls after him:

                                 PATRICK
                        You don’t have my number!

           Otumbo doesn’t look back-- he just holds up a small object.  
           Patrick’s old SIM card.

           INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DUSK

           More go-slow through the city.  Patrick looks out the window.  
           The poverty, the industriousness, the epic energy of it all.  

           He starts making eye contact with the sellers walking near 
           the car.  He no longer looks away.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - POOL BAR - NIGHT

           Patrick at a small table.  On his phone.  Tired again.

                                 PATRICK
                             (into phone)
                        I mean there’s some of that... it’s 
                        just a lot of people.  And traffic. 
                             (listens)
                        Yeah.  Put him on.  
                             (waits)
                        Hey bud.  How goes it?

           He looks up and sees Serena has come in.  

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Really?  A handwritten letter?  
                        Which one is he again?

           She walks over.  He finishes the call and looks up at her as 
           she gets to the table.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        My son.  He got a letter from John 
                        Glenn.

                                 SERENA
                        Patrick I don’t appreciate you 
                        cutting out on me today.
                                 PATRICK
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SERENA
                        Those women thought you were 
                        important.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Well I’m sure you clarified that 
                        for them after I left.

                                 SERENA
                        You were with that guy from the 
                        street, right?

           He rubs his hands over his face, busted.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Patrick you could have been hurt.

                                 PATRICK
                        He was full of it.  My money’s 
                        gone.  

                                 SERENA
                        Of course it is.  What did you 
                        think would happen, he’d say he was 
                        sorry and write you a check?

                                 PATRICK
                        I should just go home.

                                 SERENA
                             (considers)
                        Actually sometimes they do write a 
                        check.  Then the check’s fake and 
                        you’re arrested for bank fraud--

                                 PATRICK
                        Stop.

                                 SERENA
                        It’s just money.

                                 PATRICK
                        I hate that expression.  People 
                        only say that if they’re totally 
                        broke or really rich and it doesn’t 
                        matter anyway.

           Serena just stands there.  Then Patrick realizes, he starts 
           to laugh.
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        No way.  No way!  You’re fucking 
                        rich!  Aren’t you?

           She grabs his arm.

                                 SERENA
                        Come on.

                                 PATRICK
                        No tell me!  Is it a trust fund?  
                        Or some kind of inheritance?

                                 SERENA
                        I have to go to this thing.  I need 
                        you to come with me.

           She pulls him up but he’s still fixated.

                                 PATRICK
                        Or your dad invented something, 
                        like Teflon or polar fleece... I 
                        want some money... can I have some 
                        polar fleece money?

           She’s ignoring all of it, leading him out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Establishing.  Not as nice as it sounds -- a standard boxy 
           building near the docks -- but the cars outside make up for 
           it.  Benz, Bentley, etc.  Valet parked in neat rows.  

           More cars and people still arriving, young and rich and 
           dressed accordingly.  And all of them black. 

           Serena and Patrick emerge from her Toyota Camry.  The city 
           amazes Patrick once again -- this time not for its poverty 
           but for its affluence.

                                 PATRICK
                        Whose birthday is it again?

                                 SERENA
                        The oil minister’s son.  Just 
                        follow my lead and promote my 
                        virtues.

           They head inside.
           INT. YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Crowded, loud, a DJ plays AFRO-POP.  Patrick holds a beer, 
           standing next to Serena.  Talking to a small group of 
           attractive, well-off Nigerians.

                                 PATRICK
                        So I go out there today and I’m 
                        thinking-- it’s gonna be amateur 
                        hour.  

           He gulps the beer.  But they seem to be listening.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not!  These women are 
                        serious!  Small business makes up 
                        over 70 percent of any emerging 
                        economy.  To empower these women 
                        financially, the way BUILD is 
                        doing... the effects are cascading, 
                        you know?  Better health care.  
                        Better education.  Lower infant 
                        mortality rate.  Lower crime rate.  

           This in particular resonates with them.  Serena is pleased.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        1000 Naira.  That’s all it takes.

                                 NIGERIAN WOMAN
                             (to Serena)
                        He is quite the salesman for you.

                                 PATRICK
                             (ignoring and drinking)
                        I mean look, let me tell you I come 
                        from a finance background, the 
                        numbers I’m used to playing with 
                        are seven digits, eight digits... 
                        but it’s not just about the 
                        numbers.  It’s about their hearts.  
                        These loans give them this 
                        opportunity-- I mean, we’ve all 
                        been blessed, right?  Am I right?

           They nod, that’s right, I think--

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        But these women have been... un-
                        blessed.  They’ve had the crap just 
                        kicked out of them spiritually, the 
                        sand kicked in their faces, the 
                        sands of Africa--
                                 SERENA
                        Patrick could you go get me a 
                        drink?

           He stops mid-sentence.

           BAR - LATER

           Patrick drinks at the bar.  He sees Serena across the room, 
           still with the group, sealing the deal or perhaps clarifying.  
           A BRITISH MAN (30s, white) edges up to him.  Friendly enough.

                                 BRITISH MAN 
                        You one of Tully’s men?

                                 PATRICK
                        Me?  No.

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Oh.  Sorry, mate.  Perhaps he’s 
                        come and gone.

           Patrick looks confused.

                                 BRITISH MAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not with Chevron, then?

                                 PATRICK
                        No.

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        I just figured.  We all have to 
                        make the rounds.  Dance the Token 
                        Minuet.  Kiss the rings.

                                 PATRICK
                        Who do you work for?

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Shell.  You?

                                 PATRICK
                        I work for a bank.  American.

           The man smiles.  Takes a sip of scotch.

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Well you’ve come to the right 
                        place.  This is the next Dubai.  
                        Minus the fundamentalist sense of 
                        rigor and coherence.  Tell that to 
                        your bosses.
                                 PATRICK
                        I will.

           The Brit studies the crowd.

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Look at them all.  Living it up.  
                        Meanwhile it’s our pipelines 
                        getting ripped apart, and our 
                        workers getting snatched.  But 
                        they’re the ones who need a 
                        reckoning.

                                 PATRICK
                        Why?

                                 BRITISH MAN
                        Because they’re the ones who nick 
                        it!  We build a platform offshore, 
                        it costs 8 million.  His father 
                        charges us 10.  And pockets the 
                        difference.  

           He points to a YOUNG MAN, surrounded by women, presumably the 
           birthday boy.

                                 BRITISH MAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s why Dubai is better.  
                        They’ll chop your damn hand off.

           Patrick smiles.  But he has really nothing to say.

                                 BRITISH MAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a shame, really.  We’re the 
                        bad guys, right?  Gas flares 
                        poisoning the air.  Spills 
                        destroying villages.

           The man shakes his head.

                                 BRITISH MAN (CONT’D)
                        Bloody hell.  We couldn’t save 
                        anyone here even if we wanted to.

           This strikes Patrick as odd.  But before he can reply or even 
           think it through, Serena catches his eye across the party, 
           ready to go.

                                 PATRICK
                        Have a good night.

           The British Man nods as Patrick walks away.
           INT. SERENA’S CAR - LATER

           They are parked in front of the Moorhouse.  Both in the 
           backseat.  Looking at each other intently.

                                 SERENA
                        Thanks again.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Sure.

                                 SERENA
                        You were good.  And dangerously 
                        full of shit.  You should move 
                        here.  And run for office.

           He’s drunk.  He tries to kiss her.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Patrick--

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s a stressful situation.

                                 SERENA
                        What is?

                                 PATRICK
                        All of this.  Has been.  In a time 
                        of war...

           He kisses her neck, but she’s laughing.

                                 SERENA
                        There’s no war.

                                 PATRICK
                        You never know who to trust...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PATRICK’S HOTEL ROOM - (NEXT) MORNING

           Patrick slowly wakes.  Head hurting.  He looks across the 
           room-- where Serena is in a robe, hair wet.  She checks email 
           on her laptop.

                                 PATRICK
                        What time is it?

                                 SERENA
                        7:30.  
           Patrick rolls over.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Komi’s on his way over to get me.  
                        Your internet here is brutal.

                                 PATRICK
                             (muffled)
                        We could meet for lunch later.

                                 SERENA
                        Can’t.  I leave for Accra on 
                        Friday.  I’m swamped.

           He turns back towards her.

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t leave for two days.

                                 SERENA
                        So?

                                 PATRICK
                        I have nothing to do.

           She shuts down her computer and starts packing it up.

                                 SERENA
                        Paint stores.

                                 PATRICK
                        Huh?

                                 SERENA
                        My father.  He owned a chain of 
                        paint stores in Arizona and Utah.  
                        Then he sold them.  Lots of people 
                        make money in not very interesting 
                        ways.

           She slips off the robe and quickly gets dressed.

                                 PATRICK
                        Ha.  I was right.  This is easy for 
                        you.

                                 SERENA
                        Do I look rich to you?

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s the point.  You don’t have 
                        to.
           She’s dressed.  She sits down on the edge of the bed.

                                 SERENA
                        You have two days, Patrick.  In 
                        Nigeria!  Do something.

           She gets up off the bed, blows him a kiss and is out the 
           door.

           INT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

           Patrick approaches the female FRONT DESK CLERK.  He is 
           holding his Nigeria tour book.

                                 PATRICK
                        Hello.  I was hoping to arrange a 
                        visit to the National Museum.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Yes.  I am sorry.  It is closed 
                        today.

           Patrick sighs.  That was his plan.  He looks around, the 
           lobby is quiet.  Then he looks out front... and reacts.

                                 PATRICK
                        No way.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - (MOMENTS) LATER

           Patrick is crossing the parking lot towards the edge of the 
           hotel grounds, which are ringed by a high FENCE.

           There’s lots of people loitering there who can’t get past 
           security and into the hotel... and one of them is Otumbo.

                                 PATRICK
                        What are you doing here?

                                 OTUMBO
                        I wait for you.  To go look for 
                        Abacha.

                                 PATRICK
                        No.  I’m not doing that.  

                                 OTUMBO
                        But you said you want to find him.

                                 PATRICK
                        We’re not going to find him.  I 
                        have work to do.  It’s over.
                                 OTUMBO
                        Today, we will find him.

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay, great.  Wait right here.  
                        I’ll be back in five minutes.  
                        Okay?  You happy?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Yes. 

           Patrick turns and walks away, irritated.  He has no intention 
           of going with Otumbo.

           INT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - POOL BAR - (MOMENTS) LATER

           Patrick drinks coffee and reads a newspaper.  Talks on a cell 
           phone to his family.  Etc.

           EXT. FRONT OF MOORHOUSE - LATER

           Patrick slides around a pillar, peering out at the front of 
           the hotel.  Otumbo is still standing there.  

           Patrick walks back to the elevator, snickering.  What a dope.

           INT. PATRICK’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Patrick works on his laptop.  He gets up and goes to the 
           window.  Otumbo is still standing there.  He can’t see 
           Patrick at all-- he’s looking towards the front of the hotel.  
           Waiting.

           LATER

           Half-eaten room service lunch on the desk.  Patrick goes to 
           the window, knowing what he’ll find...

           Then he frowns.  Otumbo is gone.  He’s puzzled--

           And then he spots him.  He’s WALKING IN TRAFFIC in front of 
           the hotel, selling... TOILET PLUNGERS.

                                 PATRICK
                        He’s selling toilet plungers.

           And Patrick stands there, and he watches.  Traffic is heavy 
           now but it still speeds up occasionally and is dangerous, 
           Otumbo weaves between cars, face shiny with sweat.
           Patrick is transfixed.  Something about this moves him.  This 
           young guy who found some plungers and is trying to sell them, 
           doing whatever he can... and still taking an occasional 
           glance back at the hotel, waiting for Patrick to emerge.

           EXT. MOORHOUSE HOTEL - DAY

           Patrick walks back to the fence.  Catches Otumbo’s eye.  And 
           waves him over.  

           Otumbo dodges the cars and makes it to him.  He seems neither 
           angry nor surprised, handling this seven hour delay with his 
           usual aplomb.

                                 PATRICK
                        We’ll go tomorrow.  After lunch.  I 
                        have to do something in the 
                        morning.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Okay then.  Maybe somewhere not as 
                        far for me.  I will call you.

                                 PATRICK
                        No problem.  Where did you get 
                        those plungers?

                                 OTUMBO
                        From my friend.

           Patrick just lets it go.  Some things are beyond explanation 
           at this point.

                                 PATRICK
                        See you tomorrow.

           Otumbo nods and starts back towards traffic--

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           Patrick waves him over.  He hands Otumbo some small bills and 
           gestures for the toilet plungers.  Otumbo smiles slightly and 
           begins cramming them all through the metal fence posts.

           INT. PROJECT BUILD OFFICES - (NEXT) MORNING

           Basic and non-profity.  Serena is trying to work as Patrick 
           hovers over her desk.

                                 SERENA
                        This is the guy who stole from you?
                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  But he waited for me.  I made 
                        him wait, it was kind of a joke at 
                        first... and he got a job, Serena!  
                        For the day!

                                 SERENA
                        They all do that.  What else was he 
                        going to do?  Maybe he’s trying to 
                        steal from you again.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh ho.  So who’s the cynic now?

                                 SERENA
                        I am.  Because I’ve been here more 
                        than a week.

           A CO-WORKER comes in and hands her some papers.

                                 PATRICK
                        I want you to help me get him a 
                        loan.  And I know you don’t lend to 
                        men usually.  But I’d look at this 
                        as a favor to me.

                                 SERENA
                        Our loans are small, Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                        I know.

                                 SERENA
                        So what I’m saying is... couldn’t 
                        you just loan him the money 
                        yourself?

                                 PATRICK
                        No.  It has to be legit.  If it 
                        comes from me, it’s just another 
                        con.

           Serena considers it.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Just one meeting.

                                 SERENA
                        Fine.  Call me later.

           But she’s still troubled.
                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Patrick what do you really know 
                        about this guy?

                                 PATRICK
                        He needs help.  And I can help him.  
                        Didn’t you say I should do 
                        something?

                                 SERENA
                             (resigned)
                        Yeah... I just thought you wouldn’t 
                        listen.

           EXT. “COMPUTER VILLAGE” - IKOYI - DAY

           A typical bustling African market, except this one is 
           completely filled with stalls selling electronics.  Each one 
           with a specialty: televisions, cell phones, stereos.

           Patrick walks with Otumbo.  It’s loud, hot, dirty, there are 
           hundreds or thousands of people, chatting or bargaining or 
           yelling or laughing-- you never get used to this many people.

                                 OTUMBO
                        A loan?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  A small loan.  So you can 
                        open a business.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I don’t understand.  What kind of 
                        business?

                                 PATRICK
                        Well that depends on you.  What do 
                        you know how to do?

           Otumbo doesn’t answer.  He doesn’t look at Patrick, he just 
           keeps walking.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You know about computers, right?

                                 OTUMBO
                        So?

                                 PATRICK
                        So there must be some kind of 
                        computer business you can have.
                                 OTUMBO
                        Like selling?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yeah... I don’t know.  It might be 
                        hard because the loans aren’t very 
                        big...

                                 OTUMBO
                        How much is the loan?

                                 PATRICK
                        I think the first one is 1000 
                        Naira.

           Otumbo laughs.

                                 OTUMBO
                        1000 Naira?  What kind of business 
                        can you open for that?

                                 PATRICK
                        A chop house, or a market stall.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Market stall?  That is work for a 
                        woman.

                                 PATRICK
                        Maybe you can get more.  She wants 
                        to meet with you.  She is very 
                        excited to meet with you.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Is she pretty?

                                 PATRICK
                        I don’t know.  I guess.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I think you like her.

                                 PATRICK
                        Just meet with her.  And think of a 
                        business you’d like to have.

           Otumbo thinks about it.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I can fix radios.
                                 PATRICK
                        There you go!  You can have a 
                        repair shop.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I can show her.  When do we meet?

                                 PATRICK
                        Tomorrow morning.  At your home.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Okay.  

           They walk on.  

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        I do not understand why you are 
                        doing this.

                                 PATRICK
                        Me neither.  You’re a hard worker.  
                        You can do something, I think.

                                 OTUMBO
                        But what is in it for you?

                                 PATRICK
                        Nothing.

                                 OTUMBO
                        That does not make sense.

                                 PATRICK
                        I know, okay?  Stop asking things.

           Otumbo smiles, having let down his guard a little.

           INT. PATRICK’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick stares at the CLOCK RADIO next to his bed.  He pulls 
           one of the knobs off.  Tugs at the cord a little.  

           Finally he grabs it, takes it to the BATHROOM, and throws it 
           hard on the ground.  And pokes at it with one of the nine 
           toilet plungers lined up next to the shower.

           INT. CAR - TRAVELING - (NEXT) MORNING

           Patrick and Serena in back, Komi driving up front.
                                 PATRICK
                        So I figure he can set up a stall 
                        in that electronic village place he 
                        showed me.  Over in Ikoyi.  He’s a 
                        really hard worker.  And a nice 
                        guy.  You’ll like him.

           Serena nods, half listening.  Patrick is holding the broken 
           clock radio.  They are stuck in traffic on Third Mainland 
           Bridge.

                                 SERENA
                        You know where he lives, don’t you?

                                 PATRICK
                        I have the address to meet him...

                                 SERENA
                        He lives there.

           She points to the LAGOON-- the houses built on stilts over 
           the oil-slicked water.

           EXT. BRIDGE FLYOVER - DAY

           Underneath the bridge: choked with buses, okadas, people.  
           Patrick stands a few feet away from where Komi and Serena 
           exchange a few final words at the parked car.  Then she walks 
           over and joins Patrick.

                                 SERENA
                        Okay.  Let’s go.

                                 PATRICK
                        You know where to go?

                                 SERENA
                        Basically.  We’ll call him if we 
                        get lost.  Look, you sure you’re up 
                        for this?

           Patrick nods.  But maybe he isn’t.  They start walking.

           EXT. EDGE OF LAGOS LAGOON - DAY

           Small boats tied up here, some fishing and bartering going 
           on.  Music, heat, people walking around-- that is always 
           everywhere.  Serena confidently walks up to an OLDER MAN.

                                 SERENA
                        Hello.  Adogbo Village?
                                 OLDER MAN
                        Okay.  2000 Naira.

           Serena smiles.

                                 SERENA

                                 OLDER MAN
                        1000 Naira.  Best price.

                                 SERENA
                        Round trip.  And you wait for us.

           He nods.  They step towards a small motorboat.

           INT. BOAT - TRAVELING - DAY

           It’s not far to the stilt village.  The water is completely 
           polluted and plumes of smoke rise from the ramshackle 
           housing.

                                 SERENA
                        Here.  I brought these for you.

           She hands Patrick some brochures that she has pulled from her 
           messenger bag.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh.  Thanks.

           But he’s hardly paying attention.  They are approaching the 
           village.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Have you been here before?

                                 SERENA
                        We don’t do much work out here.  
                        It’s been awhile.  Six months, 
                        maybe.

                                 PATRICK
                        Is it the same?

                                 SERENA
                        No.  It’s bigger.

           They arrive at the perimeter and begin navigating the small 
           channels.  The boat slows.

           This is extreme urban poverty of the most appalling kind, 
           seen only in a handful of megacities in the world.
           Ramshackle, canted shacks are made from rough planks of wood, 
           with the occasional piece of corrugated metal humped from the 
           mainland.  No electricity, no running water, no city services 
           of any kind.

           And there are THOUSANDS of people living here.  Patrick sees 
           men fishing, laying racks of freshly caught croaker to smoke 
           over fires or dry in the sun, a classroom with children 
           shouting in English as a teacher points to a chalkboard, a 
           crippled man crab-walking down a gangplank and up a small 
           rise, disappearing from view.

           The boat slows as there are other boats now, carrying women 
           selling loaves of bread, or fishermen heading out.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you call him.

           Patrick is mesmerized by it all, he turns and sees a man 
           squatting and taking a shit directly into the water--

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Patrick.

           He snaps out of it and turns to her.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Call him.

                                 PATRICK
                        Okay--

           Patrick fumbles for his phone.  He dials a number.

           LATER

           the boat has slowed at the foot of one of the shacks.  As the 
           older man ties up, Otumbo is waiting for them.  He is dressed 
           nicely, in slacks and an open shirt.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Good morning Mr. Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                        Joseph, hey.

           He gives Serena a hand and pulls her up onto the walkway.  
           Then Patrick.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        This is Serena Carson, from Project 
                        BUILD.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                             (to Serena)
                        Serena, this is Joseph Otumbo.

           They shake hands.

                                 OTUMBO
                        This way.  It is not far.

           Otumbo leads.  They follow.

           EXT. STILT VILLAGE - DAY

           It is all over water, all walking on planks.  

                                 SERENA
                        How long have you lived here?

                                 OTUMBO
                        In Adogbo?  Three years.  I come 
                        from my village, Bara.

                                 SERENA
                        I’ve been there.

           Otumbo doesn’t respond.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        We have some clients out there.  
                        Are you a Muslim?

                                 OTUMBO
                        No.  Catholic.

           Serena nods.  They keep walking.  Otumbo seems nervous.  
           Patrick is looking all around, a fully functioning 
           neighborhood in the most squalid conditions.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        We are here.  Please come.

           Otumbo leads them into a SHACK.  No door, just a cutout.  

           INT. SHACK - DAY

           They dip inside.  There is very little light and no other 
           people.  It is one room, maybe ten by twenty.  There are two 
           plastic chairs, a small table, and six mats on the floor.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Would you like a drink?  

                                 SERENA
                        No, I’m fine.  Thank you.
           Otumbo looks to Patrick, who smiles politely and shakes his 
           head.  He is trying to act casual, but he was not prepared 
           for any of this.  Otumbo pulls back the frayed fabric 
           covering the cutout window, bringing in a little more light.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Please, sit.

           Serena sits but Patrick motions for Otumbo to take the other 
           chair.  He sits across from Serena while Patrick sort of 
           loiters by the door.

                                 SERENA
                        Joseph, why don’t I start by 
                        telling you a little bit about what 
                        we do and how we work.

                                 OTUMBO
                        You were founded in 1992.

                                 SERENA
                        That’s right.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I went to the internet cafe in 
                        Surulere and learned all about your 
                        work.  I have googled you, Miss 
                        Carson.

           Otumbo smiles; he can be charming when he wants to be.

                                 SERENA
                        Patrick tells me you have some 
                        skill with computers.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Yes.  But... I do not want to do 
                        this type of work.  I am more 
                        interested--

           Suddenly Patrick GASPS in fright.  They turn to him--

                                 PATRICK
                        Sorry.  There’s someone on the 
                        ground!

           They look and indeed, in the corner of the room, a YOUNG 
           WOMAN is sleeping.

                                 OTUMBO
                        [angrily to her in Krio]
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        [sleepy reply in Krio]

           As they continue to argue--

                                 PATRICK
                        Does she live here?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Yes--

                                 SERENA
                        It’s okay.  She can stay.

           Serena smiles at the young woman.  Otumbo mutters at her one 
           more time then turns his attention back to Serena.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I am more interested in radio 
                        repair.  This is what I learned in 
                        Bara, and from my friend Legbo here 
                        in Computer Village.  But now, he 
                        is old and his eyes are not so 
                        good.  This is work that needs good 
                        eyes and good fingers.  These are 
                        the things that I have.

           Patrick pulls the broken clock-radio from a plastic bag.  He 
           hands it to Otumbo, who sets it down on the table.

           Otumbo has a small sack of RANDOM TOOLS.  Pliers, a 
           screwdriver, some tape.  He empties them on to the table.

           He starts to take the radio apart as they watch.  At first it 
           seems impressive.  Then it starts to become clear he has no 
           idea how to fix it.  It’s awkward.

                                 PATRICK
                        Maybe you need to...

           His voice trails off.  Otumbo is sweating.  Frustrated trying 
           to jam two pieces together.  It goes on.  Humiliating.  The 
           young woman wanders over and watches.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        [Starts to say something in Krio--

           Otumbo turns to her and SHOVES HER away, YELLING at her.  

                                 SERENA
                        Hey!
                                 PATRICK
                        Whoa Joseph--

           The whole thing degenerates as the young woman YELLS back, 
           Patrick has to pull Otumbo away from her, Serena leads her 
           outside.  Fiasco.

           LATER

           Patrick stands facing Otumbo in the shack.  Neither speaks 
           for a moment.  Finally:

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Maybe because of the clock part.  
                        You know, it’s a clock and a radio.

           Otumbo still doesn’t say anything.  Won’t even look at him.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        There’s not even any electricity 
                        here.  I mean, how would you even 
                        know if you fixed it?

           Otumbo looks beyond Patrick, out the doorway.  Patrick turns 
           and sees Serena having a conversation with the young woman.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        So tomorrow, if we meet at the 
                        other place--

           Patrick turns back to Otumbo, who is holding the broken radio 
           out to him.  Patrick takes it from him.  This is over.

           INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

           Serena and Patrick in the back.  Patrick with the clock radio 
           on his lap.  Patrick stares out the window.

                                 SERENA
                        Her name is Grace.  She’s from 
                        Sierra Leone.  Their village was 
                        attacked.  Her mother raped and 
                        murdered in front of her.  Father 
                        hacked to death.  She was ten.

           Patrick turns back to her.

                                 PATRICK
                        Who?

                                 SERENA
                        The girl in the room.  She’s a 
                        prostitute on Lagos Island.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SERENA (CONT'D)
                        A dozen men a day.  300 Naira each.  
                        She gets to keep 50.

           Patrick rubs his eyes.

                                 PATRICK
                        I can’t take it.  I can’t look.

                                 SERENA
                        I can help her.

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s too much.  I can’t do anymore.

           He opens his eyes and turns to Serena.  He is crying.  
           Halting, stuttering gasps.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not strong enough.

           She grabs his hand.  Sympathetic.

                                 SERENA
                        Oh Patrick.  Who gives a fuck about 
                        you?

           Patrick is stung.  She’s done with him as well.

           INT. PATRICK’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick is packing to leave.  He folds his clothes into the 
           suitcase, and throws the tour book and Serena’s brochures in 
           as well.

           INT. NATIONAL MUSEUM - (NEXT) MORNING

           Patrick is at the museum.  He is looking at the bullet-ridden 
           car of the assassinated President.

           EXT. NATIONAL MUSEUM - MORNING

           Patrick comes out into the bright sunlight.  He sees his TAXI 
           DRIVER and starts over to the car.

           He stops short.  Otumbo is standing a few feet away.  Patrick 
           walks over.  Wary.

                                 PATRICK
                        How did you know I was here?

           Otumbo is sullen.  Guard up once again.

                                 OTUMBO
                        I found Abacha.
                                 PATRICK
                        What?

                                 OTUMBO
                        He is sending out a new format this 
                        morning.  He will be there all day.

           Otumbo hands Patrick a slip of paper with an address written 
           on it.  Patrick is confused.

                                 OTUMBO (CONT’D)
                        It is for yesterday.  Because of 
                        what you tried.

                                 PATRICK
                        But it didn’t-- it didn’t go so 
                        well, Joseph.

                                 OTUMBO
                        No one ever tried.  Goodbye.

           Otumbo walks to his okada, gets on and rides away.  Patrick 
           watches him go.  He looks at the slip of paper again, 
           wondering what to do with it.

           EXT. SPEEDY INTERNET SHOP - DAY

           Another moderate neighborhood-- not like the stilt village.  
           Patrick gets out of the taxi and walks to the glass front 
           door, next to a HAIR SALON.  Nervous.

           INT. SPEEDY INTERNET SHOP - DAY

           There is a front counter with a CLERK (20s), then an L-shaped 
           room behind with rows of old desktop computers and some fans 
           blowing the hot air around.

           Patrick peeks into the room.  It is empty except for one 
           SMALL BOY at a desk.  

           Patrick laughs to himself.  It’s another dead end and the 
           perfect finale.  He approaches the clerk, reading a magazine.

                                 PATRICK
                        Excuse me.  Has “Abacha” been 
                        around today?

           The clerk points in to the room.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        But--

           The clerk is pointing at the small boy.
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        That’s Abacha?

           Patrick turns and takes a few steps into the room.  The boy 
           is largely hidden from view, but Patrick can see his legs 
           dangling, too short to reach the floor.

           Patrick isn’t sure what to do.  He takes another step and 
           Abacha looks up.  Patrick turns and walks out.

           EXT. SPEEDY INTERNET SHOP - (LATER THAT) DAY

           Abacha exits the internet cafe.  He starts walking down the 
           street.  Behind him, Patrick follows in his car at a discreet 
           distance.

           After a couple of blocks, Abacha turns into an ALLEY.  The 
           car can’t fit.  Patrick has them pull up, slowly passing the 
           alley.

           Patrick looks down the alley and sees Abacha sniffing glue 
           out of a paper bag with a couple of other YOUNG BOYS.  They 
           turn and see him, glassy-eyed.

           Patrick tells the driver to drive away.

           EXT. EDGE OF LAGOS LAGOON - DAY (MOS)

           Patrick talking with some men.  He speaks with his boat 
           driver from the previous day...

           INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

           Patrick in the taxi, they are driving in SURULERE.  They are 
           in traffic, Patrick is checking out the faces of the walking 
           salesmen as they go.

                                 PATRICK
                        There.  Stop.

           He rolls down the window.  Otumbo is selling DVDs.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Get in the car.

           Otumbo pauses briefly.  Then he gets in the front seat.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell me Abacha was a 
                        kid.
                                 OTUMBO
                        You did not ask.  Also I did not 
                        want you to know you had been 
                        tricked by a child.

                                 PATRICK
                        So he’s some master criminal?

                                 OTUMBO
                        No no.  But he is good.  He is 
                        smart, Abacha.

                                 PATRICK
                        Then he should be in a school.  I 
                        drove by a school in that 
                        neighborhood, a parochial school--

                                 OTUMBO
                        So you pay his school fees now?  
                        You want to help him now?

           Patrick takes a breath.  Game for one last try.

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  Yes I do.

                                 OTUMBO
                        He stole from you.

                                 PATRICK
                        So did you.  I tried to help you, 
                        didn’t I?  Who is his oga?

           Otumbo smiles slightly at Patrick using the lingo.

                                 OTUMBO
                        Abacha owes a lot of money.  He 
                        comes here illegally, from another 
                        country.  He has to pay the oga 
                        back for transport.

                                 PATRICK
                        So I will pay the oga.

                                 OTUMBO
                        You will pay the oga?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes!  I can get the money.

                                 OTUMBO
                        That is not possible.
                                 PATRICK
                        I am doing this.  I am leaving 
                        tomorrow morning and I am doing 
                        this before I leave.  Now you can 
                        either help me or not, but I’m 
                        doing it.

           Otumbo has never seen Patrick this intense.  And yet Otumbo 
           remains cool, like (almost) always.  He turns to the driver:

                                 OTUMBO
                        Abeg Bar Beach.

           The driver looks uncertain.

                                 DRIVER
                        You code me?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Chai!  Carry and go, broda!

           Driver isn’t happy but they head off.  

           EXT. BAR BEACH - DUSK

           A little bit of sand and a few chop houses; a lot of 
           contaminated water and mountains of garbage.  Somewhat safe 
           during the day and a no-go area at night.  

           The sun is setting in the haze as Patrick arrives.  He walks 
           with Otumbo from the parking area towards the beach.  Some 
           AREA BOYS approach and Otumbo talks to them in PIDGIN.

                                 OTUMBO
                             (to Patrick)
                        A little dash for them.

           Patrick nods, he knows how it works.  He pulls out a small 
           clump of Naira and hands it to Otumbo, who pays them.  The 
           area boys let them pass.

           There are a plastic tables on the beach, but all are empty 
           except for one.  The OGA (20s) sits with a few cronies, 
           drinking beer and surrounded by WOMEN who serve them.

           Oga is muscular and dark, wearing a cap.  Maybe drunk, maybe 
           violent.  He is laughing heartily as they approach the table.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Hello.

           Patrick stands there for a moment before they acknowledge 
           him.  Otumbo stands a few paces behind.
                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to bother you.  But I 
                        want to talk to you about one of 
                        your, uh, workers.

                                 OGA
                        Who?

                                 PATRICK
                        Abacha.

                                 OGA
                        Abacha?

           Oga looks confused.  One of the CRONIES says something to him 
           in Pidgin.

                                 OGA (CONT’D)
                        Ah.  “Leke leke.”  

           Now Patrick looks confused.

                                 OGA (CONT’D)
                        He is a little bird.  When he sing 
                        it go many places.

                                 PATRICK
                        Right.  I want him.  

                                 OGA
                        You want to buy Abacha?

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s not like that.  I want him to 
                        come work for me.

           Oga laughs.  A cue for the cronies to laugh as well.

                                 OGA
                             (to cronies)
                        Oyibo come to buy a black boy.  I 
                        should cut off his koko for that.

           Patrick waits for them to stop laughing.

                                 PATRICK
                        He’s smart.  He’s a good worker.  I 
                        could use him in my business.

                                 OGA
                        And what business do you have?
                                 PATRICK
                        Helping people.

           Oga leans back, pondering.  Takes a long hit off a joint.

                                 OGA
                        You say all these good things about 
                        Abacha, how much he is worth to 
                        you... that also makes me think 
                        that he is worth very much to me.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’ll pay whatever you want.

                                 OGA
                        Dat one na grammar.  Abacha is not 
                        for sale. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Name your price.

                                 OGA
                        You think you can sail across the 
                        ocean and buy us?  Those days are 
                        over.  Go away now.  

           Patrick isn’t sure what to do.  

                                 OGA (CONT’D)
                        Go.  Get off my beach.

           Patrick looks back at Otumbo, who doesn’t say anything.  But 
           he is looking off at something... Patrick looks in that 
           direction and sees Abacha playing in the sand near the water.

                                 PATRICK
                        My God.  He’s right there.

                                 OGA
                        So?

                                 PATRICK
                        Come on.  Please.  He’s just a boy.

           Oga doesn’t answer.  Patrick takes a step towards Abacha-- 
           and one of the cronies stands threateningly and points a GUN 
           at Patrick.

                                 CRONY
                        He say to go!

           Abacha is so close-- but Patrick is scared now.  There is 
           nothing he can do.  He sighs.  It’s over.
                                 PATRICK
                        Okay... okay.

           He starts to back away--

                                 OTUMBO
                             (stepping forward)
                        Coolu temper!  No dey bros 
                        fighting!

                                 OGA
                        Eh yah... you dey vex me oh!

           They talk in sharp voices-- a typical Nigerian conversation, 
           animated and incomprehensible, maybe angry but possibly not.

                                 PATRICK
                        What--

           But Otumbo holds up his hand as he continues to talk directly 
           to Oga.  Finally they’re done.  Otumbo turns to Patrick.

                                 OTUMBO
                        It is no problem.

                                 PATRICK
                        What is no problem?

                                 OTUMBO
                        Abacha.  He is yours.

           Patrick smiles.  He can’t believe it.

                                 PATRICK
                        What?  What did you say?

                                 OTUMBO
                        He say Abacha can go if another 
                        worker take his place.

           Patrick realizes what this means.

                                 PATRICK
                        You can’t do that.

                                 OGA
                             (to Abacha)
                        Chai!  Leke leke!

                                 OTUMBO
                        It is already done.

           Abacha runs over.
                                 PATRICK
                        Joseph, no.

                                 OTUMBO
                        It is best.

                                 PATRICK
                             (to Oga)
                        This isn’t right.

           Oga is suddenly FURIOUS.  He leaps up from his chair.

                                 OGA
                        I am tired of you!  I should kill 
                        you both!

           He grabs a KNIFE from the table and moves towards Patrick, 
           Otumbo moves to intervene, Patrick stumbles and falls in the 
           sand, but before things can go further there are SIRENS and 
           two POLICE CRUISERS-- 

                                 CRONY
                        Senators!

           People start to scurry in different directions, and the 
           police are quickly out of the cars chasing after people, it’s 
           chaotic and confusing--

           Oga grabs Otumbo around the neck, holding the knife to him, 
           backing away--

                                 OTUMBO
                             (to Patrick)
                        Go!

           Oga pulls Otumbo towards one of the chop shacks and they 
           disappear from sight, the police cautiously advance on it-- 

           Patrick watches this and then Abacha grabs his hand, pulling 
           him away, and Patrick finally reacts, the two of them run 
           towards the car park, beyond the police cruisers.

           Patrick takes one last look at the chaos on the beach, he 
           can’t see what is going on as two of the police disappear 
           into the chop house, there are GUNSHOTS--

           He shoves Abacha into the taxi and they hurry away.

           INT. SCHOOL DORMITORY - NIGHT

           Two dozen YOUNG NIGERIAN BOYS are in their nightclothes and 
           horsing around.  A priest named FATHER JERRY (50s, black) 
           stands at the doorway.
                                 FATHER JERRY
                        Okay everyone.

           The boys quickly move to their bunks and quiet down, bowing 
           their heads.

                                 FATHER JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Dear Father, accept the prayers and 
                        work of this day, and give us the 
                        rest that will strengthen us to 
                        render more faithful service to you 
                        who live and reign forever and 
                        ever.  Amen.

                                 BOYS
                        Amen.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        See you in the morning.

           The lights go off.  Father Jerry heads out.  Patrick has been 
           standing next to him.  He follows.

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Patrick walks beside Father Jerry.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        The dormitory is two years old.  We 
                        had a group of Italian missionaries 
                        who took it upon themselves to 
                        raise the funds.

           The priest is obviously pious but also casual.

                                 FATHER JERRY (CONT’D)
                        There’s about two dozen boys here 
                        at the moment.  Sometimes the 
                        parents come back to claim them, so 
                        that number can go up or down.  But 
                        it seems like for everyone that 
                        goes home, another one shows up 
                        mysteriously at the door.

           INT. ANOTHER BUILDING - NIGHT

           Father Jerry flips on the light.  Fluorescents kick in-- it 
           is a brand new computer lab.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wow.
                                 FATHER JERRY
                        Another donation.  Does Abacha like 
                        computers?

                                 PATRICK
                        Uh, not really.  I think he’s 
                        afraid of them, actually.  He 
                        probably shouldn’t come in here.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        Oh.

                                 PATRICK
                        I wouldn’t even tell him about it.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        Okay.

           Patrick nods, thinking that’s covered.  But Father Jerry 
           studies him.

                                 FATHER JERRY (CONT’D)
                        What’s his first name, by the way?

                                 PATRICK
                        Um...

           Patrick laughs nervously.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        That’s all right--

                                 PATRICK
                        --Emmanuel.  His name is Emmanuel.

           Father Jerry smiles.

                                 FATHER JERRY
                        Emmanuel.  “God is with us.”

           He puts his hand on Patrick’s shoulder.

                                 FATHER JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for bringing him here, 
                        Patrick.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FATHER JERRY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           The office is dim except for a single desk light.  Patrick 
           enters and walks over to a comfy chair, where Abacha is 
           curled up, asleep.  Patrick kneels down to him.
                                 PATRICK
                        Hey. 

           Abacha wakes and looks up at him.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to live here now.  And 
                        go to school.

           Abacha doesn’t answer.  He’s sleepy.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        There’s lots of other kids.  It’s 
                        gonna be fun.  Okay?

           Still nothing.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I have a son, did you know that?  
                        He’s your age.  Maybe you can meet 
                        him someday.  I’ll have him write 
                        to you.  

                                 ABACHA
                        Email?

                                 PATRICK
                        A letter.  Let’s go.

           Patrick grabs his hand and pulls him up.  They walk out of 
           the room together.

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Patrick shakes hands with Father Jerry and walks towards his 
           taxi and gets in the backseat.

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           From the front seat-- Serena turns around and looks at him.

                                 SERENA
                        Okay?

                                 PATRICK
                        Yes.  

                                 SERENA
                        Father Jerry’s a good guy.

                                 PATRICK
                        Thank you for doing this.
                                 SERENA
                        Hey-- you did this.  It’s never 
                        pretty.  But you got something 
                        done.  In Nigeria that’s a miracle.

           Patrick is subdued.  The driver begins backing out of the 
           courtyard.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        When do you leave?

                                 PATRICK
                        In the morning.

           They pull out of the driveway onto the pitch black 
           neighborhood street.  Patrick is thinking.  Serena senses it.

                                 SERENA
                        Patrick.  Let it go.

           Patrick looks at her, surprised she guessed it.  He gives her 
           a reassuring nod.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE - SURULERE - (NEXT) MORNING

           The taxi is parked at the side of the road.  Patrick watches 
           all of the street sellers as they walk by.  He has been there 
           awhile.

           No Otumbo.  Patrick checks his watch.  Time to go.

                                 PATRICK
                             (to driver)
                        Okay.

           The driver starts the car and pulls away.  They pass a soccer 
           field.  Boys are playing.  No uniforms, no equipment.  Dirt 
           and dust.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DICK’S SPORTING GOODS - DAY

           Filled with racks and rows of shiny new sports gear.  White 
           people perusing.  Climate controlled.  We are back in 
           AMERICA.

           Patrick and Liam stare at the wall of sneakers.  A YOUNG 
           SALESMAN approaches.
                                 SALESMAN
                        Can I help you?

           LATER

           Patrick pays at the register.  As he waits he looks down at 
           the counter, a cup of PENNIES with a sign:

                              need one take one

           It holds his attention for some reason.  Then the charge slip 
           is in front of him and he signs for Liam’s shoes.

           INT. FOOD COURT - NAPERVILLE MALL - DAY

           They’re eating pizza.  

                                 LIAM
                        Scott said it wasn’t true.  But I 
                        showed it to him on Wikipedia.  
                        “Pluto is not a planet,” it says.  
                        “It is now considered part of a 
                        distinct region called the Kuiper 
                        Belt.”  That shut him up.

                                 PATRICK
                        Listen buddy.  There’s something we 
                        have to talk about.

           Liam is eating, sort of listening.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        And it’s probably going to be a 
                        little hard for you to understand, 
                        but I want you to try.

           Liam keeps eating, betraying no concern.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Remember how I always told you to 
                        look for the good in people?

                                 LIAM
                        You never said that.

                                 PATRICK
                        Maybe not specifically, but in 
                        certain situations... the point is 
                        I was looking for the good in 
                        someone, and I trusted them, and I 
                        got in trouble for it.
                                 LIAM
                        Did you get arrested?

                                 PATRICK
                        No it’s not-- what I’m trying to 
                        say is I trusted someone and I had 
                        kind of bad motives myself too, 
                        that combination...

           Liam isn’t getting it.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        And the money, the money for space 
                        camp--

                                 LIAM
                        I know.

                                 PATRICK
                        Huh?

                                 LIAM
                        Mom told me.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Told you what exactly?

                                 LIAM
                        She said it cost a lot, and that 
                        you were gonna pay for some of it, 
                        and that Mom and Stephen were gonna 
                        pay for the rest.

                                 PATRICK
                        Stephen?

                                 LIAM
                        Mom’s friend.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh.  Right.

           Now Patrick is the one who is quiet.  Processing this new 
           information, trying to cover.

                                 LIAM
                        He fixes stuff.

                                 PATRICK
                        Like around the house?
                                 LIAM
                        No.  Like brains, I think.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT OF DIANE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Cold and wintry still in the midwest.  Liam runs inside.  
           Diane faces Patrick at the front door.

                                 PATRICK
                        He forgot his iPod.

           Diane nods.  She knows he knows.

                                 DIANE
                        I was going to tell you--

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s fine.   I’m just glad he’s 
                        gonna get to go.

           He seems sincere about this-- no hint of jealousy.

                                 DIANE
                        I mean about Stephen.

                                 PATRICK
                        That’s fine too.  You deserve it.

           He smiles.  And he seems sincere about this too-- so now 
           Diane is suspicious.

                                 DIANE
                        What happened to you over there?

                                 PATRICK
                        In East Africa, you mean?

           Diane smiles, but she’s still waiting for an answer.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know yet.

                                 DIANE
                        Well, I’d like to hear more about 
                        it, one of these days.

           He nods, but doesn’t answer.  She cares about him.  Kisses 
           him on the cheek as Liam darts back out past them.  Patrick 
           turns and walks away.
           INT. PATRICK’S STUDY - (LATER THAT) DAY

           Patrick checks his email.  The mail downloads... subject 
           headings are the usual collection of Netflix and Amazon and 
           junk and the like... 

           Then one message where the subject says Hey There and the 
           sender says Serena Carson.  Patrick smiles and doesn’t delete, 
           but saves it for later.  He scans on.  Deletes a bunch, then 
           comes to another one--

                           Mr Patrick Man With Many Ogas

           Under “from” it simply says:

                                    o k

           Patrick is intrigued.  And as he CLICKS to open the message:

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        Hello Patrick.  I am writing you 
                        this letter after a long time of 
                        thinking.

           We end at OTUMBO.  Alive and well.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This is Joseph Otumbo who you met 
                        in Lagos, Nigeria.  It is my 
                        pleasure to contact you and I hope 
                        that you do remember our visits 
                        together.

           Otumbo stares at the screen.  While others in the room seem 
           to be typing rapidly, he weighs his words carefully.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I would first like to say that my 
                        name is not Joseph Otumbo.  My name 
                        is Obi Kamara.  I am 17 years old, 
                        and I have lived in Nigeria for 
                        four years.

           He seems to relax visibly, having typed this.  He continues.
                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Patrick I am sure you are upset 
                        that I did not tell you ever my 
                        real name.  Maybe when I tell you 
                        my story you will understand.

           EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - SIERRA LEONE - DAY - PAST

           A small but busy place-- huts, a dirt road, people and mules.  

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        I was born in Port Loko which is in 
                        Northern Province of Sierra Leone.  
                        It is a small village where I lived 
                        with my mother and father and four 
                        sisters and two brothers.

           There are families about: children playing soccer, men in 
           groups seeking shade, women collecting firewood and making 
           bread.

                        I am the oldest child in my family 
                        and a member of the Temne tribe.

           OBI (age 12) is among the boys who play.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My mother took care of my sisters 
                        and brothers and had a small market 
                        stall.  My father raised livestock 
                        and worked in a mine.

           INT. VILLAGE SCHOOL - DAY (MOS)

           Obi is in a classroom, seated on the floor with many other 
           BOYS, gazing up at the primitive blackboard.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        I was a student for many years of 
                        my life.  My goal was to be a 
                        scientiest or teacher.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PORT LOKO - NIGHT

           As the village sleeps, SOLDIERS creep out of the nearby bush 
           and descend.
                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        Unfortunately for many years there 
                        was civil war in my country.  The 
                        war started in 1992 in Freetown our 
                        capital and lasted for 10 years.

           The soldiers ATTACK.  In the darkness it is hard to see, 
           there are FLASHES of muzzle fire and SCREAMS.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        When the war come to Port Loko it 
                        was very terrible.  The village was 
                        raided and women were raped, men 
                        were killed, children and women had 
                        arms and legs cut off to mark them.

           NEXT MORNING

           the village is quiet, no signs of life.  The only sound is 
           the crackling of the huts as they burn.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I will not tell you all of the 
                        things I saw because I do not like 
                        to think about them or put them 
                        back into the world.

                        All of my family was killed except 
                        for me, two younger sisters, and 
                        younger brother.  For some time we 
                        lived in a refugee camp near the 
                        border in Guinea.  We lived in the 
                        camp for over one year.  One of my 
                        sisters died there of disease.

           Cramped, squalid conditions.  Undignified and tragic.

                        Four years ago we left the camp on 
                        foot to make it to Nigeria.  A year 
                        after we arrived in Nigeria we 
                        began to live in Adogbo, Lagos 
                        State, where you visit me in my 
                        home.

                        I hope Patrick when I tell you this 
                        you understand a little more of my 
                        story.  It has been a difficult 
                        journey of pain and sorrow.  I have 
                        not been able to fulfill my dreams, 
                        because every day when I work it is 
                        only to survive.

                        friends, also from Sierra Leone.  
                        One of my mates from Port Loko, we 
                        had learned a month earlier that he 
                        was still alive.  We worked hard to 
                        save money working at the docks or 
                        selling, so each of us could have 
                        one drink at the nice bar.

           Otumbo and his friends at the bar.

                        You say you hear me say “Otumbo.”  
                        Otumbo?  I do not say this.

                        “Otumokpo.”  It is a pidgin word.  
                        It means juju, black magic.  This 
                        is how my friend tease me, the way 
                        he say for me to get a girl.

           Patrick exits the washroom, having heard what he heard.

           Patrick confronts Otumbo at the door.

                        Then you asked me who I was, and I

                        Mr. Patrick try to understand.  A 
                        white man comes and says a name to 
                        you.  If you say no, I do not know 
                        this man, then nothing will happen.  

           Otumbo runs.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        If you say yes, that is me, then 
                        maybe something good, maybe

                        So I say yes, I am Joseph Otumbo.  
                        Then I run, and you hit me with a 
                        rock, and the other things happen 
                        where I am not sure what to say or 
                        do, because I do not know anything 
                        you are talking about.

                        This is not so easy for me, 
                        Patrick.  I am guessing a lot of 
                        the time.  But I have to try.  And 
                        you are a very easy person to talk 
                        to because you are not always 
                        really listening to me.  And many 
                        times you are pretending yourself.

                        Then you offer me a loan for 
                        business.  I was surprised by this 
                        and happy and scared.  I do not 
                        have skills for this.  

           Serena watches...

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You tell me it is a woman who will 
                        come.  I think that maybe if she 
                        meet my sister Nanday, this will 
                        help Nanday.  I make her like 
                        Nanday better than me.

           Otumbo shoves the girl-- his sister NANDAY (15).

           LATER

           Patrick is saying goodbye to Otumbo after the disastrous 
           meeting.  Otumbo has a hard face as Patrick leaves...
                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Nanday is friendly, she get along 
                        with anyone.

           But then Nanday returns, tells Otumbo the good news...

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And the woman help her.  She will 
                        apprentice in a bakery!  This I 
                        cannot believe!  None of us believe 
                        it!

           Otumbo smiles.  Nanday hugs him.  But Otumbo is still 
           worried.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And still I know.  You have not 
                        found Abacha.  

           Gears still turning.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But I know you now, Mr. Patrick.  
                        So I give you Abacha.

           INT. SPEEDY INTERNET SHOP - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           Two of Otumbo’s FRIENDS (we recognize from the bar) roust 
           everyone out of the internet cafe.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        He was four years old when we leave 
                        Port Loko.  

           Otumbo guides “ABACHA” into the empty room.  The boy is so 
           thin and small, drug-addled at age nine, he barely walks in a 
           straight line.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He cried and cried for his mother 
                        and father, his brothers and 
                        sisters.  For months he would not 
                        stop crying!

           Otumbo instructs him.  Abacha is distracted, not clear if he 
           understands.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He becomes a hard boy, an angry 
                        boy.  Nanday and me, we cannot 
                        control him.
           Abacha wants to go.  Otumbo speaks sharply to him.  The boy 
           sits at the computer.  Otumbo and his friends hurry out.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But it will be a good future for 
                        Bilal now.

           A beat as Otumbo and the others race around the corner... 
           just as Patrick’s taxi pulls up out front.

           INT. SPEEDY INTERNET SHOP - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           Patrick takes a step towards Abacha and he looks up.  Patrick 
           quickly leaves.  Abacha turns his attention back to the 
           computer monitor-- he is watching a CARTOON.

           the OGA is Otumbo’s dreadlocked friend, the other guys his 
           mates from the bar.  It’s all an act.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        So you see Mr Patrick, you come to 
                        Lagos because of one reason.

           Otumbo whisked into the shack, a gun FIRED into the air--

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But because of this many other 
                        things happen to you.

           Patrick runs away with Abacha.

           Patrick is looking for Otumbo on the dark street and finds 
           him hiding in the ditch.  That small boy hands him a rock.  
           The boy is BILAL.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Otumbo and his friends hang out on the beach after the 
           exchange.  
                                 OTUMBO (V.O.)
                        Some of these things, I wonder: how 
                        can I do this?  I am the lowest of 
                        the low.  And I know for Mr Patrick 
                        I must be very convincing.  I must 
                        find a way for him to see what is 
                        the right thing to do.

           They are having a beer with the “POLICE”-- who aren’t police 
           at all.  The uniforms are fake and tossed aside, the cars are 
           borrowed and owners are being paid off and driving them away.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because it is too late for me, Mr. 
                        Patrick.  Nanday and Bilal, they 
                        are the future.  So I figure out a 
                        way.  In Lagos, there is always a 
                        way.  

           The friends are laughing, celebrating, but Otumbo is distant.  
           He looks back at the city as night falls.

                                 OTUMBO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Patrick please do not be angry.  
                        Sometimes there are things we can 
                        not know.  But this is something I 
                        know.  I will do what it takes for 
                        my family to survive.  And you have 
                        saved my family.

                        Mr. Patrick, you are a good person. 

           He hesitates, then types the final line:

                        Your friend, Obi Kamara.

           Otumbo moves the cursor to press SEND.  And as he clicks--

           THE POWER GOES OUT in the internet cafe.

           The room is pitch black.  Everyone sits there.  A long 
           beat... and then the power kicks in.  
           Overhead lights flicker to life.  And the screens pop on, the 
           machines across the room rebooting--

           He stares at the screen.  Wonders.  Isn’t sure what to do...

                        Dad let’s go!  It starts in twenty 
                        minutes!

           And Patrick deletes the email.  As he crosses and exits, the 
           broken clock radio sits on his desk, cord dangling onto the 
           floor.

           EXT. CONDO - DAY

           They’re walking towards the car.  Liam hurries around to the 
           passenger side but Patrick hasn’t unlocked the car. 

                                 LIAM
                        Dad--

           But Patrick is squinting up into the sky.

                                 PATRICK
                        Liam look.  The moon, in the 
                        daytime.

           Indeed, up in the blue sky is a FULL MOON.

                                 PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Look at that.

           It seems to bring Patrick great pleasure.  He smiles.  
           Meanwhile Liam rolls his eyes at Astronomy 101.

                                 LIAM
                        It’s always there, Dad.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Are you sure?

                                 LIAM
                        Yes.  Unlock the car.
           Patrick takes one last lingering look, then unlocks the car 
           and they both get in.

           Obi walks out of the internet cafe and onto the dark street.  
           People about, the buzz of the okadas, the hum of generators, 
           the glow of kerosene fires.

           He starts walking.

           EXT. SCHOOL DORMITORY - NIGHT

           Obi walks to the high retaining wall outside the courtyard.  
           Up above he sees the lights of the dormitory, the sounds of 
           the children inside.

           The children hush for their evening prayer.  He can barely 
           make it out.

           He waits.  And then-- Bilal appears in one of the upper 
           bunks.  He sees Obi down below.  An evening ritual.  Bilal 
           smiles.  Obi smiles back.  The lights in the dorm shut off.

           Obi turns and walks away.

           INT. SCHOOL DORMITORY - NIGHT

           Many of the children are fast asleep.  Bilal is in his top 
           bunk by the window.  Awake.

           He looks out to the sky.  The city is dark, so lacking in 
           power, that all the stars are visible.  Bilal gazes up at the 
           moon, lovely and full, almost close enough for him to touch.

                                                              FADE OUT.
