           Friedrich "Fritz" Lang (December 5, 1890 - August 2, 1976)
           German-American film director.  The best-known émigré from
           Germany's school of Expressionism, Lang produced an oeuvre
           that established the characteristics of the "film noir" genre
           that dubbed him the "Master of Darkness".  Film scholars
           consider Lang's films Metropolis and M to be his
           groundbreaking masterworks.  But the inspiration behind Lang's
           making of M is a story that has been largely left untold. 
           On a cold winter night in 1920, Fritz Lang's wife was found
           dead on the floor of their Berlin flat with a single bullet
           wound to the chest.  Her death was ruled suspicious.  Lang
           rarely spoke of that night, and history books and biographies
           have left this little known detail of his early years
           undocumented… or, strangely omitted.

           ON BLACK

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        The end of genius is sometimes
                        spectacular:  A bomb's explosion.  A
                        madman's gibbering.  An orgasmic
                        suicide before a sell-out audience. 
                        A Faustian pact with the Devil in
                        which nothing is left to chance.

           FADE IN:

           ROOFTOPS.  DUSK.

           CLASSIC NOIR-STYLE

           A MAN RUNS.  A leather strapped SUITCASE in his hand.

           SUPER TITLE:  BERLIN 1933 

           TIGHT ON THE MAN (40) looking nervously over his shoulder,
           sensing pursuers closing in around him.

           He maneuvers around a steeply sloped shoal of chimneystacks. 
           Throws the suitcase over the gap to the next roof.  It slides
           to the edge, clinging to the gutter.

           TIGHTER STILL ON THE MAN.  A look of relief.  A bead of sweat.

           He leaps across, almost losing his footing and plummeting to
           the ground below.  He snatches up the suitcase, drops to the
           fire escape, slides down to the alley, vanishes in the dark. 

           Sun dips below the horizon.  Night falls.

           INT. SEWER SYSTEM -- CONTINUOUS

           The man makes his way along the cavernous artery of gushing
           water spilling from conduits to a canal below.

           Trudging through knee deep water, he looks up through a metal
           grate leading to the street and sees a policeman standing
           guard above.  Walks a bit more and locates a manhole with
           ANHALTER BAHNOF stenciled along the brickwork.

           A moment later, sluicing through the water, a UNIFORMED
           POLICEMAN in pursuit.  The officer shines his lamp on the
           manhole and upon noticing that it's displaced -- BLOWS HIS
           WHISTLE.

           The convergence of loud footfalls and shadows on the stonework
           reveals a POLICE SQUAD already in the tunnels.
           EXT. WILHELMSPLATZ -- CONTINUOUS

           The man turns into a city square with prancing statuary and
           Communist and Nazi flags hanging side-by-side like two
           idealistically opposed parents.  He burrows into the
           zigzagging human traffic.

           An ORGANIZER spews anarchy on a bullhorn.  Books by Freud,
           Einstein, Mann, Brecht, Hemingway, and Wells thrown into a
           roaring bonfire.

           Bathed in perspiration, the man casts his eyes down and avoids
           TWO SA BROWNSHIRTS (GERMAN STORMTROOPERS), rifles slung over
           their shoulders, on a direct collision course with him.

           He steps into the motorway to avoid their gaze.  Passing
           automobiles and tramcars puff exhaust fumes.

           BLARING HORN from a massive TRUCK.

           He sidesteps it by inches.  Nearly kills him.

           Securely on the walkway now, the man steels himself and
           carries on.

           A street lamp ignites, reveals a DARK FIGURE in a Herringbone
           TRENCHCOAT crossing the motorway and heading up the street
           after the man.

           EXT. CANAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Fog enshrouded TRESTLE BRIDGE.

           We find the man alongside the canal, making his way toward
           the bridge.  A barge chugging thick bursts of coal transports
           freight up the flat gray waterway.

           The streetlamps bump on in sequence as the man makes his way
           onto the footpath.  A traveling OOMPAH BAND approaches from
           the opposite direction.

           Behind him, BOOTS CLINK confidently on the iron bridgework. 
           He shoots a look over his shoulder, spots Trenchcoat behind
           him, trying to close the distance.

           TIGHT ON TRENCHCOAT as a KNIFE slides from his coat pocket. 
           Glinting light flickers off the serrated blade as it's
           unsheathed.

           The man stumbles forward increasing his gait, breath heavy,
           suitcase tripping up his escape.

           The thickening fog is blinding.  Visibility less then 10
           feet in every direction.
           The man breaks for the nearing musicians playing a Bavarian
           standard.  Brushing alongside a French horn, clarinet, and
           squeezebox.  Ducking under a trombone.  Narrowly avoiding
           the gyrating bow of the strolling violinist, and coming face
           to face with a giant tuba.

           Trenchcoat pushing through the musicians, moving quickly
           past them.

           Trenchcoat closes in, slashes the knife through the fog. 
           The blade cuts into the man's greatcoat, slicing the back
           clean off.

           LOW AND TIGHT ON TRENCHCOAT'S look of confusion.

           Widen to reveal the man's severed, empty coat hanging from
           the bridge's studded support spire.

           Trenchcoat looks 360, races to the parapet, leans over.

           The BARGE trudges from underneath the bridge.  The man on
           its bow, drifting up river.

           Trenchcoat slams his fists into the steel spire.  Rushes
           off.

           EXT. BARGE (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

           A SEAMAN appears on deck holding a lengthy metal stave with
           attached kerosene lamp.  The man crouches down, hiding near
           stacked freight off the port bow.

           The barge plummets into darkness as it travels beneath another
           bridge.  The seaman pushes off its support pillars with the
           stave, steering safely through the narrow passageway.

           As the barge clears the bridge, the man spots an abandoned
           troller anchored to piling near the banks of the canal.

           The man leaps onto the troller.  His footing breaking through
           the timeworn hull before making his way off the boat and up
           the weed infested embankment on shore.

           EXT. WOODS -- CONTINUOUS

           The man crashes through a thicket of Sycamore trees running
           full throttle.  Vapor trails bleating out of his nose and
           mouth.

           A TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS.

           Craning his neck in all directions, he secures the suitcase,
           and chooses a route.
           INT. RAILWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           The RATTLE of trains and BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENTS blare through
           the station as the man crosses the platform to the
           STATIONMASTER'S BOOTH. 

                                 MAN
                        When is the next train to Paris?

                                 STATIONMASTER
                        Eight O'clock.  Departing in six minutes.

                                 MAN
                        Fine.

                                 STATIONMASTER
                        Berth or sleeping car?

                                 MAN
                        Private, quickly, please.

           Perspiring, the man slides damp bills through the slot in
           the window.  The porter thumbs it suspiciously.

                                 STATIONMASTER
                        Return?

           With an expertly raised eyebrow...

                                 MAN
                        One-way.

           The man nervously checks over his shoulder.  The platform
           buzzing with evening commuters, beat cops, and SA Brownshirt
           foot patrols.  No Trenchcoat.

                                 STATIONMASTER
                        Track two.  Boarding now.

           He snatches up the ticket and goes through the turnstile,
           heading towards the northbound line. 

           A flock of CARRIER PIGEONS explode high overhead.

           The Nazi high-speed train known as The Flying Hamburger idles
           on the tracks.  Steam billows from its undercarriage, like a
           fire breathing dragon awaiting flight.

           The 10-car chortling beast loads passengers.

           The man anxiously holds the ticket, waits in line.

           An UNDERGROUND MOB WOMAN in the horde spots the man.  She
           stares at him.  Familiarity breeds contempt.
           TIGHT ON:  Beads of sweat cascading down the man's cheek,
           soaking his fine linen shirt collar.

           The man meets the woman's gaze.  Every cell in his body
           freezes, unsure if he's been tagged.  He's one man from safety
           when she uses her German like a slap --

                                 UNDERGROUND MOB WOMAN
                            (German)
                        There.  Right there.  That's him!

           Heads turn.  A fervor of excitement permeates the station.

           ASKEW ANGLES:  Grimacing faces.  Glaring eyeballs.  Arms
           extended into accusing fingers.

           A wave of emotion spreads through the commuters like a plague. 
           An ANGRY MOB forming before our eyes.  What could this man
           have done?

           The train lurches forward on the rails.

           The man blunders for the handrail.

           WHISTLES and FLASHLIGHTS proceed POLICEMEN as they invade
           the platform with authority.  Some officers led by GERMAN
           SHEPHERDS.

           The man pulls himself inside the moving railcar, disappearing
           through the steam like a ghost.

           Doors close, lock behind him.

           EXT. RAILWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           The train gains speed and rolls out of the station.

           INT. FLYING HAMBURGER -- CONTINUOUS

           The man makes his way down the aisle.  Glances at TWO OLDER
           JEWISH MEN who watch him.

           The man fills his lungs with air.  Sighs relief for the first
           time.  Wrestles with the suitcase as he heads down the...

           CORRIDOR

           Checking the number plates tacked above the doors, he finds
           his compartment.
           SLEEPING CAR

           Now inside, he produces a switchblade and opens the locked
           latch of the suitcase. 

           THE SUITCASE filled with BUNDLES OF CASH. 

           He snaps to attention at the sound of the compartment door
           sliding opening, flips closed the case.

           A PORTER with a stern face.

                                 PORTER
                        Ticket.

                                 MAN
                        Of course.

           Hands him the ticket.

                                 PORTER
                        Papers.

                                 MAN
                        You'll find they are in order.

           Handing off his papers, the porter scrutinizes them, looks
           back at him suspiciously.

           The man nervously glances out the window.  The fog of his
           nervous breath clouds the glass. 

                                 PORTER
                        Why are you traveling to Paris?

           The man searches for a smart reply.

                                 PORTER
                        Wait a minute.  Lang...Fritz Lang? 
                        Are you making a picture there?

           The man removes his trademark MONOCLE from his shirt pocket
           and positions it over his left eye.

                                 FRITZ LANG (MAN)
                        Yes, yes I am.

           After everything he's been through, we can glean that his
           ego still craves the attention.

                                 PORTER
                        Fritz Lang, the famous film director. 
                        My wife will never believe it. 
                        Pleasure to welcome you aboard. 
                        Enjoy your trip, Sir.
           The Porter leaves the compartment.  We hang on Fritz's 
           haunted reflection in the window as the German countryside
           races by.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Training for our '36 Olympics, Lang?

           Fritz looks over to LOHMANN (don't worry, you will be
           officially introduced later), dressed in a Trenchcoat and
           sitting across from him.

                                 FRITZ
                        How did you...?

                                 LOHMANN
                        You know the answer to that question. 
                        Lets start from the beginning, Lang.  

           With that, we move through the window, following the high
           speed train from above as it races down the rails on a
           collision course with Paris.

                                 FRITZ (V.O.)
                        They're coming for you --   

           The SPINNING TRAIN WHEELS transforming into --

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE, DECLA STUDIO -- DAY

           -- SPINNING HAND-CRANKED CAMERA on the set of "DIE SPINNEN" 
           (THE SPIDERS), a silent B-grade adventure serial.

           Rolling camera and arc lights pointed at a beautiful ingenue,
           LIL DAGOVER, clad in a seductive tribal costume, standing in
           a campy replica of an Incan City.

           Shooting script on lap.  Cigar smoke clinging in the air. 
           FRITZ LANG, less world weary now, is a powerfully built man
           in a perfectly-tailored suit.  Directing from behind the
           camera, he's trying to elicit fright from the actress --

                                 FRITZ (cont.)
                        -- you're all alone.  There's no one
                        to help you.  You scream...SCREAM! 

           Lil's eyes widen.  Her lips separate.  Trying to summon fear,
           but the result is --

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut...cut...cut.

           The CAMERAMAN next to him stops hand-cranking.

           Fritz approaches Lil to give direction --
                                 FRITZ
                        Terrified.  It's terror.

                                 LIL DAGOVER
                        Terror.

                                 FRITZ
                        A conspiratorial organization has
                        left you a calling card.

           Fritz gestures to the prop department as they dress the set
           in hundreds of fake Tarantulas.

                                 LIL DAGOVER
                        What, you mean all them rubbery spiders?

                                 FRITZ
                        You're only escape from death is 
                        Kay Hoog.  Sportsman-explorer with 
                        a vast library, loyal servants, and
                        the best wines and women at his
                        disposal.

           Fritz gestures to her co-star, RUDOLF KLEIN-ROGGE, having
           his rather large and protruding gut cinched into a male
           equivalent of a corset by two stage hands.

                                 LIL DAGOVER
                        It's these bloody feathers.

           Lil pointing to the elaborate headdress costume atop her head.

                                 FRITZ
                        The ostrich plumage on that tribal
                        headdress was hand sewn by an
                        Oriental.

                                 LIL DAGOVER
                        I can feel my neck swelling.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're the Priestess of the Sun from
                        a world unknown.  Lost treasure
                        beckons you.  Shall I cloak you in
                        topper and tails?

           Frightened by his air of supreme confidence, Lil replies in
           nervous laughter. 

           Fritz sinks back into his director's chair. 

           His producer, JOE MAY, nervous type and prim as a governess,
           walks over glumly.  
                                 JOE MAY
                        Keep shooting, Fritz.  We're over
                        schedule.  They're threatening to
                        shut us down again.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Ego-mad narcissists, all of them.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Perhaps if you didn't go to bed 
                        with every cabaret dancing ingenue.

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you read the script I gave you?

                                 JOE MAY
                        You should eat.  I'll have the girl
                        bring a liverwurst and coffee.

                                 FRITZ
                        "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari".

           Joe May sips his coffee.

                                 JOE MAY
                        The audience loves the Kay Hoog series.

                                 FRITZ
                        I make and remake the same picture, Joe.

                                 JOE MAY
                        I'm too tired.

                                 FRITZ
                        A film should depict its times.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Germans are seized in rising
                        inflation, unemployment, collapse of
                        moral standards, political unrest. 
                        What do they want with lurid.  They    
                        need reassuring.

           A STAGEHAND delivers a NOTE to Fritz.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Lady told me to give you this, sir.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Well, what does it say?

                                 FRITZ
                            (reading)
                        "Perhaps rubbery spiders are not scary".

           He turns towards Lil, who is rehearsing before the next take.
                                 FRITZ
                            (to Stagehand)
                        Tell Miss Dagover, her services are
                        no longer required on set.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Fritz, you can't fire the star in
                        the middle the picture.

                                 FRITZ
                            (to Stagehand)
                        I want her extracted from the premises 
                        immediately.

                                 JOE MAY
                        I hate this job.  Fundamentally. 
                        Makes me nervous.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        I'll tell her, Mr. Lang.  But the
                        note came from the lady with the
                        brass pen.

           Stagehand gestures across the stage to THEA VON HARBOU (39) 
           a blonde stately German with a commanding air.  She's
           scribbling into a pad with a BRASS PEN.

                                 FRITZ
                        Who is that?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Thea von Harbou.  Writer.  Rather
                        prolific one at that.  Published her
                        first novel at thirteen. 
                            (beat)
                        She's Klein-Rogge's wife.

                                 FRITZ
                        Klein-Rogge is married?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Mmmm, appears to be a rather
                        mysterious and closely guarded chapter
                        of their lives.

           Fritz takes Thea in.  It doesn't go unnoticed by Joe May.

                                 JOE MAY
                        There's a party tonight for the
                        publication of Thea's new book.  You
                        and "L" should come.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, we can't make it.
                                 JOE MAY
                        I hear F.W. wants her to write his
                        next picture.

                                 FRITZ
                        Murnau?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Mmmm, something to do with Vampires.

           The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR yells -- 

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        Quiet on the set!

           The warning bell rings.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        Lights!

           The lights sizzle and blaze.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        Camera!

           A young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera.

                                 FRITZ
                        Action!

           Lil gives another weak take.  Fritz doesn't notice.  His
           eyes are squarely on Thea Von Harbou.

           EXT. RIVER SPREE -- EVENING

           Borderless inky water.  In the distance, a lone Yacht anchored
           and strung in glowing Chinese lanterns.

           PRELAP SOUNDS OF A PARTY.

           EXT. DECK, YACHT -- EVENING

           Inscrutable jealous eyes pursuing Thea as she mingles with 
           intellectuals and artists that eddy around her with admiration
           on their faces.

           Joe May sneaks up on Fritz, revealing him as the secret
           suitor.

                                 JOE MAY
                        I see you've resorted to stalking.
                                 FRITZ
                        Wallowing in the glory of parasite
                        celebrity acquaintances.  Why the
                        odd look on your face?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Snatched a set of porcelain figurines
                        dating back to the Ming dynasty. 
                        Little shop in the Chinese district. 
                        Proprietor doesn't have a clue.

                                 FRITZ
                        Should have snatched a proper tie.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Thea Von Harbou is emancipated,
                        accomplished, a devout nationalist,
                        and nearly forty.  You don't fall 
                        in love with people's minds, Fritz. 
                        Stick to your virgin starlets.

                                 FRITZ
                        I loathe parties.

                                 JOE MAY
                        I can imagine how much this little
                        extravaganza is costing Klein-Rogge. 
                        Where's L?

                                 FRITZ
                        Overboard.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Funny, I didn't think you the
                        murdering type.

                                 FRITZ
                        Nothing gained by a scandal.

                                 JOE MAY
                            (realizes he's serious)
                        I gave the toast at your anniversary
                        party. 

                                 FRITZ
                        We inhabit the same house.  Furniture
                        that you walk around in order to not
                        bump up against.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Why not petition for divorce?

                                 FRITZ
                        She'll contest it.  Besides, I
                        insisted on the Catholic rites.
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRITZ
                        It's like a vaccination -- enduring
                        'til death.

           Fritz's wife, LISA "L" ROSENTHAL joins them.  She's modest,
           unsophisticated, and desperately trying to exist in her
           husband's world.

                                 L
                        There you are, Fritz.  I was looking
                        for you everywhere.

                                 FRITZ
                        Not many places to hide.

                                 L
                        Very clever.  Hello, Joe.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Sweet, L.  Ever spirited.

           L holds up Thea's new book.

                                 L
                        Look, there's a whole stack of them
                        near the giant prawns.

           Joe May spies a strapping clarinet player in the band.

                                 JOE MAY
                        L, how about a dance?

                                 L
                        I accept on one condition. 

                                 JOE MAY
                        Name it.

                                 L
                        There will be no talk of dividends
                        and profit margins.

                                 JOE MAY
                        What's your position on counting
                        steps?

           L hands Thea's books to Fritz as Joe May escorts her to the 
           floor.  Fritz scans the deck for Thea, but she's not there.

           He goes to the railing.  Stares at the dark water.

                                 THEA (O.S.)
                        Not thinking of ending it all?

           Fritz turns, finds Thea next to him holding two Martinis.
                                 FRITZ
                        Difficult offing oneself with the
                        Gershwin playing.

           Thea grins, radiant in the moonlight.  Noticing her book in
           his hand --

                                 THEA
                        Will you read it?

                                 FRITZ
                        No.

                                 THEA
                        Then I apologize for the boorish night.

                                 FRITZ
                        It would be rude to contradict the
                        lady and criminal on such an occasion.

                                 THEA
                        I invite your contempt.

           Handing him a Martini --

                                 THEA
                        Forewarning, I make an absolutely
                        frightening Martini.

                                 FRITZ
                        Surely with the right Vermouth?

                                 THEA
                        Afraid not, it's brain-melting, knee-
                        shaking, bladder-weakening, shivers
                        down the spine, hair-stand-up-on-the-
                        back-of-your-neck terror.

           He takes a sip.  She awaits his response.

                                 FRITZ
                        Dreadful that.

           They giggle.

                                 FRITZ
                        Your note today "perhaps rubbery
                        spiders are not scary".

                                 THEA
                        Observation.  Hazard of the business.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, please enlighten -- tell me  
                        Mrs. Von Harbou, what frightens you?
                                 THEA
                        Real life.  What we do to one another.

           He turns her words over in his head.  Suddenly, FIREWORKS
           streak into the night sky.

           Clearly inebriated, Lil Dagover staggers over.

                                 LIL DAGOVER
                        Lights.  Lights in the sky!

           Lil's sudden shift from bliss to horror seizes Fritz's
           attention. 

           Lil SCREAMS.

           It's perfect, the scream Fritz has been trying to elicit
           from her on set.

                                 FRITZ
                            (sotto)
                        Circle that.

           The BAND ABRUPTLY STOPS PLAYING.

           Everyone on deck surges to the rails to see --

           -- the CORPSE OF A YOUNG WOMAN grazing the surface of the
           dark water.  Her eyes black, skin an unnatural pallor, and
           hair splayed like tentacles.

           EXT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           A wealthy suburb in the solid upper-class neighborhood of
           Wilmersdorf.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Headlights from an arriving car shine in the windows,
           illuminating aspects of the well-appointed residence.

           Eyes flickering awake.  Feet shuffling into slippers.  Fritz's
           domestic, FRAU NUSSBAUM (60), prying and ignoble in nature,
           pads down the stairway.

           She pours two tumblers of cognac, topping one off liberally.

           Fritz and L enter.  Frau Nussbaum helps them with their coats.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        To warm your bones, ma'am.

           Frau Nussbaum hands L a Cognac, already anticipating her
           response --
                                 L
                        Not tonight.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Very good, ma'am.

                                 L
                        Night, Mrs. Nussbaum.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Nighty-nite, ma'am.

           As L ascends the spiral staircase that dominates the room --

                                 FRITZ
                            (to Frau Nussbaum)
                        She's upset.  A girl was killed.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Tsk-tsk, poor thing.

                                 FRITZ
                        Garroted.  Plunged into the Spree. 
                        Police think it's the work of that
                        serial murderer.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Jah, I heard he mailed a girl's kidney
                        to an Inspector at Scotland Yard.

                                 FRITZ
                        Bound to be in the morning papers. 
                        Berliners waking to tea and sympathy.

           Handing Fritz a cognac --

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        To rid the nightmares, Mr. Fritz.

           Fritz heads upstairs with the nightcap.  Frau Nussbaum downs
           L's cognac in a single shot -- her usual routine.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           L seated at the vanity, taking down her hair.

           Fritz yanks off his bow tie, setting it on the bureau next
           to Thea's book.  He opens the cover, reads --

                    Blossoming Lotus by Thea von Harbou.  

           -- runs his finger affectionately along the words.

                                 L
                        Did you tell Frau Nussbaum about it?
                                 FRITZ
                        About what?

                                 L
                        The murder.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't know.

                                 L
                        What did you say?

                                 FRITZ
                        One doesn't always have to say what
                        one thinks, L.

                                 L
                        I went by the Institute today. 
                        Hallways are flooded with legions of
                        shell-shocked men; syphilis,
                        tuberculosis, amputees, and worse.

                                 FRITZ
                        Terrible throbbing in the temples.

           Fritz opens his bureau drawer and finds a bottle of Aspirin
           near his BROWNING SERVICE REVOLVER, at the quick in case of
           intruder.

                                 L
                        I'm needed there?

                                 FRITZ
                        Where?

                                 L
                        The hospital.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're needed here.

                                 L
                        Frau Nussbaum does the cooking,
                        cleaning, washing, mending -- what's 
                        left for me to do?

                                 FRITZ
                        You do what the others do.

                                 L
                        You would love a woman like that
                        wouldn't you?  Someone who needs to
                        check her diary to see if she's able
                        to luncheon.
                                 FRITZ
                        You crack on about it, but most women
                        would die to have what you have.

                                 L
                        The woman who wrote the book --    
                        I saw the way you looked at her
                        tonight.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't be ridiculous.  She's nearly
                        forty.

           L turns to the mirror, insecurity and self-loathing wearing
           her face.

                                 L
                        Someone at the party said that she's
                        a baroness.

                                 FRITZ
                        She's not a baroness.

                                 L
                            (quoting)
                        Poor Fritz, "Germany's premiere film
                        Director marries Russian-Jew Nurse
                        from Vilna slums."

                                 FRITZ
                        Shall I censor the society pages too?

                                 L
                        You regret our marriage.  Don't be a
                        coward, admit it.

                                 FRITZ
                        All right, if you must know -- you
                        crack on about the mundane.  You're
                        settled in your ways, anemic in your
                        excitements and sober in taste.  If
                        it were up to you, we'd go to the
                        Spiesehauster for Kippers every night.

                                 L
                        At least I don't deny where I come
                        from.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, it precedes you through the door
                        and takes a seat at the head of the
                        table.

                                 L
                        Do you think of your mother when you
                        pretend to be one of them?
                                 FRITZ
                        What the hell you're talking about.

                                 L
                        You refuse to go to her grave.

           Fritz's pain turns to anger.

                                 FRITZ
                        My mother was Catholic!

                                 L
                        Your mother lies in Weissensee with
                        her people.

                                 FRITZ
                        A night of enthusiasms, is that what
                        you want?   

                                 L
                        If I could, I would kill you.

           Fritz races to the bureau and extracts his BROWNING REVOLVER. 
           It's our first glimpse at his rage.

                                 FRITZ
                            (handing it to her)
                        Here, take it.  What are you waiting for?

           WE TRAVEL through the common dividing wall to --

           FRAU NUSSBAUM'S BEDROOM

           -- Frau Nussbaum's ear peeled against the wall, snooping on
           the private affairs of her employers.

           WE TRAVEL through the common dividing wall to --

           INT. FRITZ'S STUDY -- LATE NIGHT

           Alone at his desk, Fritz is reading Thea's book.  We can
           tell by his face that the words are aching with resonance. 
           Turning the final page, he draws a breath, fights back an
           onslaught of emotion -- Euphoric.  Lost.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

           Blistered sausages hiss in a cast iron skillet on the stove.

                                 FRITZ (O.S.)
                        Most victims were missing appendages.

           Frau Nussbaum prepares breakfast as Fritz reads aloud from
           the morning paper.
                                 FRITZ
                            (reading)
                        Although the latest victim's limbs
                        were intact, authorities say the
                        condition of body and other
                        unprintable offenses point to the
                        work of a serial-killer dubbed "The
                        Monster of Dusseldorf" by the public,
                        and whose early victims hailed from
                        that district.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Jah, monster.

                                 FRITZ
                            (reading)
                        Authorities believe the unidentified
                        female victim was dead no longer
                        then a few hours before her body was
                        recovered from the Spree. 

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Tsk-tsk.  Poor girl

                                 FRITZ
                        Berlin's Chief Inspector Lohmann was
                        unavailable for comment.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Lohmann's the big wheel at the Alex. 
                        They say his homicide record is one
                        hundred percent.  He'll unmask the
                        monster.

                                 FRITZ
                        Frau Nussbaum, I have an engagement
                        at half past ten.  I'm not to be
                        disturbed.  Show them to my study,
                        all right.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Jah, jah, jah, half ten.

           Fritz's gaze freezes on L's empty chair and place setting at
           the kitchen table.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Will Mrs. Fritz be joining for
                        breakfast?

                                 FRITZ
                        Bit of a restless night, I'm afraid. 

           PRELAP SOUNDS OF A CUCKOO CLOCK. 
           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Frau Nussbaum eyes Thea Von Harbou warily as she escorts her  
           up the staircase to the upper chamber.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        This way, ma'am.

           Thea unwinds her scarf as she makes her way into Fritz's
           sanctuary.

           INT. FRITZ'S STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           The large garret room has been converted into an office. 
           Fritz, a consummate modernist, is posed behind his custom
           built Bauhaus desk.

                                 FRITZ
                        Thank you, Frau Nussbaum.

           Frau Nussbaum remains planted in the room.

                                 FRITZ
                        You may go now, Frau Nussbaum.

           She flares her nostrils at him and shuffles out.

           Fritz stands to receive Thea, but before he's able to make
           an impression, L barges into the room dressed in a housecoat, 
           head in pincurls.

                                 L
                        Fritz...
                            (noticing Thea)
                        Oh, I didn't realize you had a guest.

                                 THEA
                            (to L)
                        Hello, Mrs. Lang.  I'm here to discuss
                        business with your husband.

                                 L
                        Oh, I see.  Certainly.  Hello.

           L self-consciously pats her hair as she eyes Thea's smartly
           tailored suit.

                                 L
                        I'm not usually dressed like this. 
                            (re. Thea's stockings)
                        Are those real silk...

                                 FRITZ
                        For God's sake, L.
                                 L
                        Well, I'll just leave you to...

           L goes to the dormer window in the sloping roof.  Pulling
           back the heavy draperies so that light floods in.

           Thea adjusts her eyes to the harsh glare before noticing the  
           FERRIS WHEEL that fills the glass.  The upper regions of the
           monster rising out of the forested common surrounding it.

                        It's stunning.

           L stares at the spinning gears with trepidation.

                        Fritz says you should try everything
                        once before you die.  I get goose
                        pimples just thinking about it.

                                 THEA
                        It's quite safe.  You needn't be
                        afraid of it, unless you're afraid
                        of yourself.

           L turns her words over, leaves.  Fritz locks the door behind
           her, turns to Thea.

                                 FRITZ
                        Read your book.  Didn't care for it. 
                        Didn't see the point.

                                 THEA
                        Thank you for that unbiased
                        portraiture of my novel.  I
                        particularly like the half sentences
                        and insults dropped like curtsies.

           Thea removes a pair of glasses from her handbag.  Slides
           them on and studies his face.

                                 FRITZ
                        You stare at me as if establishing
                        lunacy.

                                 THEA
                        Your left eye, the iris, it's...

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes, injury from the war.
                                 THEA
                        You look nothing like him.

                                 FRITZ
                        Who?

                                 THEA
                        Surely you know they refer to you as
                        the Stalin of film?

                                 FRITZ
                        Mark of a truly educated person to
                        be moved by a statistic.

                                 THEA
                        It's a love letter to India.  Mann
                        called it "burningly ambitious".

                                 FRITZ
                        A book should tell a good story. 
                        That's all I'm suggesting.

                                 THEA
                        I'm sure there are values to such
                        honest criticism.  I'll make sure 
                        to telegram the Romana Maharishi who
                        inspired the rotten opus.

           She takes a BRASS PEN and NOTEPAD from her handbag and writes
           down an address. 

                                 THEA
                        My Optometrist in the village.  He
                        does a thorough examination.  I'll
                        show myself to the door.

           As she's leaving --

                                 FRITZ
                        You're not really going to work for
                        that hack Murnau?

                                 THEA
                        Who told you that?

                                 FRITZ
                        A little bird.  My birds are reliable. 
                        Do you want my advice?

                                 THEA
                        I didn't come for advice.

                                 FRITZ
                        His last picture wasn't worth the
                        train ticket from Babelsberg.
                                 THEA
                        Goodbye, Mr. Lang.

                                 FRITZ
                        I want a scenario where characters
                        aren't always escaping flooded rooms,
                        mental wards, jail cells, and caves.

                                 THEA
                        You despised my book.

                                 FRITZ
                        I didn't care for the story.  Your
                        writing itself seems almost channeled. 
                        Beautiful, passionate, heartbreaking.

           She remains stoic, but his words nearly knock her over.

                                 THEA
                        I see.

                                 FRITZ
                        A Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou
                        motion picture.  You would have
                        complete freedom to create of course.

                                 THEA
                        Why did you lock the door?

                                 FRITZ
                        I always lock it when I'm working.

                                 THEA
                        Lets get one thing straight, you're
                        not the general and I'm not the
                        troops.

           Thea turns to a door off his study.

                                 THEA
                        What is this room used for?

                                 FRITZ
                        Storage.

                                 THEA
                        Is there a window?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.

                                 THEA
                        I like to end by three o'clock.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're accepting?
                                 THEA
                        I never allow anyone into my personal
                        study.  Can you agree to those terms?

                                 FRITZ
                        Agreed.

                                 THEA
                        Besides, I'm destined for a rather
                        sordid divorce.

                                 FRITZ
                        From Rogue-Klein?

                                 THEA
                        A stiff drink and a good part, he'll
                        be fine.

                                 FRITZ
                        Forgive me, but that was spoken like
                        a man.

                                 THEA
                        Then it will command your respect.
                            (beat)
                        In the meantime, I'd like to get the
                        uncomfortable business out of the way.

           As Thea pushes her glasses towards her upturned nose --

                                 THEA
                        Now Mr. Lang, I'd like to see you
                        without your pants.

           The camera pushes towards the window, landing on the colossal
           rotating FERRIS WHEEL.

           EXT. OPTOMETRIST OFFICE -- DAY

           A MONSTROUS BLINKING EYE AND MONOCLE sign hangs over the door.

           INT. OPTOMETRIST OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Antiquated gadgets, instruments, charts, and diagrams of 
           eye anatomy.

           Fritz's grossly enlarged pupil pressed against a magnifying
           glass as the OPTOMETRIST examines him.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Open your eye wide.  Keep it open. 
                        That's it -- that's good.  Blink
                        please.  Blink.  Relax.

                            (beat)
                        The damage to your left retina is
                        extensive.

                                 FRITZ
                        Russia, Italy, Balkans, I did my
                        bit.  Bullets missed all the vital
                        organs.  Nearly lost the eye.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        It must have been painful.

                                 FRITZ
                        More of a spreading numbness. 
                        Convalesced in Vienna hospital. 
                        That's where I met L, my wife. 
                        Amongst the carnage.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Dynamic range is paramount in your
                        profession.

                                 FRITZ
                        I was meant to be an architect, like
                        my father.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        You'll need to be fitted.

           The Optometrist hands him an Oriental silk palace fan.  Throws
           the lights and flips on a projector that illuminates an
           eyechart on the wall.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Stand on the white line.  Cover your
                        right eye.  From the top row.

                                 FRITZ
                        F - R - P - S - C - Q - E.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Good.  Now the left.

                                 FRITZ
                        K.  I.  L.  L.  Err...L.  No, it's
                        definitely L.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Patch or monocle?

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't understand.

           The Optometrist walks in front of the projected eye chart.
                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Perfect vision in the left eye. 
                        Stone-blind in the right.

                                 FRITZ
                        Blind, then why a monocle?

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        Aesthetics.  I can have it ready for
                        you in a few weeks. 

           Fritz removes the Oriental fan from his eye and is  
           instantaneously met by a large letter "M" now projecting
           on the Optometrist's labcoat.

           The striking image vanishing into Fritz's psyche as the 
           lights flicker on.

                                 OPTOMETRIST
                        You may experience some disorientation
                        in the beginning, don't be alarmed. 

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- VARIOUS

           MONTAGE TIME PASSAGE with FRAU NUSSBAUM'S POV of Fritz's
           locked study door as he works in seclusion with Thea:

           The locked study door from the bottom of the stairs.

           The locked study door from down the hallway.

           Lugging a basket of laundry, Frau Nussbaum stops and sternly
           stares at the locked study door, proceeds up the stairs.

           Shadows playing under the locked study door.

           Frau Nussbaum at the locked study door with a tray of tea. 
           Thea appears briefly to retrieve it. 

           Frau Nussbaum kneeling at keyhole of the locked study door.

           CLICK.  The locked study door opens, Frau Nussbaum scurries
           out of sight. 

           Frau Nussbaum's ear peeled against the locked study door. 
           Snatches of conversation overheard.

           INT. FRITZ'S STUDY -- DAY

           PAN across Fritz's desk.  Typed script pages with BLUE PENCIL
           notations lead to the shadowy images of Fritz and Thea making
           love. 

           Thea rolls onto her back.
                                 THEA
                        I was half-hoping the sex would be
                        tedious, you know.

                                 FRITZ
                        That would make it easy.

                                 THEA
                        Mmm.

           Thea notices a photograph of Fritz and Joe May taken in 
           Manhattan Harbor.

                                 THEA
                        Manhattan skyline.  Is this you?

                                 FRITZ
                        It was.

           Fritz steals a tender glance at her.

                                 FRITZ
                        Adrift.  That's how it feels.

                                 THEA
                        We should get dressed, finish writing
                        the scene. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm in love, Thea.

           Thea manufactures a calming smile.

                                 THEA
                        Love isn't something you proclaim
                        while your wife is out treating
                        Diphtheria and dressing wounds.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm going to tell her.

                                 THEA
                        None of us wants the public shame.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't care about that.  I want to
                        marry you.

                                 THEA
                        It's possible that now is not the
                        right time.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you love me, Thea?
                                 THEA
                        I'm leaving.

                                 FRITZ
                        Where?

                                 THEA
                        India.  Six weeks.

                                 FRITZ
                        India?

                                 THEA
                        It's where I go to clear my mind.

           He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's where you go to end things.

           EXT. STREET (WEEKS LATER) -- EARLY EVENING

           Coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys. 
           L walks home from the hospital wearing a nursing uniform.

           She runs across the road to the Optometrist office, which
           has just turned over its "CLOSED" sign in the window.  BANGS
           on the glass.

                                 L
                        No, wait.  Wait...

           The Optometrist unlocks the door and L disappears inside.

           A moment later, she resurfaces with a small box wrapped in
           brown paper and twine.

           EXT. WURSTELPRATER PARK -- MOMENTS LATER

           L walks past the entrance to the amusement park.  She notices
           two sisters who appear to be lost, 14-year-old LOUISE and  
           5-year-old GURTRUDE, holding an anthropomorphic BALLOON.

           A MAN IN A CRUMPLED FEDORA, is assisting them.  Sensing
           something is off, L approaches.  But her gaze is diverted by
           the swirl and dazzle of the RIESENRAD FERRIS WHEEL looming
           above.

           Gurtrude's deserted BALLOON sails by, drifting skyward.  L
           looks back, but the sisters and man are gone.

           The BALLOON catches in the telegraph wires, until the wind
           shakes it free and carries it away.
           AMUSEMENT PARK

           Snake charmer, fortune-teller, and shooting gallery booths. 
           L wanders amongst the painted faces, anthropomorphic balloons,
           and sticks of candyfloss.

           A CARNIVAL BARKER, paper windmill stuck in his battered hat, 
           sways L over to a penny slot aptly named: "What The Frau Saw".

                                 CARNIVAL BARKER
                        See "What The Frau Saw".         

           Blushing, L heads to the Ferris Wheel.  Before she knows it,
           she's at the ticket booth.

                                 TICKET MAN
                        Last ride of the day.

                                 L
                        One ticket, please.

           L steps up on the platform as a young couple exits a gondola
           and she's ushered into their place. 

           Realizing that the couple have left their BINOCULARS behind --

                                 L
                        Excuse me, you forgot...oohh...

           But it's too late, the Ferris Wheel CLATTERS and begins its
           revolutions.  The throng people shrinking below as Berlin's
           city lights rise up.  L's apprehension palpable.

           The wheel steadily turning, bringing her higher and higher.

           The gondola abruptly stops at the top and swings idly.

           L nervously looks over to the next gondola, it's empty.

           She grabs the binoculars and sweeps them back and forth. 
           Discovering her own house, she dials in a crisp image of  
           the outward-slanting windows off of Fritz's study.

           The gondola CREAKS in the wind. 

           L feels guilty about peeping until Thea's naked body comes
           into view, standing at the window.

           L clutches the binoculars tighter.

           L's POV -- Fritz joins Thea at the window, moves his hands
           down the curve of her back and kisses her passionately. 

           L can hardly breathe.  Everything becoming faint.
           EXAGGERATED CLOSE UP of "What The Frau Saw", a dancing girl
           bent over a stool as the cabaret promoter thrusts her from
           behind.  The gears turning faster and faster.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           L bursts through the door, disheveled.  Clambers up the
           staircase.  Pounds her fists on Fritz's locked study door.

           The door snaps open.  L encounters Thea in the doorway. 
           They hold each other's gaze.

           Thea removes the pair of silk stockings that she's hastily
           thrown inside her handbag and hands them to L as a peace
           offering.

                                 THEA
                        French silk.  Impossible to come by
                        these days.

                                 L
                        Fritz!

           L throws them to the floor and rushes into Fritz's study.

           Thea passes Frau Nussbaum on the staircase heading upstairs
           with a tea tray.  Thea exits the front door as the muffled
           sounds of an argument are heard above. 

           A GUNSHOT EXPLODES.  TIME STOPS.

           The tea tray in Frau Nussbaum's grip CRASHES to the floor. 
           She stands frozen, staring up the staircase.

           INT. LANDING, HALLWAY UPSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Frau Nussbaum moves gingerly along the landing, glancing
           inside Fritz's bedroom and study as she walks past.

           She ambles towards a washroom at the end of the corridor. 
           Light spilling out from beneath the door.

           She carefully turns the doorknob, when the door suddenly
           snaps open and Fritz appears in the doorway.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hurry, telephone the police.

           L's BODY lies motionless on the washroom floor behind him. 
           Her head lolled to one side.  Her blood sluiced across the
           mottled tile.  The Browning in her grip.

           Frau Nussbaum shudders with fear.
           EXT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Reporters loiter the pavement, dangling cameras like black
           concertinas.  Meanwhile in the house, upstairs…

           INT. UPSTAIRS WASHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           BLINDING FLASHES from the crime scene photographers camera. 
           A knot of police surrounding L's body.

           The photographer snaps off a shot of the blood stained  
           Star of David hanging from a chain around L's neck.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE, STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz stares out the window.  A stiff drink in his hand. 
           Frau Nussbaum shuffles in, prattling --

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Detectives be wanting to talk to you
                        before long, Mr. Fritz.

           Fritz spots an indentation on his palm left by the BROWNING'S
           TRADEMARK PATENT on the grip of his gun.  A horrified gasp,
           as he quickly shoves his hands in his pockets.

                                 FRITZ
                        Mrs. Nussbaum, about what you think
                        you might have seen or heard tonight --

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        I could never forget as long as    
                        I live -- maybe longer.

           Their history rushing in around them. 

                                 FRITZ
                        You know that there will always be a
                        place for you here. 

           Frau Nussbaum drops to her knees, wipes a BLOOD SPLATTERING
           off his shoe.  She quickly shuffles out, hiding the soiled
           rag in her apron pocket. 

           Fritz notices something on his desk -- the small box wrapped
           in brown paper and twine. 

           He unwraps it and finds a ribbonless monocle inside. 

           Places it in his left eye socket.  Studies his reflection in
           a mirror.  The eyepiece altering his appearance to a half
           repellent Cyclops enigma.

           Sound of shuffling feet, Frau Nussbaum races back in --
                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        They're gone.

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Police.  Press.  Mrs. Fritz's remains. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't understand. 

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        They're down there.

           They turn to the window where an ant line of search party
           torch fire pierces the darkened forest lining the park.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Two little girls found murdered by
                        the footpath near the fair grounds. 
                        Officer said the youngest was
                        bludgeoned.  The older girl's head...
                        they're still looking for it.

           INSERT CUCKOO CLOCK:  A woodchopper yielding a sharp ax
           appears through a small trap door as the hands strike
           midnight.

           Frau Nussbaum tightens the shawl over head. 

           Fritz at the window, an insidious fear spreading over him.

                                                               FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. CITY STREET (NEXT MORNING) -- DAY

           PAPERSELLERS, latest editions clipped to boards hanging from
           they're bodies, run down the sidewalk shouting:

                                 PAPERSELLERS
                        Extraausgabe, extraausgabe!

           The headlines read:  "THE MONSTER OF DUSSELDORF STRIKES AGAIN" 

           INT. STUDY, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Having fallen asleep in his chair, Fritz opens his eyes
           groggily to the sound of a hauntingly familiar whistle.  
           ("In the Hall of the Mountain King" from Grieg's Peer Gynt)
           (Peter Lorre's famous whistle in "M").
           He places the monocle in his eye and scans the room in a panic,
           unable to get his bearings until glimpsing a colossal trapezoid
           of shadow in the doorway, features barely distinguishable.

                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        Knock knock.

           CHIEF INSPECTOR LOHMANN, a gorilla stuffed into a Herringbone
           Trenchcoat, is standing in the doorway.

                                 FRITZ
                        Chief Inspector Lohmann.

                                 LOHMANN
                        You know me?

                                 FRITZ
                        I've seen your photograph in the
                        paper.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I'm never photographed, do you mind?

           Lohmann points to a platinum box on the desk.

                                 FRITZ
                        Suit yourself.

           Lohmann, eyes dark orbits, takes THREE CIGARS from the box. 
           Fritz offers him a light, Lohmann declines, tucking them in
           his coat pocket instead.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Rang the doorbell.  Had to let myself in.

                                 FRITZ
                        My domestic Frau Nussbaum must be out
                        doing tasks.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I've heard of you, of course.  The
                        serials --

                                 FRITZ
                        "The Spiders".

                                 LOHMANN
                        Wonderful how you kept the suspense
                        going.  You're a master at it.  How
                        at the end one's left guessing.

                                 FRITZ
                        One learns to keep a sharp eye, in
                        my line of work.
           Lohmann casually picks up a PLAYBILL from Fritz's desk and
           retreats to a corner.

                                 LOHMANN
                        "The Spiders", that's it.

                                 FRITZ
                            (nervously)
                        Will there be an inquest?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Lisa Rosenthal was shot and killed
                        by a single bullet through the chest,
                        postmortem imminent, fired from the
                        Browning service revolver owned by
                        Fritz Lang.  That's you.

                                 FRITZ
                        That's how women do it, isn't it?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Through the heart.  Yes, very
                        theatrical --

           Lohmann slides the playbill for Bizet's "CARMEN" across the
           desk.

                                 LOHMANN
                        -- identical to the death of the
                        gypsy girl in "Carmen", in fact. 
                        However, in the play it's her lover
                        who delivers the fatal blow, making
                        it murder.  Well you saw it, you
                        know. 

           Fritz's nervous under his microscope.

                                 FRITZ
                        I accompanied my wife to that little
                        exercise last week. 

                                 LOHMANN
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 FRITZ
                        It hadn't occurred to me before, but  
                        it may have put the thought in her head.

                                 LOHMANN
                        You had a row with your wife?

                                 FRITZ
                        Row?
                                 LOHMANN
                        These things generally begin with a
                        row.

                                 FRITZ
                        There was no row.

                                 LOHMANN
                        What's your relationship with   
                        Mrs. von Harbou?

                                 FRITZ
                        Nothing untoward.  She's my mistress.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 FRITZ
                        You think I killed my wife, is that
                        it?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Lets call it a suspicious suicide.

                                 FRITZ
                        Look, I heard a shot.  I ran down the
                        hallway to the washroom.  Pushed open
                        the door.  She was lying on the floor. 
                        Blood everywhere.  Gun in hand.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Like a lens?

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't follow you.

           Lohmann holds his hands like he's shooting a camera.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Click-click-click, that's how you
                        saw it?

           An abrupt look of anger flashes across Fritz's face.

                                 FRITZ
                        There's a serial killer massacring 
                        children and terrorizing five million
                        people.  Perhaps your efforts might
                        be put to better use.

           Lohmann smiles, but it's filled with rancor.

                                 LOHMANN
                        She died instantaneously?
                                 FRITZ
                        She was dead when I got to her.

                                 LOHMANN
                        And you're quite certain what you
                        saw was intentional?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.  Certain, I couldn't say for
                        sure.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Accidental then?

                                 FRITZ
                        No...I don't know.  When you say saw
                        it, perhaps I should clarify, I heard
                        it.  I was not there.

                                 LOHMANN
                        So she didn't die instantaneously?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.  No.  I don't know, I'm all
                        tangled up. 

                                 LOHMANN
                        Did you administer chest compressions?

                                 FRITZ
                        I was not there.

                                 LOHMANN
                        You said that. 

                                 FRITZ
                        She was distraught.

                                 LOHMANN
                        About the affair?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Still, there's something erroneous
                        about the death.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't understand?

                                 LOHMANN
                        The crime scene seems staged.  You're
                        a film director.  You see what I'm
                        getting at.  The matter requires
                        consideration.
           Lohmann heads for the door.

                                 FRITZ
                        Consideration?

                                 LOHMANN
                            (tapping his pocket)
                        That's what the cigars are for.

           EXT. WEISSENSEE JEWISH CEMETERY -- DAY

           Endless catacombs of the dead.  Dark clouds.  Dark flowers.

           A handful of mournful sober faces shouldered together around
           L's open gravesite.  Amongst them, Joe May.

           EXT. KNOLL, OUTSIDE WEISSENSEE CEMETERY --  LATER

           Downpour.  Wet hair plastered to his skull, Fritz bids 
           farewell to his wife from outside the gates of the cemetery
           as her coffin is lowered into the ground.

           Joe May walks up behind him carrying an umbrella.

                                 FRITZ
                        It was a proper burial.

                                 JOE MAY
                        L was my friend.

                                 FRITZ
                        You think I should have been there. 
                        That it looks suspicious.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Let me take you home, Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                        I've been rolling ideas around.

                                 JOE MAY
                        A conversation for another day.

                                 FRITZ
                        New focus.  New direction.

           Joe May is stirred, finally gets it.

                                 JOE MAY
                        You're firing me.

                                 FRITZ
                        New direction.  New focus.
                                 JOE MAY
                        What about the picture?

                                 FRITZ
                        We press on. 

                                 JOE MAY
                        You have great powers of detachment,
                        Fritz.

           Unable to meet Joe's eyes, Fritz shifts his gaze back to 
           L's gravesite.

                                 FRITZ
                        You learn to economize grief when
                        you've been to the front.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Right.  By the way, congratulations
                        on your engagement.

                                 FRITZ
                        Rumormongers trying to sacrifice me
                        in the small print. 

           Fritz's mouth stiffens.  Chief Inspector Lohmann's outline
           reflects in the aperture of his monocle. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Who have you spoken to about this?

                                 JOE MAY
                        No one. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Has anyone been 'round to your place?

                                 JOE MAY
                        No, of course not.

           Surveilling them from under a tree near the gravesite, Lohmann
           lights a CIGAR and blows out a jet of smoke.

                                 FRITZ
                        They're watching.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Have you been prescribed medication?

                                 FRITZ
                        I feel like a carp in a bathtub.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Well something has induced this
                        galloping paranoia.
                                 FRITZ
                        They can see into every window.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Who...who's watching?

                                 FRITZ
                        Trust me, they will ring your bell. 
                        And when they do, they'll have
                        questions -- ways of finding answers.

                                 JOE MAY
                        What are you afraid of?

                                 FRITZ
                        It would be a shame to forfeit   
                        the treasures you've accumulated. 
                        What, with work particularly scarce
                        these days.  Especially the Mings. 
                        Serial numbers meticulously rubbed
                        out.  Stashed underneath the
                        floorboards.

                                 JOE MAY
                        It was never like this between us in
                        the old days.  Fundamentally.

           Fritz turns up his collar and makes his way home on foot. 
           The rain falls steadily, smothering the city like a hand
           over its mouth.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE, STUDY -- DAY

           Rain tics steadily on the windows.  Having just arrived,
           Thea is soaking wet.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're drenched.

                                 THEA
                        Filthy day.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm glad you came.

                                 THEA
                        Taxi abandoned me at your door.  I
                        walked nearly the entire way back
                        before I rang the bell.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Here, let me take your wet things.

           Noticing her skinned knee and tattered stockings.
                                 FRITZ
                        Are you alright?

                                 THEA
                        I'm always tripping up. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Let me get you something for that.

                                 THEA
                        I can't stay long.  I know the funeral
                        was today.  I came to tell you how
                        terribly sorry I am for your loss.

                                 FRITZ
                        I've missed you.

                                 THEA
                        Please, don't --

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't go to India. 

                                 THEA
                        I need to attend to my knee before 
                        I go.

           Thea stops, realizes that she's heading for the bathroom
           where L died.

                                 FRITZ
                        You don't ever have to go in there.
                            (beat)
                        Here, please --

           -- Fritz indicates the door adjoining his study.

           Thea opens the door to find that it's no longer a storage
           room, but has been renovated into a serene work space.

                                 FRITZ
                        Your own corner of the map.

                                 THEA
                        It's beautiful.

                                 FRITZ
                        I want to marry you, Thea.

                                 THEA
                        Klein-Rogge is expecting me.

                                 FRITZ
                        You told me once that your life was
                        your own.
                                 THEA
                        I really have to go.

           Tears rolling down her face.  He places the key to the door
           in her palm.

                                 FRITZ
                        The window gets pink ribbon light in
                        the mornings.  You can complete it
                        with your things.

                                 THEA
                        I wouldn't know how.

                                 FRITZ
                        I could help you.

                                 THEA
                        I never allow anyone inside my  
                        personal study.

           Fritz kisses her deeply.  They begin to make love.

           The rain tics on the window as we TRAVEL through it and down
           onto the wet street, where neighborhood boys are kicking
           around a ball. 

           The ball goes rogue and rolls in front of Lohmann, looking
           up at the window staking out Fritz's house.

           "In the Hall of the Mountain King" from Grieg's Peer Gynt
           orchestral piece starts and crescendos over --

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

           SPED UP 16mm BLACK & WHITE SILENT FILM FOOTAGE:                                
           (grainy, white leader, odd markings, sprocket holes)

           Fritz and Thea at their engagement dinner party with
           celebrities in attendance.

           Fritz and Thea outside a courthouse holding a marriage
           certificate.

           Fritz and Thea skiing the Alps on honeymoon.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Grieg's tune continues over Fritz asleep in bed.  CLOSE on
           his perspiring face as he fights ghosts.

           His eyes shoot open as he shudders awake.

                                 FRITZ
                        L!
           Turns to find Thea asleep in bed next to him.

           Realizing now that there's a steady BANGING sound coming
           from downstairs.

           INT. FRITZ'S HOUSE (VARIOUS) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Fritz tracks the BANGING sound through the house to the 
           front door. 

           He tightens the cord on his robe and opens the door.  Nobody
           there.  The street outside stifled with fog.

           The knocking coming from a MOURNING WREATH slung over the
           door handle and lashing against the door in the wind.

           Angered, Fritz rips it down.  Yells out the door --

                                 FRITZ
                        I know you're out there, Lohmann.

           INT. UPSTAIRS WASHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Fritz's haunted face stares blankly at the sparkling white
           tile floor where L's bloody body was found.

           Faint footsteps. 

           He spins around, finding Thea behind him in a drowsy stupor.

                                 THEA
                        There can be no understanding between
                        the hand and the brain unless the
                        heart acts as mediator.

                                 FRITZ
                        God knows, I --

                                 THEA
                            (cutting him off)
                        It's the opening dedication for
                        Metropolis.

           She stumbles back down the hallway to the bedroom.

                                 FRITZ
                            (sotto)
                        Metropolis?  

           SOUND of random typewriter keys STRIKING --
           INT. FRITZ'S STUDY -- DAY

           -- turns into a steady CLATTERING of typing.  Fritz paces
           around his desk listening to the activity, but it's not coming
           from inside his room.

           The door to the adjacent room open --

           INT. THEA'S STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           -- Thea is perched at the edge of the desk, feverishly typing
           their new manuscript.

           She hits the carriage return and snaps her head angrily
           towards Fritz, who is now standing in the doorway about to
           pierce her private sanctuary.

                                 THEA
                        A room of one's own.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm to live within your margins, is
                        that it?

                                 THEA
                        My own corner of the map.  Did we
                        not make an agreement?

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't want an argument.

                                 THEA
                        Then why are you standing in the
                        doorway?

                                 FRITZ
                        I had hoped to borrow a cup of your
                        usual composure as you tell me where
                        we are in this story.

           Thea takes a deep breath, turns over her typewritten pages --

                                 THEA
                        Our heroine, the beautiful and
                        evangelical Maria, has taken up the
                        cause of the everyman.  Meanwhile,
                        the evil Rotwang builds a robotic
                        gynoid that looks identical to her.

                                 FRITZ
                        Fusing human and machine energy.

                                 THEA
                        Precisely.
                                 FRITZ
                        Why does he build it?

                                 THEA
                        Power.

           Fritz straining to see the photograph in Manhattan Harbor
           with Joe May.  The towering skyline behind them MORPHING
           into the futuristic dystopian vision for "Metropolis".

                                 FRITZ
                        Oh, this is good.

                                 THEA
                        Society is divided into two groups:
                        Thinkers, who plan but don't know
                        how anything works.  Workers, who
                        achieve their goals but have no
                        vision.

                                 FRITZ
                        Neither group is complete, but
                        together they make a whole.

                                 THEA
                        Exactly, close my door.

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

           Thea irately swings her chair around, facing him.

                                 THEA
                        Friedel please, I'm working.

           An ELECTRICAL BUZZING sound.  Gyrating VOLTAIC LIGHT
           encompasses her body, slowing MORPHING her into the iconic
           robotic metallic figure of Maria, the protagonist in 
           "Metropolis".

           Fritz stares from the doorway, immobile.

                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MARMORHAUS THEATER -- EVENING

           Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou's silent masterpiece
           "Metropolis" projects on the massive screen. 

           The auditorium crowded with tuxedos and gowns gathered for
           the gala premiere.

           Fritz clutches Thea's hand.  A MAN in front of them is screwed
           all the way around in his seat and peering at them.
                                 FRITZ
                        Why is he staring at us?

                                 THEA
                        Who?

                                 FRITZ
                        The man in the third row. 

                                 THEA
                        Where?

           Fritz scans the row again, but all eyes are now on screen.

           Angle on the man in the third row.  He makes a notation in a 
           pocket notebook -- a NAZI SWASTIKA on its cover.

           INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER -- LATER

           Fritz at a row sinks, staring at his reflection in the mirror --
           not pleased with the reflection staring back. 

           WHISTLING in the tune of "In the Hall of the Mountain King"
           from Grieg's Peer Gynt emanates from a stall.

           Fritz is rounding the corner to the stalls in the direction
           of the warbling when he stops dead at the sight of --

           -- L's NURSING UNIFORM splayed out on the shiny marble floor. 
           A crimson flower of dried blood over the heart.

           Fritz is stunned.  Stands there frozen.

           A TOILET FLUSHES.

           Lohmann exits zipping his fly, stands in the half-light. 
           Fritz is caught off guard, unprepared for this reality.

                                 LOHMANN
                        There you are.  Sorry I'm late.

                                 FRITZ
                        You weren't invited.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Tough crowd out there.

                                 FRITZ
                        They seem to be enjoying it.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Then why the boiling behind the eyes?

                                 FRITZ
                        You don't know me, Lohmann.
                                 LOHMANN
                        I am you.

                                 FRITZ
                        What did you say?

           Lohmann scrapes a match against the wall, lighting a cigar.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Gal in your picture -- I had a woman
                        like that once.  Cold.  Robotic. 
                        Can't leave.  Can't stay.  Like
                        stepping on a landmine.

           Fritz looks back at L's bloody nursing uniform.

                                 FRITZ
                        Not tonight, all those people out
                        there.  I beg you...

                                 LOHMANN
                        All your hard work and wifes blood.

           Lohmann jerking his thumb at the bloody nursing uniform --

                                 LOHMANN
                        You know we're going to have to talk
                        about why this happened.

                                 FRITZ
                        I haven't heard from you in months.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Just because you don't see me, doesn't
                        mean I'm not there.

                                 FRITZ
                        You enjoy this charade.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Fritz Lang is the only person who
                        knows what's going on here.  He won't
                        tell you, but he knows.

                                 FRITZ
                        I had nothing to do with L's death. 
                        And we both know that if you had
                        evidence to the contrary, I'd be
                        retaining a barrister. 

           Lohmann snorts, places his hand on his face like an eyepatch.

                                 LOHMANN
                        We're pirates, you and I.
                                 FRITZ
                        I can look in the mirror with a clean
                        conscience and honestly say that my
                        mind and body are one hundred percent
                        intact.

                                 LOHMANN
                        So it appears.

                                 FRITZ
                        Excuse me, but I have a job to do.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I have a job too.  I feel the most
                        alive when I'm doing it.

           Fritz storms out.  Goes back inside the auditorium, stands  
           at the doors.

           ON SCREEN: "METROPOLIS" MONTAGE of rising temperatures,
           spinning turbines, pressures coming to a head, bubbling
           liquids on the boil -- forces welling up from the deep.

           The projected images reflecting in the glass of Fritz's
           monocle, fueling the forces roiling inside him.

           INT. ARTIST'S STUDIO -- DAY

           Jars of oil colors.  Assorted brushes.  Stacked canvas. 
           PUSH IN on the back of an artist in front of an easel,
           slashing the canvas in vivid color.

           THE CANVAS TRANSFORMING into a montage of the expressionist
           poster art for Fritz and Thea's film collaborations:

                                  DR. MABUSE 

                                DIE NIBELUNGEN

                                   SPIONE

                                FRAU IM MOND  

           PULL BACK to reveal Fritz behind the artist pondering the
           now blank canvas, clearly distressed by the lack of ideas
           for his next creation.

           EXT. TERRACE, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- MORNING

           Fritz and Thea are having breakfast in the garden terrace. 
           Frau Nussbaum comes down the path carrying a pot of coffee
           and the morning newspapers.
                                 FRITZ
                        Cantaloupe was lovely, Frau Nussbaum.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Herr Ott says give it a good slap. 
                        When it talks back it's ready.

                                 FRITZ
                        Herr Ott?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Market stand in Alexanderplatz.

                                 THEA
                        That district is teeming with common
                        criminals who have a complete
                        disregard for the law.  Old women 
                        being attacked for their pensions. 
                        Just last week a man was beaten in
                        front of his children and shaken by
                        the bootstraps for the small change
                        in his trousers.  Surely we can afford
                        that nice shop in Covington Garden.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Cantaloupe not talking back there,
                        Mrs. Fritz.

           Fritz pours coffee, smirking.

                                 FRITZ
                        Tell Herr Ott that we could do with
                        a nice mango next time.

           Thea crossly reaches for her reading glasses and riffles
           through the newspapers.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Herr Ott and the others have been
                        doing more then talking, tell you
                        that.  They've been organizing.

                                 FRITZ
                        Organizing?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        A round-up to do what the police
                        don't.

                                 FRITZ
                        Vigilantes?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        To trap the Monster.  Got their own
                        ideas going about it too.
                                 FRITZ
                        Overturning law by brute force
                        constitutes a criminal act. 

                                 THEA
                        It's arcane.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Jah, maybe so, but there won't be a
                        scared woman or child left in the
                        city once they've done the deed,
                        they says.

                        Frau Nussbaum.

           Frau Nussbaum makes an audible sigh as she starts back up
           the path.

                                 FRITZ
                        She's been with me for fifteen years.

                                 THEA
                        She thinks she's married to you.

                                 FRITZ
                        She's devoted and doesn't steal.

                                 THEA
                        She's a drunk.

           The stylus screeches before catching its groove.  The music
           gushes from the windows.  Fritz's eyes widen in recognition. 

                                 FRITZ
                        What is this?  I know this.

           Thea peers out from behind the Berliner Tageblatt.

                                 THEA
                        "In the Hall of the Mountain King"
                        It's from Grieg's Peer Gynt.

           Fritz's eyes fastened on the newspaper headline in her grip:

                  "Monster of Dusseldorf Eludes Police Again"

           His mind ticking away as if hit by a lightening bolt idea as
           the haunting music crescendos.
           INT. STUDY, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- DAY

           THE MAKING OF "M" 

           Fritz excitedly cutting clippings from the lurid daily
           headlines detailing the Monster of Dusseldorf crimes.

           Thea enters, finds her husband holding a large pair of sheers.  

                                 FRITZ
                        What is the most unspeakably heinous
                        act you can think of?

                                 THEA
                        Scrapbooking tops the list.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't annoy me, Thea.  Just listen --
                            (reads from clippings)
                        Christine Klein, thirteen years old,
                        found in her bed with throat cut. 
                        Rose Ohliger, eight years old, 
                        stabbed thirteen times and dumped
                        near a construction site.  Ida Reuter,
                        nineteen, skull crushed with a hammer. 
                        Elizabeth Dirries, also nineteen,
                        also bludgeoned. 
                            (pointing)
                        The Doering sisters massacred right
                        down there near the park footpath.
                            (beat)
                        It's all here, interviews with
                        eyewitnesses, new theories by police,
                        there's even a boasting letter sent
                        to the press and signed by the Monster
                        himself.  What do you think? 

                                 THEA
                        I think a very bad man is stalking
                        the streets of Berlin.

                                 FRITZ
                        Right and what better story then the
                        one etched indelibly in the mind of
                        every German.

                        No playboy adventurers, industrial
                        bigwigs, scientists, inventors, or

                        Nonsense, there's always a hero.

                                 FRITZ
                        The hero always wins yet they are
                        never as compelling to watch as those
                        they pursue.

                                 THEA
                        Fritz, you can't make a film about a
                        serial murderer.

           Fritz lowers the scissors, looks at her.

                                 FRITZ
                        An ordinary man.  An unforgivable
                        crime.  We're all capable of that.

           HIGH ANGLE of Fritz with three Nero-Film Investors:        
           FAT MAN, FEZ HAT, and PINCE-NEZ, sitting at a circular table.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Is there a manuscript?

                                 FRITZ
                        Thea and I are working on it now.

                                 FEZ HAT
                        What's it about?

                                 FRITZ
                        I prefer not to divulge any specifics
                        until the scenario is complete. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        Don't want to jinx it, aye?

                                 FRITZ
                        I can tell you that the subject matter
                        is especially current.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Current?

                                 FRITZ
                        Especially.

                                 PINCE NEZ
                        Good?

                                 FRITZ
                        Frightfully.
                                 FEZ HAT
                        Popular?

                                 FRITZ
                        The motion picture will be vastly
                        influenced by sound.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Sound?

                                 PINCE NEZ
                        I hear F.W. is experimenting with sound.

                                 FRITZ
                        Murnau.

                                 FEZ HAT
                        I saw a talking picture called
                        "Blackmail" in London.  Very challenging.

           -- Thea feverishly typing as Fritz paces outside her doorway. 
           Their usual routine. 

           The last key crashing like a punctuation mark, Thea turns
           and looks at the WHITE ORCHIDS on her desk.

                                 FRITZ
                        I thought you would like them?

                                 THEA
                        We step on each other's feet.

                                 FRITZ
                        And...?

                                 THEA
                            (nodding to typewriter)
                        It's confused.

                                 FRITZ
                        We'll work the story out.

                                 THEA
                        It requires inquiry.

                                 FRITZ
                        Inquiry, is...

                                 THEA
                        Underlying truth.
                                 FRITZ
                        I was going to say dangerous.

                                 THEA
                        The ability to look from the inside. 
                        Methods.  Procedures.  Pathology.  A
                        synthesis of facts.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you understand what you're asking
                        me to do?

                                 THEA
                        We need to see everything before us.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm only a plodding director.  This
                        is completely out of my depth. 
                        Besides, has it occurred to you how
                        long that will take?

                                 THEA
                        Writers are patient.  We watch.  We
                        wait.  We think.  It's our one 
                        virtue.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're asking me to --

                                 THEA
                        Shine a flashlight into dark places.

           Thea leans over, smells the Orchids.

           INT. FRONT DESK, ALEX -- LATER

           Berlin's Police Headquarters at Alexanderplatz.  Locals call
           it the "Alex".

           Wearing a heavy frock coat and holding a dripping umbrella,
           Fritz is pleading with a DESK OFFICER --

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Chief Inspector Lohmann?

                                 FRITZ
                        That's right.  It's about the murders.

           The Desk Officer makes a face like he just drank piss.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Murders?

                                 FRITZ
                        In the papers.
                                 DESK OFFICER
                        You want to confess?

                                 FRITZ
                        Confess?

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Over two hundred people have confessed
                        to the murders.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why?

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        The glory I suspect.  And if it's
                        not a confession, it's neighbor
                        suspecting neighbor.

                                 FRITZ
                        Listen, I'm doing research and if I
                        could see the files...

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Sure, down the street, try knocking
                        on the doors of Boim's School for
                        the deaf.

                                 FRITZ
                        Look, Lohmann could vouch for me. 

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        I'm sure he could, but Lohmann isn't
                        here is he. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I think you know who I am.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Only by reputation.
                            (beat)
                        Mind if I ask you a personal question?

                                 FRITZ
                        All right.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        How did you do it?

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        C'mon, you were drunk.  One thing
                        led to another --
                                 FRITZ
                        You have me mixed up with someone.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Goat shit, you're notorious.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cruel rumors. 

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Tell me, what did it feel like?

                                 FRITZ
                        I'd like to speak to someone in
                        authority.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        You don't want to say, sure I
                        understand.  But if it was me...
                            (lowering voice)
                        ...if I had nailed Marlene Dietrich,
                        I wouldn't leave out a single detail.

           Realizing the influence he holds, Fritz leans in two inches
           from the Desk Officer's ear --

                                 FRITZ
                        It's the way she used her mouth.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Mouth, huh?

                                 FRITZ
                            (sexually charged)
                        Had all her molars removed.

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        I can see that.

                                 FRITZ
                        And she sucked lemon wedges in between
                        takes to keep the muscles tight.

           The Desk Officer breathes heavily, aroused.

           Fritz bangs up the stairs leading to the second floor, giving
           way to full access of the departments inner-sanctum.

           Tired policemen coming off their beats slump on benches.

           A large MAP OF BERLIN on the wall is marked with murder sites
           and compass circles signaling combed areas.
           A blown-up FINGERPRINT projected onto a large screen is being
           studied by GRAPHOLOGIST.

           An OFFICER with a MASTER KEY on a chain around his neck 
           approaches Fritz.

                                 OFFICER
                        You here to see Lohmann's brain?

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 OFFICER
                        File room, end of the hall.  You got
                        ten minutes.

           Key in grip, Fritz makes his way down the corridor until
           arriving at the iron grillwork door at the end.  Unlocks it
           and goes inside.  Jerks a string that lights a naked bulb.

           The room, a dizzying box crowded with floor to ceiling files
           chronologically marked and dedicated to murderers.

                                 FRITZ
                            (sotto)
                        Lohmann's brain.

           Outside a freight train lumbers past the small window with a
           loud clatter, sending the files quaking.

           Fritz locates a dossier flagged with a BLUE TAB.  Hoists it
           down from the tall shelf.

           CLOSE ON the classified file, case name:  Fritz Lang

           Fritz flips amongst the pages of his own file:

           Fingerprints taken from the bathroom and gun.

           Photographs of the crime scene.  Lurid.

           Fritz's heart sinks at the thought of all the information
           gathered on his wife's death.  He flips to a page with a
           ruling marked: "Suicide".

           The thunderous ROAR from another freight train.  The files
           in Lohmann's brain juddering violently. 

           INT. STUDY, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Fritz races into the room breathing heavily.  Thea right
           behind him.

                                 FRITZ
                        Put the light out.
                                 THEA
                        Why?

                                 FRITZ
                        Just do it.

           Thea kills the overheads. 

           Frau Nussbaum shuffles in with a lit candle.

                                 THEA
                        What did you do?

                                 FRITZ
                        I stole it.

           Fritz unbuttons his coat and removes a DOSSIER three inches
           thick hidden in his waistband. 

           CLOSE ON the classified file, case name: MONSTER OF DUSSELDORF

                                 FRITZ
                        They'll shoot me.  I'll get shot.

                                 THEA
                        What's in there?

                                 FRITZ
                        Detective notes, fingerprints,
                        photographs -- things of that nature. 
                        Methods I've never seen before. 
                        They call it the new science.  There
                        must have been sixty volumes dedicated
                        to the Monster alone.  Files thick
                        as thieves.

           Thea gingerly opens the file --

                                 FRITZ
                        Careful, I have to return that.

                                 THEA
                        Where are the poison pen letters?

                                 FRITZ
                        They keep all bodily evidence in
                        another room, under heavy lock and
                        key.

           She turns a section in the file marked CLASSIFIED.

                                 THEA
                        What is this?
                                 FRITZ
                        A twenty-five page special bulletin
                        on the case.  Things not made public. 
                        The hunt for the killer goes as far
                        as asking organized crime for their
                        help.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Herr Ott?

                                 FRITZ
                        On the payroll.

                                 THEA
                        Frau Nussbaum can get us to Ott.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't want any part of that.

                                 THEA
                        Look at the file, no physical
                        description, no clues.  The police
                        don't know anymore then we do about
                        the killer.

                                 FRITZ
                        They know he wears a hat.

                                 THEA
                        That's every person in Berlin.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        The monster is among us.

           The candle light casting long shadows on the wall.

           EXT. GHETTO, ALEXANDERPLATZ -- NIGHT

           Working class marketplace inhabited by thieves, grifters,
           smugglers and your average garden variety hoodlums.  Streamers
           of fog twist along the menacing streets, smearing the
           streetlights.

           Fritz's parks his Maybach at the curb and leans against a 
           circular pillar with countless wanted posters. 

           HERR OTT, fur-collared overcoat and bowler, padlocks his
           produce stand for the night.  He walks along the road carrying
           a wooden pole with affixed cages -- trashing feathers and
           cooing inside.

           Fritz tails him into a twisting alley lined with tenements.

           Herr Ott ducks into a alcoved cellar.  Vanishes.
           Fritz trains on the alcoved entry and spiral staircase
           descending into darkness.  Considers it.

           The sound of typing emerges. 

           (It should be noted, Thea's intermittent typing emerges
           through making of "M" sequence.) 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. THEA'S STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Thea hits return and glances at the typed page. 

                                 THEA
                        Where did it lead?

                                 FRITZ
                        An underworld lair known as      
                        "The Crocodile Club".

                                 THEA
                        What happened down there?

           On edge, Fritz rummages through his notes.

                                 FRITZ
                        I want to organize my thoughts first.

                                 THEA
                        I understand.

           Thea hits the carriage release and places a fresh sheet of
           onionskin in the typewriter.  Looks back at Fritz --

                                 THEA
                        Done procrastinating?

           Fritz stares blankly at her. 

           Prelap sound of footsteps.

                                                                CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. "THE CROCODILE CLUB" -- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz descends the spiraling staircase and is swallowed up
           by darkness.

           INT. "THE CROCODILE CLUB" -- CONTINUOUS

           A beaded curtain clattering behind him, as Fritz enters the
           underworld hideout. 
           The room is a raw dark space.  A taxidermied CROCODILE hangs
           above, its reptilian underside running the length of the
           room.  But where is everybody?

           Fritz walks down a long rickety underground passageway, 
           eyeing a sump pump along the way.

           A faint hum, growing louder. 

           Pips of sweat on Fritz's brow.

           Coming to the end of the passageway, there's a puzzled look
           on Fritz's face.

           Trains his eyes on a METAL DOOR WITH PRESSURIZED SPINLOCK.

           INT. SEWER SYSTEM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Fritz descends a steel ladder and sinks into a cavernous
           artery of gushing water spilling from conduits.

                                 FRITZ
                        Ugh!

           Holds a handkerchief to his nose, can't take the putrid
           stench.

           Herr Ott appears out of the murk.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Berlin's bowels.  Runs right into
                        the Blue Danube.

                                 FRITZ
                        Herr Ott.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Why are you shadowing me?

                                 FRITZ
                        I just want to talk.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Passport, birth certificate, or
                        marriage reversion?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry?

                                 HERR OTT
                        Peculiar time to be a jew.

           Fritz gets a closer look at the pole Herr Ott carries, the
           affixed cages occupied by pigeons.
                                 HERR OTT
                        Follow me.

           Treading ankle-deep water, Fritz stays close behind Herr Ott
           navigating the catacomb of twists and turns until they reach --

           INT. UNDERGROUND MOB LAIR -- CONTINUOUS

           A secret area teeming with surging hats, sticks, and fists
           forming a circle.  Torches hanging from the walls. 

           CAMERA TRACKS down a long table lined with brass knuckles,
           hammers, bats, pipes, burglary tools, pickax, guns, knives.

           Fritz tries getting a better view over the heads and through
           the gaps between the shoulders.  Glimpses a BLOODY MAN
           restrained to a chair.  Writing in pain.  Eyes rolling.

           UDO, a colossal Ukrainian finger-breaker with a tattoo of a
           second mouth on his chin, is administering the blows.

           Udo turns to Fritz.  Towering above him, the second mouth on
           his chin quaking in rage --

                                 UDO
                        We got a copper here!

           The angry mob swirls around Fritz.  Fritz tries to answer,
           but the crowd is too loud --

           Herr Ott hops up on some piling, addresses the crowd.

                                 HERR OTT
                        WAIT!  WAIT!  WAIT!  He's not a cop. 

                                 MOB MAN
                        How can you tell?

                                 HERR OTT
                        Look how he's dressed -- like he's
                        going to shul or a job at the bank.

           Whistling, harrumphs, and laughter from around the room.

           But Fritz can't take his eyes off the captive man --

                                 FRITZ
                        That's him isn't it -- you've caught
                        the Monster of Dusseldorf?

                                 HERR OTT
                        No, him...he's a cop.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cop?
                                 HERR OTT
                        That canary said he would die for
                        the cause.  The tragedy is that he
                        was right.

           Udo slams a fist into the cop's kidney.  He squeals in pain.

           Herr Ott uncaps a pint bottle, offers it to Fritz.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Drink.

                                 FRITZ
                        No.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Definitely not a cop.

           More laughter from around the room. 

           Fritz seizes the bottle and takes a stiff pull.

                                 HERR OTT
                        That was a bad idea.

           Fritz spits it out, trying not to dry-heave.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Your piss is going to burn like hell. 

           Fritz suddenly queasy, could faint.

                                 UDO
                        You must be crazy coming here. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I wanted to see for myself.

           Herr Ott releases the pigeons, they fly to a row of stalls. 
           Numbered bands on their legs corresponding with markers on a
           large map of Berlin mounted on the wall.

                                 HERR OTT
                        We have our own stool pigeons.  They
                        work quite efficiently.

                                 FRITZ
                        Look, I'm a film director.  I'm
                        researching my next picture. 

                                 HERR OTT
                        Researching down here?

                                 FRITZ
                        It's about you -- all of you. 
                                 MOB WOMAN
                        A picture about us.

                                 FRITZ
                        Your efforts to catch the Monster of
                        Dusseldorf.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Why should we trust YOU?

                                 FRITZ
                        I know you're working with the police. 
                        I've seen the records.

                                 HERR OTT
                        There's an abyss between us and them. 
                        This district is tethered by one
                        leash.  They don't cooperate, but
                        they don't interfere.

                                 FRITZ
                            (nodding to cop)
                        Then what happened to him?  

                                 HERR OTT
                        Sometimes they send a canary.  And
                        it's not just the police.

                                 FRITZ
                        The political police?

                                 HERR OTT
                        Enough.  We're done talking.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why are you doing it?

                                 UDO
                        To look after the little ones better.

                                 FRITZ
                        Bullshit, what's in it for you?

                                 HERR OTT
                        They go house to house, hedge to
                        hedge looking for the monster. 
                        Disrupting our legitimate criminal
                        activities.

                                 FRITZ
                        So you're going to catch him.

                                 HERR OTT
                        We're going to kill him.
           Udo grabs Fritz, digs his wallet out of his coat and hands
           it to Herr Ott.

                                 FRITZ
                        Wait, I need that.

                                 UDO
                        Not here you don't.

                                 FRITZ
                        Maybe we can help each other.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Whatever you spit -- we get a cut.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut?

                                 HERR OTT
                        Of your motion picture.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, I don't think that's a good --

           Herr Ott fishes through the wallet, finding Fritz's
           identification card.

                                 HERR OTT
                        We get a cut or you get cut.  Get it
                        Fritz Lang from One One Charlottenburg
                        Lane?

                                 FRITZ
                        I recognize a good turn when I hear
                        one.

                                 HERR OTT
                        You remember the way outta here?

                                 FRITZ
                        Big crocodile. 

                                 HERR OTT
                        There are no crocodiles in Berlin.

                                 FRITZ
                        I saw it.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Good, because now that you saw it,
                        you need to forget it.

           Udo shoots his fist straight into Fritz's face. 

           THWACK. 
           Everything goes PITCH BLACK.

           EXT. GHETTO, ALEXANDERPLATZ -- DAWN

           Fritz out cold by a dumpster.  Disheveled.  Unshaven.  He
           opens his eyes groggily.  Disoriented.  Eyes blurry.

           Checks his coat and finds his empty wallet, keys, and monocle
           still inside.  As he puts the monocle in place -- Lohmann
           comes into view, looming above him.

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann, what are you doing here?

                                 LOHMANN
                        You were in my brain.

                                 FRITZ
                        Jesus, it's morning already?

                                 LOHMANN
                        What are you doing in my brain, Lang? 

                                 FRITZ
                        Looking at the reports.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Why?

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm writ--

                                 LOHMANN
                        What are you writing -- your
                        confession?

                                 FRITZ
                        It's about the monster.

                                 LOHMANN
                        What happened to your face?

                                 FRITZ
                        Uh,...nothing.

           Fritz daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief.

                                 LOHMANN
                        They talked to you?

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure.

                                 LOHMANN
                        What did you promise them?
                                 FRITZ
                        The Alex is two blocks south, in
                        case you've lost your way.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I found you didn't I.

                                 FRITZ
                        Look, it's a good story.  An ordinary
                        man.  An unspeakable crime.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Well we're all capable of that.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't speak for me, Lohmann.

                                 LOHMANN
                            (sneering)
                        "I think it's the best work I've
                        ever done."

                                 FRITZ
                        Stop it.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Those are confidential police records,
                        you shit.  I should drag you down to
                        the Alex right now.

                                 FRITZ
                        I saw my file, Lohmann.  It had a
                        BIG BLUE STAMP on the jacket.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Yeah, you like that -- I got a   
                        BIG RED STAMP just like it.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's over, all right.  I don't know
                        why you keep digging it up.

                                 LOHMANN
                        It's digging itself up.

           They hear approaching sirens.

                                 LOHMANN
                        C'mon, you better come with me.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why would I do that?

                                 LOHMANN
                        The monster struck again last night. 
                                 FRITZ
                        Last night?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Grafenberger Woods.

                                 FRITZ
                        That's not far from here.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Why pay for the matinee if you can
                        see it free, huh Lang?

           As Lohmann heads out --

                                 FRITZ
                        Wait, I have a car.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Should have taken the train.

           Lohmann cocks his head in the direction of Fritz's Maybach -- 
           completely stripped and burning in the street.

                                 FRITZ
                        Oh, Jesus.

           Lohmann keeps walking.

           Fritz hesitates, unsure, then runs to catch up to him.

           EXT. COURTYARD, TENEMENT BLOCK -- MOMENTS LATER

           A group of SCHOOLCHILDREN standing in a circle, are playing
           a game and chanting in high-pitched voices --

                                 CHILDREN SINGING
                            (in German)
                        "Just you wait, it won't be long. 
                        The man in black will soon be here
                        with his cleaver's blade so true. 
                        He'll make mincemeat out of you".

           Fritz and Lohmann walk past a row of tenements.  Signs posted
           along the street:  "Wer ist der Morder?  10,000 Marks Reward"

                                 FRITZ
                            (to Lohmann)
                        Do you hear that awful song they're
                        singing.

                                 LOHMANN
                        As long as they're singing, we know
                        they're still there.
           A PREGNANT HAUSFRAU hanging washing out to dry from a high
           story balcony, yells down --

                                 PREGNANT HAUSFRAU
                        Elsie!  Elsie!

           LITTLE ELSIE BECKMANN looks up to the window --

                                 ELSIE
                        Ma'am?

                                 PREGNANT HAUSFRAU
                        You children should be at home.

                                 ELSIE
                        Yes, ma'am.

           As Elsie turns, she spots Fritz nearing --

                                 ELSIE
                        It's the monster!  It's the monster!

           The children all SCREAM and take flight.

                                 FRITZ
                            (to Lohmann)
                        Why are they behaving like that?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Children are sensitives.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sensitives?

                                 LOHMANN
                        To the diabolic.  We've done tests.

                                 FRITZ
                        When are you planning on bringing  
                        this out to the public.

                                 LOHMANN
                        All in good time, Lang.

           SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  From the Underwood. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. THEA STUDY -- DAY

           The typewriter keys striking against the pulp paper.

                                 THEA
                        Fantastic.  Keep going. 
           Fritz yells back from the adjoining office.

                                 FRITZ (O.S.)
                        Lets move on to the crime scene.

                                 THEA
                        Where?

                                 FRITZ (O.S.)
                        Behind a church in Grafenberger Woods. 

                                 THEA
                        God, what was it like?  Describe it.

                                 FRITZ (O.S.)
                        Horrible.  The crime scene was like
                        a haunted fairy tale.  "Haunted fairy
                        tale" -- that's good, put that in.

                                 THEA
                        It's a tad dramatic.

           Editing pages with his trademark BLUE PENCIL, Fritz pauses.

                                 FRITZ
                        You think?

                                 THEA
                        No, it's good.  I'm putting it in.

           She types it.  Fritz appears in the doorway.

                                 FRITZ
                        Scratch that.  The violence should
                        be implied never seen.

           Thea rolls the paper up a few lines -- looks. 

           She aptly rips the paper out of the carriage.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. GRAFENBERGER WOODS -- LATER

           Tree branches throw distorted shadows.  A gothic style church
           can be seen in the distance.

           A knot of police surround the pallid corpse of a young woman
           slain in the woods behind the church.  The victims LEFT HAND
           missing, severed above the wrist.

           Lohmann and Fritz observe the scene from a few yards away.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Stay here.  Don't touch anything. 
           Lohmann marches past the police officers with authority. 
           Begins conducting his own investigation. 

           Veiled behind trees, Fritz is strains to see, but TWO OFFICERS

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        Butchered.

                                 OFFICER TWO
                        Who found her?

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        Priest from the church.

                                 OFFICER TWO
                        Someone talk to him?

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        He's a servant of God, half-wit.

                                 OFFICER TWO
                        I'd like to go back to bed.

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        What number is this?

                                 OFFICER TWO
                        Twenty two.

                                 FRITZ (O.S.)
                        Twenty three.

           Fritz scowls at his idiocy, slowly withdrawals.

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        Twenty three?

                                 OFFICER TWO
                        I didn't say anything.

           Fritz wanders through the thick tangle of undergrowth.  Leans
           against a tree and relieves himself.  Herr Ott was right, it
           burns like hell. 

           Hears something FLAPPING in the breeze in the wooded footpath.

           Eyes tired and bloodshot, he squats down for a closer look. 
           A swath of paper weighted by the victims SEVERED HAND, the 
           WEDDING BAND on her finger glitters in the sun. 

           He looks sharply around, alone.

           FRITZ'S POV:  It's a POISON PEN LETTER from the Monster of
           Dusseldorf scribbled in BLUE PENCIL.  
           Fritz rises.  Lohmann looming behind him.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Trust me, you don't want to get inside
                        of that head.

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann!  I didn't touch it.   

                                 LOHMANN
                        It was just sitting here in the open
                        like a grave marker.

                                 FRITZ
                        I swear, I didn't touch it.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Did you read it?

           Fritz anxiously fussing with his monocle.

                                 FRITZ
                        What kind of animal does that?

                                 LOHMANN
                        He stalks little girls like hunters
                        stalk elk over mountains.

                                 FRITZ
                        Any suspects?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Suspect everyone.

           Lohmann palms the poison pen letter.

                                 FRITZ
                        Who knows where it can lead.

                                 LOHMANN
                        System in place at the Alex, it might
                        as well disappear into a chasm. 

                                 FRITZ
                        What do you mean?  They can run
                        fingerprints and...

                                 LOHMANN
                        It should be analyzed properly.

                                 FRITZ
                        Right.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I'll do the dirty work for you.
                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Take it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Me?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Take it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann?

                                 LOHMANN
                        You want to know the nature of evil,
                        here.

           Lohmann thrusts the poison pen letter into his palm. 

                                 FRITZ
                        How about you, don't you want to
                        know the nature of evil?

                                 LOHMANN
                        No, because then I'd be out of a
                        job.

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann...

                                 LOHMANN
                        Get out of here, Lang.

           Fritz's mouth hangs open. 

           Lohmann clomps away, vanishing into the dense woods.

           Tall iron security fences surround a sinister circular
           facility with prison windows.

           INT. GRAND DUCAL LUNATIC ASYLUM -- DAY

           A shabby pisshole with hard edges, harsher shadows.

           Inmates spew jeers and hurl spit from their cells as a NURSE
           on shift escorts Fritz down the main corridor.

           INT. DOKTOR WERBEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           The nurse gently raps on the door, enters with Lang.       
           Running water can be heard from the adjoining washroom.

                                 NURSE
                        Doktor Werbel?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL (O.S.)
                        Yes?

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Lang to see you, sir.

                                 FRITZ
                        I appreciate you seeing me on such
                        short notice, Doktor Werbel. 

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL (O.S.)
                        Yes, I'll be right with you Mr. Lang.

           The nurse shows Fritz a chair, leaves.

           Fritz waits for the doctor, looking around the room --
           bookshelves crowded with psychiatric tomes, lobotomy
           instruments, and anatomical brains in formaldehyde.

           Something catches Fritz's eye -- a steel door with a diamond
           shaped observation window bored into the wall.

           He peers inside the window -- a padded cell for patients in
           between sessions.

           Suddenly a HAND fills the glass.  Fritz draws back. 

           Frantic POUNDING on the door.  The hinges RATTLING.        

           A PATIENT locked inside, caged like a wild animal. 

           Muffled words emanate from the thick door.  Fritz moves closer
           trying to make them out --
                                 CAGED PATIENT

           Suddenly a metal plate slides across, closing off the window. 
           Fritz cocks his head to see -- DOKTOR WERBEL, unfazed,
           buttoning a crisp white lab coat.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Sorry about the interruption. 
                        Sedative seems to be wearing off.

                        Leucotomy.  Greek for cut/slice. 
                        Severing the connections to and from
                        the prefrontal cortex.  The Americans
                        refer to it as Lobotomy.

           Bloody surgical instruments are lying on a metal tray.

                        Does it change them?

           Doktor Werbel studies Fritz curiously, surprised by the
           sincerity of the question.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        It's a commonly used treatment in a
                        wide range of mental illnesses,
                        including schizophrenia, clinical
                        depression, anxiety disorders.

                                 FRITZ
                        What's he being treated for?
                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Poisoned his wife and four children
                        then ground up their remains.  Hungry
                        customers believed they were eating
                        pork, when they frequented his hot-
                        dog stand near the train station.

                        They deserved it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Excuse me?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        They are Satan and his dominion.  At
                        least in his mind.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        In my experience, it's the critical
                        moment between the intention and the
                        act itself.  The difference between
                        an impulse and a grave if not fatal
                        error.  Why did you say you were here?

           Fritz stiffens, startled by the question.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes, why do you ask?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        The aftermath of this war has been a
                        particularly fertile breeding ground
                        for serial homicide strains.

                                 FRITZ
                        Strains?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Haarmann, Denk, and Grobmann most
                        notably in the last decade.  Have
                        you killed someone?
                                 FRITZ
                        What, no.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        It's nothing to be ashamed of, anyone
                        with a gun can kill someone in the
                        service of one's country.

                                 FRITZ
                        They're clearly deranged.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Actually, killers are usually not
                        psychotic and may appear to be quite
                        normal and often charming. 
                            (beat)
                        Every human mind harbors a latent
                        compulsion to murder.  Guilt and
                        innocence walk a fine line.  We are
                        all potential killers needing only
                        the flick of a mental trigger to
                        send us before a jury of our peers.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you mind if I show you something,
                        Doktor.

           Fritz removes the POISON PEN letter from his pocket.

                                 FRITZ
                        I understand that you specialize in
                        handwriting analysis.  This is a
                        letter from the Monster of Dusseldorf
                        himself.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        How did you obtain it?

                                 FRITZ
                        Trust me, it comes from high up.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL

           Thea enters for her study, rubbing her tired fingers.

                        What are you having?

                        Turkey on rye.

                        Hardly believe what I found this
                        morning in the garden patch.

                                 THEA

                        My own knitting needles, sticking
                        out of the geraniums like Excalibar's
                        sword.

           Mumbling as she shuffles out of the room --

                        Strange goings on in the house of

                        No, of course not.

           Refining the typed manuscript with his BLUE PENCIL, Fritz
           turns over the last page.

                                                                CUT BACK TO:

           INT. DOKTOR WERBEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Using a magnifier, Doktor Werbel considers the poison pen
           letter written in BLUE PENCIL, with a keen medical eye.  

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Fractured personality.  Feelings of
                        inadequacy.  Humiliation stemming
                        from childhood.  Pressures of
                        socioeconomic status.  By his own
                        admission, he derives heightened
                        sexual gratification by the conquest
                        of woman, but he feels trapped by
                        them as well.
                            (beat)
                        Most likely has a cultivated exterior. 
                        Dresses impeccably, reads widely,
                        behaves properly in civilization. 

                                 FRITZ
                        A two natured human being.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Estranged to himself.  Disconnected
                        from his deeds.  Losing touch with
                        the human side. 

                                 FRITZ
                        How do you see it, Doktor?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        The repressed looping.  The word
                        choice.  The blue pencil.  It's like
                        looking through the eye-piece of a
                        microscope, the tangled mind exposed,
                        laid flat on the slide.

           Doktor Werbel tilts a scrutinizing eye at Fritz.
                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        It's your handwriting, isn't it?

           Fritz stiffens.

                                 FRITZ
                        What, no.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Takes one of like mind to do the
                        unthinkable.

                                 FRITZ
                        You've misunderstood my purpose.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        You think it's easy being committed
                        instead of taking the big ax?

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm not a patient here.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Then who are you?

           Fritz thinks hard about the question.  His concentration
           snaps off with the sound of a RING!

           On the desk a black telephone with no dial.  Doktor Werbel
           hesitates, then-- 

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                            (into phone)
                        Yes.

           Long beat.  He hangs it up.

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        Seems a resident of our institute is
                        missing.

                                 FRITZ
                        Missing?

                                 DOKTOR WERBEL
                        I need to end our meeting now.

           Doktor Werbel escorts Fritz out of the office.

           TWO ORDERLIES race up the corridor behind Doktor Werbel,
           tussling him to the ground.

           PATIENTS holler from their cells, aroused by the commotion. 

           The nurse hurries into Doktor Werbel's office, slides the
           steel plate away from the diamond shaped observation window.
                                 NURSE
                        Ohmygod, Doktor Werbel!

           She unlocks the steel door and liberates him.

                                 NURSE
                        Doktor Werbel, are you all right?

           CLOSE ON Fritz through the staggering chaos as he comprehends
           that the bona fide Doktor Werbel was locked inside the padded
           cell.  Fritz communing the entire time with a madman who
           turned his family into sausages.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. THEA'S STUDY -- DAY

           Thea at the Underwood, takes a finished page out of the
           carriage and places it face down on the stack to her right. 
           Feeds in a new page.  Begins typing --

           EXTREME CLOSE SHOT: ONIONSKIN PAPER

           The keys crashing down to form the words: 

                              THE MURDERER AMONG US

           She rips the paper out of the carriage.  Brings it into Fritz,
           who affixes his monocle in anticipation.

           As she hands it over --

                                 THEA
                        Darn, it smudged.

           EXTREME CLOSE SHOT FRITZ'S POV:

           The ink on the "M" in the word MURDERER bleeding, misshapen. 

           Fritz bewitched by the distorted letter, can't take his eyes
           off it.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- EVENING

           Fritz at the mirror, buttoning a crisp white tuxedo shirt. 

           Thea comes up behind him, helping him with his bow tie. 
           Evening dress sparkling, she's never looked more radiant.

           He kisses her tenderly.  Their fingers mingling together. 
           He's never been more in love then this fleeting moment.
           INT. LOBBY, FRIEDRICHSTADT-PALAST THEATER -- NIGHT

           Booming down on the opening night gala reception for the
           theatrical production of "Spring Awakening".

           Fritz and Thea are with a group of patrons discussing current
           events.  DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS joins them.

                                 THEA
                        Fritz, I'd like to introduce you to 
                        Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels.

           As they shake hands --

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Pleasure.

                                 FRITZ
                        Likewise.  A Doctor...?

                                 GOEBBELS
                        I did my doctoral thesis on 18th
                        century romantic literature.

           Fritz glances his NAZI ARMBAND.

                                 FRITZ
                        Age of Enlightenment.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        My interests in the arts have taken
                        root in another direction.

                                 FRITZ
                        Politics.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Adolf Hitler and I are big fans. 
                        The magistery of "Metropolis" caused
                        the Fuhrer to break down and weep. 
                        He said and I quote: "Here is a man
                        who will give us great Nazi films!"

           Fritz stunned, nearly speechless.

                                 FRITZ
                        You humble me. 
                            (beat)
                        Excuse me, I could do with a drink.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        The bar's over there.

                                 FRITZ
                        I can find my way.
           Fritz heads for the bar, could vomit.

           Runs into his old chum Joe May nursing a Martini.

                                 FRITZ
                        Joe May, been awhile. 

                                 JOE MAY
                        This is a historic occasion, Fritz
                        and Thea are the toast of the town.

                                 FRITZ
                        You saw the pictures?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Afraid I don't get out as often as I
                        would like these days.

                                 FRITZ
                        You want to insult me, fair enough. 
                        But you can't envy me at the same
                        time.

           Joe May shrugs, downs his drink. 

                                 JOE MAY
                        Recently came into an authenticated
                        armoire from the Capethian dynasty. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Thinking of leaving Berlin?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Thirty thousands marks.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why the reduction?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Too big to smuggle out.

                                 FRITZ
                        Who is he?

           Joe May grins good-naturedly.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Bit personal.

                                 FRITZ
                        Over there, with my wife.

           Joe May flicks his gaze to Thea now flanked by three tuxedos: 
           Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Dr. Joseph Goebbels, and a dashing young
           INDIAN GENTLEMAN.
                                 JOE MAY
                        Armband is Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels,
                        soon to be appointed Reich Minister of
                        Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. 
                        And one of Adolf Hitler's closest
                        associates.

                                 FRITZ
                        We've been introduced.

                                 JOE MAY
                        You know Klein-Rogge, rumor has it
                        he's slamming morphine with a cabaret
                        dancer. 

           Thea reaches out and touches the Indian Gentleman's hand. 
           Fritz's lips forming a straight line.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Ayi Tendulkar.  Doctor from India.

                                 FRITZ
                            (sotto)
                        India.

                                 JOE MAY
                        He beds the wives of influential
                        Berliners.  They take pleasure in
                        sleeping with foreigners, it's like
                        travel:  Candlelit dinners.  Little
                        presents.  Clean sheets.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're enjoying this?

                                 JOE MAY
                        The truth tortures.

                                 FRITZ
                        At last, we're getting somewhere.

                                 JOE MAY
                        They're greifers. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Greifers?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Grabbers of Jews.  
                            (beat)
                        It's very simple.  Either you're
                        with them or you're not.  And your
                        wife is more Prussian than you're
                        monocle.

           The theater bell rings signaling it's time to take their seats.   
                                 FRITZ
                        I'll come see the armoire.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Be careful, Goebbels stalks Jews
                        like hunters stalk deer over the
                        mountains.  And Thea Von Harbou is a
                        ten point antlered beauty.

           Fritz's eyes widen, realizing that Joe May's words echo
           Lohmann's --

                                 FRITZ
                        What did you say?

           -- but Joe May's already heading inside the auditorium with
           the other patrons.

           INT. AUDITORIUM, FRIEDRICHSTADT-PALAST -- LATER

           Well into the dreadful play.

           ON STAGE:  The ACTOR delivering Moritz's monologue is a short
           odious piglet of a man with a moon-shaped face, sad bulging
           eyes, and low pitched purr of a voice.

                                 ACTOR PLAYING MORITZ
                        It's as if I were hearing my dead
                        Grandmother tell the story of the
                        Queen without a head.  She was a
                        perfectly beautiful queen, fair as
                        the sun, lovelier than all the maidens
                        in the land, only she had come into
                        the world, alas!  Without a head.

           Laughter from the audience.  The actor throwing off more
           nervous energy than a caged snake.

           Fritz and Thea watch from their box seats in the balcony. 

           Fritz scans the audience with opera glasses.  Locates Goebbels
           in the Orchestra section scribbling in a notebook with a
           NAZI SWASTIKA on its cover.  Ayi Tendulkar seated next to
           him.  

           Fritz looks back at Thea.  Suspicious.  Pained. 

           Heckles from the audience.  The actor stammers, it clearly
           throws him off.  

                                 ACTOR PLAYING MORITZ
                        Err...err...err confounded rot!  I
                        haven't been able to get the Headless
                        Queen out of my head!  
           The actor moves to the top of the proscenium arch.  A loud
           chorus of BOOS from the audience.

           Fritz lingers on the actor, sympathizing with the vile  
           creature on stage, drawn to him.  He glances at the playbill,
           Moritz played by:  Peter Lorre. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE (INTERMISSION) -- LATER

           Stage hands, actors, understudies, in the wings.

           Fritz finds Peter Lorre's name on a door, enters.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           A box of exposed hot water pipes and cracked plaster. 

           In costume, hair drawn back tightly to fit under a wig cap,
           PETER LORRE is seated at the dressing table.  Bottle of Scotch
           on the table nearly empty. 

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Do you have the tabasco sauce?

                                 FRITZ
                        No.  

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Did they send you to fire me?

                                 FRITZ
                        What, no.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        It's still early.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm a director.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Plays?

                                 FRITZ
                        Motion pictures.  That's why I'm
                        here, I have a role looming. 

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Loooooooming?

                                 FRITZ
                        I'd like to offer the role to you.
                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...err...err...me?
                            (suspicious)
                        What kind of part?

                                 FRITZ
                        Leading part.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Is this a joke?

                                 FRITZ
                        Mr. Lorre, I'm offering you the
                        opportunity to act in a film.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...err...err have you seen the
                        show tonight?

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm quite a fan.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        You heard them out there -- their
                        reaction?

                                 FRITZ
                        You provoked them.  Nobody else could
                        have played that role.  It would be
                        like doing Macbeth without Macbeth.    

                                 PETER LORRE
                        It never occurred to me that my puss
                        could be photographed.

           A STAGEHAND enters with a bottle.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Here's the Tabasco, Mr. Lorre.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...err...err...bring it here.

           Lorre dabs the Tabasco sauce on two cotton balls, places
           them on his puffy froggy-eyes.

                                 STAGE HAND
                        It's how he gets into character.

                                 FRITZ
                        Outstanding.
           INT. FRITZ'S STUDY -- LATE NIGHT

           Fritz at his desk contemplating production design drawings,
           storyboards, and script pages for "M".  The pages crowded
           with his blue-penciled notations.

           He reaches for across the desk for one of his signature
           pencils, but the holder is empty.  He angrily brushes the
           work aside.

           The telephone on Fritz desk rings.  He answers.

                                 FRITZ
                            (phone)
                        Hello.

                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        Quite a meat grinder you're caught
                        in, Lang.  Couldn't pen a better
                        scenario if you tried.

                                 FRITZ
                            (phone)
                        Lohmann.

           Fritz goes to the window, spots Lohmann in a TELEPHONE KIOSK
           across the street.

           Meanwhile downstairs... 

           KITCHEN

           Frau Nussbaum preparing a tea tray when she encounters PENCIL
           SHAVINGS on the counter -- smudging her finger tips BLUE.

           Overhearing bits of conversation upstairs, she gingerly picks
           up the downstairs telephone.  Eavesdrops on Fritz's
           conversation while she retrieves the tea tin from the cabinet. 

           She pulls off the tin lid and to her shock, finds a heap of
           BLUE PENCILS inside, while simultaneously grasping that
           Fritz's voice is the ONLY VOICE on the other line.    

           FRITZ'S STUDY

           Fritz eyes Thea's locked study door as Lohmann speaks.

                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        You didn't go to the after party. 
                        She must me wondering where you are?

                                 FRITZ
                            (phone)
                        I had a headache.
                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        Right.  Her dance card is probably
                        full anyway. 

                                 FRITZ
                            (phone)
                        Leave it.

                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        Don't say you didn't see it coming.

           Fritz takes a heavy breath, ready to talk --

                                 FRITZ
                            (phone)
                        Lohmann wait, don't hang up,        
                        I want to talk --

           CLICK. 

           Fritz looks out the window, the telephone kiosk now empty. 
           He slams the phone down.

                                 FRITZ
                        Bastard!

           Fritz removes a SWITCHBLADE from his top drawer.  Goes to
           Thea's door, wedges the blade into the lock. 

           SNAP. 

           Fritz stands in silence at threshold of her inner sanctum. 
           Turns on the lights.  Hesitates before he steps inside.

           THEA'S STUDY

           Fritz topples drawers, leafs through personal journals and
           private letters, searching for traces of an affair.  Sickened
           by his own behavior, he stops.  Then his eyes lock on the
           bookshelf with Thea's published novels. 

           He removes one book in particular, opens a cover --

                  Blossoming Lotus written by Thea von Harbou.

           Below it reads --    For  A.T. 

                                 FRITZ
                            (sotto)
                        A. T. -- Ayi Tendulkar

           He stares at it, bewildered.  Stunned.  Confused. 

           Turns to see Thea now standing in the doorway, still dressed
           in her gown.
                                 THEA
                        How's your headache?

                                 FRITZ
                        Worse.

                                 THEA
                        I left the party.  I was concerned
                        about you.

                                 FRITZ
                        Concern for me? 

                                 THEA
                        Did you find what you were looking for?

                                 FRITZ
                        I wanted answers.

                                 THEA
                        By breaking in and devouring my
                        personal papers like Silverfish?

                                 FRITZ
                        You've been with him?

                                 THEA
                        The truth has a price, Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                        Has it been the entire time?

                                 THEA
                        Only when I needed it to be.

                                 FRITZ
                        That's it -- that's all you have to
                        say to me?

                                 THEA
                        My life is my own.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're my wife!

                                 THEA
                        You made sure of that.

                                 FRITZ
                        I sacrificed everything for you.

                                 THEA
                        I never asked you to.
                                 FRITZ
                        Is this how it's going to be -- 
                        coming at each other guns blazing?

                                 THEA
                        The difference is mine isn't loaded.

           He backs her up against the window.  She's paralyzed.

                                 FRITZ
                        You have no idea what I'm capable of.

                                 THEA
                        Just like that -- like you blue
                        penciled your first wife out of the
                        final draft?

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you ever love me?

                                 THEA
                        I do still --

           Fritz catches his distorted reflection in the window.

                                 THEA
                        -- even when the monsters are close.

           Fritz lets her go.  Immobilized, he drifts to the floor.

           EXT. AIRFIELD -- DAY

           Large industrial hangar along the outskirts of Berlin.

           INT. ZEPPELIN HANGAR -- CONTINUOUS

           The structure housing a sleekly designed AIRSHIP with a
           prominent Nazi Swastika symbol on its fin.

           Fritz and the Nero-Film Investors stride past the massive 
           rudder as they survey the space as a potential stage.

           The interior MORPHING into an exterior tenement building.

           INT. MURDERER'S ROOM, TENEMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

           The MURDERER sits at a windowsill, his back to us, writing a
           poison pen letter.  As we slowly PUSH IN on his back --

           -- Peter Lorre, dressed in Hans Beckert's trademark overcoat,
           spins around, stares directly into the lens and says --
                                 PETER LORRE
                        I can't do it.

           A scaffold above leads to Fritz, seated beside a camera on
           tripod operated by WAGNER, the photographer.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut!  Cut!  Cut!

           PULL BACK to reveal the tenement building is a set for "M".

           and props.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I can't do it.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's a black box.  Think of it as
                        the audience.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        No, I can't --

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Whistle.  I can't whistle.

                                 FRITZ
                        You never said anything.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        You never asked.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't be ridiculous, put your lips
                        together like this --

           Fritz whistles a few bars of the Gynt tune. 

           Peter Lorre blows and blows, nothing but air.

                                 FRITZ
                        Stop!  It's torture.  You could
                        inflate the Graf Zeppelin with all
                        that hot air.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I'm sorry, Fritzy.
                                 FRITZ
                        Actors fence, ride horses, charm
                        snakes, but you can't whistle.   

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I err...err...err...fence.

                                 FRITZ
                        Nevermind, just stand on your mark
                        and try saying your line without
                        spitting.

                                 PETER LORRE
                            (stirred)
                        Err...err...you never said I would
                        be playing a compulsive murderer of
                        children.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's a sympathetic role.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Sympathetic?  Rape.  Murder.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's a crime which he resents very
                        much afterwards.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        My heart's bleeding for him, but I'm
                        the one who has to get under the
                        skin of a psychopath.

                                 FRITZ
                        Hans Beckert is a murderer,     
                        Peter Lorre is a matinee idol.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I don't know if I can do it.

                                 FRITZ
                        Pathos.  Catharsis.  Channel it.

           Peter, issuing one of his hesitant smiles.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I could have spent the morning                    
                        tending to my roses.

           Fritz looks around to the crew, angrily announces --

                                 FRITZ
                        That's an hour for lunch.

           Peter Lorre scuttles off to his trailer.  Fritz waves a
           production assistant over.
                                 FRITZ
                        Keep him docile.  No matter what it   
                        takes.  I can't afford to lose the day.

           Production designers KARL VOLLBRECHT and EMIL HASLER approach.

                        We looked over your renderings for
                        the final scene. 

                                 FRITZ
                        It's important that the kangaroo
                        court look absolutely authentic, 
                        you understand.

                                 EMIL
                        I'll draw up some blueprints.

           Fritz spots something from the corner of his eye -- 

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann.

           He marches across the stage towards Lohmann, now camouflaged
           behind a cookaloris. 

                                 FRITZ
                        What the hell are you doing here? 

           A MAN with similar stature to Lohmann, cowers.

                                 FRITZ
                        You're not Lohmann.

                                 MAN
                        I didn't mean to inter --

                                 FRITZ
                        Did Lohmann send you?

                                 MAN
                        Lohmann?

                                 FRITZ
                        What do you want?

                                 MAN
                        Nothing, sir.

                                 FRITZ
                        Who let you in here, huh?

                                 MAN
                        We haven't worked together.  I'm
                        Adolf Jansen your sound --
                                 FRITZ
                        Sound?

                                 MAN
                        Recordist, sir.

           PETER LORRE'S DRESSING ROOM

           Peter Lorre makes terrible faces in the mirror trying to get
           into character. 

           KNOCK at the door.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...err, yes --

           A MAN with a MEDICINE BAG enters.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        I didn't ask for a physician.

                                 MAN
                        I'm not a physician.

           He opens the bag and removes a syringe and vile of MORPHINE. 

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Who are you?

                                 MAN
                        The gardener.

           He fills the syringe with fluid and injects the needle in
           Peter Lorre's arm vein.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        What are you doing!

                                 THE GARDENER
                        Tending to the roses.

           Peter Lorre's head lolls back.  His eyelids flutter and then
           amplify to unveil blossoming irises. 

           His pupil morphing into a hypnotic spinning spirals --

           INT. "M" SET, NERO-FILM STUDIO -- LATER

           -- PULL OUT to reveal that the hypnotic spinning spiral is a
           display hanging in a BOOKSHOP window next to a huge arrow
           phallicly bobbing up and down. 

           A YOUNG GIRL stares, fascinated by the continual motion. 
           The blood-thirsty Hans Beckert/Peter Lorre sets off after
           the vulnerable girl. 

           The girl runs to her mother.  We FOLLOW them along the
           pavement, arms around each other, as they pass the Hans
           Beckert, who has ducked inside the bookshop doorway. 

           Eyes drooping, mouth hanging open, Hans Beckert sways in a
           nervous fit.  Puts his hands on his chest, nervously
           scratching them.

           Fritz next to the camera.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut! 
                            (beat)
                        That was brilliant, Peter. 

                                 PETER LORRE
                        You really liked it, Fritzy.

                                 FRITZ
                        Absolutely believable.

           Peter Lorre's not acting, he's doped up.  Staggering away --

                                 PETER LORRE
                        By the pricking of my thumbs,
                        something wicked this way comes. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Macbeth.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...err...Macbeth.

             Fritz waves Wagner over.

                                 FRITZ
                        Get the film to the lab.  I want to
                        see rushes first thing tomorrow.

           INT. "M" SET, NERO-FILM STUDIO -- LATER

           Most of the crew have wrapped.  Fritz in front of a microphone
           recording the Gynt whistle himself (Peter Lorre's famous
           whistle in "M").

           BOOM OPERATOR wearing headphones, listens to a crude wireless
           transmitter, trying to stay awake.  His eyes snap open.    

                                 BOOM OPERATOR
                        They caught him.  They caught him! 

           He tunes the antenna, turns up the crackling volume --
                                 RADIO NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        This is a special announcement from
                        Radio Berlin:  the Monster of Dusseldorf
                        has been apprehended.  The murderer,
                        identified as 48 year-old Peter Kurten,
                        has confessed to 79 offenses including
                        sex crimes and murders and if found
                        guilty will be sentenced to death by
                        guillotine.  Kurten told police that
                        he urged his wife to turn him in for
                        the reward money.  He was according to
                        friends, a most unlikely murderer.  We
                        repeat... 

           The blood drains from Fritz's face.

           EXT. PRISON, ALEXANDERPLATZ -- DAY

           Cold stratum of guard towers and well-fortified gates.

           A throng of citizens surround a prison bus stopped outside
           the iron-barred entrance.  Fritz amongst them, vacillating
           in the tumultuous motion. 

           The bus door opens and a PRISON GUARD shouts --

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Prisoner eins-sieben-null-null-eins.

           PETER KURTEN (Monster of Dusseldorf), meek and hardly
           dangerous looking, is ushered off the bus by flanking guards
           and paraded along the crowd.   

           Shackled to steel collar and chains, Kurten is forced to
           take baby steps, flinching under the barrage of shouts and
           jeers.  Above, tower guards CLACK and train their rifles.

           Fritz is pulled along by the current of the crowd, almost
           dragging him under, until cresting right in front of Kurten. 
           Fritz close to his ear, discreetly mutters --

                                 FRITZ
                        How do you live with what you've
                        done?  I need to know.

           Peter Kurten stops.  Processes it.   

           As he's pulled away, Kurten turns to Fritz, offering a glimpse
           into the monster -- 

                                 PETER KURTEN
                        It's going to snow.

           A SIREN BLASTS from the tower, followed a loud THRUM as the
           iron doors swallow Kurten.
           Fritz shoots his eyes to the sky, it's never more clear.

           EXT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Fritz climbs out of a taxicab, returning home.  A group of
           neighborhood children are playing soccer the street. 

           Relieved that they're safe from the monster, Fritz kicks the
           ball around with them, when a SHADOW passes over his eyes. 
           Looks up at something that stops him dead --

           -- a titan FLAG of Third Reich support above his door, stirred
           by the wind. 

           Fritz eyes fill with sadness.  Emotional.

           Behind him, a dark car squeals to a halt at the curb.  TWO
           DETECTIVES inside.  The one behind the wheel pokes his head
           out the window --

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Get in, Lang.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM, ALEX -- LATER

           The detectives and their POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER, scrutinize
           Fritz like a mannequin on display.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        We know you struck a deal with the
                        Herr Ott in exchange for your own
                        neck.

                                 FRITZ
                        That's an outrageous lie.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Really, then why is that yid prick 
                        and his cronies on the payroll for
                        your picture -- would you like to
                        see the ledger?

                                 FRITZ
                        Extras. 

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Extras?

                                 FRITZ
                        What's the harm, they're just ordinary
                        citizens in need of a little money
                        for their families and struggling
                        businesses.
                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        They're pick-pockets, con-men,
                        burglars, and safe-breakers.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure, now that you don't need them. 
                        Now that you've caught your monster.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        I've heard you're arrogant.

                                 FRITZ
                        Lohmann footnote, no doubt. 
                            (shouting)
                        I know you're listening Lohmann!

           The detectives look at each other puzzled.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        You have blood on your hands,    
                        Mr. Lang.  So listen carefully,   
                        last day of shooting at the blimp
                        hangar, when those low-life scum
                        have gathered for your big climactic
                        scene --

                                 FRITZ
                        Who told you that?

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        -- we're going to dispatch a force
                        to systematically take the Berlin
                        underground down.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why come to me?  Wait, you don't
                        expect me to play along? 

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        You're one of the most beloved figures
                        in Germany.  Above suspicion.

                                 FRITZ
                        You know what they do to snitches. 
                        I'll be exterminated -- my corpse
                        plucked from the Blue Danube.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        So you won't help us?

                                 FRITZ
                        I would rather plummet from Golden
                        Lizzy's wings.
                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                            (to Detectives)
                        Throw him in the clinker.

                                 FRITZ
                        On what charge?

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Failure to aid a police investigation. 
                        Colluding with criminal elements. 
                        You'll get two years, longer if I'm
                        inclined to reopen the investigation
                        into your first wife's murder.

                                 FRITZ
                        You mean suicide.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Murder, self-murder -- same guilt. 

                                 FRITZ
                        I want to speak to Lohmann, right now.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Lohmann's dead.

                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Working the Monster of Dusseldorf
                        case nearly drove him mad before his
                        ticker gave.

                                 FRITZ
                        That's impossible.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        I don't know what fantasy world you're
                        living in, Lang -- but trust me,
                        prison's no fairy story.

           Fritz trying to process it.  The Chief Commander nods to the
           detectives who pull handcuffs.

                                 FRITZ
                        Wait a minute!

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Leave a man alone in a cell for a
                        couple of days and a lot comes back
                        to him that he couldn't remember
                        before.

           Fritz turns to the window, eyebrows furrowing.  It's SNOWING.
           INT. HALLWAY, ALEX -- LATER

           Cops with snow on their boots and jackets pass by Fritz as
           he heads for the door.  Before exiting, Fritz glimpses a 
           photograph of Lohmann mounted on the wall. 

           PUSH IN on the caption underneath:                        

                  IN MEMORIAL CHIEF INSPECTOR LOHMANN 1880 - 1925                                                             

           Fritz jolted.  His mind churning.  Puts on his hat and
           disappears into the hypnotic falling snow.

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE BERLIN -- EVENING

           Snow assaulting the city like mortar shells.

           INT. BEDROOM, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Fritz enters to find Thea is in bed, nearly asleep.

                                 THEA
                        It's snowing.

                                 FRITZ
                        I know. 

                                 THEA
                        You look pale, like you've seen a spook.

                                 FRITZ
                        You weren't at the studio today.

                                 THEA
                        I had an engagement.

           Fritz bends down, kisses her on the cheek.

                                 FRITZ
                        Cocktails with the Minister of
                        Propaganda, no doubt?

                                 THEA
                        You're obviously upset.

                                 FRITZ
                        Why are you in bed?

                                 THEA
                        I took a sleeping tablet.

                                 FRITZ
                        You never do that.
                                 THEA
                        I fell.

                                 FRITZ
                        Fell?

                                 THEA
                        Mmmm, stairs.  I'm always tripping up.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sure it wasn't while you were hanging
                        that gigantic flag of party support
                        above the door?

                                 THEA
                        I'm just an errand boy.  It's you
                        they want.

                                 FRITZ
                            (re. ankle)
                        It's swollen, you need a doctor.

                                 THEA
                        You can't sleepwalk forever, Friedel. 
                        Berlin is changing.

           His worst fears confirmed.

                                 FRITZ
                        You joined the party.

           Ayi Tendulkar comes through the door with a cold compress. 
           Fritz a deer caught in the headlights.

                                 THEA
                        Ayi's a doctor.  I asked him to come. 

                                 AYI TENDULKAR
                        It's nice to meet you.  Regrettable
                        that it's under these circumstances.

                                 FRITZ
                            (seething beneath)
                        Truly, regrettable.

                                 AYI TENDULKAR
                        Our girl sprained her ankle.  I've
                        given her something for the pain. 
                        Couple of days, she'll be back to
                        climbing mountains.

                                 FRITZ
                        Kilimanjaro, perhaps.

                                 AYI TENDULKAR
                        Perhaps.  Well, I should go.
                                 THEA
                        You'll catch your death in this, let me
                        send for a car.

                                 AYI TENDULKAR
                        I enjoy the walk.  Good-night.

           Ayi leaves.  Fritz looks to Thea for help in understanding.

                                 FRITZ
                        How much do they know, Thea?

                                 THEA
                        Fritz...

                                 FRITZ
                        How much?

                                 THEA
                        I have nothing to hide. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you give them the manuscript?

                                 THEA
                        They've liked what they've seen so
                        far, very much.

                                 FRITZ
                        They've watched it?

                                 THEA
                        Roughly assembled footage, that's all.  

                                 FRITZ
                        They'll destroy it.

                                 THEA
                        They can help us.

                                 FRITZ
                        They'll take the scissors to it. 
                        Make it an example and then proudly
                        parade it as part of their propaganda
                        machine.

                                 THEA
                        Please, with your professional pity. 

                                 FRITZ
                        You have no idea what they're capable
                        of, they're probably in the neighbors
                        toilet listening to us right now.

                                 THEA
                        Are you really that deluded?
                                 FRITZ
                        You deceived me.

                                 THEA
                        No, I saved you!

                                 FRITZ
                        Who's deluded, now? 
                            (beat)
                        I've never loved anyone as I loved you.

                                 THEA
                        I'm sorry, this is difficult for me?

                                 FRITZ
                        You've always had trouble writing
                        endings.

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. FRITZ'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE on the Nazi flag waving above the door, the SWASTIKA
           morphing into --  

           INT. "M" SET, NERO-FILM STUDIO -- DAY

           -- "M", Hans Beckert's trademark letter on the back shoulder
           of his jacket as WARDROBE presents it for Fritz's approval. 

                                 FRITZ
                        It's Hans Beckert's badge of shame. 
                        His scarlet letter.  Larger. 

           PETER LORRE'S DRESSING ROOM

           The Gardener arrives with his medicine bag.  Peter Lorre
           ushers him inside, closing the door behind them.

           STAGE

           Fritz going over his shot list, when Herr Ott approaches.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Excuse, please.  

           Herr Ott hands Fritz a bottle of gin.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Go ahead, we're toasting.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm not going to have a seizure and
                        drop dead am I?
                                 HERR OTT
                        It's safe, but you drink first just
                        in case.

                                 FRITZ
                        What are we toasting to?

                                 HERR OTT
                        To clear conscience or poor memory, eh?

           Fritz almost chokes as he knocks it back.

           A CLANG OF STEEL as the hangar doors are hoisted and a swarm
           of UNDERGROUND CRIMINALS flood into the studio.

                                 FRITZ
                        My god, how many are there?

                                 HERR OTT
                        Hundred, maybe more.

                                 FRITZ
                        We agreed on twenty five.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Take this lot to nab the monster.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's a picture.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Your picture.

           Clearly doped up, Peter Lorre exits his dressing room.  Herr
           Ott sizes up the human cartoon caricature approaching --

                                 HERR OTT
                        We'll make him squeal like a pig
                        stuck under a gate.

           Herr Ott joins his cronies as Peter Lorre reaches Fritz.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Fritzy, I want to talk to you about
                        my motivation in the finale scene.

           Fritz nods the angry mob that Herr Ott is rousing.

                                 FRITZ
                        Don't worry, they'll help you find it.

                                 PETER LORRE
                        They look like a rough bunch.

                                 FRITZ
                        Extras.
                                 PETER LORRE
                        Err...what are they playing?

                                 FRITZ
                        Themselves.

           INT. "M" SET, NERO-FILM STUDIO -- LATER

           CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDE revealing the catacomb set for the
           climatic kangaroo courtroom scene in "M".

           Fritz behind the camera, adjusts his monocle.

                                 FRITZ
                        Quite please.  Camera.  Sound.  Speed. 
                        Aaaaand action.

           CAMERA PANS across the faces of Herr Ott, Udo, and other mob
           members as Peter Lorre/Hans Beckert is shoved down the steps
           for trial (the mob treating him like they've caught the real
           monster).

           Fritz comprehends that he's lost control of his film to the
           real mob, but it doesn't matter because what he's getting is
           better then he imagined.  

           Morphine fueled and genuinely frightened by his fellow actors,  
           Peter Lorre sweats, pants, pleads and squeals his way through
           Hans Beckert's writhing and primal confession --

                                 PETER LORRE/HANS BECKERT
                        I can't help myself!  I haven't any
                        control over this evil thing that's
                        inside me -- the fire, the voices,
                        the torment!  Always...always, there's
                        this evil force inside me.  Silently,
                        but I can feel it there.  It's me,
                        pursuing myself.  I want to escape...   
                        to escape from myself, but it's
                        impossible.  I can't.  I can't escape. 
                        I have to obey it.  I have to
                        run...run...streets...endless streets. 
                        I want to escape.  I want to get
                        away.  And I am pursued by ghosts. 
                        Ghosts of mothers.  And those
                        children.  They never leave me.

           Fritz mouthing the lines along with Lorre when he spots a
           hauntingly familiar face in the mob --

           -- L, his dead wife.  How can this be?  He looks back again,
           but the ghost is gone.

           Unbeknownst to Fritz, Thea is in the studio listening to
           every word of dialogue.
           Her face pained as it slowly sinks in that she's hearing 
           Fritz's self-confession. 

                                 PETER LORRE/HANS BECKERT
                        I see the posters and I read what
                        I've done.  I read...and...and read. 
                        Did I do that?  But I can't remember
                        anything about it, but who will believe
                        me?  Who knows what it feels like to
                        be me?  How I'm forced to act...
                            (eyes close to ecstasy)
                        How I must...don't want to, but must. 
                        And then a voice screams...I can't
                        bear to hear it.  I can't...I can't
                        go on.  Can't go on...can't go on. 
                        Can't go on...

           The crew and cast turn to Fritz, wait breathlessly --

                                 FRITZ
                        Cut!  Brilliant!

                                 WAGNER
                        Do you want to go again?

           Fritz nervously checks his watch.

                                 FRITZ
                        Brilliant.  Print it.  That was your
                        finest moment, Peter.

           Peter Lorre stomps up to Fritz and takes a swing.  He ducks
           just in time.

                                 FRITZ
                        What was that for?

                                 PETER LORRE
                        That wasn't acting.  That was real. 
                        You saw them, they practically 
                        crucified me.
                            (beat)
                        It was good, wasn't it.

           Peter Lorre issues a hesitant smile as two stage hands
           restrain him and escort him off the stage.  En route to his
           waiting car, Peter Lorre passes by Thea --

                                 PETER LORRE
                        Powerful words.

                                 THEA
                        I didn't write them.

           Thea looks at Fritz one last time before exiting the stage
           doors forever.  Fritz never aware that she was ever there.
           The lights power down and the crew begin packing equipment.

           Fritz races over to Herr Ott and his cronies, who are ambling
           through the studio preparing to leave.  Fritz trying to warn
           them --

                                 FRITZ
                        You should go now.  All of you. 

           Fritz and Herr Ott trade a look.

           Suddenly the carbon-arc lights bump on in sequence.

                                 POLICE ON BULLHORN (O.S.)
                        This is the police.  This is a raid. 
                        Nobody move.  Get your papers ready.

                                 MOB WOMAN
                        Coppers!

           POLICE WHISTLES as OFFICERS burst through, storming the stage.  

           Entrances and exits blocked.  Cops draw batons.  The mob
           prepare for a fight. 

           Heavy breathing bellowing, Fritz not sure whether to run or
           hide as Herr Ott's stare digs into him.

                                 HERR OTT
                        They can't hold us on trumped charges
                        for long, Lang.  When we come for
                        you, it will be from all sides, like
                        Mosquitoes at a picnic.

           CRANE UP, the place goes nuts. 

           INT. FRITZ'S HOME -- DAY

           Fritz enters the particularly quiet house calling out for --

                                 FRITZ
                        Thea!

           Frau Nussbaum shuffles down the stairs.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        She's gone, Mr. Fritz.

                                 FRITZ
                        Gone for the evening?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Gone for good. 
                                 FRITZ
                        What?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        She went to the studio to tell you. 
                        Said someone would come round for
                        the rest of her things.

           Fritz heads for the door, prepared to find her.

                                 FRITZ
                        Where is she?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        India.

           EXT. STREET, APARTMENT BUILDING -- EVENING

           Neighborhood of upscale walk-ups. 

           Waiting Taxicab idles in the street. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz, carrying a briefcase, climbs the angular staircase to
           the upper level.  A radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced. 

           Fritz finds the door, knocks... 

           INT. JOE MAY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Several knocks bring Joe May to the door.  He looks through
           peephole.  Opens the door a crack.

                                 FRITZ
                        Sorry, I know it's late.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Do you want to see the armoire?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.

           Joe May removes the door chain, leads Fritz inside.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Follow me.

           The walls festooned with nail holes and faint outlines where
           paintings and tapestries once hung.  Apartment in shambles,
           Joe May has fallen on hard times.
                                 FRITZ
                        What happened to your flat?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Put out cheese, the mice come.  You look
                        awful by the way.

           Joe May's lover FREDERICK, an strapping Aryan wearing a silk
           kimono, hurriedly retreats to another room.

                                 JOE MAY
                        The armoire is there.

           Fritz hands Joe May an ENVELOPE.  He fans through a lump of
           banknotes.

                                 JOE MAY
                        This far surpasses the price we agreed
                        on.

           Fritz spots Joe's identical photograph of the two of them
           traveling abroad, youth and optimism on their side.

                                 FRITZ
                        Do you ever think about that time in
                        the harbor?  The Manhattan skyline.

                                 JOE MAY
                        I think about it.

                                 FRITZ
                        They wouldn't let us off the boat.

                                 JOE MAY
                        They were misguided.

                                 FRITZ
                        Time passes quickly, perhaps that's
                        good.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Does Thea know you're here?

                                 FRITZ
                        Thea's gone.

                                 JOE MAY
                        The money's not for the armoire?

                                 FRITZ
                        No.

           Fritz sets the briefcase in front of Joe May.

                                 FRITZ
                        Open it.
                                 JOE MAY
                        You're giving me heart palpitations.

           Joe may hesitates.

                                 FRITZ
                        Open it, Joe.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Oh, Christ...

           He lifts the briefcase lid.  Inside TWO FILM REEL CANISTERS.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's the negative for "M".  I want
                        you to smuggle it out.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Sorry, the price for that is too high.

           Suddenly the bedroom door snaps open and Frederick, now
           dressed a NAZI MILITARY UNIFORM steps out.  He nods to   
           Joe May before leaving.

                                 JOE MAY
                        An enemy is an enemy until they're
                        you're friend. 

                                 FRITZ
                        One has to keep their ear to the
                        ground.

                                 JOE MAY
                        What kind of trouble are you in?

                                 FRITZ
                        The police.  Berlin Underground. 
                        And Goebbels knocks at my door.    

                                 JOE MAY
                        This city is covered with a net of
                        informers.  Every square mile under
                        surveillance.  They will assemble
                        themselves.  They're like the Queen,
                        able to navigate the board in any
                        direction.  You won't be able to
                        move without causing a stir.   

                                 FRITZ
                        I know it doesn't change things
                        between us, Joe.  But I ask for your
                        forgiveness.

                                 JOE MAY
                        It doesn't work like that, Fritz. 
                        The past doesn't change for anyone.
           SILENCE.  Long beat.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Sit down.  

           INT. FRITZ'S HOME -- DAY

           A persistent doorbell rings through the house.

           BATHROOM

           Depressed by Thea's departure, Fritz soaks in the bathtub
           with a pitcher of martinis.  His monocle streamed up.

           The doorbell again.  Yelling to Frau Nussbaum downstairs --

                                 FRITZ
                        Frau Nussbaum, are you going to get
                        that?

           KITCHEN

           Frau Nussbaum collects milk bottles from the dairyman at the
           back door. 

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Where's dairyman Schmidt?

           We recognize Udo in disguise by the tattoo on his chin, he's
           been released from jail.

                                 UDO
                        Retired.  Two marks, ma'am.  

           As she hands over the money, Udo gets a good look inside,
           casing the house before the door closes.

           The decisive doorbell again.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        I'm coming...I'm coming.

           Frau Nussbaum unties her apron as she heads for the front
           door this time, leaving a pot of eggs boiling on the stove.

           LIVING ROOM

           HAMMERING AT THE DOOR

           Frau Nussbaum opens the door to find SS OFFICER KRAUSE and
           THREE NAZI STORMTROOPERS waiting on the stoop.  They invade
           the house with authority.

           Fritz races down the stairs wearing a bathrobe.
                                 FRITZ
                        What's the meaning of this?

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                        Herr Lang we have orders to confiscate
                        the film negative for "M" and
                        immediately accompany you to the
                        Reichspropagandaministers office.

           Fritz's eyes dart nervously around the room.

                                 FRITZ
                        Confiscate the film, why?

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                        We have our orders.

                                 FRITZ
                        I'm afraid the film negative is at
                        the lab.  Composites are being printed
                        for its release.

           The Stormtroopers look at one another in confusion, not sure
           what to do.

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                            (to Fritz)
                        Get dressed.

           The Stormtroopers search room-to-room as Fritz heads upstairs.

           BEDROOM

           Fritz rushes into the wardrobe and grabs a trouser and jacket
           with stiff collar.

           He picks up the telephone and begins dialing when he realizes
           that he can't get a dial tone.  Grasping that someone
           downstairs is listening in, he slowly replaces the phone to
           its cradle, stands there looking at it.

           Fritz slides open the bureau drawer and stares at his trusty
           Browning.  Slams the drawer closed.

           As he dresses, he quickly scribbles something onto stationary,
           folds it in half.

           LIVING ROOM

           SS Officer Krause stares at Frau Nussbaum in a motionless
           rage, her Jewishness unmistakable to him.

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                        Where's the mistress of the house?

           As Fritz descends the stairway --
                                 FRITZ
                        Trekking Mount Kilimanjaro with her
                        Indian lover.  I'll get my hat.

           Handing Frau Nussbaum the note.

                                 FRITZ
                        Few things needed at market.

           Frau Nussbaum's eyes widen.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Right away, Mister Fritz.

           Frau Nussbaum grabs her coat and heads for the front door,
           but SS Officer Krause blocks her in the doorway.  Seizes the
           note in her hand.

           CLOSE ON note:  Eggs, milk, sausage, sweets.

           SS Officer Krause folds the note and hands it back. 

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Almost forgot the basket.

           Frau Nussbaum retrieves the shopping basket near Fritz before
           leaving.

           The Nazi's turn their gaze to Fritz.

           CLOSE ON the eggs in the pot in the kitchen.  They roil under
           the intense heat. 

           INT. KAISER WILHELM CHURCH -- LATER

           A priest performing Mass to a few scattered parishioners. 

           Joe May and a couple of BLACK MARKET HAWKERS are staggered
           in pews doing business.

                                 HAWKER #1
                        Old man Goldberg succumbed.  China,
                        some silver, and a rare cartography 
                        collection.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Wedgwood candlesticks?

                                 HAWKER #2
                        Counterfeit.

                                 JOE MAY
                        It'll be our little secret.

           Joe May crosses out a note scribbled in a little pad.
                                 JOE MAY
                        Saffron.

                                 HAWKER #3
                        Gem?

                                 JOE MAY
                        Spice.  Chef at the Excelsior will
                        pay top dollar.

           Joe May flips the pad closed, crosses himself as he gets up. 
           Frau Nussbaum standing in the aisle.  She hands him a note
           from Fritz.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Mr. Fritz put it in the basket.  Did
                        all the shopping before I found it.

           The shopping basket falls and eggs break open at their feet.

           EXT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- CONTINUOUS

           A monster of stone and concrete on Wilhelmsplatz, across
           from the Chancellery and Hotel Kaiserhof.

           The library on the corner is being ransacked and an organized
           book burning conducted on the pavement. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- CONTINUOUS

           Massive, echoing.  Fritz and his escorts make there way down
           a seemingly endless corridor.  SA Brownshirts with guns pass. 

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                            (to Fritz)
                        Wait here.

           Classic paintings hang in the corridor.  At the end,
           Rembrandt's final portrait.

           EXT. STREET -- LATER

           An old Mercedes haphazardly parked. 

           Joe May hurriedly loads the briefcase with the film canisters
           with the negative for "M" into the trunk.

           INT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- LATER

           Fritz anxiously awaiting his meeting with Propaganda Minister
           Goebbels, when there's a bustle of activity outside his door.
           GOEBBELS WIFE and SEVEN CHILDREN have arrived with a lunch
           basket and are ushered into the Propaganda Ministers office.

           Fritz checks his watch, idles.

           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE -- LATER

           AERIAL SHOT follows Joe May's Mercedes on a icy serpentine
           route, running through woods.

           INT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- LATER

           Fritz looks pensively at his reflection in the window.

           INT. JOE MAY'S MERCEDES (MOVING) -- LATER

           Fat snow flakes pelt the window and as the windshield wipers
           drag them away, a boarder check point comes into view.

           SS BOARDER GUARD exits the guardshack, raising his arm for
           the driver to stop.

           Joe May nervous until spotting Frederick, his lover and inside
           contact, in the guardshack.  Relieved, Joe May rolls down
           the window. 

                                 SS BOARDER GUARD
                        Passport.

                                 JOE MAY
                        Here you are.

           But Frederick will not make eye contact with Joe May, in
           fact he turns up the radio in the guardshack. 

           Another SS BOARDER GUARD comes from behind, checking under
           the car with a mirror and a DOG that sniffs for bombs.

           The dog nears the trunk.  The dog starts barking.

           The tail lights and tailpipe exhaust pierce the cold.

           INT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- LATER

           Fritz stares at the inscription on an accommodation plaque:

                "Reichspropagandaminister Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels" 

           Goebbels voice startles him --

                                 GOEBBELS (O.S.)
                        Sixteen vowels.  
           Goebbels, dressed in his party uniform, raises his hand in
           salute.  Fritz nervously reciprocates.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Come this way, Mr. Lang.

           Fritz follows Goebbels as he limps back to his office. 
           Goebbels seven children swarm them as they enter.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        My wife Magda and my children.

                                 FRITZ
                        Pleasure.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Children, this is Fritz Lang.    
                        The most famous film director in 
                        all of Germany.

           The children sheepishly grin.  Goebbels digs in his pocket --

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Little mice, what do we have here...

           -- pulls out handful of chocolates.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Sweets for my sweethearts.  Harald,
                        Helga, Hildegard, Helmut, Hegwig,
                        Holdine, Heidrun.

             Goebbels pecks Magda on the cheek.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Run along now with your mother now 
                        children.

           INT. GOEBBELS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           A sizable and nearly empty office, at the end Goebbels desk. 
           Fritz stands uncomfortably in front of Goebbels like a child
           in need of reprimanding.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Have a seat.

                                 FRITZ
                        There is no chair.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Did you read Brecht's quote in this
                        mornings newspaper?
                                 FRITZ
                        "Where one burns books, one eventually
                        burns people."

                                 GOEBBELS
                        It's true Germany's artist and
                        intellectuals are waking up late in
                        the day, but they are waking up.

           SS Officer Krause enters with TWO WING-BACKED CHAIRS, setting
           them in front of Goebbels desk before leaving.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Please...

           Fritz takes a seat, stares at the third chair.

                                 FRITZ
                        Will someone be joining us?

           Goebbels drags his club foot around the desk and opens his
           diary to a particular entry.  Reads his notation:

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Thursday, May 21st, 1933 -- Magda
                        and I saw the rough assembly for "M". 
                        Fantastic!  Against humanitarian
                        soppines for the death penalty. 
                        Well made.  Fritz Lang will be our
                        director one day.

                                 FRITZ
                        You flatter me, Herr Minister.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        I saw a dreadful picture last night. 
                        American.  A man in a loin cloth
                        running around with monkeys.  It
                        won't see the light of day in Germany.

                        Look, I am terribly sorry but we
                        have to confiscate your film.

                                 FRITZ
                        Confiscate, why?

                                 GOEBBELS
                        I assure you it's just the ending we
                        didn't like.  It lacked the ideals 
                        to save it from a perverted and
                        inconclusive ending.

                                 FRITZ
                        I don't understand.
                                 GOEBBELS
                        The Fuhrer despised it. 

                                 FRITZ
                        The Fuhrer watched it?

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Found the influence of America's
                        cultural invasion on the motion
                        picture bothersome.

                                 FRITZ
                        It's a German picture.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        "Metropolis" and "Die Nibelungen",
                        are German films.
                            (beat)
                        Hitler wants you to serve as the
                        architect of a new agency supervising
                        motion picture production in the
                        Third Reich. 

                                 FRITZ
                        My father wanted me to be an architect.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Nazi's Fuhrer of film.

           Hearing it gives Fritz pause, he suddenly realizes the depth
           of trouble he is in.

                                 FRITZ
                        Again, you flatter me.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Not everyone is qualified for culture.

                                 FRITZ
                        I assure you that I take your offer
                        very seriously and intend to weigh
                        it carefully.

           There's no hiding Goebbels displeasure.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        It does not go unnoticed that a 
                        banner of party approval is raised
                        over your house.
                            (beat)
                        Do you consider yourself a Catholic?

           Goebbels, tapping into what haunts Fritz.  Mustering a curt
           riposte...
                                 FRITZ
                        I assure you, you won't find any
                        atheists in the trenches. 

                                 GOEBBELS
                        What is your creed?

                                 FRITZ
                        I consider myself a German patriot.
                            (beat)
                        And a Catholic.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        It comes through the mother, one's
                        being or not being a Jew.

                                 FRITZ
                        There was a conversion.  Catholic. 
                        There are records.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Priest for marriage, Rabbi for dying.

           Fritz accepts the comment as someone aware of their fate.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Irony of ironies, the man with the
                        monocle is virtually blind.
                            (beat)
                        Truth is you're only half.  We know
                        all about the 'flaw' you have. 
                        Setting aside your family, and
                        naturally along with them your own
                        Jewish heritage.
                            (beat)
                        This of course can be overlooked in
                        light of your service during the
                        Great War and contribution to Cinema. 
                        You see, we decide who is Jewish or
                        not, Herr Lang.

           Fritz realizes that he can no longer sleepwalk -- it's 1933
           and events will soon jar him awake.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        You have twenty-four hours.  Tic-toc. 
                        Oh, Herr Lang --

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes.

           Pointing to the empty chair --

                                 GOEBBELS
                        The empty chair in the room is always 
                        Germany's interest.
           A clock ticks somewhere in the room.  The hands on the clock
           ticking toward a fateful hour.

           EXT. MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA -- CONTINUOUS

           Fritz explodes through the doors and into the city square
           teeming with Berliners returning from factory jobs, lugging
           shopping, and pushing baby prams.

           INT. GOEBBELS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           SS Officer Krause enters and repossesses the two chairs.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Wait.

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                        Sir?

           Krause balancing the chairs in his hands like a scale. 
           Goebbels considers them as if trying to deliberate a question.

                                 GOEBBELS
                        He's going to run.

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                        Sir?

                                 GOEBBELS
                        Go after him.  I want Fritz Lang
                        arrested immediately.

           EXT. CITY SQUARE -- CONTINUOUS

           HIGH ANGLE of the Victory Column, Fritz crosses underneath
           Golden Lizzy's wings.

           An UNDERGROUND MOB MEMBER following Fritz, opens the hatch
           door on a cage and releases a PIGEON into the air --

           INT. UNDERGROUND MOB LAIR -- MOMENTS LATER

           -- the PIGEON flies into its designated stall.  Then a second
           later, another PIGEON flies into a stall. 

           Herr Ott draws the corresponding line on the map, tracking
           Fritz's movements.

                                 HERR OTT
                        Smoke him out.

           Underground mob members study the map, contemplating.
           INT. KITCHEN, FRITZ'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Frau Nussbaum chanting a Kiddush prayer, ceases the ritual
           at the sound of a key turning in the lock. 

           As Fritz enters --

                                 FRITZ
                        Did you find Joe May?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Jah, gave him letter.

                                 FRITZ
                        Good.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        What did they do to you, Mr. Fritz?

           Fritz looks at the poor man's Seder on the table and hand-
           embroidered Star of David on the sash around her neck.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Seder, day of the Exodus.

                                 FRITZ
                        I remember.  Go on, we drink together.

           Touched, Frau Nussbaum pours the wine into two glasses.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        To rid the nightmares.

                                 FRITZ
                            (toasting)
                        Day of the Exodus.

           Frau Nussbaum lowers her glass, intuitively knowing --

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        You're leaving.

                                 FRITZ
                        I could send for you in a few months. 
                        Come work for me once I'm settled.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Where?

                                 FRITZ
                        Paris.  London.  United States.  I
                        don't know.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        I could never leave my home.
                                 FRITZ
                        Black clouds are amassing over this
                        country.  Soon there will be no home.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        I'm German.  It's in my bones.

           Suddenly, POUNDING on the front door.  

                                 FRITZ
                        Promise me you'll get out.

           Frau Nussbaum blows out the candle.  HOLD ON the black smoke
           rising.

           Fritz races upstairs to the bedroom.  Unlocks the combination 
           wall safe and hurls the money inside into a suitcase.

           Frau Nussbaum shuffles into the room with Fritz's coat.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Hurry, there's no time.

           OUTSIDE

           SS Officer Krause POUNDS on the front door, signals for some
           stormtroopers to go around back. 

           INSIDE

           Fritz backs away from the door, realizing that he's
           surrounded.

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        The roof, hurry!

           Fritz races upstairs to the only exit left -- the bathroom,
           where L died.  Can barely bring himself to open the door.

           BATHROOM

           Fritz contemplates the spot where L lay in a pool of blood. 

           Goes to the slip-up window and hoists it open. 

           FRITZ'S STUDY

           Frau Nussbaum peers over Fritz's desk reading a handwritten
           letter bequeathing all his worldly possessions to her.

           ROOFTOP

           Fritz lifts himself onto the pitched roof.  He's on the edge,
           the only thing between him and an ugly drop is sheer
           determination.  The Ferris Wheel swirling behind him.
           Bringing us back to the opener...

           ...only now it's from the PERSPECTIVE OF HIS PURSUERS. 

           ROOFTOP

           From the ground, tucked in the shadows, Udo follows Fritz,
           leather suitcase in hand, maneuvering the steeply sloped
           shoal of chimneystacks.

           FRITZ'S HOUSE

           SS Officer Krause and the stormtroopers burst through the
           doors, systematically going room to room searching the house. 
           Frau Nussbaum enters from the kitchen.

                                 SS BOARDER GUARD
                        Where is he?

                                 FRAU NUSSBAUM
                        Shul, Day of the Exodus.

           The stormtroopers gather around Krause, confirming that Fritz
           is indeed gone.

           Krause tilts his head, looking at her --

                                 SS OFFICER KRAUSE
                            (to Stormtroopers)
                        I want a search of every train
                        station.

           INT. UNDERGROUND MOB LAIR -- CONTINUOUS

           Several pigeons in their stalls now, Herr Ott scrutinizes
           the map dotted with pins.

                                 HERR OTT
                            (to gang)
                        He's leaving Berlin. 

           The mob members grabbing their bats, knifes, brass knuckles,
           and pickaxes before heading out.

           EXT. CANAL -- LATER

           A fog enshrouded TRESTLE BRIDGE.

           BOOTS CLINK confidently on the iron bridgework.  The man in
           the herringbone Trenchcoat slides a KNIFE from his pocket. 
           Glinting light flickers off the serrated blade as it's
           unsheathed. 
           PAN-UP to reveal that it's Udo following Fritz.  He increases
           his gait, trying to close the distance. 

           INT. ALEX -- CONTINUOUS

           RING.  Desk phone.  Police Chief Commander, picks up.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                            (into phone)
                        Yeah. 

           Slams the phone down.

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                            (to squad)
                        Lang was just spotted buying one way
                        ticket to Paris. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Paris?

                                 POLICE CHIEF COMMANDER
                        Get the dogs.

           INT. PLATFORM, RAILWAY STATION -- LATER

           A MOB MEMBER opens up his birdcages as he spots Fritz going 
           through the turnstile, heading towards the northbound line. 

           A FLOCK OF CARRIER PIGEONS explode high overhead.

           The Flying Hamburger idles on the tracks.  Steam billows
           from its undercarriage, like a fire breathing dragon awaiting
           flight.  The 10-car chortling beast loads passengers.

           Suddenly WHISTLES AND FLASHLIGHTS proceed POLICEMEN led by 
           GERMAN SHEPHERDS invading the platform with authority.  SS
           Officer Krause and his stormtroopers converging with  Herr
           Ott and his cronies, everyone hunting Fritz.

           Grimacing faces.  Glaring eyeballs.  Arms extended into
           accusing fingers as they spot Fritz.

           But it's too late, Fritz blunders for the trains handrail,
           pulling himself inside the moving railcar and disappearing
           through the steam like a ghost. 

           The wheels grind and the train lurches forward on the rails
           then gains speed and rolls out of the station.
           INT. COMPARTMENT, FLYING HAMBURGER TRAIN -- LATER

           We hang on Fritz's haunted reflection in the traincar window. 
           The German countryside racing by.

                                 LOHMANN (O.S.)
                        Training for our 36' Olympics,   
                        Mr. Lang?

           Fritz turns and see Lohmann sitting across from him, cigar
           clenched in his teeth.

                                 FRITZ
                        I thought you were dead?

                                 LOHMANN
                        I don't want to wear out my welcome 
                        and I can understand why you would
                        think that, but trust me I have only
                        your interests in mind.

           Fritz looks at him carefully through the wafting smoke.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Didn't figure you for the running type.

                                 FRITZ
                        I was scared to death.  They betrayed
                        me, what was I supposed to do?

                                 LOHMANN
                        Whole country was betrayed, Fritz.

           Fritz turns back to the window.

                                 FRITZ
                        There's no god back there.  Not in
                        Germany.

                                 LOHMANN
                        It isn't the place of our youth.

                                 FRITZ
                        They'll get away with it.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Nobody gets away with anything,  
                        that's my observation.

           The car is plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a
           tunnel.  Fritz's BROWNING SERVICE REVOLVER is sitting between
           them when the light returns.
                                 LOHMANN
                        Look, I'm just asking you to meet me
                        halfway.  You can't refuse to admit
                        reality in hope that it will go away. 
                        It doesn't work like that.  We decide
                        who we take to the dark.

                                 FRITZ
                        What do you want?

                                 LOHMANN
                        You know the answer to that question.

           Car plunged into darkness as train bombs into the first of a
           quick chain of tunnels -- light returns.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Bullet's in the chamber.

                                 FRITZ
                        You want a confession?  Well you're
                        not going to get it.

                                 LOHMANN
                        I didn't come here to discuss the
                        terms.

           Fritz eyes the BROWNING.

                                 FRITZ
                        Simple shot to the head, isn't that
                        what they taught us in the great war.

                                 LOHMANN
                        Way I see it, it's just show business. 
                        Moment between ACTION and CUT,
                        anything can happen.

           Car is plunged into darkness as train bombs through another
           tunnel. 

           Sound of a GUNSHOT. 

           Light returns, the BROWNING is in Fritz's grip.

           PAN OVER to a single BULLETHOLE dead center in the leather
           upholstery where Lohmann was seated opposite.  

           WIDE SHOT of compartment, Fritz sitting alone.  

           Fritz's face plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a
           tunnel.
                                 A VOICE (V.O.)
                        The end of genius is sometimes
                        spectacular:  A bomb's explosion.  A
                        madman's gibbering.  An orgasmic
                        suicide before a sell-out audience. 
                        A Faustian pact with the Devil in
                        which nothing is left to chance. 
                        Sometimes, more often to be sure, 
                        it is lonely and most ordinary.
                "MY PRIVATE LIFE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FILMS" 

                                  Fritz Lang

           FRITZ LANG:

           Fritz Lang escaped Germany for the constraints of the
           Hollywood Studio System and was later stigmatized by the
           communist hysteria of the McCarthy era.  His visual style
           was simplified and he was forced to make American Studio
           pictures.  His worldview became increasingly bleak and
           pessimistic.  He died in 1976.  Extremely secretive about
           his personal life, he never spoke about his Jewish heritage
           or his wife's death in public interviews.  "M" is considered
           his masterpiece.

           THEA VON HARBOU:

           Thea Von Harbou became a Nazi in 1932.  She married Ayi
           Tendulkar.  After the war she was detained by British military
           and forced into unskilled labor.  She wrote 75 screenplays,
           including several with a Nazi stigma.  In 1954, one of her
           first films was shown at a retrospective in Berlin.  She was
           the guest of honor and slipped when leaving the theater. 
           She died as a result of that fall.  "M" is considered her
           masterpiece.

           PETER LORRE: 

           After the filming of "M" Peter Lorre was plagued with death
           threats and hostile public crowds.  Misunderstood and
           disillusioned, he went to the United States, where the roles
           he had to play were rarely suited to his talent.  He underwent
           many treatments for drug addiction but never fully recovered. 
           Frustration hounded him to an early death.  "M" made Lorre a
           star.

           JOSEPH GOEBBELS:

           Following Hitler's death, Goebbels served as Chancellor for
           one day.  He ordered the cyanide poisoning of his six children
           before he and his wife committed suicide.

           PAUL KURTEN "THE MONSTER OF DUSSELDORF":

           Paul Kurten confessed to 79 crimes.  He was beheaded six
           weeks after the premiere of "M".
