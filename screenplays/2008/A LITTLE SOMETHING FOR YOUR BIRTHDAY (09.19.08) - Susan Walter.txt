                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Whenever you’re ready.

           FADE IN ON:

           A 30-ish blonde, CINDY, trying to look comfortable on a floral 
           print couch.  She clears her throat, looks into the lens.

                                 CINDY
                        I guess it would have to be my 
                        sixteenth.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Can you start the sentence with my 
                        most memorable--

                                 CINDY
                        Right.  Sorry.  
                (beat)
                        My most memorable birthday would 
                        have to be my sixteenth.  My dad 
                        rented the ferris wheel on the Santa 
                        Monica Pier.  All my friends came.  
                        We rode it must’ve been a hundred 
                        times.  At the end of the night, 
                        Richie Brenner tells me his mom is 
                        out of town, he has the car, do I 
                        want a ride home?  I couldn’t 
                        believe my dad let me go with him.  
                        I lost my virginity in his basement. 
                (suddenly very worried)
                        Can I say that?  Maybe I shouldn’t 
                        say that... about doin’ it with 
                        Richie.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Do you regret it?

                                 CINDY
                        All the other girls were doing it 
                        since they were 14.  

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        So you wanted to.

                                 CINDY
                (sly smile)
                        It was my sweet 16.

           As she BLUSHES, we...

                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           A TITLE CARD bearing the number: “30”

                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           RING...  RING...

           INT. SENNA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           A rumpled faux-redhead, SENNA, reaches for the ringing phone, 
           presses it against her hair.

                                 SENNA
                        Hi Mom.  Thank you.  ...Yes, you’re 
                        the first.  ...Wouldn’t miss it for 
                        the world.  See you then.  

           As the phone slides from her ear--

                                 WILL 
                        Your mother always call at the 
                        crack of dawn?

                                 SENNA
                        Only on my birthday.

           Senna’s strapping, young bedmate, WILL, sits up.

                                 WILL
                        Today’s your birthday?  Shit.  Why 
                        didn’t you tell me?  

                                 SENNA
                        Didn’t I?

                                 WILL
                        I think I would have remembered. 
                        So...?  How old are you?

                                 SENNA

                                 WILL
                        No, seriously.

           Senna turns to look at him.  Raises an eyebrow.

                                 WILL
                        You are not 30!  

           She pats him on the head, gets out of bed. 
                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 WILL
                        Not that it matters.  Older women 
                        are hot!  You should take it as a 
                        compliment I thought you were 
                        younger.  Senna?

           As Senna disappears into the bathroom--

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. SENNA’S LOS FELIZ APARTMENT - DAY

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

                                 DARLA
                        Senna!

           DARLA, a wisp of a woman in culottes and combat boots, bangs 
           on Senna’s door.  As she reaches under the mat for the key--

           The door opens.  It’s Will.  He avoids Darla’s gaze as he 
           skulks past.  

           INSIDE THE APARTMENT

           It looks like a crime scene: dirty dishes, laundry 
           everywhere...  Darla’s (non-)reaction suggests it’s like this 
           all the time.  Senna smokes a cigarette as she makes coffee.  
           Before Darla can ask--

                                 SENNA
                        We broke up.  

                                 DARLA
                        You gave him three good weeks.

                                 SENNA
                        He talked too much.

                                 DARLA
                        Maybe you should get a dog.  
                (Senna bristles: A dog?)
                        They don’t invite their friends 
                        over to drink all your beer, borrow 
                        your credit cards-- 

                                 SENNA
                        I’m not getting a dog.

                                 DARLA
                        Sucks that you broke up on your 
                        birthday.  
                                 (MORE)
                                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 DARLA(cont'd)

                (then, upbeat)
                        I’ll throw you a party!  My hot 
                        friend from Harvard will make you 
                        forget all about jailbait--

                                 SENNA
                        The only thing I want less than a 
                        party is for you to set me up with 
                        one of your preppie friends.  
                (then, suddenly)
                        What is that?

           Senna spots a DIAMOND SOLITAIRE on Darla’s ring finger.  She 
           grabs her hand, looks at her accusingly.

                                 DARLA
                        I warned you we were talking about 
                        it.

                                 SENNA
                        What about our dream of becoming 
                        crinkly old spinsters together?  
                (off Darla’s grimace)
                        Okay, my dream.
                (then)
                        I’ve got to give it to him, it is a 
                        badass ring. 

                                 DARLA
                        You want to try it on?

                                 SENNA
                        No thanks.

                                 DARLA
                        Afraid you’re going to want one?

                                 SENNA
                        If we were in opposite world, 
                        maybe.  But I’m happy for you.  

                                 DARLA
                        No you’re not.

                                 SENNA
                        Yes, I am.  Unhappy for me, but 
                        happy for you.  You’re going to be 
                        a beautiful bride.

           She opens her arms.  They hug, then:

                                 SENNA
                        So when does the internment begin?
                                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 DARLA
                        Not for another year, at least.  
                        His parents are flying in from 
                        Sydney this weekend to meet me.  
                        We’re having dinner at Le Dome.  

                                 SENNA
                        Le Dome?  What are you wearing?  

                                 DARLA
                        What I always wear.

                                 SENNA
                        So they’re going to feed you 
                        through the window, then?

                                 DARLA
                        Is it that bad?

                                 SENNA
                        You’re coming to work with me.

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. VARIOUS LA LOCATIONS - DAY

           Senna and Darla disappear down the steps of the VERMONT 
           AVENUE SUBWAY STATION.  To the sound of the TRAIN 
           accelerating into the darkness...

           ARIEL VIEW of the route-- along SUNSET BLVD., past DODGER 
           STADIUM, through the towering DOWNTOWN LA high rises to:

           THE LA CLOTHING MART.  

           Walls of glass, soaring ceilings, hundreds of showrooms, 
           crammed together for one purpose: selling clothes.  Follow 
           the enormous, two-story escalator up to:

           A top tier SHOWROOM.  As Senna inspects a rack of monotone 
           separates-- 

                                 DARLA
                        Captain Kirk called.  He wants his 
                        uniforms back.

                                 SENNA
                        The samples are over there.

           She shoos Darla toward a rack of sample dresses.  As Darla 
           half-heartedly looks through them-- 
                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 RAMONE
                        I’m putting in my will that I want 
                        to be buried in these.  

           RAMONE, a handsome woman trapped in a man’s body, holds out a 
           pair of perfectly orange suede boots for Senna to see.  She 
           GASPS, snatches one out of his hand. 

                                 SENNA
                        OmiGod.  Have to have them.

                                 DARLA
                        They don’t exactly go with your 
                        Stepford wives-wear.

                                 RAMONE
                        Or your Stepford wife boss.

                                 SENNA
                        People should have crushed orange 
                        suede, and damn it, I’m going to 
                        bring it to them!  Vanessa will deal 
                        with it.  I’m taking the boots.  

                                 RAMONE
                        You’re the buyer.

           She joins Darla at the sample rack.  After a quick perusal:

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t like any of these for you.  
                        Let’s go to the alley.
                (then)
                        Messenger the boots...?

                                 RAMONE
                        You got it.

           Senna and Darla make for the door, exit onto--

           THE SIDEWALK

           As Senna pauses to light a cigarette:

                                 DARLA
                        She’s not going to like them.

                                 SENNA
                        Who?

                                 DARLA
                        Vanessa.  The boots...? 
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        If she doesn’t like them, we’ll 
                        send them back.  No biggie.

                                 DARLA
                        Just because you started as her 
                        salesgirl--

                                 SENNA
                (correcting her)
                        Stylist.

                                 DARLA
                        Stylist, doesn’t mean you have to 
                        work for her forever.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s a good job.

                                 DARLA
                        You’re bored out of your gourd!  
                        That’s why you smoke.

                                 SENNA
                        I smoke to keep from stuffing food 
                        in my mouth.

                                 DARLA
                        Another sign of boredom.

                                 SENNA
                        At least I’m coping.

           They arrive at colorful, chaotic SANTEE ALLEY.  Senna snubs 
           out her cigarette, then plunges into a stall, starts flipping 
           through dresses.  Darla holds up one of her discards:

                                 DARLA
                        What about this one?

                                 SENNA
                        Too Swiss Miss.  

           Darla gives it another look: she’s right!  Senna moves on to 
           another stall.  As Darla follows on her heels--

                                 DARLA
                        Look at you.  You’re a bloodhound, 
                        driven by unstoppable instincts.  
                (then, stopping short)
                        Oooh.  Stella McCartney!  

           She pulls a dress off a rack.  Senna takes one look--
                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Knock-off.  Look at the stitching.

                                 DARLA
                        I like it.

                                 SENNA
                        I guess it’s passable.  Put it on.

           She moves some racks to make an impromptu changing area.  As 
           Darla disappears from view--

                                 DARLA
                        They say that following your dreams 
                        paves the way for love.

                                 SENNA
                        I have no idea what that means.

                                 DARLA
                        It means you‘re not going to 
                        attract love into your life until 
                        you’re fulfilled by what you’re 
                        doing.   

           Darla comes out.  Senna pulls a PIN CUSHION from her bag, 
           starts making adjustments to the dress.

                                 DARLA
                        See?  This is what I’m talking about.  
                        You’re like the Picasso of clothes.  

                                 SENNA
                        I’m working my way up.  That’s what 
                        we do in the real world.  When you 
                        finish school, you’ll do it, too.

           A VENDOR approaches.

                                 VENDOR
                        If you want to stick pins in my 
                        dress you’re going to have to buy 
                        it.

           She sneaks a glance at Darla: do you want it?  Darla nods.

                                 SENNA
                        We’ll give you fifty bucks.

                                 VENDOR
                        It’s a Stella McCartney!
                (off Senna’s raised eyebrow)
                        Seventy-five.  
                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Sixty.

           Darla offers up the cash.  As the vendor takes it--

                                 DARLA
                        If you worked somewhere that sold  
                        clothes we like, you could loan me 
                        the real thing for free.

           INT. BEL AIR HOTEL - DAY

           Senna enters the posh hotel, is greeted by FRANCOIS, the 
           handsome, silver-haired MAITRE D’.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Senna!  Bon anniversaire!  You get 
                        more beautiful every year.  

                                 SENNA
                        And you get more forgiving.  
                        Speaking of forgiving--

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Your mother is on the terrace.

           Senna makes her way to the terrace, where CELIA (svelt, 
           stylish, impressively young-looking) is seated.  

                                 CELIA
                        Senna darling!  

           She stands and cups Senna’s face.  

                                 CELIA
                        My beautiful birthday girl.  Just 
                        look at you.  

           She pulls a large wrapped gift from under the table.

                                 CELIA
                        Happy birthday.  Open it!

           As Senna starts unwrapping the gift...
                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 CELIA
                        Francois asked me how old you are, 
                        can you believe it?

                                 SENNA
                        The nerve.

           A WAITER approaches.  To Senna:

                                 WAITER
                        Something to drink, Madmoiselle?

                                 CELIA
                (perfect French)
                        Un thé vert, la meme comme moi.

           As soon as the waiter moves off--

                                 CELIA
                        You didn’t tell him, I hope.

                                 SENNA
                        That I’m 30?

                                 CELIA
                        Senna!  It’s nobody’s business how 
                        old we are.

                                 SENNA
                        “We?”  I see.  How ‘bout we tell 
                        people you’re not my real mom.  
                        That I was adopted.  At 15.  When 
                        you were 25.

                                 CELIA
                        I’m all you’ve got.  You should be 
                        grateful I’m not letting myself go.  

           Senna opens the box, pulls out a dinner plate, a salad plate, 
           a teacup and saucer.

                                 SENNA
                        You got me a china place setting?

                                 CELIA
                        A woman your age should have decent 
                        china.  Foolish at this point to 
                        wait for your wedding.  Do you like 
                        the pattern?  I love it!  

                                 SENNA
                        It’s very... Bridal.
                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 CELIA
                        I did it to empower you.  So you’re 
                        not waiting for a man.  If I give 
                        you one every year, you’ll have a 
                        full set by the time you’re in your 
                        forties.  

           The tea arrives.  Celia reaches across the table, pours a 
           cup, pushes it toward Senna, willing her to drink.

                                 CELIA
                        So Darla tells me you’re dating a 
                        fetus.

                                 SENNA
                        When did you talk to Darla?

                                 CELIA
                        So it’s true.

                                 SENNA
                        Yes, I’m dating a fetus.  Hard to 
                        get too serious with his mother 
                        always tagging along.

                                 CELIA
                        Again with the sarcasm.  It’s no 
                        wonder you can’t meet a man.

                                 SENNA
                        I meet plenty of men, mother.

                                 CELIA
                        No, you meet boys.  Men have jobs.  
                        Homes.  Facial hair.  They take an 
                        interest in meeting your family-- 

                                 SENNA
                        I broke up with the fetus, okay?  
                        You never met him because it was 
                        never going anywhere.  

                                 CELIA
                        If it was never going anywhere, why 
                        did you go out with him?  

                                 SENNA
                        He was fun.

                                 CELIA
                        Fun?  Is that it?
                                             (cid:13)

                        He had a nice ass.

                                 CELIA
                        So that’s what you think you’re 
                        worthy of.  Fun and a nice ass.  

                                 SENNA
                        What else is there?

                                 CELIA
                        You got your father’s sense of 
                        humor, you know that?  Everything’s 
                        a joke, until it kills you.

           As Senna reaches for a piece of bread--  

                                 CELIA
                        Don’t eat the bread!  If you’re 
                        hungry, we’ll order.
                (to the waiter)
                        Monsieur!  Nous voudrons commander.

           As Senna tosses the bread back in the basket:

                                 CELIA
                        So I thought after lunch you could 
                        take me shopping.

                                 SENNA
                        Can we do it tomorrow?  I have a 
                        meeting with Vanessa.

                                 CELIA
                        What about?

                                 SENNA
                        She wants me to take over the 
                        business.  Then she’s going to 
                        shower me with money, an army of 
                        assistants and a new car.

                                 CELIA

                        It’s been six years you’ve been 
                        with Legacy.  When you first came 
                        to me, you were like a little 
                        sheep, so timid and eager to 
                        please.  I did my best to shepherd 
                        you, but I fear my little sheep has 
                        lost her way.

                                 SENNA

                        are boring.  But my customers aren’t 
                        flashy.  They’re practical.

                        I’m sorry.  I’ll tone it back.

                        I’m tired of constantly reigning 
                        you in, Senna.  I’ve hired a buyer 
                        whose sensibilities are in line 
                        with my customers’.  If you want to 
                        stay on as a salesgirl--

                                 SENNA
                        A salesgirl?

                                 VANESSA
                        Obviously it would mean a pay cut.  
                        I don’t imagine you’d want to do it 
                        indefinitely, just until you find 
                        another job.  I’ll give you a strong 
                        reference, of course...

LOS FELIZ RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Darla is waiting outside the trendy restaurant.  Senna 
           approaches, still looking shell-shocked.

                                 DARLA
                        There you are!  I’m sorry I didn’t 
                        call you back.  My battery died.

           She opens the door...

                                 DARLA
                        I ordered take out, I need your 
                        help carrying.

           ...Nudges Senna...

           INSIDE THE RESTAURANT 

           ...Leads her through the bar.  Senna stops short when she 
           sees-- 

                                 SENNA’S FRIENDS
                        Surprise!

           Twenty people, sitting at a large table, smiling up at her. 
           As Senna stands there, not knowing whether to laugh or cry...

           INT. LOS FELIZ RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Senna’s birthday party, as seen from a distance.

           Senna is crammed into the booth, surrounded by friends.  We 
           hear overlapping snippets of conversation:  

           A ROSY CHEEKED GIRL clutching a Margarita:

                                 ROSY CHEEKED GIRL
                        I’m totally dreading turning 30.

           Darla, showing off her ring:

                                 DARLA
                        He put it on my toothbrush!

           STEVE, her geek-chic, Aussie boyfriend, explaining how he 
           came to buy it:
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 STEVE
                        People make a big deal about size 
                        and clarity, but the most important 
                        consideration by far is cut.  Small 
                        inclusions don’t matter, it’s the 
                        cutting that affects how much the 
                        stone sparkles...

           And Senna, wishing she could crawl under the table.  After a 
           long, miserable beat, she squeezes her way out, sneaks out to--

           THE BAR

           The CHISELED BARTENDER approaches with a drink.

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Happy Birthday.

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks.

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Let me guess.  29 again?

                                 SENNA
                        Is that supposed to be funny?

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Didn’t know you were so touchy 
                        about it.

           Then, to someone standing behind her:

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Can I get you something, bud?

           Senna looks over her shoulder to see a well-groomed man in an 
           expensive suit, ADAM.  She takes him in: broad-shouldered, 
           conservatively dressed... 

                                 ADAM
                        Frozen strawberry Daiquiri, please.

           ...definitely not from around here.  

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        You serious?

           Adam nods: he’s serious.  As the bartender moves off to make 
           the drink, he catches Senna looking.

                        It’s the palm trees.  They make me 
                        feel like I’m on vacation. 

           He’s smiles at her.  He’s good-looking...

                                 ADAM
                        When you live at the beach and 
                        every day’s a beach day, where do 
                        you holiday?  Siberia?

           ...And kind of funny.  Ok, she’ll bite:

                                 SENNA
                        Is that where you’re from?

                                 ADAM
                        Close.  Boston.  Moved here a week 
                        ago.  I’m hoping to get discovered.

                                 SENNA
                        Rock star or actor?

                                 ADAM
                        Rock star, of course.  

                                 SENNA
                        What do you play?

                                 ADAM
                        Nothing yet.  It’s really more of a 
                        back-up plan.  

           She smiles.  She’s starting to like this guy.

                                 SENNA
                        So you came here for a job?

                                 ADAM
                        My firm opened an office downtown.  
                        I said I’d try it for a year.  I 
                        want to live in at least a half 
                        dozen cities before I pick one to 
                        settle down and start a family in.

                                 SENNA
                        How very thorough of you.  Are you 
                        auditioning wives, too?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m afraid I can’t tell you that.  
                        Excuse me one second.

                        Attractive redhead at the bar, asks 
                        good questions, two points.
                (then, looking up)
                        Sorry.

                        Here you go.  Strawberry Daiquiri.

           The bartender places the drink in front of Adam.  He tries to 
           get Senna’s attention.  No chance.

                                 SENNA
                        Where are you living?

                        Long way to come for a Daiquiri.

                                 ADAM
                        I was supposed to meet someone, an 
                        old friend from college, but I must 
                        have missed her.  She was having a 
                        birthday dinner for some friend of 
                        hers, Sierra, or Henna... some 
                        hippy, crunchy name you only hear in 
                        California. 

           Senna perks up: could it be...?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m actually kind of relieved I 
                        missed the party.

                                 SENNA
                        Why’s that?

                                 ADAM
                        My friend, Darla, kind of fancies 
                        herself as a matchmaker.  

           Yep.  Darla’s friend from Harvard.

                                 SENNA
                        She wanted to set you up with the 
                        hippy, henna girl?

                        I hate being set up, but she begged.

           Senna’s smile suddenly falters. 

                                 SENNA
                        Begged?  Why would she beg?

                                 ADAM
                        Apparently this girl has a hard 
                        time meeting the right sort of men.

                                 SENNA
                        What ‘sort of men’ does she meet?

                                 ADAM
                        Y’know...  Guys she could never be 
                        serious about.

                        So she’s a slut?

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t know about that, maybe just 
                        a little lost.
                (lost?)
                        Y’know, went to art school for a 
                        couple years, works some nowhere 
                        job in retail.  I’m not sure, I 
                        wasn’t really interested, I just 
                        came as a favor to my friend.

                                 SENNA
                        Because she begged.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, pretty much.

           As Senna suppresses the urge to clobber him--

                                 DARLA
                        You made it!

           A tipsy Darla bounds up to the bar, gives Adam a hug.

                                 ADAM
                        You’re here!  I looked for you--

                                 DARLA
                        I’m small.  You’ve got to look 
                        hard.  I see you met Senna.

           The color drains from Adam’s face as he realizes...
                                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Not officially.

                                 DARLA
                        Allow me.  Adam, this is Senna, my 
                        BFF.  Senna, meet Adam from Boston.  
                        We went to Harvard together.  He’s 
                        a lawyer but has other attractive 
                        qualities.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m going home.

                                 DARLA
                        You can’t leave now--

           Senna stands, looks at Adam...

                                 SENNA
                        It was four years at San Francisco 
                        Art Institute, and a Masters from 
                        Cal State.  Oh, and I got fired 
                        from the nowhere job, so now I’m an 
                        unemployed-hippy-slut.

           ...Then makes for the door.  

           OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT

           Senna’s hands tremble as she lights a cigarette.  

                                 DARLA
                        Senna?

                                 SENNA
                        I told you no set-ups!  

                                 DARLA
                        I’m sorry.
                (then)
                        Did you really get fired?

                                 SENNA
                        No, I lied. 

                                 DARLA
                        Did she say why?

                                 SENNA
                        I suck at my job, that’s why.
                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 DARLA
                        You did not suck at that job.  You 
                        just outgrew it.  I’m glad you got 
                        fired.  Now you can do whatever you 
                        want.

                                 SENNA
                        Like what?

                                 DARLA
                        Your degree’s in design--

                                 SENNA
                        It takes forever to break through 
                        as a designer.  I’m not 29 anymore.

                                 DARLA
                        Ok Miss negative pants, you’re 
                        cruisin’ for a pep talk.

                                 SENNA
                        No pep talks.

                                 DARLA
                (singing a la R. Kelly)
                        I believe you can fly...  I believe 
                        you can touch the sky...

                                 SENNA
                        I’m going home.

                                 DARLA
                        Ok, ok, I’ll stop.  I’ll walk with 
                        you.  Just let me get my purse. 

           As Darla prances back inside, Senna looks up to see--

           Adam, handing his ticket to a valet.  He catches her staring.

                                 ADAM
                        Senna.  I am so sorry.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s ok.

                                 ADAM
                        Darla didn’t beg.  I wanted to come.  
                        I just didn’t want you to think I 
                        was the kind of guy who needed to be 
                        set-up.  I was trying to impress you 
                        and instead I insulted you.  I’m 
                        sorry.  I would have liked a chance 
                        to get to know you.
                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           As Senna finds herself uncharacteristically speechless--

                                 DARLA
                        Bartender Brad’s pouring flaming 
                        fuzzy navels, on the house!

           Darla disappears back inside.  The valet is holding Adam’s car 
           door open.  Adam smiles wistfully at her...

                                 ADAM
                        Happy Birthday.

           He gets in his car.  As Senna watches him drive off, we...

                                   FADE OUT.

           FADE IN ON:

           The CHISELED BARTENDER BOY on a stool.

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        My most memorable birthday?  Yeah, 
                        okay.  My most memorable birthday 
                        was my 21st.  I had it bad for this 
                        friend of my little sister’s.  She 
                        was only eighteen but she was--
                (pantomimes breasts)
                        Y’know... mature.  

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        One second, sorry.  

           The DIRECTOR enters the frame.  It’s DARLA.  

                                 DARLA
                        I just want to move the mic back--

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Am I talking too loud?

                                 DARLA
                        No, no.  You’re perfect.  So it’s 
                        your 21st birthday...

           She moves back OUT OF FRAME.

                                 CHISELED BARTENDER
                        Right.  And my sister brings this 
                        chick over to my apartment, and I’m 
                        thinkin’ wow, happy birthday to me.  
                        My sister takes off, me and... God I 
                        can’t even remember her name...

                        Amanda, Mandy, something like that.  
                        Anyway the two of us start drinking 
                        tequila shots.  Next thing I know 
                        she’s passed out on my toilet, 
                        covered in vomit.  I had to call my 
                        sister at like 2 in the morning.  It 
                        was embarrassing as hell.  That’s 
                        definitely my most memorable 
                        birthday.

           The bartender boy smiles sheepishly, and we...

           TITLE CARD: “31”

                                  DISSOLVE TO:

                                 DARLA 
                        Senna?  SENNA!?

           INT. DARLA’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Senna sleeps on a pull out bed in Darla’s tiny spare room.  
           There are UNOPENED WEDDING PRESENTS everywhere. 

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Senna, wake up!

           Senna wakes to see Darla standing over her holding the phone. 

                                 SENNA
                (into the phone)
                        Hello?  Hi mom.  Yes, you’re the 
                        first.  Of course I’m coming.  Bye-
                        bye.

           The phone droops from Senna’s arm.  The screen goes-- 

                                    BLACK.  

           In the darkness:

           Pots CLANG!  Cupboards SLAM!  

           FADE IN ON:

           INT. DARLA’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Senna wakes with a start.  She rolls out of bed, squeezes 
           past the GIFTS into the kitchen to see--
                                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Oh!  Sorry!

                                 STEVE
                        Shit, sorry!

           Steve’s making pancakes.  In the nude.  As he covers his 
           privates with a frying pan--

           Darla walks out of the bedroom, wearing yoga clothes.  She 
           stops short when she sees them.

                                 STEVE
                        I forgot she was staying with you. 

           As he scurries off--

                                 SENNA
                        I told you I’d be imposing--

                                 DARLA
                        You know his penis looks like a 
                        hairy mushroom.  Like every other 
                        guy’s.  Big wow.

                                 SENNA
                        Still...

                                 DARLA
                        Most of my stuff’s already at his 
                        place, we just crashed here so I 
                        could go to yoga.  Wanna come?

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks, but I gotta go peddle my 
                        wares.

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - MONTAGE

           Senna pulls a dozen PURSES out of the storage space in 
           Darla’s garage, tosses them in the back of her aging Subaru.

           She drives west, to the glittering, tree-lined streets of 
           Beverly Hills.  She parks on swanky BEVERLY DRIVE, heads into-- 

           A BOUTIQUE

           Shakes the MANAGER’s hand, shows off her purse, gives her a 
           product card, leaves with a smile.  As the manager tosses the 
           one-sheet into the trash--
                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           Senna hits another store, then another.  Her stack of one-
           sheets dwindles as she pounds the pavement: ROBERTSON BLVD., 
           FRED SEGAL on Melrose, LARCHMONT VILLAGE, swinging SILVERLAKE.

           Back in the car, she checks her watch, heads downtown to...

           INT. LA CLOTHING MART - SHOWROOM - DAY

           Ramone’s showroom, where her purses are on display.  As she 
           adds two new ones to the collection:

                                 SENNA
                        They look so lonely, sitting there.  

                                 RAMONE
                        They have each other.

                                 SENNA
                        How come Georgio gets a whole wall 
                        and mine are all crammed in the 
                        corner?
                (then)
                        Don’t answer that.

                                 RAMONE
                        Your bags are gorgeous.  Buyers have 
                        no imagination.  The ones that do--

                                 SENNA
                        Still hurts.

                                 RAMONE
                        Hey!  She did you a favor.  You’re 
                        living your dream.

                                 SENNA
                        Broke and on my best friend’s 
                        couch, just how I imagined it.

           Just then, a striking WOMAN in big sunglasses, LISA KLINE, 
           walks in, entourage in tow.  She nods to Ramone.

                                 SENNA
                        Who’s that?

                                 RAMONE
                        Lisa Kline.

                                 SENNA
                        The Lisa Kline?  Of Lisa Kline on 
                        Robertson?
           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 RAMONE
                        And Beverly Drive, and Malibu.

                                 SENNA
                        Did you show her my purses?

                                 RAMONE
                        She’s only looking for coats.  I 
                        have to go tell her I don’t have 
                        any.  This is L.A., you want coats, 
                        go to New York!

                                 SENNA
                (re: her bag)
                        She’s carrying a Birkin.

                                 RAMONE
                        If you had three stores, you’d have 
                        a Birkin, too.
                (then)
                        Shouldn’t you be at lunch?

                                 SENNA
                (looking at his watch)
                        Oh shit!  

           And as she bolts out the door--

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. BEL AIR HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

           Celia sits at her primo table by the window, sipping tea.  
           She catches a waiter looking at her.

                                 CELIA
                        She’ll be here any minute.

           He moves off.  Celia pulls a wilted flower from the bouquet, 
           adjusts Senna’s napkin, polishes her wine glass.  Finally--

           Senna enters.  Celia WAVES, then vigorously points to her 
           watch (you’re late!).  As Senna starts toward her--

           She spies Francois chatting with a customer.  A mischievous 
           grin leaks out onto her face.   As she passes the dapper 
           Maitre d’, she whispers in his ear.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m 31.

           HOLD ON Francois as he REACTS, then REJOIN--
                                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)           Senna, as she kisses her mother hello.

                                 CELIA
                        What did you say to Francois?

                                 SENNA
                        When?

                                 CELIA
                        Just now.  You whispered something 
                        in his ear.

                                 SENNA
                        Just hello.

                                 CELIA
                        That waiter has been hovering over 
                        me for half an hour.

                                 SENNA
                        Sorry.  I was at the Mart. 

                                 CELIA
                        The Mart!?  You should be going 
                        straight to the boutique owners.

                                 SENNA
                        I do.  They have a million wanna-be 
                        designers knocking on their doors.

                                 CELIA
                        Wanna-be?  Is that what you think 
                        you are, a wanna-be?  You know why 
                        I named you Senna?  Your father 
                        didn’t want to, said it was too 
                        weird--
                (imitating him)
                        ‘That’s not a name!  Where’d you 
                        even get it?’  I made it up.  So 
                        the world will know you’re one of a 
                        kind.  Don’t forget that!

           Celia pulls out a small, wrapped gift out of her purse.

                                 SENNA
                        Looks a little small for a place 
                        setting.

                                 CELIA
                        I’m not giving you china anymore.

                        Because it was a lie.  

           She thrusts the gift on Senna.  Senna unwraps it.  Inside the 
           box: a delicate PENDANT, an antique heart with diamonds. 

                                 CELIA
                        Your father gave it to me on our 
                        wedding day.  

                                 SENNA
                        I can’t take Dad’s gift to you--

                                 CELIA
                        It brought me ten years of the best 
                        love a woman could know!  

           Senna obediently puts on the necklace.

                                 SENNA
                        How does it look?

                                 CELIA
                        You won’t like it.  But nothing 
                        else seems to be working.  Although 
                        I don’t imagine you’re going to 
                        meet a man living on Darla’s couch.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s only until I get my first big 
                        order.

                                 CELIA
                        What are you going to do after she 
                        gets married?  They’re not going to 
                        keep a second apartment just for you.

                                 SENNA
                        I know.

                                 CELIA
                        You can always move back in with me.

           As Senna’s eyes flash with terror--

           Senna waits outside Vanessa’s closed office door.  A SALESGIRL 
           stares at her from behind the register.  Senna meets her gaze, 
           she looks away.  An endless beat goes by.  Finally:

                        She says you can go in.

           Senna steps into--

           VANESSA’S OFFICE.  

                                 VANESSA
                        Senna!  What a surprise.  

                                 SENNA
                        Thank you for seeing me.

                                 VANESSA
                        Don’t be silly.  I hear you’re 
                        designing now.
                (re: her handbag)
                        Is that one of yours?

                                 SENNA
                        Yes.

                                 VANESSA
                        Festive.
                (then)
                        So how’s it going? 

                                 SENNA
                        I’m just getting off the ground.  
                        You know how hard it is for new 
                        designers.

                                 VANESSA
                        What can I do for you, Senna?

                                 SENNA
                        I know my purses aren’t for 
                        Legacy...

           Senna gives her a chance to disagree.  She doesn’t.

                                 SENNA
                        While I’m getting the business of 
                        the ground, I was hoping to find 
                        some part time work.  As a 
                        salesgirl.  Just to make ends meet.

                                 VANESSA
                        You know I care about you, Senna.  
                        I have a million girls clamoring to 
                        work for me.  You don’t want to be 
                        a salesgirl.

                        And I don’t want someone whose

                        sorry.

           Senna tosses her purse into her trunk and SLAMS the door.  
           The CIGARETTES come out.  As she inhales fiercely...

           INT. DARLA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Candles flicker, balloons dance on the ceiling.  Darla is 
           rearranging the furniture as Senna enters looking haggard.

                                 DARLA
                        Happy, happy!

                        Drink.

           And as she beelines for the bar--

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. DARLA’S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The party is in full swing.  Steve, the resident expert, 
           mixes colorful martinis for a cluster of friends: 

                                 STEVE
                        No, no, I was just reading about 
                        this.  People think Vodka comes 
                        from potatoes, but actually it can 
                        be made from any fermentable 
                        material-- soy, wheat, beets, even 
                        by-products of oil refining or wood 
                        pulp processing... 

           Darla interrupts:

                                 DARLA
                        Have you seen Senna?

           Steve points, Darla looks.  Senna sees her, waves, holds up 
           her empty glass: can you bring me another?

           Darla scoops a drink off the bar, turns back around to see--
                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Place looks great.

           Adam.  With CINDY, the 30-something with the memorable sweet 
           16th, on his arm.  Darla looks at her, then at Adam: Who is 
           this person, and why did you bring her to my party?

                                 ADAM
                        This is Cindy.  We’re working on a 
                        case together.

                                 CINDY
                        Our buildings face each other 
                        downtown.

                                 DARLA
                        Hello Cindy.  Oooh, I think I smell 
                        my brownies.  Cindy, do you think 
                        you could give me a hand?

                                 CINDY
                        Of course!

                                 DARLA
                (then, to Adam)
                        Take this to Senna.  

           She hands Adam the drink.  As she whisks Cindy away--

           Adam looks over at Senna, collapsed on the sofa, legs spread 
           eagle, hair fanned out on the pillow.   As he approaches he 
           sees several EMPTY GLASSES in front of her: she’s had a few. 

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  

                                 SENNA
                        Hey yourself.  Is that for me?

           Their fingers touch as he hands her the drink.  She downs it 
           in one gulp, smiles up at him.  Even drunk, she’s adorable.  

                                 ADAM
                        I’m Adam.

                                 SENNA
                        The rockstar.  I remember.  So?  
                        You get discovered yet?  

                                 ADAM
                        Sadly, I don’t think it’s going to 
                        happen for me.

                        Not with that attitude.

                                 ADAM
                        Truth is, I have zero musical 
                        talent.  No, less than zero.  I 
                        have negative musical talent.   
                (negative talent???)
                        I make other people worse.  I’m not 
                        exaggerating.  When I was in second 
                        grade, my music teacher, Mr. Ponte, 
                        told me that some people were meant 
                        to just mouth the words.  

                                 SENNA
                        Your second grade music teacher 
                        told you to lip sync?  

                                 ADAM
                        When I told my mother she went 
                        ballistic.  And then, strangely, Mr. 
                        Ponte just disappeared.

                                 SENNA
                        What a coincidence.

                                 ADAM
                        That’s what she told the police.
                (then)
                        You going to the wedding?

                        Maid of honor.

                                 ADAM
                        I wanted to be Maid of Honor.

                                 SENNA
                        You didn’t tell your mother...?

                                 ADAM
                (smiling, charmed)
                        Lucky for you.

                                 SENNA
                        How are the auditions going?  For 
                        the wife?

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, the wife.  Yes.  No clear front 
                        runner yet.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Good to know.  I see you got some 
                        decent sportswear.  Elie Tahari?
                (off his blank look)
                        Your sweater.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh.  I don’t know.  It was a gift 
                        from a client...

           Senna reaches under his sweater to expose the label.

                                 ADAM
                (reading it)
                        Elie Tahari.

                                 SENNA
                        MFA, Cal Arts.

           Senna tries to retract her hand from inside the sweater.  Her 
           ring gets caught.   

                                 SENNA
                        Ooop.  Ring’s caught.

           As she reaches the other hand in to untangle it--

                                 CINDY
                        Hi.

           Cindy appears.  Just in time to see Senna with her hands up 
           Adam’s sweater.  

                                 ADAM
                        Hey!  Cindy.  This is Senna.  

                                 CINDY
                        Happy Birthday.  I’m Cindy.

                                 SENNA
                        Hello, Cindy.  
                (re: the drink in her hand)
                        Is that for me?

                                 CINDY
                (it wasn’t but...)
                        Oh.  Sure.  
                (then)
                        Great party.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s all Darla.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 CINDY
                        That Darla is amazing.  I can’t 
                        imagine going back to school now.  
                        Studying for the bar nearly killed 
                        me! 

                                 SENNA
                        You’re a lawyer, too?

                                 CINDY
                        Yes.  But not at the same firm as 
                        Adam.  We met through mutual 
                        friends.  Also lawyers.  Our 
                        buildings face each other downtown.

           Senna looks at Adam:  Is this chick for real?  Just then--

           The lights go OFF.  A moment later--

                                 DARLA
                        HAPPY BIIIRRRTH-DAY TO YOU...

           Darla emerges with a cake.  The party guests all start 
           singing.  All except Adam.  He’s lip syncing.  Senna puts her 
           hand to her ear: Can’t hear you.  He shakes his head, no way.

                                 EVERYBODY EXCEPT ADAM
                        Happy Biiiirrrth-day, to yooouuuu!

           Darla stops in front of Senna.

                                 DARLA
                        Make a wish!

           Senna looks at Adam, Cindy hanging on his arm.  She sucks in 
           her breath, closes her eyes, and BLOWS out the candles.  

           The room erupts in applause.  Darla picks up the cake, 
           beckons to Cindy.

                                 DARLA
                        Cindy!  Can you come help me cut 
                        the cake?

                                 CINDY
                        Oh.  Sure.

           Reluctantly, Cindy lets go of Adam‘s arm.  As she follows 
           Darla into the kitchen--

           Steve comes by with a tray of shooters.  As Senna reaches:
                                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        You sure you should be having that?

                                 SENNA
                        It’s my birthday.  Le chaim!

           She foists a shooter on him.  They drink.  Senna goes to set 
           down the glass.  Misses the tray.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa!  Let me help you.

           He guides her arm toward the tray.  As he stands there, 
           holding her arm...

                                 ADAM
                        Maybe you should sit down.

                                 SENNA
                        Or you could just take me to bed.

           She smiles seductively at him.  

                                 ADAM
                        You do know I came with somebody.

                                 SENNA
                        If we hurry, she won’t see.  

           As she starts walking backwards, beckoning to him to follow--  

                                 ADAM
                        Watch out!

           THUMP!  She bits her head on a low-hanging chandelier.  As 
           her knees crumple--

                                 ADAM
                        Gotcha.

           He catches her, spins her around, eases her toward--

           THE BEDROOM.  Stops in the doorway.  Not going in.

                                 SENNA
                        Aren’t you coming?
                (he shakes his head no)
                        I’ll make it worth your while.

           In a mock STRIP TEASE, she flings off her sweater, spins it 
           in the air.  As she shimmies toward the bed--
                                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        OOOOOF!

           She trips on a wedding gift, THUMPS to the floor.

                                 ADAM
                        Senna?

           She doesn’t move.  He hurries over to her, nudges her gently.

                                 ADAM
                        Senna?  Are you okay?

                                 SENNA
                        Mmmmnnnnff.

           Her eyelids flutter.  Her mouth floats open.  She’s out.

           He looks down at her a long beat, then grabs a pillow from the 
           bed, lays it under her head.  

           Watching him, staring down at her, we wonder what he’s 
           thinking as we...

                                   FADE OUT.

           FADE IN ON:

                                 VANESSA
                        So these interviews are for your 
                        Masters thesis?

           Vanessa, in a highback chair.  Darla is behind her, adjusting 
           a lamp.

                                 DARLA
                        In Social Work, yes.  So I can 
                        become a therapist.

                                 VANESSA
                        And listen to people complain for a 
                        living?  You must be a Saint.

           Darla moves out of frame.  A KEY LIGHT goes on.  Vanessa sits 
           up a little straighter.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Whenever you’re ready.

                        My friend Charlene threw me a 
                        surprise party.  She told my husband 
                        to tell me he was taking me out for 
                        dinner, just the two of us.  The 
                        morning of, he says he’ll pick me up 
                        at 8.  At a quarter to 9, he calls 
                        me from work, tells me he’s stuck 
                        with a client, can I meet him at the 
                        restaurant?  I tell him I don’t want 
                        to go by myself, he says you have to 
                        go, Charlene arranged for all your 
                        friends to be there.  It’s supposed 
                        to be a surprise.  So I go.  My 
                        friends shout surprise, I burst out 
                        crying.  That was the beginning of 
                        the end.  He was supposed to pick up 
                        the cake on his way.  Of course he 
                        forgot.  So we didn’t have one.  
                        We’re divorced now.  
                (bitter)
                        But I’m not bitter.  I have my 
                        career.  It’s for the best.

           She smiles unconvincingly, and we...

           Darla’s old apartment, now occupied by Senna.  Find her--

           As she runs for the ringing phone, in a towel.  Her Eiffel 
           Tower ashtray, usually overflowing with butts, is now filled 
           with coins-- a sure sign she hasn’t been smoking.

                                 SENNA
                        Hello!  Hi mom!  Yes, you’re the 
                        first.  ...Of course I’ll be there!  
                        All-righty, see you then.

           As she hangs up and prances off...

SENNA SILVER LAKE BOUTIQUE - MORNING

           Senna paints the moulding of a tiny retail space in funky-
           edgy Sliverlake as--

                                 DARLA
                        I can’t believe you’re doing all 
                        this yourself.

           Darla walks through the open front door, two coffees in hand. 

                                 SENNA
                        Believe it, baby.  

           She takes the coffee from Darla.  They toast.

                                 DARLA
                        Drink your coffee.  I’ll paint for 
                        a bit.  Where’s the primer?
                (off Senna’s blank look)
                        You’re not putting regular paint on 
                        the bare wood, are you?

                                 SENNA
                        I was planning on doing two coats.

                                 DARLA
                        You still need to prime.
                (re: the paint)
                        What is all of this? 

                                 SENNA
                        Paint.

                                 DARLA
                        High gloss acrylic is for bathrooms 
                        and indoor pools.  

                                 SENNA
                        The guy said it was durable.

                                 DARLA
                        It’s durable all right.  If this 
                        stuff spills on your concrete floor 
                        you’ll never get it out.

           As Senna scans the floor to look for drips-- 

                                 SENNA
                        Ahhh!  Shit!

As she scrambles to mop it 
           up--

                                 DARLA
                        That’s going to leave a mark.

                                 SENNA
                        What do I do?

                                 DARLA
                        I’ll tell you what you’re not going 
                        to do.  Paint!  Come on, I’ll go 
                        with you to get some turpentine.  
                        And exchange the paint.

           They each grab some paint, head out to--

           THE ALLEY

           Senna pops the trunk of her aging Suburu.  It’s full of clothes.  

                                 SENNA
                        Oh shit.  

                                 DARLA
                        We can take my car--

                                 SENNA
                        No, I was supposed to return these 
                        first thing this morning.  They’re 
                        not mine.  I accidentally took 
                        someone else’s order.
                (off Darla’s raised eyebrow)
                        It happens!

                                 DARLA
                        Go.  I’ll exchange the paint.  
                        Wait!  Where’s the key?  
                (for what?)
                        To lock the store.

                                 SENNA
                        I never lock it.  
                (again, the eyebrow)
                        It’s not like there’s anything to 
                        steal.

           Darla wants to reprimand her, bites her tongue.

           Senna stumbles into a store carrying armfuls of clothes.  

                                 SENNA
                        Sorry I’m late.  Whoa!

           The clothes start slipping from her grasp.  GEORGIA, the 
           vendor, jumps up to catch them.

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks!  That should be all of them.  
                (off Georgia’s look)
                        No, of course that’s all of them.  
                        Definitely.

           A heliotrope CASHMERE COAT catches her eye.   

                                 SENNA
                        OmiGod!  This is my mom’s color 
                        exactly.  Her china, her curtains, 
                        her lipstick.  She would die.

                                 GEORGIA
                        It’s $150.  That’s cost.

                                 SENNA
                        Can I put it on my P.O.?

                        there.  The balance is $2200.  
                        $2350 with the coat.

                                 SENNA
                        You’re just going to charge me for 
                        the coat, right?

                        enough credit to pay for everything 
                        up front.  I’ll lose the store!

                        Then I guess you’ll have to get it 
                        somewhere.

           INT. BEL AIR HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

           Senna sits across from Celia in the courtyard, opening a 
           birthday card.  A GIFT CERTIFICATE wafts out.  Upon seeing it:

                                 SENNA
                        You got me a manicure. 

                                 CELIA
                        Twelve manicures.  One a month for 
                        a year.  I know you’re on a budget, 
                        so I included the tip.  

                                 SENNA
                        I got something for you, too.  

           Senna hands Celia a large SHOPPING BAG.  Reluctantly, Celia 
           opens it.  As soon as she sees the coat--

                                 CELIA
                        Tsk!  Senna! 

                                 SENNA
                        When I saw the color I knew I had 
                        to get it for you.

                                 CELIA
                        It’s beautiful.  How much was it, 
                        I’ll pay you back.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s a present!

                                 CELIA
                        You’re a single woman.  You can’t

                        Senna!  I told him you’d be calling!

                                 SENNA
                        I know.  I just... I can’t really 
                        afford an accountant right now.

                                 CELIA
                        Accounting is not the place to 
                        skimp.  You make one little mistake 
                        the IRS will be all over you.  

                                 SENNA
                        I’d like to hire an accountant, but 
                        I still have to pay for the clothes.

                                 CELIA
                        You screw up your books you could 
                        wind up in jail!  I knew this was 
                        too much for you to take on by 
                        yourself.  There’s only one thing 
                        to do: find you a partner. 

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t need a partner.  Just a 
                        little more cash.

                                 CELIA
                        I have the perfect person!  
                (dramatic pause, then)
                        Me.

           Senna opens her mouth to speak.  Nothing comes out.

                                 CELIA
                        It’s perfect.  You do the creative 
                        side, I’ll keep the books, do the 
                        payroll, I’m great with customers.  
                        You said you needed more cash...

                                 SENNA
                        I was hoping you could just loan me 
                        the money.

                                 CELIA
                        What fun is that!?  If I buy into 
                        the business, we can build it 
                        together!  We’ll probably need a 
                        lawyer to iron out the logistics...

                        Ooh!  I know just the guy!  I hope 
                        I still have his number...

           As Celia rummages through her purse--  

           HOLD ON Senna, looking mortified.

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA MELROSE BOUTIQUE - DAY

           Senna stands in the doorway of boutique, which Darla has 
           sanded and primed like a pro.  Upon seeing her:

                                 DARLA
                        She said no?

                                 SENNA
                        Worse.  She wants to be my partner.  
                        Why are you smiling?

                                 DARLA
                        I’m just imagining it.

                                 SENNA
                        This isn’t funny.  If this store 
                        fails I’ll have to move in with 
                        her.  Forever!

           She slumps back against the wall.  Suddenly realizes...

                                 SENNA
                        That’s wet paint, isn’t it.

                                 DARLA
                        Yep.

           Darla extends a hand, peels her off the wall.  The back of 
           her shirt is covered with paint.

                                 SENNA
                        Excuse me.  I’m just going to go to 
                        the bathroom and kill myself.

           Senna goes into-- 

           THE BATHROOM

           Looks at herself in the mirror.

                                 SENNA
                        You are so fucked.
                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           As she start unbuttoning her blouse, Darla peeks her head in.

                                 DARLA
                        How much do you need?
                (off Senna’s baffled look)
                        Money.  How much money?

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t know.  Like ten grand.

                                 DARLA
                (into her cell phone)
                        Twenty grand.

                                 SENNA
                        Who are you talking to?

                                 DARLA
                        She’ll come right now!

                                 SENNA
                        Where am I going?

                                 DARLA
                        You remember my friend Adam...?

                                 SENNA
                        Oh no.  Not going there.  I passed 
                        out stripping for him, remember?

                                 DARLA
                        You want to be tethered to your mom 
                        for eternity?

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN LAW FIRM - DAY

           Senna approaches the RECEPTIONIST at the posh downtown firm. 

                                 SENNA
                        Senna Berges for Adam Pierce?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Last door on the right. 

           As Senna starts down the hall, we see she’s got a SKUNK STRIPE 
           of white paint down the back of her hair, her shirt and on her 
           butt.  

           She reaches ADAM’S OFFICE.  He’s on the phone, waves her in.
                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, listen, someone just walked 
                        in my office...  Thanks.
                (hanging up)
                        Hi.

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks for seeing me.

           She offers her hand.  He shakes it.  An awkward beat, then:

                                 ADAM
                        Have a seat.

                                 SENNA
                        I can’t.  I mean I could but...

           She turns to show him her butt. 

                                 SENNA
                        It’s still a little tacky.

                                 ADAM
                        Right.  
                (then)
                        Are those your loan docs?

           She hands him a folder.  He flips through it with surprising 
           quickness.

                                 ADAM
                        We should be able to get them to 
                        convert this to an 80% value loan, 
                        then get you a second for the extra 
                        money you need.  Technically, 
                        you’ll be carrying two loans, but 
                        you’ll qualify for a better 
                        interest rate, get more cash for 
                        the same monthly payment.  

                                 SENNA
                        How much cash?

                                 ADAM
                        Enough to keep you and your mom 
                        from killing each other. 

                                 SENNA
                        Your mom’s the killer, not mine.

                                 ADAM
                        Alleged killer.

                        I should have everything ready by 
                        Friday.  I’ll give you a call.

                                 SENNA
                        That’s it?

                                 ADAM
                        That’s it.

           He walks her to the door, opens it for her.

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks for bailing me out.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, well, I wasn’t going to, but 
                        Darla begged. 

           On that, she smiles.  Then, against her better judgement:

                                 SENNA
                        Darla and Steve are taking me to 
                        Stella’s for dinner tonight, I’d 
                        love it if you’d come.  You can 
                        bring Sandy.

                                 ADAM
                        Cindy.

                                 SENNA
                        Right.  Sorry.  Cindy.

                        It’s ok, we broke up.  Turns out it 
                        wasn’t enough that our buildings 
                        faced each other.  
                (then)
                        What time?  For dinner?

                                 SENNA
                        8:00. 

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll look forward to it.

           INT. VERMONT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Senna, Adam, Darla and Steve drink wine at a table for four.
                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 STEVE
                (raising his glass)
                        To the birthday girl.  Our future 
                        queen of retail!

                                 SENNA
                        No, to you guys.  Who collectively 
                        saved my ass.  I don’t deserve you.

                                 DARLA
                        We’ll take our ten percent at the 
                        register.

                                 SENNA
                        Fair enough.

           As Senna drinks, her diamond pendant shimmers in the 
           candlelight, catching Darla’s eye.

                                 DARLA
                        I see you’re wearing the magic love 
                        karma necklace.

                                 SENNA
                        My mom gave it to me for my 
                        birthday last year.  I try to 
                        remember to wear it when I see her.

                                 DARLA
                        It’s endowed with special powers to 
                        help her find love.  

                                 SENNA
                        I was a little afraid to take it.  
                        I mean, what if it doesn’t work?  
                        Then she’ll be even more 
                        disappointed in me.  If that’s 
                        possible.

                                 DARLA
                        Your soulmate is out there.  You’ll 
                        find him when the time is right.

                                 ADAM
                        Soulmate?  Aren’t we a little old 
                        to believe in soulmates? 

                                 DARLA
                        You’re only skeptical because you 
                        haven’t found yours yet.

                        I’m skeptical because it’s 
                        statistically ridiculous.  There are 
                        billions of people in the world!  
                        Surely I could make it work with at 
                        least.. I don’t know... five?

                                 DARLA
                        So you see yourself getting married?

                                 ADAM
                        Absolutely.

                                 SENNA
                        To the woman with the most points.

                                 DARLA
                        You have a point system?

                                 ADAM
                        Not literally.  But I do believe in 
                        some sort of compatibility equation. 

                                 DARLA
                        So... marriage is a math problem.

                                 SENNA
                        Marriage is dumb.

           All eyes on Senna.

                                 SENNA
                        If two people love each other, they 
                        shouldn’t need a piece of paper to 
                        keep them together. 

                                 DARLA
                        We don’t need it--

                                 SENNA
                        So why get married?  I want my man 
                        to come home because he wants to, 
                        not because he made a vow to.

                                 STEVE
                        Just because I took a vow doesn’t 
                        mean I don’t want to come home.

                                 SENNA
                        Then why take the vow?
                        (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 STEVE
                        Because it’s tradition, shared by 
                        virtually every civilization on 
                        earth since as far back as Ancient 
                        Babylon.  In Mesopotamia, the man 
                        would claim his bride by dumping 
                        perfume on her head.  I agree, like 
                        most traditions, marriage is not 
                        necessary.  But isn’t it the 
                        unnecessary things that make the 
                        human experience so fascinating?

           Darla squeezes Steve’s arm, looks expectantly at Senna.

                                 SENNA
                        At least you agree its unnecessary.

           Steve smiles.  He got to her and he knows it.

           Adam and Senna walk down the sidewalk.

                                 ADAM
                        So who do you think Steve and Darla 
                        voted the most unromantic, me or you?

                                 SENNA
                        This is a competition now?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m just asking.

                                 SENNA
                        Definitely you.

                                 ADAM
                        Me!?  I’m not the one who said I 
                        don’t believe in marriage.

                                 SENNA
                        No, you said you don’t believe in 
                        love.  That’s much worse.

                                 ADAM
                        I said I didn’t believe in a ‘one 
                        and only.’  That’s different.

                        I’ve never even been in regular 
                        love, so for all I know it’s all a 
                        bunch of hoo-ha.

                        You’ve never been in love?  No 
                        wonder you say you don’t believe in

                        I don’t believe in marriage.

                                 ADAM
                        You will when you fall in love.

                        That’s convenient.

                                 SENNA
                        No, convenient is saying there are 
                        any number of women you could marry 
                        and be happy.  That’s convenient.

                        Just because I don’t live in a 
                        fairy tale doesn’t mean I’m going 
                        to marry just anybody.  I want 
                        someone who rocks my world.  I’m 
                        just realistic that there’s more 
                        than one woman out there who can.

                        Then maybe I’m a romantic. ‘Cause 
                        I’m not going to give my heart to 
                        someone if I think there’s room in 
                        it for someone else.

                                 SENNA
                        Because I’m choosy?

                                 ADAM
                        Because you’re delusional!  Love is 
                        not a look across a crowded room. 

                                 SENNA
                        And you’re an expert?

                                 ADAM
                        I’ve been in love a few times.

                                 SENNA
                        Yes.  Congratulations on all your 
                        failed relationships.

                                 ADAM
                        At least I haven’t been waiting 
                        around for fairy dust to fall on 
                        me.  That’s not how it happens.

                                 SENNA
                        Oh really!  So how does it happen--?

           On that, he GRABS her and kisses her HARD on the mouth.  A 
           fantastic kiss.  Clearly a long time coming.

                        You asked.

           He turns and starts down the sidewalk.  As Senna, heart 
           beating wildly, stands there staring after him, we...

           FADE IN ON:

           CELIA.  Looking, gorgeous and completely at ease.

                                 CELIA
                        My most memorable birthday?  Well, 
                        I’m not going to tell you which one 
                        it was, just that it was right after 
                        Senna was born.  I had always felt 
                        anxiety on my birthday--

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Why?

                                 CELIA
                        Why?  I don’t know.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        You don’t know, or you don’t want 
                        to tell me?

                                 CELIA
                        It’s not a big deal.  Just that my 
                        husband, God rest his soul... he 
                        didn’t always forget, but when he 
                        did, we’d both feel bad.  Anyway, the 
                        one right after Senna was born, that 
                        one was different.  They were all 
                        different after that.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        How?

                                 CELIA
                        To hold my baby and see my whole 
                        life in that sweet, angel face... 
                        Who gives a damn about flowers and 
                        chocolates.  People get worked up 
                        about their birthdays because they 
                        expect to be treated special.  But 
                        every day was special after Senna 
                        was born.

                        So you stopped expecting anything 
                        from your husband.

                                 CELIA
                        And what do you know?  I was never 
                        disappointed.  
                (then)
                        So when are you going to be done 
                        with this thesis of yours?

                                 DARLA
                        The wedding sort of derailed things 
                        for awhile, but soon, I hope.

                                 CELIA
                        It was a beautiful wedding.  I was 
                        hoping Senna would have one while I 
                        can still chew my own food.

                                 DARLA
                        I think things are looking up. 

                                 CELIA
                        She’ll screw it up.  It’s ok, I’m 
                        through kidding myself.

           As Celia glumly accepts her fate...

                                   FADE OUT.

           FADE IN ON:

           TITLE CARD: “33”

                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SENNA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Senna’s bed, in a WIDE SHOT.  There’s a large LUMP under the 
           covers.  It’s moving, up and down. 

           We hear heavy BREATHING, muffled GROANS, a GASP.  

           As we DOLLY IN toward the bed, we become increasingly aware 
           of:

           The PHONE, on the night table.  The closer we get, the more 
           we’re aware of it.  Just when we’re sure it’s about to ring--
                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           A FOOT flies out from under the covers, knocking it to the 
           floor.  A moment later--

                                 OPERATOR
                        If you’d like to make a call, 
                        please hang up and try again...

           The sounds of lovemaking continue, until--

           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.  The busy signal sounds.  Senna pops out 
           from under the blanket.  Adam pops out after her.

                                 ADAM
                        You okay?  What’s wrong?

           She pushes him off her, scoops up the phone, hangs it up.  As 
           Adam tries to pick up where they left off--

                                 SENNA
                        What if she tried to call?

                                 ADAM
                        It was 30 seconds.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s almost 7:30.  Maybe I should 
                        call her.  They’re going to take 
                        her off to chemo soon.

                                 ADAM
                        You’re right.  You should call her.

                                 SENNA
                        You don’t think she’d be mad?  That I 
                        didn’t give her a chance to call me?

                                 ADAM
                        If you want to call her then you 
                        should call her.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m going to call her.

           She dials.

                                 SENNA
                        Room 502, please.
                (after a beat, to Adam)
                        It’s ringing.
                (another beat, then)
                        Mom?  It’s me.  Did I wake you?  
                        ...I wanted you to be the first.  
                        ...To wish me...

                (smiling, relieved)
                        Thank you!  Yes you are, the very 
                        first.  I’m going to let you rest, 
                        but I’ll see you in a couple of 
                        hours, okay? ...Okay, bye.

           She hangs up the phone.  

                                 SENNA
                        I woke her up.  She said I didn’t...

           Senna forces a smile.  Her lip is trembling.  

                                 ADAM
                        You’ll feel better when you see her.  

           He holds her tight.  She breathes him in.  

                                 SENNA
                        I love you.

                                 ADAM
                        I love you, too.

                                 SENNA
                        I really mean it. 

                                 ADAM
                        So do I.

                                 SENNA
                        Do you remember last year, on my 
                        birthday, when you said falling in 
                        love would change how I felt 
                        about... y’know, certain things.  
                        You were right. 

                                 ADAM
                        It does occasionally happen.

                                 SENNA
                        This is important.  Do you know 
                        what I’m talking about?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, I do.  
                (off her look)
                        I do!  

                                 SENNA
                        Because this is it for me.

                        For me, too.  If I say any more 
                        I’ll ruin your birthday surprise. 
                (then)
                        I was going to save it for later...  
                        But I guess if you want it now...?

                                 SENNA
                        No!  I can wait.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you sure...?

                                 SENNA
                        Stop it.  Yes, I want to wait.

           She pulls him to her.  As they disappear under the covers...

           INT. SENNA MELROSE BOUTIQUE - MORNING

           The boutique looks terrific.  Colorful corsets, funky tees, 
           and of course Senna’s purses, lined up like soldiers. 

           Nikki is at the register, helping an IRATE CUSTOMER.

                                 NIKKI
                        Looks like that item went on sale.

                                 IRATE CUSTOMER
                        I bought it before it went on sale.

                                 NIKKI
                        Unfortunately, without a receipt I 
                        have no way of knowing--

                        Are you calling me a liar!?

           Senna hurries over.

                                 SENNA
                        Hi, I’m Senna, the owner, did you 
                        want to return that?

                                 IRATE CUSTOMER
                        I didn’t buy it on sale.

                                 SENNA
                        How ‘bout I give you store credit in 
                        the amount of the original price.

                        I was hoping to get my money back.

                                 SENNA
                        Plus ten percent off whatever you 
                        purchase today.

                                 IRATE CUSTOMER
                        I guess I could find something I 
                        like.

           As the grumpy customer moves off--

                                 DARLA
                        Happy, happy!

           Darla enters.  As she approaches-- SURPRISE!  We see that she 
           is very pregnant!  She’s carrying funny-looking drinks.

                                 DARLA
                        I brought Boba.  Why’s it so hot in 
                        here?

                                 SENNA
                        Air conditioning’s broken.  The 
                        guy’s on his way to fix it.  
                        Supposedly.  If and when he ever 
                        gets here, tell him it’s not the 
                        evaporator coil.
                (pointing)
                        That lady gets ten percent off.  
                (before she can ask)
                        And don’t go into labor.  I can’t 
                        handle another crisis today. 

                                 DARLA
                        Not the evaporator coil, ten percent 
                        off, no giving birth, got it.

           Senna hands Darla the keys, makes for the door.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

                                 SENNA
                        Hey mother of the birthday girl!

           Senna steps into Celia’s room to see her mom sitting up in 
           bed, an I.V. in her arm, her head wrapped in an Hermès scarf.  
           She goes to her, hugs her long and tight.
                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 CELIA
                        Okay.  That’s nice.  
                (you can let me go now)
                        Okay.

           As Senna pulls back, Celia notices she wearing the pendant.

                                 CELIA
                        You look pretty.

                                 SENNA
                        So do you.

                                 CELIA
                        Oh, please.  

                                 SENNA
                        You do!  Must be the scarf.

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t have a present for you.  I 
                        thought about going to the gift 
                        shop, but I wouldn’t want anything 
                        from this hell hole.  Except what 
                        they already took from me.  
                (indicating her breasts)
                        I wanted to keep them but the 
                        doctor said no.  

                                 SENNA
                        Mom!

                                 CELIA
                        Your father got to keep his kidney 
                        stone.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s a little different.

           Celia’s lip quivers.  She’s trying with everything she’s got 
           to keep it together.  Senna puts a hand on her shoulder. 

                                 CELIA
                        It’s just that I worked so hard to 
                        keep them perky!

                                 SENNA
                        I know.  You want some water?

           Celia nods.  Senna gets up, goes to the sink.  Celia watches 
           her intently... as if she can hardly believe that beautiful 
           woman walking toward her is her daughter.

                        I want to get square with you about 
                        something, Senna.  

                                 SENNA
                        Mom, it’s ok--

                                 CELIA
                        If I don’t say what’s on my mind I 
                        might not get another chance, so 
                        you hear me, and you hear me good.

           Senna nods.  Sits very still.

                                 CELIA
                        You’re not like me.  And it was 
                        always hard for me to accept that.  
                        So I nagged.  I nagged until I made 
                        myself sick.  Of course it didn’t 
                        do any good, I couldn’t change you.  
                        Thank God.

           Celia reaches out and touches Senna’s face.

                                 CELIA
                        You have done more in your 33 years 
                        than I have done in my entire life.  
                        Your own business.  I never even 
                        did my own hair!
                (then)
                        I look at you and I am so proud.  
                        You’re so brave and smart and 
                        talented.  I don’t know where you 
                        got it, it wasn’t from me.  Though 
                        I do have a knack for fashion.

                                 SENNA
                        Yes, you do.

                                 CELIA
                        I’m sorry Senna.  I’m sorry I spent 
                        all that time pestering you to get 
                        married.  I don’t care if you ever 
                        get married as long as you’re happy.

                                 SENNA

                        know if I should tell you.

                                 CELIA
                        Tell me what?

                        I’m getting married.

                        Tell me everything.  How, when, 
                        where???

                                 SENNA
                        He hasn’t officially asked me yet.  
                        But when I hinted that I wanted him 
                        to, he said he was going to tonight.

                                 CELIA
                        We have to get Mario to do your 
                        cake.  He made the most magnificent 
                        profiterole tower for Annie Glenn’s 
                        daughter.  I’m going to call him.

                        You can’t say anything to anybody.  
                        It’s supposed to be a surprise. 

                                 CELIA
                        I won’t.

           Just then, a DELIVERY BOY knocks and pokes his head in.

                                 DELIVERY BOY
                        Mrs. Berges?

                                 CELIA
                        My daughter’s getting married!

                                 SENNA
                        Mom! 

                                 DELIVERY BOY
                        Congratulations.  

           He sets the bags down on the table.

                        You ordered lunch from the Bel Air 
                        Hotel?

                                 CELIA
                        Of course!  It’s your birthday!

           A NURSE enters.  But before she can speak-- 

                                 CELIA
                        My daughter’s getting married!

           As Senna throws her hands up in the air--  

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. THE IVY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Adam and Senna sit at a candlelit table, the remnants of 
           dessert in front of them.

                                 ADAM
                        Wow that was good.  Perfect finish 
                        to a perfect day...

                                 SENNA
                        The day’s not over yet.

                                 ADAM
                        It is for me.  After that meal, all 
                        I want to do is curl up in a ball 
                        and sleep.  I could sleep right 
                        here.
                (off her look)
                        What?

                                 SENNA
                        Don’t ‘what’ me!  I know you have a 
                        present for me so let’s have it.

                                 ADAM
                        Did I say I got you a present?

                                 SENNA
                        Adam!

                                 ADAM
                        I didn’t give it to you earlier?

           He starts looking around for it, patting his pockets.
                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        I hope I didn’t lose it.  Oh!  
                        There it is.

           He smiles mischievously at her, then reaches under the table, 
           pulls out a perfectly small box...  

                                 ADAM
                        Don’t panic.  I haven’t forgotten 
                        your disdain for the traditional.

           She flushes with anticipation as she holds it in her hand. 

           With a racing heart, she opens it.  The blood drains from her 
           face when she sees what’s inside.

           It’s a KEY. 

                                 ADAM
                        So what do you think?

                                 SENNA
                        A key?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m asking you to move in with me.

                                 SENNA
                (wants to kill him)
                        This is your big surprise?

                                 ADAM
                (suddenly very afraid)
                        Maybe?

                                 SENNA
                        Adam, I told you this morning that 
                        being with you changed how I feel 
                        about things.  

           Adam stares at her.  No idea.

                                 SENNA
                        You said you understood!  

           And then, it hits him.  Hard.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh my God.  

                                 SENNA
                        I like the box.  Very romantic.
                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Senna, I didn’t realize... you’ve 
                        always been so down on marriage.  I 
                        thought you’d be relieved--

                                 SENNA
                        Relieved!?

                                 ADAM
                        I thought it was what you wanted.  
                (taking her hand)
                        Senna I am so sorry.  We can totally 
                        get married if that’s what you want.  

                                 SENNA
                        If that’s what I want.

                                 ADAM
                        No!  I mean, that’s not what I 
                        mean.  I mean it is what I mean but 
                        not how I mean it.

                                 SENNA
                        I can’t believe this is happening.  

                                 ADAM
                        If I had known you wanted to, I 
                        would have asked, I swear.

           She stands and makes for the door.  

                                 ADAM
                        Senna!

           Adam JUMPS to his feet, TOPPLES the chair.

                                 ADAM
                        Shit!  

           Nearby DINERS turn to look as he disentangles himself from 
           the chair, rejoins Senna--

           ON THE SIDEWALK.

           Senna’s getting into a CAB.

                                 ADAM
                        Senna!  Wait!

           He puts his hand on her.  She pushes it off.

                                 SENNA
                        Let me go.

                        I don’t want to let you go.  

                                 SENNA
                        Well you should have thought of 
                        that earlier.

           SLAM!  Off she goes.  As he watches her drive away--

                                 WAITER (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir?

                                 ADAM
                        What!?

           It’s his WAITER: with the check.

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA’S LOS FELIZ APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Senna leans up against her front door, tears streaming down 
           her face.  She looks over at--

           Her four-piece CHINA PLACE SETTING taunting her from it’s 
           perch on the buffet.  

           Her eyes narrow.  She rips off her magic love karma necklace 
           and CHUCKS it at the china.  As it falls to the floor--

           BANG BANG BANG!

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Senna!

                                 SENNA
                        Go away!

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        No!  Not until I see you.

           Senna YANKS the door open--

                                 SENNA
                        There, you’ve seen me.  Now go 
                        away!

           Then pushes it closed.  He STOPS it with his foot.

                                 SENNA
                        God damn it, Adam!

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t want to talk to you.

                                 ADAM
                        You don’t have to talk.  I’ll do 
                        all the talking.  There’s something 
                        I need to ask you right now.

                                 SENNA
                        So ask me.

                                 ADAM
                        Can’t I come in?

                                 SENNA
                        No.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay.

           One foot still jammed in the crack, he falls to one knee, 
           BANGING the other against the door as he goes down.  

                                 ADAM
                        Oww!

           Senna peeks through the crack, watches as he reaches into his 
           breast pocket and pulls out--

           A giant PLASTIC ring.  The kind you get in a gumball machine.  
           He eases it through the crack.  It’s hideous.

                                 ADAM
                        Senna... will you marry me?

           Senna looks at the ring, doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

                                 ADAM
                        Please?  Please will you marry me?

           She opens the door.  Adam topples over. 

                                 SENNA
                        Where did you get that?

                                 ADAM
                        7/11.  Gumball machine.  I got you 
                        some other things, too.

           plastic SPIDER, temporary TATTOOS, an egg of SILLY PUTTY, a 
           floating EYEBALL.  Senna looks down at the assortment...

                                 SENNA
                        I like the floating eyeball.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s yours.

           He picks it up and offers it to her.

                                 SENNA
                        How many tries did it take to get 
                        the ring?

                                 ADAM
                        Fourteen.

           She slides it on her ring finger, takes a good, long look.

                                 SENNA
                        My mother’s not going to buy it.

                                 ADAM
                        First thing tomorrow, I’ll take you 
                        anywhere you want--

                                 SENNA
                        No.

                                 ADAM
                        No?

                                 SENNA
                        Picking out the ring is a rite of 
                        passage.  You have to go through 
                        the anguish and humiliation on your 
                        own.  

                                 ADAM
                        Anguish and humiliation.  Got it.  
                        I’m all over it.  Can I come in now?

           Senna hesitates, then steps back from the door to make room for 
           him to enter.  He scrambles to his feet, takes her in his arms.

                                 ADAM
                        Still love me?

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t know.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        That’s a step up from an hour ago.

                                 SENNA
                        I told my mother you were going to 
                        propose.  She got so excited.

                                 ADAM
                        I did propose.

                                 SENNA
                        Because I had a meltdown.

                                 ADAM
                        I didn’t propose to you because you 
                        had a meltdown, I proposed to you 
                        because I love you and want to 
                        spend the rest of my life with you.  
                        The meltdown was a bonus.

                                 SENNA
                        You promise you’re not just doing 
                        it ‘cause you feel sorry for me?

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t feel sorry for you.  You 
                        had a great night.  You got a 
                        floating eyeball.

           Adam holds up the floating eyeball for her to see.  She can’t 
           help herself... she laughs.  And as they embrace, we...

           FADE IN ON:

           FRANCOIS, the maitre d’, with a heavy French accent. 

                                 FRANCOIS
                        My most memorable birthday?  Yes, I 
                        can tell you that.  I had just come 
                        to the United States.  My family 
                        was not speaking to me, I had left 
                        them and they were very angry.  I 
                        was 24.  I had been working for 
                        Monsieur Valéry since two months.  
                        The dishwasher.  Terrible work.  
                        But I was in America, and I had a 
                        job, so I did not complain.  Even 
                        though the work was miserable, I 
                        was happy to be working that day, 
                        not alone with my sadness.

                        I remember, I was wiping lipstick 
                        off a wine glass, and one of the 
                        line cooks tells me Monsieur Valéry 
                        wants to see me in his office.  I 
                        imagined the worst.  That I was 
                        fired, and I would have nowhere to 
                        go.  I go to his office, he gives 
                        me the telephone.  It was my maman.  
                        She says, it’s your birthday, for 
                        your present, I forgive you.  I 
                        tried not to cry in front of M. 
                        Valéry.  But I was too happy.

           INT. ADAM’S BEACHFRONT CONDO - MORNING

           Adam sleeps between crisp white sheets.  It’s early.  The sun 
           hasn’t even peeked above the horizon.  He opens his eyes to see--

           Senna’s not there.

           Blinking back sleep, he forces himself out of bed, pads into--

           THE KITCHEN.

           Sees Senna, sitting at the table in her nightie, face as grey 
           as the dawn.  The table is littered with wedding 
           paraphernalia: invitations, menus, sketches of dresses...

                                 SENNA
                        Look at all this shit.  

                                 ADAM
                        It’s early.  Come back to bed.

                                 SENNA
                        I keep waiting for the phone to 
                        ring.  She always had to be the 
                        first.  Even in third grade, when I 
                        slept over Molly Meyerson’s, she 
                        called the house at the crack of 
                        dawn so Molly wouldn’t beat her to 
                        it.  I didn’t do sleep-overs for my 
                        birthday after that.

           profiterole cake on the cover.

                                 SENNA
                        We argued for three days over 
                        profiteroles.  She insisted we have 
                        them, I told her they were prissy-- 
                        which they are.  I would wear a 
                        profiterole on my nose just to have 
                        her there.  

           Her lip starts to tremble.  Adam sits down beside her.

                                 SENNA
                        I had to have a winter wedding.

                                 ADAM
                        You had no way of knowing.  

                                 SENNA
                        You know why?  ‘Cause the colors 
                        are better.   I don’t even want to 
                        look at this stuff now.  

                                 ADAM
                        So toss it.  We’ll do something 
                        small, at Steve and Darla’s.  Just 
                        our close friends.  

                                 SENNA
                        What’s the point?

           Adam tries not to look stung.

                                 ADAM
                        Same as it always was.  To get 
                        married.

                        wedding.

                        You said you had it handled. 

                                 SENNA
                        Doesn’t mean you can’t have an 
                        opinion.

                                 ADAM
                        Until just now, I didn’t even know 
                        what a profiterole was, how can I 
                        have an opinion about it?

                        Our wedding’s not important enough 
                        to find out?

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t understand what you’re so 
                        upset about.  You want me to plan 
                        the wedding, is that it?

                                 SENNA
                        Yes, that’s what I want.  For you 
                        to do it.  Here!

           She pushes the pile at him.

                                 ADAM
                        I can’t plan a wedding on an empty 
                        stomach.  Let’s go out for breakfast.

                                 SENNA
                        You know I don’t eat breakfast.

                                 ADAM
                        So come keep me company.  You’re 
                        already up.  
                (off her silence)
                        Right. 

           And as he moves off, we...

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA VENICE BOUTIQUE - DAY

           Senna’s store is humming.  She’s moved to a larger space, on 
           pricey Abbott Kinney Boulevard, near the beach in Venice.  

           Two salespeople assist customers on the floor.  There’s a 
           third behind the register.  

           Darla enters, wearing her 10-MONTH-OLD BABY across her chest.  
           She waves to the cashier, goes to look for Senna in the back.  
           She’s not in her office.

                                 DARLA 
                        Do you guys know where Senna is?

                                    CUT TO:
                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           EXT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY

           A modest but well-kept 2-story Colonial.  There’s a SOLD sign 
           on the lawn.  Senna refuses to look at it as she walks up the 
           path to the front door.

           INSIDE

           Moving boxes are sprinkled amongst empty bookcases and barren 
           coffee tables.  Nails poke out where pictures once hung.  
           Senna walks past it all, UP THE STAIRS and into--

           THE MASTER BEDROOM

           Stops in the doorway.  Unlike the downstairs, it is stuffed 
           full of personal items-- perfume, magazines, pictures-- lots 
           of pictures, most of them of Senna.   

           Senna grabs an empty box, goes to the dresser, opens the 
           drawer.  Underwear, nighties, sweaters...  

           She fills the box, seals it with tape, marks it with a 
           Sharpie: GOOD WILL.  

           She opens the CLOSET, takes out a familiar HELIOTROPE 
           CASHMERE COAT.  Senna was right-- it is her mother’s color.  
           Even matches the wallpaper.  Senna tosses it into a box.

           She removes several dresses, throws them on the bed.  As she 
           turns back around, her hand flies over her mouth.  There, at 
           the back of the closet--

           Is her WEDDING CHINA.  Eleven place settings, stacked floor 
           to ceiling, a perfect match to her one set at home.

           With trembling hands, she removes a box, falls to her knees 
           to open it.  As she cradles a dinner plate in her arms--

                                 DARLA
                        Senna?

           Darla appears.  Senna looks up at her, face streaked with 
           tears.  Darla crouches down beside her.

                                 SENNA
                        She bought me the entire set.  
                        Look.  Eleven boxes. 

                                 DARLA
                        You didn’t have to do this today--

                        What should I do with it?

                                 DARLA
                        You could eat off of it.  Or you 
                        could put it behind glass and stare 
                        at it.  That’s what we did with 
                        ours. 

                                 SENNA
                        She was saving it for my wedding.

                                 DARLA
                        So wait for your wedding, then.  

                                 SENNA
                        What if there is no wedding?

                                 DARLA
                        What do you mean?  

           Senna won’t look at her.  Darla suddenly looks concerned.

                                 DARLA
                        You’re not having doubts.  
                (no response)
                        Senna!?

                                 SENNA
                        He wasn’t even going to propose.

                                 DARLA
                        You told him you didn’t believe in 
                        marriage.

                                 SENNA
                        He still should have asked.  

                                 DARLA
                        Why would he ask if he knew you’d 
                        say no--

                                 SENNA
                        If he wanted me and only me, he 
                        wouldn’t take no for an answer. 

                                 DARLA
                        Adam loves you.

                                 SENNA
                        Adam’s loved other girls, too.

                        But he proposed to you.

                                 SENNA
                        Barely.

                                 DARLA
                        That’s not fair.

                                 SENNA
                        I don’t want to be one of five.
                (off Darla’s puzzled look)
                        ‘Out of the billions of people in 
                        the world, I’m sure I could make it 
                        work with at least five.’  You were 
                        there when he said that.  I know 
                        nobody’s perfect.  I accept Adam’s 
                        obsessive need to alphabetize.  
                        That he thinks fifteen minutes 
                        early is on time.  I can even deal 
                        with the girly drinks and his 
                        stupid excuses for ordering them.  
                        But the one thing I need is for him 
                        to need me.  Only me.

                                 DARLA
                        I’ve seen him with his other 
                        girlfriends.  How he feels about 
                        you... it’s not even close.  Trust 
                        it, Senna.  

           Senna looks down at the china.  Easier said than done.

           INT./EXT. ADAM’S CAR / BURBANK AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Senna sits blindfolded in the passenger seat as Adam drives.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m getting carsick.

                                 ADAM
                        Almost there.

                                 SENNA
                        I smell the airport.  Are we at the 
                        airport?  Why are we at the airport?

           Adam steers the car down a narrow drive, then stops.  
                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Okay.  You can take it off now.

           Senna rips off the blindfold.  A VALET opens her door, helps 
           her out of the car.  ANOTHER VALET opens Adam’s.  

                                 ANOTHER VALET
                        Good evening, sir.  How long will 
                        you be traveling?

                                 ADAM
                        Just ‘til tomorrow.

                                 SENNA
                        Where are we going?

           Adam goes to her, hands her a ticket.  Her eyes fly open.

                                 SENNA
                        Vegas!?

                                 ADAM
                        Dinner at the Bellagio, a show at

                                 SENNA
                        You’re taking me to Vegas?

                                 ADAM
                        You said I should go ahead and plan 
                        it, so...

           He pulls out a RING BOX out of his pocket.  She doesn’t reach 
           for it, so he opens it for her.  INSIDE--

           WEDDING BANDS, his and hers.

                        I booked a chapel for midnight. 

           The color drains from her face.

                        A nice one, with real flowers and a 
                        live string quartet.  I know Vegas 
                        is kitschy, but we’ve been wanting 
                        to go.

                        To visit.  Not to get married.

                        This wedding planning is killing 
                        me.  Let’s just get it over with.

           Senna looks like she just got slapped.

                                 SENNA
                        Get it over with?

                        You know what I mean.

                                 SENNA
                        No, I don’t think I do.

                                 ADAM
                        I mean, if you want to do it, let’s 
                        do it already!  You do still want 
                        to marry me...?

                                 SENNA
                        Not when you’re like this.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry.  How would you like me 
                        to be?  

                                 SENNA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 ADAM
                        You didn’t believe in marriage so I 
                        didn’t ask.  Then suddenly you want 
                        to, so I do.  Then you want to do 
                        everything, then you get mad at me 
                        for letting you.  No matter what I 
                        do, it’s not good enough for you.  

                                 SENNA
                        What if I don’t want to get married 
                        in Vegas?

                                 ADAM
                        Then I guess I’m not good enough 
                        for you.  Lord knows I tried.
                (to the Valet)
                        Can you bring the car back, please?

           He picks up his overnight bag, hands Senna some money.

                                 SENNA

                        They shouldn’t charge you, but if 
                        they do-- 

                                 SENNA
                        You’re still going? 

                                 ADAM
                        I paid for the room.

                                 SENNA
                        What are you going to do there?

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t know.  Eat, drink, party, 
                        Vegas is just as fun for singles.  
                        Or so I’ve heard.

                                 SENNA
                        So that’s it?  You’re “single” now.

                                 ADAM
                        I can’t take the roller coaster 
                        ride anymore, Senna.  I want a 
                        partner.  Someone who cares enough 
                        about my happiness to meet me half 
                        way sometimes.  Clearly that’s not 
                        you. 

           Senna’s mouth floats open as she realizes: He’s leaving her.

                                 ADAM
                        Your whole life can be about you 
                        now.  Consider it my birthday 
                        present.  

           The car arrives.  As he turns and heads for the terminal--

           HOLD ON Senna, frozen in disbelief.

                        From the moment you wake up in the 
                        morning you got people calling you, 
                        “What are you doing today, can I 
                        take you to lunch, what do you mean 
                        you’re going with so-and-so, well I 
                        want to see you, too!”  So 
                        inevitably you wind up apologizing 
                        for going to lunch with whomever 
                        you’re going to lunch with, then 
                        hosting a party you don’t even 
                        want, just to keep all those people 
                        who insist on-- 
                (quotes with his hands)
                        “celebrating” with you happy.  God 
                        forbid you tell your friends you 
                        just want to go home, make a pitcher 
                        of martinis and watch TMC.  They’ll 
                        never let you live it down!  Of 
                        course no matter how hard you try to 
                        make yourself available to everyone 
                        who insists on seeing you, there’ll 
                        always be someone you forgot to call 
                        and is pissed off that they weren’t 
                        included in your--
                (quotes with his hands)
                        “celebration.”  So a week later you 
                        wind up taking them out to lunch to 
                        make them feel better about not 
                        being invited to the party that was 
                        supposed to be about you!  I swear, 
                        after age 12, birthdays are nothing

           INT. SENNA’S VENICE LOFT - MORNING

           An alarm echoes across high ceilings and lathe plaster walls.  

           We PAN toward the source, over hand-drawn design sketches--
           coats, pants, dresses-- on the dining room table, on the 
           counters, pinned to the walls.  In--

           A few signature items tell us this sleek condo belongs to 
           Senna.  The clock (still beeping), the Eiffel Tower ashtray 
           (sans butts), the fuzzy robe on the back of the door.  

           Yep, this is Senna’s house all right.  The question is... 
           where is she?

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - MORNING

           Senna kneels by Celia’s grave.  Pajama’s peek out from under 
           her coat.  She is pale and painfully sleep-deprived.

                                 SENNA
                        Happy my birthday.  

           And as she settles in to watch the sunrise...

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. LA GARMENT DISTRICT - DAY

           The most colorful, noisy place you’ve ever seen.  Senna 
           stands in front of a wall of buttons, as an aging CHINESE 
           WOMAN shows her spools upon spools of ribbon.

                                 SENNA
                        Too fat.  Too shiny.  I don’t like 
                        the ribbing...  that’s nice, but I 
                        need it in more of a blue-black.

           As the woman nods and moves off--

                        That’s okay.  Anything else 
                        happening?

                                 NIKKI (O.S.)
                        Store’s pretty quiet.  But some 
                        flowers came for you.

           Senna perks up.  Flowers?

                                 SENNA
                        From who?

                                 NIKKI (O.S.)
                        I don’t know. You want me to open 
                        the card?

                                 SENNA
                        It’s ok.  I’ll be there in an hour.

           She closes the phone.  Stands there, lost in thought, until--

                                 CHINESE WOMAN
                        Here.  Blue-black.

           The Chinese woman returns with more ribbon.

                                 SENNA
                        That’s it.  I’ll take all of it.

           As the woman writes up her order--

           Senna’s eyes are curious, hopeful.  She heads for the 
           register with a spring in her step.

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA VENICE BOUTIQUE - DAY

           Trendy hobo bags, colorful ankle boots, and some of the 
           sexiest dress coats you’ve ever seen.

           A few upscale customers mill about the sleek retail space as 
           Senna enters, waves to Nikki, beelines for--

           HER OFFICE.

           There, on her desk, is a bouquet of roses.  Lemon yellow, 
           creamsicle, lavender.  As she reaches for the card--

                                 NIKKI  
                        Who are they from?
                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           Nikki appears in the doorway.

           Senna opens the card, making a point not to look eager.  As 
           she flips it open--

           Her eyes register disappointment.  Huge disappointment.  She 
           was hoping they were from someone else.

                                 SENNA
                        ‘My wife loves her coat.  We want 
                        to bring your line to Paris.  
                        Please expect a call from me, warm 
                        regards, Emile...’ something I 
                        can’t pronounce.

                                 NIKKI
                        Paris!  OmiGOD!  We’re going 
                        international!

           Nikki grabs her and hugs her.  A slow smile spreads over 
           Senna’s face as she realizes...

                                 SENNA
                        My coats are going to Paris.  

                                 NIKKI
                        Le fashion capital du monde!

                                 SENNA
                        Happy Birthday to me!

           They high five.

                                 NIKKI
                        Where are you celebrating?

                                 SENNA
                        Darla always plans something great.  

           As Nikki moves off, Senna picks up the phone, dials.

                                 SENNA
                        Darla!  Hey, it’s me.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Oh, hey.  Hold on a sec.

           We can hear a BABY CRYING in the background, and Darla trying 
           to SHUSH him.

                                 SENNA
                        You want to call me back?
                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        It’s always like this.  What’s up?

                                 SENNA
                        I was just checking in... y’know, 
                        to see what was happening tonight.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Mommy’s on the phone!  
                (then)
                        Sorry, what?

                                 SENNA
                        I was just asking about the plans 
                        for tonight.  Am I coming there?  
                        Are we meeting somewhere...?  
                (long beat of silence)
                        Darla?

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Oh my God, Senna...  I suck.  I am 
                        the worst friend ever...  

           The color drains from Senna’s face: Darla forgot her birthday.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Don’t touch that.  That’s 
                        very dangerous.

                                 SENNA
                        You’re busy.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        No, wait!  Don’t hang up.  Shit, I’m 
                        a putz!  With Steve out of town--

                                 SENNA
                        It’s okay.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        It’s so totally not okay.  I can’t 
                        even take you out, I don’t have a 
                        babysitter.  

           Just then, Nikki pokes her head in, indicates the phone.

                                 NIKKI
                        Line two.

                                 SENNA
                        I have to take another call.  We’ll 
                        talk later.

                                 SENNA
                        Nikki, wait!  If you were going to 
                        go out someplace fabulous tonight, 
                        where would you go?

                                 NIKKI
                        White Lotus.  If you can afford $20 
                        cocktails.

                                 SENNA
                        You want to see if the other girls 
                        want to come?  My treat.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hell yeah!

           Nikki moves off.  Senna smiles to herself.  As she picks up 
           the phone... 

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA VENICE BOUTIQUE - EVENING

                                 SENNA
                        See you tonight.

           Senna waves to Nikki, goes out the back door to--

           THE ALLEY

           Opens her car door, eases the flowers into the seat beside 
           her.  She looks at them a long beat, then plucks her phone 
           from her purse and dials:

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        It’s Adam.  Leave me a message so I 
                        can call you back.

                                 SENNA
                        Hey.  It’s Senna.  I know it’s 
                        short notice, but I’m having a 
                        little birthday get together at 
                        White Lotus tonight, would love to 
                        see you if you can stop by.  Ok, 
                        hope you can make it.  Bye.

           She closes the phone, bites her lip, then starts the car.

SENNA’S CAR / VENICE STREETS - EVENING

           As Senna drives down sunkissed Venice streets:

                                 SENNA (V.O.)
                        Hey.  Senna again.   I forgot to 
                        tell you what time, so, uh... it’s 
                        9:00.  Any time after that.  Call 
                        me if you’re coming, ok?

           She pulls into her parking spot, jogs up her front walk:

                                 SENNA (V.O.)
                        Hey it’s me again.  I forgot to tell 
                        you I reserved a private room, so 
                        just ask for me, it’s in my name.  
                        Call me and let me know if you’re 
                        coming, ok?  Ok, bye.

           INT. SENNA’S VENICE LOFT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Senna, freshly showered and still in a towel, looks down at 
           her cell phone: no messages.

           She crosses to the dresser, opens the top drawer, wades 
           through some scarves to find--

           A JEWELRY BOX.  From it, she pulls out one very special 
           NECKLACE, fastens it around her neck.

           She examines her refection.  The diamond heart glistens 
           against her damp skin.  She takes off her earrings, then 
           pulls her hair up, secures it in a knot.  It’s all about the 
           necklace tonight.

           She goes to close the box, pauses, then reaches in and pulls 
           out one very gruesome-looking FLOATING EYEBALL.  

           She stares at it a beat, then digs back in the box and 
           produces a giant PLASTIC RING.  Unceremoniously, she carries 
           them to the wastebasket and DROPS them in.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Your basic hot spot.  The crowd is young and good-looking, 
           lots of wanna-be actors with great hair and fabulous jeans.

                        Girl, you are smokin’!

           Senna, funky sexy with a lace bra peeking out of her 
           strapless dress, approaches a cluster of girls at the bar.  
           Her make-up is shimmery, dramatic: like she put some effort 
           into it.  The girls AD LIB hellos, then:

                                 NIKKI
                        Vodka tonic?

           Senna nods.  As Nikki signals to the bartender--

           A HANDSOME GUY slides in next to Senna.  Their eyes meet.  

                                 SENNA
                (re: his tattoo)
                        Nice art.

                                 HANDSOME
                        Thanks. 

           She pauses to let him elaborate.  He doesn’t.

                                 SENNA
                        Why a dragon fly?

                                 HANDSOME
                        Oh, I don’t know...

                                 SENNA
                        I thought maybe you didn’t have 
                        enough ink for a dragon.

                                 HANDSOME
                        No.  

           Senna smiles.  He totally doesn’t get her.  But she doesn’t 
           give up.

                                 SENNA
                        I have one on my shoulder.  I 
                        wasn’t sure what color I wanted so 
                        I went for clear.

                                 HANDSOME
                        That’s a joke, right?

                                 SENNA
                        You got me.

           He smiles, relieved.  So much for tall, dark and handsome...

                        No thanks.  I have a club foot.

           A HOSTESS beckons to Senna.  As she and the girls move off...

           Senna tears wrapping paper off of a large, flat gift.

                        You guys...

           It’s a FRAMED MAGAZINE ARTICLE: Vogue “Designers to Watch” 
           Issue.  There’s a picture of Senna and one of her coats. 

                                 SENNA
                        Thank you so much!

           She group hugs her (cute, young) employees.  Just then--

                                 NIKKI
                        Well look who the cat dragged in.

           Senna’s heart pounds.  She oh-so-casually turns to see:

                                 DARLA
                        Better late than never!

           Darla, carrying a LARGE BOX with a bow on it.  Senna smiles, 
           trying with everything she’s got to hide her disappointment.

                                 DARLA
                        I left my kid with a stripper but 
                        you’re worth it.  Happy Birthday!

           Darla places the box in front of Senna.  As Senna reaches for 
           it--

           It MOVES.  As if there were a giant Mexican jumping bean 
           inside.  A whimpering Mexican jumping bean.

                                 SENNA
                        Oh no.

           Darla whips off the lid:  It’s a PUPPY.

                        C’mon let’s go dance.

           Senna on the dance floor, holding the puppy against her

                                 SENNA
                        This can’t be good for him.

                        Britney and Paris bring their dogs 
                        to clubs all the time.

           A perky COLLEGE GIRL sidles up to Senna, starts making kissy 
           faces at the dog.

                                 COLLEGE GIRL
                        Your dog is so cute!

                                 SENNA
                        You want him?  I’m serious.  You’d 
                        be doing me a favor.

           Senna tries to hand her the puppy.  The girl quickly moves 
           away.  Senna looks down at him...

                                 SENNA
                        Don’t take it personally.

           He stretches up and LICKS her face, wagging his tail wildly. 

                                 SENNA

           BUZZZZZZZ.  BUZZZZZZZ.

           Her cleavage starts vibrating.  Her phone.  As she reaches, 
           the puppy slips down the front of her dress.

                                 SENNA
                        Shit!

           She SQUATS DOWN to catch him.  He starts licking her all over.

                        Hello!

                        No, please, don’t lick me.

                        Senna?

           Senna’s face goes WHITE.

                                 SENNA
                        Adam???

                        No!  I was just, wait... hold on.

           She struggles to stand, foists the wiggling dog on Darla, 
           then fights her way out of the crowd toward the bar.

                                 SENNA
                        Are you there?

           She JAMS a finger in her ear.  There are people EVERYWHERE.

                        Yeah, I’m here. 

                                 SENNA
                        Hi.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Hi.  Sorry to call so late.  I just 
                        wanted to wish you happy birthday.

                                 SENNA
                        Did you get my messages? ...Adam?
                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        I’m here.

                                 SENNA
                        I called you.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        I know.  Listen I can hardly hear 
                        you.

                                 SENNA
                        Yeah, sorry, it’s pretty insane.  

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        I don’t want to keep you from your 
                        party.  Happy birthday.

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks.  We only just got here, if 
                        you want to come.  Adam?  ...Adam???

           She looks down at the phone.  He’s gone.  She hurries through 
           the crowd, back to her--

           PRIVATE ROOM

           Shuts the door.  Darla’s there with the puppy.

                                 DARLA
                        You were right about the puppy.  
                        He’s not real keen on clubbing.  
                        Who are you calling?

                                 SENNA
                        Adam.  We just got cut off.  I 
                        called and invited him but I think 
                        he only just now got the message.  
                (then)
                        He turned his phone off.  Why would 
                        he turn his phone off?  I was just 
                        talking to him a second ago.

           She looks at Darla.  She looks guilty and a little scared.

                                 SENNA
                        What?

                                 DARLA
                        I wanted to tell you, but your 
                        birthday was coming...

                                 SENNA
                        Tell me what?
                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 DARLA
                        Then I forgot--

                                 SENNA
                        Tell me WHAT!?

                                 DARLA
                        Adam was seeing this girl long 
                        distance.  I didn’t think it was 
                        serious.  
                (then, with difficulty)
                        She just moved here.

           As Senna’s heart drops into her stomach--

                                 DARLA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SENNA
                        When?  When did she move here?

                                 DARLA
                        Last weekend.  They’re not living 
                        together.

                                 SENNA
                        Of course he’s with somebody.  He’s 
                        been shopping for a wife since the 
                        day we met.
                (then)
                        You should have told me!

                                 DARLA
                        I know.  

                                 SENNA
                        I called him three times today.  He 
                        must think I’m an idiot.

                                 DARLA
                        He’d never think that.  

           Senna shakes her head.  Sure feels like an idiot... 

                                    CUT TO:

           INT. SENNA’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Senna, in a nightie, whitening strips on her teeth, stands at 
           the mirror, patting eye cream in the tiny creases around her 
           eyes.  She turns to look at--
                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           The PUPPY, curled up on a towel in the bathtub.  He’s 
           quivering ever-so-slightly.  Senna covers him with a hand 
           towel, leaves the room.  A moment later--

           She comes back, scoops him up and carries him into--

           HER BEDROOM, snugs him into the bed.  As she settles in 
           beside him, she looks over at THE PHONE.  She stares at it a 
           beat, then removes the whitening strip from her top teeth, 
           picks it up and dials.  

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        It’s Adam.  Leave me a message so I 
                        can call you back.

                                 SENNA
                        Adam, hi.  It’s Senna.  I just...  
                        I wanted to thank you for calling.  
                        Darla told me about your girlfriend 
                        moving here, I’m glad to hear 
                        you’re happy.  Well, I’m around if 
                        you want to catch up.  Y’know, as 
                        friends.  If you want to.  Ok, bye.

           Senna hangs up.  Looks at the dog: her bedmate, now.  

           As she CLICKS off the light, we...

                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON:

           Adam, in a MEDIUM CLOSE-UP.

                                 ADAM
                        My most memorable birthday was my 
                        34th.  I was still with Senna then.  
                        I guess you’d call it the honeymoon 
                        period.  She wouldn’t let me out of 
                        bed that morning, so I was late to 
                        my deposition.  I never got 
                        breakfast, then we worked through 
                        lunch.  When I got home, Senna had 
                        hidden little presents all over the 
                        house, like a treasure hunt, with 
                        funny little poems for clues.  The 
                        last present was in the bed.  I 
                        won’t tell you what it was, just 
                        that we never made it to dinner.  I 
                        didn’t have a meal the entire day.  
                        That was my birthday.  It was 
                        exhausting being with her...  
                                 (MORE)
                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 ADAM(cont'd)

                        Incredible, but exhausting.  I 
                        guess that’s why it couldn’t last.  

           HOLD ON his gentle smile, then...

                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON:

           TITLE CARD: “36”

                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SENNA’S VENICE LOFT - MORNING

           A puppy tongue on Senna’s sleeping face.  She grimaces, tries 
           to fight him off.  Finally--

                                 SENNA
                        Okay, okay, okay, okay!

           She stumbles out of bed, the dog nipping at her heels.

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. SENNA VENICE BOUTIQUE - DAY

           It’s early.  The boutique isn’t open yet.  We can see Nikki 
           through the glass, arranging a display. 

           TAP TAP TAP.  Nikki looks up.  It’s Senna, with her dog.  
           Nikki hurries to unlock the door for her.  

                                 NIKKI
                        Happy Birthday!

                                 SENNA
                        Thanks.  Is she here?

                                 NIKKI
                        In your office.  Shall I gather the 
                        troops?

           Senna nods, then steps--

           INSIDE THE BOUTIQUE.  She pauses a moment to take it all in.  
           Her hear swells with pride: she’s come a long way.

           Employees start to gather around her.  A few hug her, wish 
           her happy birthday.  Her eyes are shiny as she smiles and 
           thanks them.  Finally:
                                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)

                        Thanks to all of you who came in 
                        special today.  I appreciate it.  
                        Most of you know that I sold the 
                        store and am going to Paris to 
                        design full time.

           Senna’s employees clap and cheer.

                        Don’t applaud yet, I may crash and 
                        burn.  Anyway, I wanted you all to 
                        meet your new boss.  She gave me my 
                        start in the business, and really 
                        knows her shit.  Vanessa?

           Vanessa steps forward.  Smiles affectionately at Senna.

                                 VANESSA
                        I don’t want to keep you guys who 
                        came in or your day off, and we 
                        open in ten minutes!  I just wanted 
                        the opportunity to introduce 
                        myself, and tell you how much I’m 
                        looking forward to working with you 
                        all.  Senna’s built an incredible 
                        business, I’m honored she’s chosen 
                        me to continue her Legacy.  

           She winks and smiles at Senna.

                                 SENNA
                        Vanessa also owns Legacy.

                                 VANESSA
                        Don’t worry, I’m not changing the 
                        name.  You’ve built an incredible 
                        brand.  We’re looking forward to 
                        stocking it with your cutting edge 
                        designs.  Make us proud.

           More applause.  As Senna wipes a tear from her eye...

           INT. SENNA’S VENICE LOFT - DAY

           Senna’s phone is RINGING as she enters with Lucky.  She 
           hurries to answer it.

                                 SENNA
                        Hello?

                                 SENNA
                        I did it.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Congratulations.  You’re a free 
                        woman!  Let’s go celebrate your

                        something really Californian.

           EXT. COUNTY LINE STATE BEACH - DAY

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        The waves are nice and mushy, it’s 
                        a great day for learning, so let’s 
                        get out there and have some fun!

           A tanned INSTRUCTOR DUDE addresses a group of students that 
           includes Senna, Darla, Steve, Adam and Adam’s athletic-
           looking girlfriend, ALISON.  Steve is crouched down talking 
           to STEVIE, his and Darla’s three-year old son:

                                 STEVE
                        When the wave moves into shallow 
                        water, the bottom of it slows down, 
                        allowing the top to spill over it...

                                 ADAM
                        Who needs sunscreen?

           Adam holds up a tube.

                                 ALISON
                        Not me, I always put it on before I 
                        leave the house.  It’s more 
                        effective if you apply in advance.

           He offers it to Darla, she waves it off.

                                 DARLA
                        We’re good.

                                 ALISON
                        I’ll hang with little Stevie if you 
                        want to try.  
                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 DARLA
                        That’s okay.

                                 ALISON
                        I’d enjoy it.  I can surf anytime...
                (baby voice, to Stevie)
                        ...but I hardly ever get to play 
                        sandcastles with such a handsome boy 
                        like you!  Would you play with me?

           As Stevie buries himself in Darla’s dress--

                                 ALISON
                        My biological clock must be going 
                        off.  Until a few months ago, I 
                        couldn’t stand the sight of 
                        children.  Now all I can think 
                        about is babies, babies, babies!

                                 ADAM
                        I think we’re supposed to go pick 
                        out our surfboards.

                                 ALISON
                        I brought my own.  We’ll meet you 
                        guys in the water.

           Steve kisses Darla, tousles Stevie’s hair...

                                 STEVE
                        Be good to your mum.

           Then trots off with Adam.  Alison looks adoringly at Stevie.

                                 ALISON
                        You’re so lucky you started early.  
                        I’m 37, if Adam doesn’t step up, I 
                        may have to take matters into my own 
                        hands.

                                 DARLA
                        Meaning...?

                                 ALISON
                        Just because we have birth control 
                        pills doesn’t mean we have to take 
                        them.  Once those eggs get crusty 
                        it’s game over.  

           A beat of stunned silence, then--
                                              (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 ALISON
                        Oh my God, they’re in the water!
                (to Senna, as she moves off)
                        Meet me down there.

           As Alison sprints toward the water--

           Darla looks at Senna: Did you hear what I heard?

                                 SENNA
                        Hey, he picked her.

           Alison beckons to Senna.  As she heads off toward the surf--

           HOLD ON Darla, looking stunned.

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Senna stands waist deep in the ocean. Waves are breaking in 
           front of her.  Each time one does, she and her surfboard are 
           PUSHED BACK toward the beach.  A few yards in front of her--

                                 ALISON
                        You got it, babe.  Paddle, paddle 
                        paddle!  Don’t give up!  That’s it!

           Alison cheers Adam on as he fights his way through the impact 
           zone.  He makes it to open water.  Alison rewards him with a 
           kiss.  

           Senna grits her teeth, plunges forward.  A wave starts 
           breaking on top of her.  She paddles with everything she’s 
           got.  Water sprays into her eyes and nose.  She coughs and 
           gasps, then (miraculously!) finds herself--

           OUT AT SEA.  

           Here, beyond the sandbar, the water is smooth as glass.  

           Senna collapses onto her board.  A few feet away--

                                 ADAM
                        Hey!  You made it!

                                 SENNA
                        It was touch and go for awhile 
                        there...

           A few feet away, Alison is surfing toward the shore.  
                                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        It can’t possibly be as easy as 
                        she’s making it look.

                                 ADAM
                        She swam for Stanford, practically 
                        lived in the water.  You’re doing 
                        great.  Steve can’t even get out.  

           ANGLE ON Steve, stuck in the foam.  Alison is running over to 
           help him with such intensity you’d think his life depended on 
           it.  As Senna watches--

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        You guys ready for a lesson?

           The instructor dude paddles up to them.  Senna looks at Adam--

                                 ADAM
                        Go ahead.  I’m waiting for Alison.

                                 SENNA
                        If I drown, Darla gets my shoe 
                        collection.

           Senna follows the instructor to a spot away from the crowd. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        Ok, here comes a wave.  When you 
                        feel it lift your board, paddle.   

                                 SENNA
                        Then what?

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        Hold on and ride it.

           He steers her into position.  A wave starts to lift her up...  

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        Paddle, paddle!  Don’t lean back!

           She paddles, but too little too late.  It gets away.  

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE
                        That’s ok.  Here comes another one.  
                        Paddle, paddle, paddle...

           She tries again.  Misses again.  

                                 INSTRUCTOR DUDE

           Alison, paddling toward Adam-- head down, biceps pumping, 
           talk about committed...

           Senna looks back at the WAVE forming behind her.  She starts 
           paddling, HARD.  As the water lifts her up...  

                                 SENNA
                        Oh my God...

           She gives one last burst.  It pays off.  The wave GRABS her 
           board--  

                                 SENNA
                        Oh my God!  Oh my God!

           She HOLDS ON for dear life as it whisks her toward the beach. 

           As she’s deposited on the shore, she jumps to her feet, looks 
           out at Adam...  

           Her face drops.  Alison is hovering over him.  He didn’t see.  
           As she shakes off her disappointment...

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. COUNTY LINE BEACH - MAGIC HOUR

           Senna lies on her board, staring up into the twilight sky. 
           Adam paddles up to her, calls out-- 

                                 ADAM
                        We’re going to miss our reservation.  

                                 SENNA
                        Where’s Alison?

                                 ADAM
                        She went with Darla and Steve.  She 
                        couldn’t find a place to plug in her 
                        flat iron.  She doesn’t like to go 
                        out with puffy hair.
                (then)
                        She’s missing one hell of a sunset.

                                 SENNA
                        It’s going to be tough, leaving all 
                        this.

           She smiles at him.  He takes her in.  Golden sunlight dances 
           across her eyes and skin.  She’s never looked more beautiful.

                        Yeah, Paris is going to suck.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m not complaining.  

                                 ADAM
                        Are you going to make your models 
                        wear ten foot tall hats out of 
                        feathers and old car parts?

                                 SENNA
                        I’m seeing more faux fur and tree 
                        branches.

                                 ADAM
                        Once you’re a big designer, don’t 
                        forget all us little people you 
                        left behind.

                                 SENNA
                        You’re really settling in here, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 ADAM
                        We can’t all have Paris.
                (then)
                        Last swell of the day, rolling in.

           He points.  Senna looks.  

                                 ADAM
                        You stand up yet?

                                 SENNA
                        Nope.  But I still love myself. 

                                 ADAM
                        There’s no surfing in Paris, you 
                        know.  Might be your last chance.  

                                 SENNA
                        You just want to see me fall flat 
                        on my face.

                                 ADAM
                        No.  I want to see you succeed.  In 
                        everything.

           He smiles at her.  A nice moment, until...

                                 SENNA
                        You are so full of shit.

                        And you’re a scare-dy chicken.

                                 SENNA
                        Yeah, a tired scare-dy chicken.

                                 ADAM
                        You have to get to shore somehow.

                                 SENNA
                        Fine.  I’ll try.  But no laughing!

           Senna moves into position, starts paddling for a wave.  Adam 
           hangs back as it LIFTS her up-- 

                                 ADAM
                        That’s it.  Now move your leg under 
                        you.  Lean forward.  You got it!  
                        Now stand up!  STAND UP!!!

           One at a time, she moves her feet under her, then oh-so-
           gingerly... 

                                 SENNA
                        I’m up!  I’M UP!

           She stands.  As she WHOOPS her way toward the shore...

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK

           Adam jogs up the beach where Senna is already changed into 
           shorts and sitting on a sarong.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry...  I’ll be quick!

           He continues on to his car, parked by the side of the road, 
           pulls the keys from their hiding place, POPS the TRUNK, then 
           tosses his keys inside it.

           Under the cover of his towel, he peels off his wetsuit, then 
           lowers the trunk door to see his clothes in the back seat.

           Teeth chattering, he SLAMS the trunk, moves for the door, 
           STOPS because--

           The towel around his waist is caught in the trunk.  He tugs 
           and tugs.  Not going anywhere.
                                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Shit.
                (calling out)
                        Senna!   SENNA!

           Senna looks up from where she’s sitting, sees him waving her 
           over, wraps her sarong around her waist and joins him--

           AT THE CAR.

                                 ADAM
                        I have a little problem.

                                 SENNA
                        So I see.

                                 ADAM
                        My clothes are in the backseat.  
                        C’mon I’m cold!

                                 SENNA
                        The things I do for you...

           She goes to open the car door.  It’s locked.

                                 SENNA
                        I need the keys.
                (off his blank look)
                        You locked your keys in the trunk.  
                        Nice move, counsellor.  Now what?

           Adam looks around.  It’s late, everyone else is gone.  

                                 ADAM
                        There’s a bar across the street.  

           Senna looks across the street at the HONKY TONK BAR.  The 
           parking lot is full of PICK-UP TRUCKS.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sure if you tell them it’s an 
                        emergency they’ll let you use the 
                        phone.  

                                 SENNA
                        I’m not leaving you here to freeze.

                                 ADAM
                        We don’t exactly have a lot of other 
                        options.

           Senna considers his predicament a beat, then--
                                                 (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Sarong or shorts?

           Opens her sarong to reveal her stretchy, gold shorts.  As 
           Adam considers his choices...

                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. HONKY TONK BAR - MAGIC HOUR

                                 ADAM
                        Are my balls sticking out?

           Senna looks at Adam’s ass, hugged by her high-cut shorts.  
           He’s also wearing her tank top.  It is VERY tight on him.

                                 SENNA
                        Not noticeably.

           She ushers him--

           INSIDE THE BAR.

           It’s packed to the gills with girls with big hair and guys in 
           tight wranglers and clunky cowboy boots. 

           ON STAGE 

           A portly COWBOY sings a Karaoke cover of classic Garth Brooks.

                                 SENNA
                        These guys are serious about their 
                        Karaoke.

                        Come on.

           As Adam leads Senna toward the bar, several patrons turn to 
           look.  Adam signals to the BARTENDER--

                                 ADAM
                        I locked my keys in my car, any 
                        chance I could use your phone?

                                 BARTENDER
                        C’mon back.

           As Adam follows the bartender behind the bar--

           Senna gets an idea.  Through the crowd she weaves, toward the 
           stage to where the KARAOKE DJ is spinning.  
                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)           She whispers something in his ear, he nods and smiles.  When 
           she returns to the bar--

                                 ADAM
                        There you are!  I thought maybe you 
                        rode off into the sunset with Garth.

                                 SENNA
                        Hey, the night is young.

                                 ADAM
                        Alison has my extra key.  They were 
                        already on their way to dinner, so 
                        it shouldn’t be too long.

           Just then, the DJ interrupts:

                                 KARAOKE DJ
                        Jody’s supposed to be up next, but 
                        we have birthday in the house...

           The DJ points at Senna.  The crowd turns to look.  Several 
           members hoot and cheer.  She waves her appreciation.

                                 KARAOKE DJ
                        Our birthday girl has asked that 
                        her special friend be allowed to 
                        come up here and sing her favorite 
                        song.  Whadday’all say?

           The crowd applauds.  Adam suddenly gets very nervous.

                                 ADAM
                        You didn’t.

                                 KARAOKE DJ
                        So let’s give a big hand to Adam as 
                        he serenades his birthday girl.

                                 ADAM
                        You bitch! 

           He waves as the crowd applauds him, then shakes his head to 
           indicate thanks but no thanks.

           Senna gives him an incredulous look, then turns to the crowd 
           for help.  They start chanting his name.

                                 CROWD
                        A-dam!  A-dam!

           He has no choice.  He hisses at Senna, makes his way up to 
           the stage.  The crowd goes wild at the sight of him. 
                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 COWBOY
                        Nice legs!

                                 KARAOKE DJ
                        I hope you sing better than you 
                        dress.

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t.  I’m worse.

           A standard, slightly corny country-western song comes on. 

                                 ADAM
                        For the birthday girl.

           Adam takes a deep breath, starts to sing.  A rough start.  
           Very rough.

           The lyrics are hopelessly hokey.  The only way to pull this 
           off is to go for it.  So he does.

           He grabs the mic with both hands.  He’s getting into it now.  
           The CROWD goes wild.  Senna is laughing, totally endeared.

           The lyrics turn.  What was hokey suddenly feels strangely 
           meaningful: the things they wish they could say to each 
           other, if it weren’t too late...

           Adam looks at Senna, holds her eyes as he sings.  She blinks 
           back tears.  Why does this hurt so much?

           The song ends.  The room EXPLODES with applause.  They love 
           him.  And then it hits her, hard.  She loves him.  

           She bites her lip.  Her eyes are wet.  As she pushes her pain 
           back down into her chest--

                                 KARAOKE DJ
                        Well.  That was memorable.  Thank 
                        you Adam. 

           Adam curtsies, then hops off the stage, weaves his way 
           through his adoring fans to--

           THE BAR, where Senna is waiting.

                                 ADAM
                        Happy Birthday.

           He smiles at her.  Her heart is pounding.  She might just 
           kiss him, except...
                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 ALISON
                        Adam?  What the hell are you 
                        wearing?

           Alison, Steve and Darla are standing right behind them.  

                                 ADAM
                        Alison!

                                 ALISON
                        I have your key, you can change in 
                        the car.

           As she beckons for him to follow her--

                                 BARTENDER
                        From the gals at the end.

           The bartender puts a pitcher of beer in front of him, 
           indicates two BIG HAIRED GIRLS sitting at the end of the bar.  
           Adam looks.  They wave and smile. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        In appreciation of your inspired 
                        vocal performance.

               ALISON
                                 DARLA
           You sang?
                          You sang?

                                 ALISON
                        You told me you were tone deaf.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Oh, he is.

                                 ALISON
                        If we leave right now we can still 
                        make our reservation--

                                 DARLA
                        We can’t just walk out on a free 
                        pitcher of beer.  

                                 ALISON
                        There’s no place to sit--

                                 BARTENDER
                        There’s another room in the back.  
                        How many are you?

                                 DARLA
                        Five.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 BARTENDER
                (to the HOSTESS)
                        You got a table for five in the 
                        back?

                                 HOSTESS
                        You betcha.  Follow me.

           She grabs their pitcher.   Adam looks at Senna: this okay?

                                 SENNA
                        Yeah, great.

           As Adam falls in behind Senna and the hostess--

                                 ALISON
                (not really a question)
                        You’re not staying in that outfit?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m kind of enjoying the feel of 
                        sticky vinyl on my anus.

                                 ALISON
                        You look obscene.

           Adam feels his friends watching, tries not to show his 
           embarrassment.

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll meet you guys back there.

                                 ALISON
                        I’m going to call the restaurant.

           Alison falls in behind Adam, nudges him toward the door.  We 
           can hear her railing on him as they disappear into the crowd.

                                 ALISON
                        I hope you never want to eat at 
                        Nobu, they don’t appreciate last 
                        minute cancellations.

           Darla looks at Senna. 

                                 SENNA
                        Staying out of it.

                                    CUT TO:
                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           INT. HONKY TONK BAR - LATER

                                 ALISON
                        This one’s from me.

           The table is covered with remnants of cheap bar food.  Adam 
           has his arm around Alison as Senna opens her present: BOOKS 
           about Paris: a Zagats, a phrase book, an insider’s shopping 
           guide...  Darla looks like she wants to murder her.

                                 SENNA
                        Quelles bons cadeaux!  Merci!

           Steve flips through the Zagats guide.

                                 STEVE
                        I was just reading an article about 
                        the couple who started Zagats.  The 
                        very first Guide they did was for 
                        Paris.  They called it Le Guide de 
                        Guides.  It was one page long.

                                 ALISON
                        Adam told me you’ve never been.  I 
                        spent my entire junior year in Paris!  
                        I won’t warn you about the men, 
                        because I’m sure you know they’re all 
                        out for one thing... but you probably 
                        like that!

           As Senna tries not to look insulted by the comment--

           A WAITRESS arrives with more beer.  Darla spies a book of 
           matches on her tray, plucks them off, starts divvying them up.

                                 STEVE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DARLA
                        We’re playing a game.  It’s really 
                        simple.  It’s called ‘I have 
                        never.’  We go around the circle.  
                        When it’s your turn, you have to 
                        say something you’ve never done, 
                        like ‘I have never... driven a 
                        Ferrari.’  If anybody has done it, 
                        they give you a matchstick.  The 
                        person holding all the matchsticks 
                        at the end is the winner.  
                        Everybody got it?
                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        What do we get if we win?

                                 DARLA
                        You’re not going to win so don’t 
                        worry about it.  I’ll start.  I 
                        have never... been to Paris.

           Adam and Alison each give Darla a match.  Darla glares at Adam.

                                 DARLA
                        When were you in Paris?

                                 ADAM
                        What, you think I’m lying?

                                 STEVE
                        If you’re going to challenge 
                        everybody we’ll be here all night. 
                (as Darla makes a face)
                        Alison, you go next.

                                 ALISON
                        Oh.  Ok.  I have never... locked my 
                        keys in my car.

           Adam tosses a match to Alison, then looks at the others:

                                 ADAM
                        None of you have ever locked your 
                        keys in your car?  

                                 DARLA
                        No.  Go.

                                 ADAM
                        I have never... seen ‘Gone with the 
                        Wind.’

           No matches for Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        No one here’s seen ‘Gone with the 
                        Wind?’  What’s wrong with you 
                        people?

                                 STEVE
                        My turn.  I have never... gone to a 
                        nudie beach.

           Darla and Adam each hand over a match.  Alison raises an 
           eyebrow at Adam.
                                                       (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        The debate club went to St. Barts.  

                                 DARLA
                        Yes, he’s seen everyone at this 
                        table naked.  Senna’s turn.

                                 SENNA
                        Ok.  I have never...
                (devious smile)
                        Had sex with a girl.

           Senna gets a match from Adam, Steve and Darla.

                                 ALISON
                        Wow, Darla!  What haven’t you done?

                                 DARLA
                        Well, I have never contemplated 
                        tricking my boyfriend into getting 
                        me pregnant.

           Darla holds out her hand, in anticipation of getting a match. 

                                 ADAM
                        What is she talking about?

                                 ALISON
                        It was a joke, but whatever.

           She tosses a match at Darla.  

                                 ADAM
                        What was the joke?

                                 ALISON
                        We’ll talk about it later.  

                                 ADAM
                        What’s wrong with now?  

           Alison feels everyone looking at her.

                                 ALISON
                        Who’s turn is it?

                                 STEVE
                        Yours.

                                 ALISON
                        I have never... smoked pot.

           As she smugly collects matches from everyone--
                                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        I’m out of matches.

                                 DARLA
                        You can still take your turn.  Just 
                        make sure you get one.  

                                 SENNA
                        Unlike last time.

                                 ADAM
                        I can’t think of anything.

                                 SENNA
                        Scare-dy chicken.

                                 ADAM
                        Fine.  I have never intentionally 
                        humiliated a friend in front of a 
                        crowd of rowdy cowboys.

                                 SENNA
                (tossing him a match)
                        You loved every minute of it.

                                 ADAM
                        What if I did?

           He holds her eyes a beat.  Darla watches them intently: 
           what’s going on...?

                                 STEVE
                        My turn.  I have never been to 
                        Vegas.

           Steve gets matches from Darla and Alison.  Senna looks 
           expectantly at Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        What? 

                                 SENNA
                        You’ve been to Vegas.

                                 ADAM
                        I didn’t go.

                                 SENNA
                        You didn’t go?  

                                 ADAM
                        I wasn’t feeling it.
                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 ALISON
                        What are you guys talking about?

                                 ADAM
                        I had tickets-- a ticket-- to Vegas, 
                        but I never got on the plane.

                                 ALISON
                        So you didn’t get on the plane, 
                        what’s the big deal?  Senna, it’s 
                        your turn.

           Senna stares at Adam.  She’s a swirl of emotion: pissed off, 
           relieved, but most of all...

                                 SENNA
                        Fine.  I have never...  given 
                        everything I’ve got to a 
                        relationship.

           ...Regretful.  Not surprisingly, no one offers up a match.

                                 SENNA
                        Well, I guess I’m the only one.  

           Darla looks at Senna and Adam, looking at each other...

                                 STEVE
                        Who’s turn is it?

                                 DARLA
                        Mine.  I have never...

           She glances at Alison, with her perfect hair and perfect 
           posture, then at Adam, deserving of so much more...

                                 DARLA
                        ...walked out on the love of my 
                        life.

           Deafening silence.  No one moves or breathes.

                                 DARLA
                        What?  No matches for me?

           After a long, tense beat, Adam slides his last remaining 
           match stick across the table, to Darla.   

                                 DARLA
                        Thought so.

           The color drains from Alison’s face.  She stands...
                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 ALISON
                        Well, thank you all for a memorable 
                        evening. 

           ...Then leaves the table.  

                                 ADAM
                        Shit.

           As Adam gets up and hurries after her--  

                                 STEVE
                        Brilliant.

           Senna picks up the fateful matchstick, turns it over in her 
           hand... then SCRAMBLES out of the booth, through the crowd 
           and out into--

           THE PARKING LOT.  

           Adam and Alison are nowhere in sight.  She gazes out toward 
           the beach, sees--

           Adam’s CAR, pulling out onto PCH.  Alison is driving it.  
           Adam stands on the beach, watching her go.  

           Senna charges toward the street.  It’s very dark.  As she 
           steps off the curb--

           A car HONKS at her.  She lets it pass, makes a run for it.

           ON THE BEACH

           Adam has sat down in the sand, has his head in his hands.   
           Senna approaches.  After a nervous beat--

                                 SENNA
                        Fun game, huh?

           He looks up.  Isn’t smiling.

                                 SENNA
                        Sorry.

                                 ADAM
                        Don’t apologize.  Wouldn’t be your 
                        birthday if I didn’t walk out on a 
                        relationship.

                                 SENNA
                        Hey!  I was the one who wouldn’t 
                        get on the plane. 
                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        So I gave you $20 bucks and left 
                        you in the parking lot.  Classy. 

                                 SENNA
                        I was a horrible, moody pain in the 
                        ass.  I would have left me there, 
                        too.  

                                 ADAM
                        I just couldn’t understand why you 
                        kept changing your mind about 
                        everything. 

                                 SENNA
                        I only changed my mind once.  When 
                        I realized I did believe in 
                        marriage, if it was with you.

                                 ADAM
                        The why didn’t you marry me?

                                 SENNA
                        Because I wanted you to want it as 
                        bad as I did.  To tell me that if I 
                        wouldn’t marry you, you would die.  
                        That sounds so stupid now.  I mean, 
                        clearly you’re not dead.

                                 ADAM
                        Neither are you.

                                 SENNA
                        No, I’m not dead.  But I’m not 
                        really alive, either.  Not like I 
                        was when we were together.  I 
                        accept that you can live without 
                        me.  But I can’t live without you.

           She falls onto one knee, offers up the match...

                                 SENNA
                        Marry me.  

           Adam looks at her.  Can’t believe his ears.

                                 SENNA
                        I’m on one knee, here.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you serious?
                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Yes, Adam.  I’m serious.  I’m 
                        asking you to marry me.

                                 ADAM
                        Say it again.

                                 SENNA
                        Marry me--

                                 ADAM
                        Say it again.

                                 SENNA
                        Adam Pierce, will you marry me?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

           He pulls her to him.  As they melt into a kiss...

                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN ON:

           Senna.  In a MEDIUM CLOSE-UP.

                                 SENNA
                        My most memorable birthday was...  
                        Oh God, I don’t know.  

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        You said you’d do this.

                                 SENNA
                        You were around for most of them.  
                        Pick one.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        The point of the research is to 
                        hear what you remember.  Being 
                        disappointed, feeling alone and 
                        forgotten, being surprised beyond 
                        your wildest dreams...

                                 SENNA
                        Yes.  I remember all those things.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Senna! 
                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 SENNA
                        Ok, ok, I got it.  I know what my 
                        most memorable birthday was.  
                        Seven.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        You remember your seventh birthday?

                                 SENNA
                        Of course.  My mom and I had just 
                        moved from Pasadena ‘cause my dad 
                        died and she didn’t want to stay in 
                        that big house any more.  I had 
                        only been in school two weeks so 
                        the only person I knew was you.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Say ‘Darla’.

                                 SENNA
                        The only person I knew was Darla. 
                        She was my neighbor and in my 
                        class, though you’d never know it, 
                        she looked more like a pre-schooler 
                        than a second grader.  

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        I did not look like a pre-schooler--

                                 SENNA
                        That’s why we became friends.  The 
                        runt and the new girl.  The day 
                        before my birthday, I asked Darla 
                        if she would come over the next day 
                        for cake.  She doesn’t even like 
                        cake, but she came.  I don’t think 
                        I even told her it was my birthday.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        You didn’t.

                                 SENNA
                        That’s right.  Because you ran home 
                        to get one of your Barbie’s--

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Actually, I think it was Skipper.  I 
                        wouldn’t have parted with a Barbie.

                                 SENNA
                        Whatever it was, it didn’t matter.  
                        You saved my birthday.

                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                 SENNA(cont'd)

                        And since then, you’ve never let me 
                        down.  Not ever.

           Senna smiles.  As Darla charges INTO FRAME and crushes her in 
           a HUG, we...

                        How’s the book?

                                 ADAM
                        Interesting.

           Adam and Senna wear shiny wedding bands as they sip cafe au 
           lait at a small table in a Parisian cafe.  Adam’s reading:

           Darla’s BOOK: “A Little Something for your Birthday”

                                 SENNA
                        She said it’s not really about 
                        birthdays.  It’s about expectations.  
                        How they screw up our lives.  

                                 ADAM
                (trying to read)
                        Uh-huh.

                                 SENNA
                        She studied birthdays because our 
                        expectations about them are so 
                        heightened.
                (then, peering over his 
                 shoulder)
                        Am I in it?

                                 ADAM
                        Don’t know yet.

                                 SENNA
                        I told a really good story.

                (still trying to read)
                        Mmm-hmmm.

                                 SENNA
                (not letting him)
                        People are funny about their 
                        birthdays, huh?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, they have to be the center of 
                        attention the whole day.

                                 SENNA
                        Okay, okay.  Fine.  I’ll read it 
                        when you’re done.

                                 ADAM
                        I love you.

                                 SENNA
                        Love you too.  
                (then)
                        What page are you on?

           He offers her the book.  She hesitates...  

                                 SENNA
                        No, it’s okay.  I can wait.

                        Chapter 3: Living in the moment.

           As Adam reads aloud and Senna settles back in her chair, we 
           PULL BACK to see:

           A pint-size replica of the EIFFEL TOWER.  Turns out we’re not 
           in Paris, we’re in VEGAS.  At the PARIS HOTEL. 

           As the sun dips below the glittering sunset strip, we... 

                                 FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END.
