           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY 

           Home video footage of an African-American HAND holding up a 
           TUXEDO. We hear the elderly voice of its owner:

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        This was the tux I wore on my first 
                        day workin’ at the White House on 
                        September 8, 1957. 

           The video camera pans over to CECIL GAINS, 90, African-
           American. He is a kind, gentle soul wearing comfy sweatpants 
           and a sweatshirt. We hear the male voice of the CAMERA MAN:

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Who was your favorite president? 

           Cecil smiles. He would never say who his favorite was.

                                 CECIL
                        I liked them all very much. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Even Nixon?

                                 CECIL
                        I especially liked Mr. Nixon, and 
                        Mrs. Nixon was just lovely. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        What about LBJ?

           Cecil starts to laugh. 

                                 CECIL
                        Well, he was...different, that’s 
                        fo’ sure, but a very special man. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Did you ever meet a person you 
                        didn’t like?

           Cecil thinks about it, then his smile slowly drops.  

                                 CECIL
                        If the Devil wore a green bow in 
                        his hair, the good Lord woulda’ 
                        named him Annabeth Lewis. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. LEWIS HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 

           ANNABETH LEWIS, 45, white, plump, wears a lacy dress and a 
           green bow in her hair. She screams at a young Cecil, 8.   

           CHYRON: 1926

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        Every single field nigger on this 
                        farm wants to work inside the 
                        house! Why in the name of the lord 
                        and sweet baby Jesus should I take 
                        a puny little nigger like you?!

           Terrified, little Cecil stares out at thirty black FIELD 
           WORKERS picking cotton in the hot sun. 

                                 CECIL
                        My ma just passed and my pa been 
                        gone a long tim--

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        Boo hoo! Little nigger don’t have 
                        no kin! Give me a real reason, boy!

           Little Cecil shivers, terrified: 

                                 CECIL
                        Cuz...cuz...I think yo’ green bow 
                        is awful nice, Mrs. Lewis.

           Her face turns bright red in anger. 

           INT. LEWIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Annabeth is in the kitchen arranging chicken with lemon 
           slices on an ornate gold tray. Cecil pays close attention. 

                                 ANNABETH WILLIAMS
                        When you’re servin’ you need to be 
                        as quiet as you can. I don’t even 
                        want to hear you breathe. 

           A little scared, Cecil nods. 

                                 ANNABETH WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
                        The room should feel emptier when 
                        you’re in it cuz no one likes a 
                        nigger.  You understand me, boy?

           Cecil nods with simplicity, he understands. 
           INT. LEWIS HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil stands behind Annabeth holding a bowl of potatoes that 
           she scoops on to her HUSBAND and three pre-teen SON’S plates. 
           Cecil holds his breathe, struggling to not make a peep.

           Annabeth serves with a distinct elegance, very delicate. 
           Cecil closely eyes her every move as he quickly sips a tiny 
           breathe, then looks around to see if anyone noticed.

           INT. TIN SHACK - NIGHT

           Little Cecil lies awake in a tin shack filled with five other 
           sleeping African-Americans of all ages. Everyone is crammed 
           on the dirty floor, barely able to stretch their legs out. 

           Lying on his back, Cecil mimes pouring water. Practicing. 

           INT. STUDY - DAY

           Cecil pours iced tea for Annabeth who reads Marie Curie’s 
           autobiography. He puts in two spoon fulls of sugar and stirs. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        This is the one day I don’t want 
                        sugar. Make me another. 

           Disappointed, Cecil takes the glass and walks away. 

           CUT TO - LATER

           Cecil walks back in with another iced tea.

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        Is there honey in it?

           The look on his face clearly says no. 

           CUT TO - LATER 

           He walks back in and places another iced tea next to her. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve decided I don’t want honey, I 
                        want sugar after all. 

                                 CECIL
                        I brought it plain along with some 
                        options, Mrs. Lewis. 
           He gestures in Annabeth’s stylish manner toward the tray 
           where there is a filled sugar bowl, a tiny jar of honey, 
           lemon and lime slices, marble tea cakes and oatmeal cookies. 

           Annabeth forces herself not to smile as she gives Cecil a 
           slight head bow. He is stunned at the first positive gesture. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        There are no stirring spoo--

           But Cecil is already stirring it with a silver stirring 
           spoon. He sets it on a tray, then gives a slight head bow. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        Do you read, Cecil?

                                 CECIL
                        No, Mrs. Lewis. 

           She goes back to her book, flicks her hand at him to leave.

           EXT. LEWIS HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Cecil walks into the family library filled with leather bound 
           books. He opens a book and stares at the maze of words. We 
           hear 90 year old Cecil in V.O.: 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I’d never seen anything so 
                        confusing in all my life. 

           INT. TIN SHACK - NIGHT

           Cecil sits in the corner as everyone sleeps. Using a candle, 
           he places his finger under each word, silently mouthing it.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        But after awhile I started to get 
                        it.

           INT. BACK PORCH - LEWIS HOME - NIGHT 

           Cecil is now 15 years old. He sits on the back porch eating 
           grungy meat and potatoes next to the family dog, reading a 
           copy of ‘Huckleberry Finn’. He looks up from the book, sad.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Those books ended up being the 
                        worst thing to ever happen to me. 
           EXT. COTTON FIELDS - SUNSET

           Cecil walks around the cotton field, he looks deeply unhappy. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Until I started readin’, I always 
                        thought the world ended at the edge 
                        of the cotton farm. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Annabeth and Cecil serve the family. Annabeth sets fish on a 
           plate and Cecil debones it like a pro. A well oiled duo.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I decided I wasn’t gone read no mo’ 
                        books. 

           Annabeth has a huge fake smile, a servant in her own family. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        But it was too late...

           INT. STUDY - NIGHT

           Seated at her chair, Annabeth stares up at Cecil, can’t 
           believe what she’s just heard. She looks almost sad.  

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        But...why?

                                 CECIL
                        I wanna see some of the things I 
                        been readin’ about. I been savin’ 
                        up for almost three year now. 

           Her face becomes very stoic. She goes back to her book. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS
                        That’s fine. Leave when you like. 

           She flicks him away. He stares at her, surprised and hurt 
           that this is it after all these years. He walks to the door. 

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        Cecil.

           Cecil stops, looks back at her. There are tears in her eyes.

                                 ANNABETH LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to be a paleontologist.  
           INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

           Cecil rides the rails in a freight train car with a knapsack. 
           He stares at the barren landscape that flies by, enthralled. 

           Seated across from him are two grimy HOBOES, white. Excited 
           by the ride, Cecil smiles at them...they don’t smile back.

           INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - MORNING

           Sunlight beams in on a sleeping Cecil, blood CAKES his head. 
           He struggles to wake up as he feels the pain. He darts awake 
           as he looks around - everything he has is gone.  

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Walking down a dirt road with a blood soaked rag to his head, 
           he passes a charred abandoned factory with broken windows.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I started to understand why they 
                        were callin’ it a Depression.

           A PRISON TRUCK drives by full of BLACK PRISONERS, all chained 
           together. Cecil stares at the truck, scared this will be him. 

           EXT. BREAD LINE - CHURCH - DAY

           A line of ragged looking white men, women and kids, are lined 
           up in a grimy bread line. They SCREAM and hiss at Cecil. 

                                 WHITE CROWD
                        Go away!/Leave here!/Die, nigger!

           Little kids throw stones and rocks at him. Cecil runs away. 

           INT. TIN SHACK - DAY

           A rainstorm hammers down upon Cecil who cradles himself in a 
           small tin shack. Water drips on his head. Drip Drip Drip.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I would dream I was cleaning gold 
                        flatware... 

           He looks like he’s slowly going mad. Drip Drip Drip. 
           EXT. COUNTRY TOWN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Cecil stumbles in to a country town through pouring rain. He 
           peers in a window of a closed country store, sees groceries.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...and serving chicken au poivre 
                        from a silver tray.  

           Transformed into a depraved soul, he finds a large rock, 
           picks it up to throw it through the window...

           ...but he suddenly STOPS as he sees a glow in the distance. 
           He slowly walks through the rain toward the glowing light. 
           The closer he gets, the more his eyes fill with fascination. 

           He walks right up to an ornate glass window at a beautiful 
           Southern HOTEL. Through the window he sees... 

           Three BLACK MEN in elegant black tuxedos. They are placing 
           gold forks next to china dishes in an opulent dining room. 

           INT. KITCHEN - HOTEL - DAY

           Having cleaned up a touch, he is in the kitchen of the hotel. 
           The HEAD BUTLER, black, 40’s, glares at him with a meanness.

                                 HEAD BUTLER
                        So tell me, boy, why in the hell 
                        should I hire you!?

           Cecil turns to him with a warm smile, completely at ease.

                                 CECIL
                        I have found that it is better to 
                        serve, than be served.

           The Head Butler tries not to smile.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil is seated on a chair, still being filmed. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        When did you end up in DC?

                                 CECIL
                        Ah, come on now. I got to start 
                        gettin’ ready for tonight. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Just a few more questions. 
           Cecil sighs, resigned. 

                                 CECIL
                        I got to Washington DC about ten 
                        years later. I went there to enlist 
                        so I could fight in the war...

           INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - LOBBY - WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           A WEALTHY COUPLE walks in to the grand lobby of the Hotel. 
           Waiting for them with scotch on a silver tray is Cecil, now 
           25. He wears a black vest and tie, exudes class and grace.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...but the army wasn’t so 
                        interested in takin’ negroes. 

           INT. WINE CELLAR - DAY

           Cecil delicately pours red wine into a glass decanter, a lit 
           candle under it to see the sediments more clearly.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        And the negroes they did take, they 
                        only used for cleanin’ and servin’. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Cecil shakes a martini shaker with grace and style. He twists 
           off the top and effortlessly pours the martini into a glass. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        But I wouldn’t have minded. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Cecil hangs a guest’s suit and shirt into the closet, then 
           checks the buttons on the shirt, one at a time. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I would’ve been happy servin’ a 
                        Colonel escargot in France...

           Discovering one of the buttons is loose, he pulls out a 
           needle and thread from his pocket and begins to re-sew it. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        ...or pouring a General jasmine tea 
                        in Tokyo. 
           Then, he hears CRYING in the next room. He peaks in and sees 
           the shy maid, GLORIA, 22, black, crying on the floor. 

                                 CECIL
                        What’s the matter, Gloria?

           She holds up a white dress shirt covered in a red wine stain. 

                                 GLORIA
                        The glass slipped. 
                             (Starts crying again)
                        I can’t lose this job, Cecil. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Cecil holds the shirt under the sink as he vigorously rubs a 
           bar of soap over the stain. She watches him, impressed. 

                                 CECIL
                        There’s magic in a simple bar of 
                        soap, but it only works if the 
                        water is real hot.  

           He holds it up, the stain is coming out. She smiles. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Everyone say you real kind. 

                                 CECIL
                        Ah, it ain’t nothin’.

           But she keeps smiling at him...

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Gloria stands in front of a PASTOR, wears a wedding dress. 

                                 GLORIA
                        I do. 

           CUT TO - CECIL. He is next to her, looks slightly terrified.

                                 CECIL
                        I do. 

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           A wedding reception is being held in the basement. A jazz 
           band plays as dozens of people dance, drink and celebrate. 
                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I didn’t have no kin folk there, 
                        but Gloria sho’ made up for it. 

           Cecil walks around serving cocktails. Gloria hurries over and 
           takes the tray. He shrugs, embarrassed, just can’t help it. 

           She escorts him to the dance floor as the band plays a slow 
           tune. They slow dance, foreheads touching, madly in love.  

                                 CECIL
                        Should I bring out hors devours?

           She shakes her head, no. Kisses him on the mouth. 

           INT. COLORED HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Cecil carries Gloria into their honeymoon suite, a dank room 
           with dirty carpets. They look like they are in Heaven.

           INT. COLORED HOTEL - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           They lie in bed next to each other, cuddling. Gloria looks 
           blissful, but Cecil seems pensive. 

                                 GLORIA
                        What’s wrong, baby doll?

                                 CECIL
                        I was just thinkin’ about Annabeth 
                        Lewis. 

                                 GLORIA
                        That mean ole cracker woman? 

                                 CECIL
                        I feel so sad for her.
                             (Turns to Gloria)
                        She neve’ had no one love her the 
                        way I’m gonna love you. 

           Gloria starts to beam. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna give you a house and a 
                        family and I’m gonna take care of 
                        us for the rest of our lives. 
                        Nothin’ ever gonna tear my family 
                        apart. You hear me, honey bear?

                                 GLORIA
                        I hear you, baby doll. 
           INT. STAFF CHANGING ROOM - HOTEL - DAY

           Cecil changes his clothes in the run down locker room. The 
           HOTEL MANAGER, 50’s, white, walks in. He looks concerned.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        Cecil, there’s a problem. 

                                 CECIL
                        What is it?

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        Gloria is in the hospital.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DAY

           Cecil stands outside the hotel trying to hail a taxi, but 
           none will stop. Panicked, he sees the Wealthy Couple getting 
           into a Bentley. An awkward look as they know he needs a ride.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Cecil runs down a street waving at cabs that won’t stop. He 
           sprints past a store with a ‘WHITES ONLY’ sign on it. 

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           Cecil runs past the US Capitol Building. 

           EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

           He runs past the Supreme Court of the United States. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           He hurries down the hallway of a dilapidated hospital, finds 
           the door he’s looking for. A young NURSE, black, stops him. 

                                 NURSE
                        You can’t go in there. She needs 
                        rest. 

                                 CECIL
                        Please, I need to see her-- 

                                 NURSE
                        I said ya can’t go--

           But he moves past her and hurries in to the room. 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Lying on a hospital bed in a room with four other PATIENTS is 
           Gloria, she looks terrible, exhausted. Cecil hurries to her. 

                                 CECIL
                        You okay, honey bear?

                                 GLORIA
                        Your son came early, baby doll. 

           Tears fill his eyes at the news. 

                                 CECIL
                        It’s a boy?

           She nods. 

                                 GLORIA
                        And he don’t wait for no one. 

           INT. MATERNITY WARD - NIGHT

           Cecil is in the hospital nursery holding his newborn baby BOY 
           who cries with all the other newborns. Cecil is in love. 

                                 CECIL
                        I promise I’ll never leave you, 
                        Louis.

           His son continues to cry. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Nothin’ ever gonna tear us apart. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           The Gains house is packed with many NEIGHBORS, all African 
           American, as Cecil walks around serving all of his friends 
           fried chicken, biscuits and corn on the cob on a silver tray.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Everything was real nice for a long 
                        time.  

           Seated by himself in the corner is LOUIS, now 12 years old, a 
           little chubby, he reads a comic book.

                                 CECIL
                        You wanna join the group, Louis?
           Cecil nods to the BOYS seated in the living room. Louis 
           shrugs, ‘not really’. Cecil gives him an understanding wink. 

           A fun neighbor, HOWARD, 40’s, charismatic, grills the boys.  

                                 HOWARD
                        What do you want to be when you 
                        grow up, Elroy?

           A small boy in army fatigues, ELROY, 8, points at Cecil. 

                                 ELROY
                        I wanna work at a fancy hotel just 
                        like Mr. Gains. 

           The room ‘ahhhs’ as Elroy’s mom, GINA, heavy, smiles. 

                                 GINA
                        That’s my boy. 

                                 HOWARD
                        What about you, Louis? You want to 
                        work at a hotel like your dad?

           The room turns to Louis who looks unsure, a touch lost. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I...I don’t know. 

           There is a moment of silence, Cecil looks almost embarrassed. 

                                 HOWARD
                        That’s alright, Louis, you take 
                        your time. 

           Cecil smiles at Louis, but it’s clear there’s the slightest 
           ounce of concern for his son who’s a touch different. 

           INT. EXCELSIOR HOTEL - DINING ROOM - DAY 

           Holding a tray of martinis, Cecil approaches a table of 
           WEALTHY MEN. A man with CREW CUT, 40’s, stern, searches his 
           pocket for matches as he listens to a LOUD PATRON. 

                                 LOUD PATRON
                        The best decision that court ever 
                        made was to slow the whole mess 
                        down. Nigger boys in school with 
                        white girls?! Hell, we’d have 
                        another civil war! 

           He sets his scotch down close to the table’s edge. Cecil 
           glances at it, then notes how full the other glasses are. 
                                 LOUD PATRON (CONT’D)
                        Cecil, what do you think of nigger 
                        kids in school with white folks? 

           All eyes turn to Cecil, the Crew Cut Man paying particular 
           attention as he keeps searching for matches. 

                                 CECIL
                             (Refined voice)
                        To be honest, Mr. Jenkins, I tend 
                        not to be too concerned with 
                        American or European politics. 

           The Crew Cut Man smiles, liked the answer. 

                                 LOUD PATRON
                        Nor should you, Cecil, they’re all 
                        criminals. Earl Warren should be 
                        hanged. He’s the dumb son-of-a-
                        bitch judge that said it was okay 
                        to integrate the schools. 

                                 CECIL
                        I think Judge Warren is going to 
                        find that quite a challenge.

                                 LOUD PATRON
                        Damn, straight, Cecil!

           He pats Cecil on the back, knocking the scotch off the table. 
           In one motion, Cecil CATCHES it, places it in on the table 
           and LIGHTS the Crew Cut Man’s cigar with his other hand. 

                                 CECIL
                        More spirits, gentleman?

           Puffing out smoke, the Crew Cut Man grins at Cecil.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I didn’t know it then...

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil stares forward, lost in thought. 

                                 CECIL
                        ...but things were about to change. 

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Seated by himself reading a comic book, Louis notices a group 
           of kids huddled around something. He walks over to them. 
                                 LOUIS
                        What are ya all lookin’ at?

           A TEEN holds up a copy of Jet Magazine opened to a gruesome 
           picture of a black teen boy’s CORPSE with a mutilated face. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Who’s that?

                                 TEEN
                        Emmet Till. Some crackers did this 
                        to ‘em in Mississippi for talkin’ 
                        to a white girl.

                                 LOUIS
                        How old was he?

                                 TEEN
                        Fourteen. 

           Louis can’t help it, he starts to cry.

           INT. CECIL’S CAR - DAY

           Cecil drives Louis home from school in his Ford 2 door. Louis 
           stares in silence at his lower class neighborhood of small, 
           but lively storefronts - grocers, liquor stores, restaurants. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m sorry I got so upset at school.

                                 CECIL
                        That magazine neve’ shoulda 
                        published that picture. They should 
                        be ashamed of themselves.   

           Louis looks at his father. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Why did they kill him?

                                 CECIL
                        Who?

                                 LOUIS
                        Emmet Till. He didn’t do nuthin’. 

           Cecil doesn’t answer at first. Then - 

                                 CECIL
                        The law is different fo’ colored 
                        folk than it is fo’ white folk. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CECIL (CONT'D)
                        There’s certain things that colored 
                        folk can’t do or say.
                             (Then)
                        Never get in trouble with the law, 
                        Louis, and you’ll be just fine. 

           Louis stares at him, uneasy with what his dad just told him.

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil is changing into his street clothes when the Hotel 
           Manager sticks his head into the room, he looks concerned. 

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        Are you in trouble with the law? 

                                 CECIL
                        No, sir. 

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        The Secret Service just called me 
                        asking about you. 

           Cecil stares at him, baffled. 

           EXT. BLAIR HOUSE - DAY

           Cecil walks up to the Blair House, a federal-style townhouse 
           that faces the WHITE HOUSE. He glances at the White House, 
           takes a breath, then walks into the Blair House. 

           INT. FREDDIE FALLOW’S OFFICE - BLAIR HOUSE - DAY

           Cecil sits in a small office, finely furnished with turn of 
           the century antiques. He sits across from FREDDIE FALLOWS, 
           black, mid-50’s, has the formality of English royalty.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Are you political, Mr. Gains?

                                 CECIL
                        No, sir. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Good, we have no tolerance for 
                        politics at the White House. 

           Slight beat. 
                                 CECIL
                        Forgive me for asking, but how did 
                        you find me?

                                 FREDDIE
                             (Icy)
                        I didn’t. You served RD Warner at 
                        the Excelsior Hotel a few years 
                        ago. He is the Chief Usher here 
                        which means he oversees operations 
                        for the entire House. Needless to 
                        say, you made quite an impression.  

                                 CECIL
                        A few years ago? 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Mr. Warner and myself make note of 
                        potential staff around town, but 
                        butler positions rarely open as 
                        most stay on for 30 years or more. 

                                 CECIL
                        I see. It was quite a surprise 
                        getting the call.

                                 FREDDIE
                        It was a surprise for me as well. 
                        As the White House Maitre D’, I 
                        normally hire the butlers. 

           Cecil immediately knows that Freddie doesn’t want him. 

                                 CECIL
                        Forgive me for saying this, Mr. 
                        Fallows, but I certainly wouldn’t 
                        want to be hired under 
                        circumstances that would make you 
                        uncomfortable. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        You wouldn’t? 

                                 CECIL
                        Absolutely not. Your job must be 
                        immensely challenging, serving the 
                        President of the United States. You 
                        need butlers that you’ve hand 
                        picked, men to your liking that 
                        will fulfill your vision of a 
                        proper White House staff.  

           Cecil glances at a collection of crystal doves on his desk. 
                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Are these baccarat?

           Freddie looks surprised. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Indeed. 

                                 CECIL
                        Waterford is pleasant, and the 
                        Irish certainly make a great 
                        whiskey, but I think the French 
                        have a distinct advantage when it 
                        comes to crystal. 

           Freddie stares at Cecil for a beat. Then: 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Would you care for a demitasse?

           INT. GAINS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gloria, Louis, Gina and Elroy and several neighbors are all 
           in the living room, waiting. Elroy is very excited, but Louis 
           looks indifferent, reading a book. From upstairs they hear - 

                                 CECIL
                        Y’all ready?

           They all shout ‘yes’ in unison. Cecil slowly walks down the 
           stairs. They first see his shiny shoes, then his sleek pants 
           and finally the full view - a perfectly tailored tuxedo. 

           The entire room applauds as Gloria tears up, so proud. 

                                 GLORIA
                        My baby is the President’s butler. 

           Elroy is in total awe, but Louis looks a little uneasy. 

           INT. EMPLOYEES PARKING LOT - WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Cecil is in his car in the employees parking lot that 
           overlooks the South Lawn, directly behind the White House. He 
           gets out and looks around, eyes peeled open in awe. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING PATHWAY - DAY

           Cecil walks down a treeline pathway toward the side entrance 
           where flags stick out of lamp posts. He stops at the Security 
           Gate, a shed with a glass window. 
                                 CECIL
                        My name is Cecil Gains. I’m the new 
                        butler.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

           Cecil and Freddie walk through the elegant first floor of the 
           entrance hall. Marble walls with red carpet and pink tiled 
           floors, a French palace and a museum rolled into one. 

           Four HOUSEMEN, all black, late 20’s, are setting up ropes, 
           barriers and tables for the White House tour. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        We have six houseman who are 
                        primarily responsible for furniture 
                        and chair arrangements. 

                                 CECIL
                        Six men just to move the tables? 

           Freddie gives him a ‘you have no idea’ look. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        There are over 70 full time 
                        employees at the House. 

           They walk the Cross Hall passing the Presidential portraits. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        16 maids, 6 butlers, 4 carpenters, 
                        2 painters, 7 electricians, 9 
                        engineers, 2 plumbers, 2 grounds 
                        keepers, 3 florists, 2 pantry men, 
                        3 dishwashers, 3 doorman, 4 
                        florists, a full kitchen staff 
                        including pastry chef and 3 full 
                        time calligraphers.  

           Freddie nods at a small MAN who sets a clock in the hall.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        And Joe sets all the clocks. 

                                 CECIL
                        That’s his only job?

                                 FREDDIE
                        Every hour of every day, he makes 
                        sure that every clock is set to the 
                        exact time. 
           The Crew Cut Man from the hotel, RD WARNER, walks by. Cecil’s 
           eyes light up, he steps forward. 

                                 CECIL
                        Mr. Warner, I just want to thank 
                        you for this opportuni--

           But RD Warner keeps walking, doesn’t even acknowledge him. 
           Cecil is surprised by the snub. Freddie whispers in his ear: 

                                 FREDDIE
                        The Chief Usher is not overly 
                        friendly with the colored help. 

           Cecil nods, he gets it. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUTLER’S LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           Cecil enters the plain locker room with chipped benches. Two 
           butlers are changing into tuxes, BOOKER PARKER, 32, short and 
           fiery, and CARTER WILSON, 40, stocky with a solemn demeanor. 

                                 CARTER
                        Ten to one those kids never see the 
                        inside of that classroo--. 

           They immediately clam up as they see Cecil. Eyeing the new 
           guy. Cecil holds out his hand. 

                                 CECIL
                        I’m Cecil Gains, the new butler. 

           Carter shakes his hand first. 

                                 CARTER
                        Carter Wilson, head butler and this 
                        is Booker Parker, second butler.

                                 BOOKER
                        Where ya stand on civil rights, 
                        blood?

           Cecil is taken back. Carter shoots Booker a frustrated look. 

                                 CARTER
                        Why don’t you shake the man’s hand 
                        first? 

           Booker holds out his hand. 

                                 BOOKER
                        Sorry about that. 
           They shake hands. 

                                 BOOKER (CONT’D)
                        So where do you stand on civil 
                        rights, blood?

                                 CARTER
                        Don’t mind Booker, he’s just angry 
                        his name is Booker.

                                 BOOKER
                        Of all the goddamn names! 

                                 CECIL
                        I thought we weren’t supposed to 
                        discuss politics. 

                                 BOOKER
                        Out there in the White House, but 
                        you in the black house now, boy, 
                        and I’m just a blood that’s curious 
                        where the other blood stand. 

                                 CARTER
                        You don’t have to answer, Cecil, no 
                        one else does. 

           Cecil turns to Booker, smiles with warmth. 

                                 CECIL
                        I don’t think those negroes down 
                        South want any more trouble than 
                        they’ve already got. 

                                 CARTER
                        Amen to that! 

           Carter high fives Cecil. Fast friends. Booker smiles. 

                                 BOOKER
                        That’s alright, that’s alright. 
                             (Upper crust voice)
                        Now if you gentleman will excuse 
                        me, the First Family needs their 
                        filet mignon and Grand Mariner. A 
                        pleasure meeting you, Mr. Gains. 

           He bows his head, then walks out. Carter smiles at Cecil. 

                                 CARTER
                        Welcome to the House. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil and Fallows stand in the State Dining Room, an elegant 
           room with ornate gold curtains, gold chandelier and a massive 
           portrait of Abraham Lincoln over the marble fire place.  

           They hover over a dinning table covered in the finest china, 
           crystal and flatware. Freddie points to the crystal glasses. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        The glasses are always placed in 
                        the following order: Water, white, 
                        red and flute. Always serve from 
                        the left and when lifting a plate--

           He leans in from the left and effortlessly lifts the plate.

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        --you must never scrape the bottom. 
                        The tinkle of silverware will get 
                        an immediate report to me which I 
                        report to the Chief Usher. 

           Cecil nods, but it’s clear that this is serious business. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You must never listen or react to a 
                        conversation. The room should feel--

                                 CECIL
                        --emptier when I’m in it. 

           Freddie nods. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        And never ever rush service, 
                        because Mrs. Eisenhower is watching 
                        you like a hawk. 

           As if on cue, the door opens and in walks MAMIE EISENHOWER, 
           59, with her SOCIAL SECRETARY. In a sundress, Mamie dresses 
           youthful with curly bangs, but she acts like a general. 

                                 MAMIE
                        Freddie, I just finished tonight’s 
                        menus. I’ve decided to change 
                        asparagus to green beans. 

           The Social Secretary hands Freddie the menus. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Very good, Mrs. Eisenhower. Allow 
                        me to introduce our new butler, 
                        Cecil Gains. 
           Cecil gives a slight head bow. 

                                 CECIL
                        A true honor, Mrs. Eisenhower. 

                                 MAMIE
                        Never rush service, Cecil, and 
                        you’ll be alright with me. 
                             (Turns to Freddie)
                        Speaking of which, at the Navy 
                        dinner, I noticed that on three 
                        separate occasions, Roger picked up 
                        courses too soon. This is the third 
                        time I’ve mentioned his service. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        It is unacceptable, Mrs. Eisenhower 
                        and I assure you that his presence 
                        will no longer be required. 

           Cecil looks surprised, it’s cutthroat here. Mamie feels bad. 

                                 MAMIE
                        Oh, now, that’s not necessary, 
                        Freddie, give him one more shot. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        I prefer not, Mrs. Eisenhower, he 
                        has tried both our patience.  

                                 MAMIE
                        Well...if you insist. 

           Mamie smiles at Cecil, flipping from General to hostess. 

                                 MAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the House, Cecil, I hope 
                        your time here is pleasurable.

           And with that, she moves on as quickly as she came.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Let’s begin, shall we. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Cecil is in the small kitchen with steel appliances and 
           cabinets. He places a teapot on a silver tray as the STAFF, 
           black, shoot him glances, they know it’s his first serving. 

           As he lifts the tray, a photographer takes a picture of him 
           to record the moment. He looks fantastic in his fitted tuxedo 
           holding a beautiful tea set. Freddie whispers in his ear: 
                                 FREDDIE
                        You hear nothing, you see nothing, 
                        you only serve. 

           EXT. WEST WING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Cecil walks down the hall to the corridor entrance of the 
           Oval Office. A tiny bead of sweat forms on his forehead. 

           INT. WEST WING - OVAL OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

           He walks into the corridor, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT stops him. 

                                 CECIL
                        Tea for the president. 

           INT. WEST WING - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Cecil walks in to the Oval Office and sees DWIGHT D. 
           EISENHOWER standing upright at attention by his desk. His 
           presence is enormous, but he exudes a grandfatherly warmth.

           Cecil tries not to stare at him, but it’s hard not to. He 
           sets the tray down and begins to pour a cup of tea.

           Two other men are seated on the sofas - the Chief of Staff, 
           SHERMAN ADAMS, 56, tough and harsh, is in an argument with 
           Attorney General, HERBERT BROWNELL, 51, calm and low keyed.

                                 SHERMAN ADAMS
                        So what are you suggesting? Sending 
                        federal troops to Little Rock?

                                 HERBERT BROWNELL
                        If it comes to that, then yes.

           Cecil picks up the cup and saucer, but it rattles as his hand 
           SHAKES from nerves. He grips the cup with the other hand to 
           stop the rattling and carefully sets it down on Ike’s desk. 

           Ike steps forward, his presence overtakes the room.

                                 IKE
                        No, no, no. I can’t see any 
                        situation where I’d send troops to 
                        the South. Ever. It would cause 
                        another Civil War.

           Cecil begins to pour another cup, his hand shakes even more. 
           He’s not listening, totally focused on not spilling.
                                 HERBERT BROWNELL
                        If the Federal government doesn’t 
                        enforce Brown, then who will? The 
                        South must comply with the law.

                                 IKE
                        The South has been in compliance 
                        with the law for the last 60 years. 
                        They’ve built their entire society 
                        around the law. Then, in one day, 
                        that damn fool Earl Warren tells 
                        them their entire way of life is 
                        now illegal. It’s going to take 
                        some time for them to adjust. 

           Cecil pours another cup, but a tiny bit of tea pours over the 
           edge. He quickly takes out a napkin and drys the saucer.

                                 HERBERT BROWNELL
                        I understand, Mr. President, but if 
                        Faubus continues to block the negro 
                        children, then we must enforce the 
                        Constitution.

           Cecil places a cup of tea in front of Sherman Adams, trying 
           to be as obsequious as possible.

                                 SHERMAN ADAMS
                        Let’s give Faubus more time. With a 
                        little persuading, he’ll back down. 
                        We just want to move slowly.

           Ike sips his tea as he struggles through his feelings. 

                                 IKE
                        I am for moderation...but I am also 
                        for progress. 
                             (Then)
                        That is exactly what I am for.

           Cecil grabs his tray and hurries out of the room. 

           EXT. CORRIDOR TO OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Walking out of the Oval Office, sweat freely pours down 
           Cecil’s face. He dabbles a handkerchief on his forehead. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I was so scared I didn’t hear one 
                        word those men said. 
           INT. GAINS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Cecil serves Gloria, Louis and Elroy dinner as everyone 
           listens with rapture.  

                                 CECIL
                        Then my hands started shakin’. 

                                 ELROY
                        Did you spill, Mr. Gains?

                                 CECIL
                        A little, but I cleaned it before 
                        anyone saw. 

                                 GLORIA
                        What did the President talk about?

                                 CECIL
                        You know I can’t tell anyone that.

           Gloria nods, a little disappointed, but understands. 

                                 ELROY
                        Butlers know secrets?

                                 CECIL
                        They know everything, but they tell 
                        nothing. That’s the butler’s code. 

           Elroy grins, very exciting. Louis clears his throat, loudly. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        You got a bone in your throat or 
                        you got something to say? 

           Louis takes out a flyer and hands it to his dad, it reads - 
           ‘MAMIE TILL, MOTHER OF EMMET TILL, SPEAKS OUT!’ 

                                 LOUIS
                        I really want to go to this. 

                                 CECIL
                        Absolutely not. No way. 

                                 LOUIS
                        How come?

                                 CECIL
                        Nuthin’ good can come goin’ to this 
                        sort of thing. Nuthin’. I’m sorry, 
                        Louis, the answer is no. 

           Gloria glances at Louis who can’t hide his disappointment. 
           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           Gloria and Louis are in a packed African-American church. 

                                 GLORIA
                        You promise you won’t tell your 
                        father I brought you here?

           Louis nods, so thrilled to be there. Up on the stage walks 
           MAMIE TILL, 34, black, pretty. The audience gives her a warm 
           round of applause.  

           She walks to a podium next to a large black & white picture 
           on a pedestal of the smiling Emmet Till. On another pedestal 
           is the photo of his mutilated corpse. She speaks softly:

                                 MAMIE TILL
                        If I should cry for the rest of my 
                        life there wouldn’t be enough tears 
                        for my son Emmett Till.

           The audience yells ‘That’s right!’ and ‘Tell it like it is!’ 

                                 MAMIE TILL (CONT’D)
                        I’m just a quiet house wife from 
                        Chicago, I never once saw myself as 
                        having the courage to stand up in 
                        front of people and speak my mind, 
                        but we can’t allow what happened to 
                        my boy to ever happen again!

           The audience jumps to its feet, screaming with fire. Louis 
           yells, transformed by Mamie Till who looks right at him: 

                                 MAMIE TILL (CONT’D)
                        We all gonna be tested... 

           Louis is taken aback, he never thought he would be tested.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - IKE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ike stands in front of his VALET, a Filipino man in a Navy 
           uniform. The Valet buttons Ike’s shirt up for him.

                                 MAMIE TILL V.O. 
                        ...and only then will we see who is 
                        truly on the side of the righteous.

           Ike stares forward in deep thought, very conflicted.

           Cecil walks into the room with a coffee as the Valet takes 
           the President’s dirty pajamas and exits. Ike sips the coffee. 
                                 IKE
                        Cecil, did you mind going to an all 
                        colored school?

                                 CECIL
                        I didn’t go to school, Mr. 
                        President, I grew up on a cotton 
                        farm. 

           Ike stares at him for a beat, then nods. As Cecil turns to 
           leave, he sees a furious Sherman Adams in the doorway. 

                                 IKE
                        What is it?

                                 SHERMAN ADAMS
                        The State Guard just blocked all 
                        the colored kids from entering the 
                        school again.

                                 IKE
                        Faubus promised me he’d let them 
                        in. 

                                 SHERMAN ADAMS
                        The Governor lied, Mr. President.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY 

           Ike sits behind his desk as he speaks directly into a TV 
           camera. Sherman Adams and Herbert Brownell are in the room.

                                 IKE
                        I have today issued an Executive 
                        Order directing the use of troops 
                        under Federal authority to aid in 
                        the execution of Federal law at 
                        Little Rock, Arkansas.

           Brownell shoots Sherman Adams a subtle look, Adams shrugs.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cecil, Booker and Carter watch the announcement with the 
           dishwashers in the kitchen. Everyone has a look of pride. 

                                 IKE (FROM THE TV) 
                        ‘Thus will restore the image of 
                        America and of all its parts as one 
                        nation...’
           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

           Louis and Elroy walk to school as we hear Ike finish up: 

                                 IKE V.O.
                        “...indivisible with liberty and 
                        justice for all.”

                                 ELROY
                        Does this mean we’re all gonna go 
                        to white schools now?

                                 LOUIS
                        Probably not right away, but I bet 
                        by the time I graduate high school, 
                        every school will be integrated. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY 

           A huge auditorium is packed with friends and family for a 
           high school graduation ceremony. The PRINCIPAL, black, 
           announces the names of the graduates. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Sarah Feener. 

           In cap & gown, she walks across the stage to get her diploma. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Louis Gains. 

           Cecil, Gloria, Elroy, Gina and all the neighbors cheer like 
           crazy as Louis walks across the stage. Three years older, 
           Louis is a fit, handsome, but still shy young man. 

           We PAN ACROSS the rows of the GRADUATES in cap and gowns -  
           every single one is black. There has been no integration. 

           EXT. BUS STATION - DAY

           Cecil and Louis drag a trunk full of clothes to the cargo 
           load of a Greyhound bus as Gloria waits by the door.  

                                 CECIL
                        You sure you wanna go all the way 
                        down to Tennessee?

                                 LOUIS
                        Fisk is a really good school, dad. 

           Cecil tries to smile through the pain of losing his son.
                                 CECIL
                        I know, I know, it’s just so far 
                        away. That’s all. 

           Louis looks right at his dad. 

                                 LOUIS
                        That’s the point. 

           He walks back to his mom. Cecil is taken aback, confused. 
           Gloria awaits by the bus door in tears, she hugs Louis.   

                                 GLORIA
                        I can’t believe my boy is going off 
                        to college. 

           Then Cecil hugs Louis, holds on to him a little bit longer 
           than he should, just doesn’t want to let go. 

                                 CECIL
                        You’re the first person in this 
                        family to ever go to college. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I know, Dad. 

                                 CECIL
                        You make me proud, Louis, you make 
                        the whole neighborhood proud. I 
                        love you so much. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I love you too, Dad. 

           Cecil finally lets go. Louis takes a deep breathe, then gets 
           on the bus. The white BUS DRIVER nods to him to go to the 
           back, Louis nods back, no problem, sits at the back. 

           As the bus pulls away from the station, Louis waves to his 
           parents who wave back. They hold each other as they watch 
           their son go off to college, a sadness filling their souls. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil stares forward with the same look from the 
           bus station, sadness. The Camera Man changes the subject. 

                                 CAMERA MAN 
                        So what was a typical day like? 

                                 CECIL
                        What?
                                 CAMERA MAN
                        At the White House. What was a 
                        typical day like?

           Cecil smiles. 

                                 CECIL
                        There was no typical day.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINNING ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE UP - an escargot dish filled with delicious snails. 
           Cecil sets the tray down in front of the President of France.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        One day I’d be servin’ escargot to 
                        President Charles De Gaulle...

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - DAY

           Cecil hands Ike a putter on the South Lawn putting hole. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...the next day I’d be a caddy. 

           Ike misses the shot, slams the putter on the grass. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil smiles into the camera with pride. 

                                 CECIL
                        I never did make it to Japan...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BLUE ROOM - DAY

           Cecil pours tea for Japanese EMPEROR HIROHITO. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...but I did get to pour tea for 
                        Emperor Hirohito.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHINA STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

           A weary Cecil and Booker place the Truman China back into 
           boxes. The room is filled with all of the White House China. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        We always worked long hours...
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHOCOLATE SHOP - NIGHT

           Cecil, Booker and Carter help the pastry chef, LUKE JA’DEAN, 
           50’s, passionate, make an elaborate french dessert.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...but I loved every minute of it. 

           The Vice-President, RICHARD NIXON, 47, walks in. He feels 
           like the kid in school that desperately wanted to be liked. 

                                 NIXON
                        I brought you gentleman something 
                        very special. 

           Nixon pulls out four buttons that say ‘NIXON FOR PRESIDENT. 
           1960’. The butlers all ‘coo’, immediately put them on. 

                                 CECIL
                        We’re all cheering for you, Mr. 
                        Vice-President. 

           Carter nods but Booker smiles a little too wide. 

                                 NIXON
                        Now I don’t want to say anything 
                        negative about that Kennedy boy, 
                        I’m sure he’s a fine fellow, but do 
                        you really want a spoiled rich brat 
                        who never lifted a finger in his 
                        spoiled rich brat life to be your 
                        next president!?

           Everyone shakes their heads as Nixon dabs a handkerchief on 
           his forehead. Nothing gets him angrier than Kennedy’s wealth. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Now let me ask all of you, as 
                        members of the negro community, 
                        what are your biggest concerns? 

           The Butlers all stare back at him, no one wants to answer. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Come on, don’t be shy. I want to 
                        have a focus group here. 

                                 BOOKER
                        Well, Mr. Vice President, the 
                        colored help gets paid almost 40% 
                        less than the white help.

                                 NIXON
                        You don’t say?
                                 BOOKER
                        Yes, sir, and it’s very difficult 
                        for us to be promoted. There isn’t 
                        a single colored houseman that’s 
                        been made an engineer and many of 
                        them have been here for years. 

                                 NIXON
                        I tell ya what, Booker, when I’m 
                        President, the first thing I’m 
                        going to do is look into getting 
                        you gentleman the raises and 
                        promotions you deserve. Of course 
                        I’ll have to check with certain 
                        oversight committees and the 
                        National Trust foundation, if we 
                        have one, but I’ll definitely look 
                        into it. 

           Booker grins, doesn’t buy it. 

                                 BOOKER
                        That would be swell, Mr. Vice 
                        President.

                                 NIXON
                        What about you, Cecil? What are 
                        your concerns? Civil Rights?

                                 CECIL
                        Oh, no, sir, that’s none of my 
                        business. I just want my boy to 
                        have a good education. 

                                 NIXON
                        Damn straight. 

                                 LUKE JA’DEAN
                        Zezil’s zun just went off to 
                        college.

                                 NIXON
                        What?

                                 LUKE JA’DEAN
                        His zun just went off to college?

                                 NIXON
                        What?

                                 BOOKER AND CARTER 
                        His son just went off to college.
                                 NIXON
                        Ohhhhh. ‘Son’. Got it. The accent. 
                        Well congratulations, Cecil, what a 
                        fine accomplishment, just fine. 
                        Where’s he going?

                                 CECIL
                        Fisk University.

           Richard Nixon’s face drops. All of his ‘campaign’ enthusiasm 
           vanishes as the shrewd Tricky Dick pops out. 

                                 NIXON
                        In Nashville?

           Cecil nods. Nixon leans into him. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        What the hell does he want to go to 
                        the deep South for?

           All eyes on Cecil who shrugs, he doesn’t really know. 

           INT. NASHVILLE STREET - NIGHT

           Louis is in a rundown area, wooden shacks with dirt lawns. He 
           holds a flyer with a picture of a Hindu Goddess on it, 
           written across the top is ‘FELLOWSHIP OF RECONCILIATION'. 

                                 CAROL
                        You lookin’ for love?

           From out of the shadows steps CAROL BLUE, 19, black, wears a 
           school girl skirt and has her hair in a modern coiled flair. 
           Carol exudes a natural charisma, outgoing and brash.

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        That’s what some of us are calling  
                        the Lawson workshop, the love 
                        school. Is that what you’re lookin’ 
                        for?

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, that’s why I came to Fisk. 

                                 CAROL
                        Me too!
                             (Holds out her hand)
                        I’m Carol Blue. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Louis Gains. 
           They shake hands, but she doesn’t let go. 

                                 CAROL
                        Well come on then, Mr. Gains, Mr. 
                        Lawson is awaitin’ us!

           She drags him toward a small red brick chapel on the corner. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        Damn, boy, I’m amazed I saw you, 
                        you the darkest nigger I eve’ seen. 

           Louis blushes, he’s in love. 

           INT. CLARK MEMORIAL UNITED METHODIST - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The room is full of COLLEGE STUDENTS, all black, they listen 
           to JAMES LAWSON, 29, black, bespectacled. Very zen, mystical.

                                 JAMES LAWSON
                        Satya is truth which equals love. 
                        Agraha means force. 

           He points to a picture on the wall of MAHATMA GHANDI. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Mahatma Ghandi combined them into 
                        one word, Satyagraha, to mean love 
                        force. This is the foundation of 
                        his philosophy of non-violent 
                        resistance and it’s what Martin 
                        King used in his bus boycott a few 
                        years back. We will study Ghandi’s 
                        techniques to train you to become 
                        an army, but in this army, your 
                        only weapon will be love.  

           CUT TO - LATER 

           James Lawson has his jacket off, sleeves rolled up. Everyone 
           is paired up into teams of two seated across from each other. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON (CONT’D)
                        When they scream at you, visualize 
                        them as a baby...a time before they 
                        were taught to hate.

           CUT TO - LATER

           Carol curls into a fetal position as a student ‘kicks’ her. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Always protect your vital organs.
           CUT TO - LATER

           Louis is surrounded by students yelling and spitting on him. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON (CONT’D)
                        It’s not enough to resist the urge 
                        to strike back. You must have no 
                        desire to strike back. You must 
                        love the person that’s hitting you, 
                        you must love the hell out of them, 
                        because that is the only way you 
                        can change their heart.

           James Lawson steps forward to make the most important point.

                                 JAMES LAWSON (CONT’D)
                        For it is only when they learn to 
                        love you back that we will truly 
                        become a Beloved Community.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE - DAY

           Louis and Carol walk down the street with three students. The 
           men in suits, women in blouses, all nervous, but determined. 
           Carol grabs Louis’ hand as they walk hand in hand toward - 

           WOOLWORTHS DEPARTMENT STORE.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Twenty butlers and housemen are setting up for a State 
           Dinner. Cecil sets down a plate followed by Carter with the 
           gold flatware, followed by Booker with the wine glasses. 

           RD Warner stands under the painting of Abraham Lincoln as the 
           black staff scrambles to set up the ornate room.

           INT. WOOLWORTHS LUNCH COUNTER - 2ND FLOOR - DAY

           The five students get off the escalator and walk right up to 
           the LUNCH COUNTER. It is half filled with WHITE PATRONS. 

           The black students sit down at the counter. The white patrons 
           immediately look at them. A WAITRESS drops her tray. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Y’all can’t sit here. 

           But the students stare forward, they aren’t going to move.
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

           MILITARY AIDES escort LADIES in dresses into the East Room as 
           their MALE dates tag along. As they all line up on the red 
           carpet, the doors to the State Dining Room open revealing - 

           The BUTLERS upright at their stations dressed in tailed 
           tuxedos. The candle lit tables are covered in the finest 
           china, flatware and crystal. A vision of pure opulence.

                                 MILITARY AIDE
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, the President 
                        and First Lady of the United 
                        States.

           The Military Band strikes up ‘Hail to the Chief’ as Ike and 
           Mamie walks down the corridor lined with Military Aides. 

           INT. WOOLWORTHS LUNCH COUNTER - NIGHT

           Having sat for hours, the students still sit at the counters 
           reading books as many white ONLOOKERS stare from a distance. 
           Concern fills Carol as she points toward the escalator - 

           A group of angry white TEENAGERS are walking toward them. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           All of the guests are seated at their tables as Cecil and the 
           butlers stand at attention. Freddie nods at the butlers who 
           start serving filet of sole. Cecil elegantly sets one down. 

                                 GUEST
                        Do you think I could have some 
                        ketchup?

           INT. WOOLWORTHS LOUNCH COUNTER - NIGHT

           A White Student DUMPS ketchup on Carol’s head. Others laugh 
           as they squirt mustard on them. The black students stare 
           forward in zen calm as Louis looks at the counter Manager... 

                                 LOUIS
                        We would like to be served, please. 

           INT. STATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil sets down the next course of French lamb chops with 
           minted pears in front of a FEMALE GUEST who is so delighted 
           she kisses her HUSBAND on the cheek. 
           INT. WOOLWORTHS LUNCH COUNTER - NIGHT

           An aggressive student with a CREW CUT punches Louis in the 
           face. Louis FLIES off his stool onto the ground. 

           Carol jumps on Louis followed by the black students to form a 
           coordinated protective ball. The Crew Cut student pulls Louis 
           out and punches him. Louis looks him in the eye as he hears: 

                                 JAMES LAWSON V.O.
                        You must love your attacker. 

           He punches Louis again. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON V.O. (CONT’D)
                        Love him with all your heart. 

           As Louis looks up, a massive GLOW OF LIGHT shines behind his 
           attacker, a light that is pure and bright and beautiful. 

                                 JAMES LAWSON V.O. (CONT’D)
                        For it is only when they learn to 
                        love you back that we will truly 
                        become a Beloved Community.

           Louis’s eyes light up into a trance-like state, he’s having a 
           mystical experience. A smile forms on his bloodied face 
           because Louis now loves this man. 

           Five POLICE OFFICERS hurry into the lounch counter area and 
           immediately handcuff Louis and the other black students. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You are all under arrest for 
                        disorderly conduct. 

           The White Students CHEER as the bleeding black students are 
           lead away. The Crew Cut student grins, until he sees - 

           Four new BLACK STUDENTS are now SEATED at the lunch counter. 

                                 NEW LEAD STUDENT
                        We would like to be served, please. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           All of the butlers are lounging in the kitchen. They are all 
           exhausted as they hold up wine glasses for a toast. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        To serving our country. 

           Cecil beams, proud of his work as he clinks his glass.
           EXT. WOOLWORTHS - NIGHT

           The five students are escorted to a police paddy wagon as 
           they peacefully sing their anthem, ‘We Shall Overcome’:

                                 BLACK STUDENTS
                        ‘We shall overcome. We shall 
                        overcome. We shall overcome some 
                        day.’

           Up and down the street, 100 black STUDENTS are being hauled 
           into police paddy wagons as mobs of whites scream at them. 
           This was a coordinated sit-in all over downtown Nashville. 

           INT. DAVIDSON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Eighty-two proud students, mostly black but a couple whites, 
           are seated in a packed courtroom. Louis and Carol sit next to 
           each other, smiling, proud. Then - Louis’s smile drops. 

           He sees Cecil standing in the back of the courtroom, his 
           father looks horrified. Louis walks over to him. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Hi, Dad. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

           A furious Cecil scolds Louis in a corner of the hall. 

                                 CECIL
                        I worked every day of my life, 
                        every single day, to give you the 
                        opportunities I never had. And this 
                        is what you do with it?!

                                 LOUIS
                        You don’t understand. Something is 
                        happening here, something special.

                                 CECIL
                        Ain’t nuthin’ special about a 
                        nigger in jail!

                                 LOUIS
                        We’re standing up for our rights. 
                        We’re going to change the nation’s 
                        consciousness toward the American 
                        negro. 

                                 CECIL
                        You’re what?!
                                 LOUIS
                        We’re changing the national consci--

                                 CECIL
                        All ya’ doing is breakin’ the law! 
                        And it’s gonna get you and a lot of 
                        other folks killed. I didn’t send 
                        my boy off to college to go to his 
                        funeral! 

                                 LOUIS
                        If I can’t sit at any lunch counter 
                        I want, then I’m not really alive.  

                                 CECIL
                        Nuthin’ good can come of this. All 
                        you’re gonna do is make white folks 
                        angrier and get a lot of negroes 
                        hurt. That’s what always happens.  

                                 LOUIS
                        That’s what we’re going to change. 

           Cecil stares at him, angry and scared.

                                 CECIL
                        You don’t understand, Louis, the 
                        law doesn’t work for us, it’s 
                        always against us. Always.

           INT. DAVIDSON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           JUDGE JACK HARRIS, balding and heavy, sits up on the bench 
           staring out at the courtroom. The attorney Z. ALEXANDER 
           LOOBY, 61, black, sharp, stands up in front of the judge. 

                                 Z. ALEXANDER LOOBY
                        Your honor, the charges of 
                        disorderly conduct have absolu--

           Judge Harris turns his chair AROUND so his back faces the 
           court, he’s not going to listen. The students gasp in shock.  

                                 Z. ALEXANDER LOOBY (CONT’D)
                        --absolutely no merit. These 
                        students were calm, quiet and in 
                        compliance with all conduct laws. 

           The Judge’s back is still to the court. Looby speaks louder:

                                 Z. ALEXANDER LOOBY (CONT’D)
                        The mob that beat them are the ones 
                        that should be tried for disorder--
           He throws up his arms and yells at the Judge.

                                 Z. ALEXANDER LOOBY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the use!

           Judge Harris turns back around and faces the students.

                                 JUDGE HARRIS
                        I find the defendants guilty of 
                        disorderly conduct and sentence 
                        them to thirty days in the county 
                        workhouse or a fine of $50 each. 

           Carol leaps to her feet. She calmly announces to the Judge: 

                                 CAROL
                        We feel if we pay these fines we 
                        would be supporting the injustice 
                        and immoral practice that have been 
                        performed in our arrest and 
                        conviction. 

                                 JUDGE HARRIS
                        Ya’all feel that way? 

           All of the students rise to their feet in solidarity. 

                                 JUDGE HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy the big house, kids.

                        for us. These last eight years...

           Ike tears up, Mamie finishes for her husband who can’t speak.

                        ...and move the new President in.

           The moving pulls away as an identical MOVING VAN pulls up in 
           its spot. We hear the distinct Bostonian accent of -

                                 JACK V.O.
                        I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do

           RD Warner glances at his watch, starting to sweat.

           All of the staff is lined up in the Entrance Hall everyone 
           stands at attention, tense. RD Warner wipes his sweaty brow 
           as Cecil whispers to Carter. 

                                 CECIL
                        You nervous?

           Carter nods, then whispers back. 

                                 CARTER
                        I voted for Nixon.  

                                 CECIL
                        Me too. 

           Booker leans in and whispers: 

                                 BOOKER
                        You negroes are a disgrace. 

           The front doors open and in walks JOHN ‘JACK’ KENNEDY, 43, 
           handsome, lean, and his beautiful wife JACKIE, 31, tall, 
           wears a fawn coat and pillow box hat, she’s a touch shy.

           Jackie holds their 3 month old, JACK, JR, with daughter, 
           CAROLINE, 3, behind them. They are surrounded by many AIDES. 
           Jack flashes an enormous grin, he exudes charm and class.

                                 JACK
                        I want to start by saying that I’m 
                        thrilled we’re going to be working 
                        together over the next four years. 

           Jackie is slightly aloof as she speaks in almost a whisper: 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Eight years, Jack. 

           Everyone laughs. The baby, John Jr., starts to cry. 

                                 JACK
                        I bet you all haven’t heard that 
                        around the house in a while. 

           The room laughs, Carter turns to Cecil, nods with approval. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BLUE ROOM - DAY

           The Kennedy’s tour the house, looking at all the art work 
           with RD Warner, Cecil and Carter in tow. As Jackie looks 
           around, she seems unhappy. She speaks in a light whisper:
                                 JACKIE
                        Mr. Warner, there seem to be very 
                        few historic artifacts. There’s 
                        barely an item here before 1948. 

                                 RD WARNER
                        Mrs. Eisenhower was concerned about 
                        this as well, but as I explained to 
                        her, when it comes to redecorating, 
                        the budget is very limited. 

           The shy Jackie washes away as her voice gets much louder.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not talking about redecoration, 
                        Mr. Warner, I’m talking about 
                        restoration. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TREATY ROOM - DAY

           The light blue walls are being painted over in a dark green. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - DAY

           The Rose Garden is packed with landscapers digging it all up.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - DAY

           Jackie walks with an exhausted RD Warner and Cecil in tow 
           down the Center Hall pointing at the empty walls. 

           FADE CUT - LATER

           The walls are now covered in a beautiful series of portraits 
           of proud American Indians by George Catlin. 

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Cecil walks out of a new florist shop. Up and down the 
           street, businesses are repainting and upgrading.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Everywhere I looked, folks were 
                        sprucin’ things up. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil walks in and sees Gloria repainting the living room. 
           Her hair looks like Jackie’s and she wears an A-line dress.  
                                 CECIL
                        What in the Lords name are you 
                        doing?

           Gloria waves her hand with a refined touch.

                        Restoration. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil is in bed reading a book on Addison’s disease. Gloria 
           reads a Life article about Jackie. She turns to Cecil: 

                                 GLORIA

                        You are without a doubt the most 
                        perfect woman I know. 

           Gloria turns away, looks slightly unhappy.

                        I’m not perfect, I’m just...here.

                                 CECIL
                        Cuz he’s in jail? 

           She stares at him for a beat, then changes the subject, 
           pointing at his book.

                        It’s a condition that causes 
                        fatigue and dizziness. Someone new 
                        at the House has it.

                        No, it’s not Jackie.

           She curls into his chest, talks in sweet-talky voice.

                        can’t talk about it. 

           She rolls over, shuts off the light.

                                 GLORIA
                        Night. 

           He feels guilty, never knew this upset her so much. Then - he 
           goes back to his book on Addison’s Disease. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Cecil walks into the bedroom as a DOCTOR is administering a 
           shot into Jack’s arm. There are several prescription bottles. 
           Jack’s VALET, another Filipino, brushes a jacket with a linen 
           brush. Jack grins at Cecil as he takes a series of pills. 

                                 JACK
                        I was sick so much as a kid that my 
                        brothers used to joke if I got bit 
                        by a mosquito, the mosquito would 
                        surely die. 

           As the Valet puts Jack’s suit jacket on him, Jack clutches 
           his back in pain. Cecil grimaces, feeling Jack’s pain. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Cecil walks into the Oval Office with a tea set and water. 
           Jack is lying on the floor on a heating pad, still in pain. 
           Cecil brings him cortisone pills and another glass of water. 

           Jack is mid-conversation with his brother, BOBBY KENNEDY, 36, 
           tough and mean. He sits with his aide, JOHN SEIGENTHALER, 32, 
           slim, idealistic. Seigenthaler holds up a pen.

                                 JOHN SEIGENTHALER
                        This was sent from the ‘National 
                        Committee Against Discrimination in 
                        Housing’ as a reminder to follow 
                        through with your campaign pledge 
                        to wipe out federal housing 
                        discrimination with one swipe of a 
                        pen. 

           Jack takes the pills, then hands the glass back to Cecil.

                                 JACK
                        They only sent one?

                                 JOHN SEIGENTHALER
                        No, sir, ten thousand. 

                                 JACK
                        I take it the ‘National Committee 
                        Against Discrimination in Housing’ 
                        is being sarcastic. 

           Cecil begins to pour a cup of tea, but unlike the last time 
           we saw him do this, he looks smooth and graceful. 

                                 JOHN SEIGENTHALER
                        They’re calling it the ‘Ink for 
                        Jack’ campaign. 

                                 JACK
                        Bobby?
           Cecil sets the tea in front of Bobby who doesn’t look up. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We lose the support we’ll need from 
                        Southern Senators on Cuba if we 
                        touch civil rights right now. 

           John Seigenthaler eyes Cecil as he pours another cup of tea.   

                                 JACK
                        What do you think, John?

                                 JOHN SEIGENTHALER
                        I think there is a moral imperative 
                        to fight against discrimination. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We barely won the election! We 
                        don’t have the mandate or the 
                        political need to touch contentious 
                        social issues right now. 

                                 JACK
                        What if there are more negro 
                        protests, like those sit-in’s?

           Cecil slightly flinches at the mention of the sit-ins.

                                 BOBBY
                        The sit-ins didn’t budge popular 
                        opinion. The country doesn’t 
                        support civil rights, Jack, I don’t 
                        think you should either. 

           Jack ponders it as Cecil walks toward the door with his tray. 

                                 JACK
                        I don’t have time for this right 
                        now. I need to use my capital on 
                        Kruschev and Castro. 

           Jack looks over at Bobby.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Detente abroad trumps detente at 
                        home. 

           Bobby slightly grins, he likes to win. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I doubt we’ll even see anymore 
                        civil unrest. 

           Cecil glances at Bobby...he hopes that he’s right. 
           INT. CORE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Louis and Carol are in the tiny headquarters of the ‘Congress 
           of Racial Equality’. It has a pre-hippy, new age vibe. They 
           sit with JAMES FARMER, 41, black, theatrical voice. 

                                 JAMES FARMER
                        Are you familiar with Boynton V. 
                        Virginia?

           They shake their heads, no. 

                                 JAMES FARMER (CONT’D)
                        It outlawed segregation in bus 
                        terminals, but the law has never 
                        been enforced.

                                 LOUIS
                        So you’re going to ride busses into 
                        the deep south to confront the law?

                                 JAMES FARMER
                        Exactly. We expect to be beaten, 
                        maybe even murdered, but we will 
                        exercise our legal rights. 

           Louis and Carol exchange glances, nervous, but Carol nods. 

                                 LOUIS
                        We want to be a part of it. 

           James Farmer smiles at his fellow warriors. 

                                 JAMES FARMER
                        Are you two together?

           Before Louis can answer, Carol quickly responds:

                                 CAROL
                        No, we’re just friends. 

           Louis looks disappointed, but he mutters. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, we’re just friends. 

           James Farmer knows that Louis was hoping otherwise.

                                 JAMES FARMER
                        Welcome aboard the Freedom Ride. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT

           Wearing a tuxedo, Jack stands in front of several hundred 
           elegant guests seated in chairs. 

                                 JACK
                        When Jackie told me she wanted to 
                        use the White House as a platform 
                        for the arts, I knew it was a good 
                        idea because I do what Jackie says. 

           Everyone laughs. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        The last time our esteemed guest 
                        Pablo Caslas played in the White 
                        House was fifty-seven years ago. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

           The great musician, PABLO CASALS, 85, wise, finishes a glass 
           of water, whispers to Cecil in his Spanish accent. 

                                 PABLO CASLAS
                        After 81 years of playing, you know 
                        what always surprises me?

                                 CECIL
                        What, Sr. Caslas?

                                 PABLO CASLAS
                        That I still get nervous. 

           He hands him the glass of water. Then - 

                                 PABLO CASLAS (CONT’D)
                        Do you find it difficult being 
                        oppressed in your own home land?

           Cecil doesn’t know what to say, stunned. Just then, the crowd 
           in the East Room applauds. Freddie opens the door for Caslas 
           who enters the room. Cecil sits next to Booker and Carter. 

                                 CARTER
                        What did he say to you?

           Cecil looks at him for a beat. Then -  

                                 CECIL
                        Nuthin’. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT

           Holding his violoncello, Casals gives the President a slight 
           head bow, Jack nods back. Then, he begins Mendelssohn's Trio 
           in D Minor. We hear the most beautiful music play into...

           EXT. ALABAMA - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           A Greyhound bus drives down a dark country road in Alabama. 

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - ALABAMA - NIGHT

           A dozen Freedom Riders are on the bus with a few JOURNALISTS, 
           white. Every black Freedom Rider sits next to a white one. 

           The mood is fairly relaxed. Louis sits toward the back, 
           speaking to a JOURNALIST. Carol is asleep a few seats over. 

                                 JOURNALIST
                        Are you riding this bus to show 
                        that the negro is equal to the 
                        white man?

                                 LOUIS
                        No, sir. We do not seek equality 
                        with the white man. We want us both 
                        to be raised up. 

           The bus slows down, pulling into a bus station. Everyone sits 
           up alert as they see the bus station is completely EMPTY. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Why isn’t anybody here? 

           A MOB of white people with chains and bats STORM out from 
           behind the bus station. Louis screams at the driver - 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        DRIVE!

           The Freedom Bus takes off down the highway, but a row of cars 
           and trucks pull out from behind the bus station. An ambush.  

           GUNSHOTS blare out that hit the tires. The bus SKIDS back and 
           forth, then skids onto a dirt embankment and comes to a stop. 

           The cars catch up and a mob of 100 WHITE MEN jump out and 
           start SMASHING the bus windows with bricks and chains. 

           All of the Freedom Riders drop to the center aisle of the bus 
           as glass shards fly on top of them. Then - A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
           flies into the back window setting the back on FIRE! 
           The Freedom Riders push to the front of the bus and try to 
           open the front door, but the MOB is outside PUSHING it shut. 

           A white Freedom Rider at the bus door, ELI COWLING, pulls out 
           a gun. The other Freedom Riders look stunned as he points the 
           gun toward the mob through the glass door. The mob backs off. 

           The door flies open as Eli Cowling holds up a badge.

                                 ELI COWLING
                        Let these people off or some of you 
                        are going to die!

           The crowd backs away even more. All the Freedom Riders 
           stumble out of the bus, coughing and gasping for air. Then - 

           THE BUS EXPLODES! The Freedom Riders fall to the ground as 
           the mob begins to circle in them. One of them CLUBS Louis in 
           the head as the cello music comes to a passionate conclusion. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT

           The concert over, Caslas shakes hands with the President. As 
           Cecil hurries over with cocktails, Caslas whispers to Jack: 

                                 PABLO CASLAS
                        Remember all those people out there 
                        who need freedom. 

           Jack and Cecil are both taken by his words.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cecil is in the upstairs kitchen taking notes. He writes - 
           ‘20 guests, 10 servers, Truman service.’ Then, he hears:

           BANGING at the end of the hall. He sticks his head out to see 
           Bobby Kennedy pounding on Jack’s bedroom door, he’s furious. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Jack! Get up!

           The door opens, a sleepy Jack sticks his head out 

                                 JACK
                        What is it?

                                 BOBBY
                        The Freedom Bus was blown up in 
                        Alabama. 

           Jack’s face drops in shock, Cecil’s in horror. 
                                 JACK
                        Are they dead?

                                 BOBBY
                        We don’t know, it hasn’t been 
                        confirmed. Governor Patterson won’t 
                        return my calls. 

                                 JACK
                        I’ll cut Patterson’s balls off! 

           Bobby enters the room as Jack slams the door. Cecil stares 
           forward in horror.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I didn’t know if my son was dead or 
                        alive. 

           Then - he feels a tug at his pants, a just woken up 4 year 
           old Caroline Kennedy holds a children’s book. 

                                 CAROLINE KENNEDY
                        Cecil, will you read me a book?

           Cecil instantly regains his composure. 

                                 CECIL
                        Of course, Miss Caroline. 

           She walks him to a table in the kitchen. Caroline sits on his 
           lap and opens ‘Madeline’s Rescue’. There’s a picture of a 
           spooky looking mansion that looks like the White House. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        ‘In an old house in Paris that was 
                        covered in vines, lived 12 little 
                        girls in two straight lines.’

                                 CAROLINE KENNEDY
                        Like me and John John. 

                                 CECIL
                        Exactly. 
                             (Back to the book)
                        “The smallest one was Madeline. She 
                        was not afraid of mice.”

           Caroline beams as Cecil tries to not cry, so scared for his 
           son. He puts his arm around Caroline as he continues...

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        ‘She loved winter, snow and ice.’
           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           Cecil and Gloria are on the couch watching Jackie’s White 
           House tour on the TV. They’re tense, nervous. 

                                 JACKIE (FROM THE TV)
                        ‘’May none but wise men ever rule 
                        under this roof.’ It was Franklin 
                        Roosevelt who loved that prayer and 
                        had it put on the mantlepiece.’ 

           The phone rings! They jump up as Cecil quickly answers it. 

                                 CECIL
                        Hello?

           His entire body slumps in relief as hears: 

                                 LOUIS V.O.
                        I’m in Mississippi. 

           Gloria starts to tear up, knowing her son is alive. 

                                 CECIL
                        I thought you were in Alabama?

                                 LOUIS V.O.
                        We spent two weeks in jail there, 
                        now we’re in Mississippi.

                                 CECIL
                        Please come home. Please. Just for 
                        a little while. A few days. Please. 

                                 LOUIS V.O.
                        That’s going to be difficult under 
                        the present circumstances. 

           INT. MISSISSIPPI PRISON - DAY

           Bandages and bruised, Louis is in a blue prison uniform 
           calling from the pay phone. The prison looks like hell. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I’ve been detained by the local 
                        authorities. 

           INTERCUT - CECIL AND LOUIS

                                 CECIL
                        For how long?
                                 LOUIS
                        Three months. When I get out, I’m 
                        going to take another Freedom Ride.

                                 CECIL
                        Why, Louis?   

                                 LOUIS
                        Because it is my right to ride that 
                        bus. That is my legal right and I 
                        will exercise my rights as an 
                        American citizen! 

                                 CECIL
                        They’re going to kill you. At some 
                        point you gonna get killed.  

                                 LOUIS
                        They’re gonna have to kill me, Dad, 
                        because I’ll never stop. 

           Cecil’s eyes fill with tears, so scared for Louis.

                                 CECIL
                        All we do is worry about you. Come 
                        home, son, please, just for a 
                        little while. We miss you so much.  

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m sorry, Dad, but I can’t. 

                                 CECIL
                        Why not?

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m a Freedom Rider.  

           He hangs up the phone on his father. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Is he comin’ home?

           Cecil shakes his head, no, a look of painful defeat on both.  

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cecil lies awake in bed, starring up at the ceiling. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I was scared all the time... 

           Gloria lies awake on her side, she’s not sleeping either. 
                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        ...but it was a scary time. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINNING ROOM - DAY

           RD Warner is speaking to all the BUTLERS and several MAIDS. 

                                 RD WARNER
                        If Cuba launches a missile attack 
                        on the capital, your number one 
                        priority is to get the First Family  
                        out of the house first. 

           Several people nod. Terrified looks are exchanged. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Everyday we thought might be our

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE SECURITY GATE - DAY

           Several staff walk through the security gate, all are tense. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...but everyday we still came to 
                        work.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cecil is preparing a sandwich. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        If the President was gonna prevent 
                        our nuclear destruction, some one 
                        was gonna have to feed him. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - RED ROOM - DAY

           Cecil passes the Red Room and sees one of the maids crying. 
           He immediately gives her a warm hug. 

                                 CECIL
                        Everything is gonna be fine, Tanya, 
                        no one’s gonna get hurt. 

           She nods as she continues to cry, so scared. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I wasn’t sure we’d make it, but 
                        those Kennedy boys were real smart. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Booker reads a copy of the Washington Post with the headline: 
           ‘REDS AGREE TO SCRAP BASES IN CUBA’. Carter has a huge smile. 

                                 CARTER
                        That was without a doubt the worst 
                        two weeks of my entire life. 

           Booker nods, but Cecil still looks scared. 

                                 CARTER (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong, Cecil? We made it. 

           Cecil tries to smile. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cecil lies awake in bed again, Gloria awake on her side. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        But for us, the fear was never 
                        gonna go away.

           Jack, Bobby and Jackie watch the news footage, they look 
           horrified. Cecil and Booker stand against the back wall, 
           struggling to not appear upset. Jack looks deeply troubled.

                                 JACK
                        I don’t know what country I’m 
                        looking at. 

           Cecil peeks out over Jack’s shoulder, looking for Louis.
           EXT. BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA - DAY

           Louis is sprayed with a fire hose, jammed against a brick 
           wall. Carol clutches a tree as water drills into her. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil stares at the TV screen, barely able to hide his fear. 
           He sees Jack staring at him, he quickly looks forward. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN BEDROOM - DAY

           Cecil is in the Lincoln Bedroom dusting off the dark wood 
           desk. He is about to walk out when something catches his eye. 
           He walks back to Lincoln’s desk and cleans off a small speck. 

                                 JACK
                        Do you ever see the ghost?

           Surprised, Cecil turns around to see Jack in the doorway. 

                                 CECIL
                        No, Mr. President, I’ve never seen 
                        Lincoln’s ghost. 

                                 JACK
                        They say he still haunts this room.

                                 CECIL
                        I’ve heard that as well, but I 
                        don’t know anyone who’s seen him. 

           Jack Kennedy takes a step forward, lowers his voice. 

                                 JACK
                        I know your son is a Freedom Rider. 

           Cecil’s face drops. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        He’s in prison in Birmingham right 
                        now with Martin Luther King. 

                                 CECIL
                        Is he okay?

                                 JACK
                        I’m guessing he’s beat up, but from 
                        his record, he must be used to it. 
                        He’s been arrested 16 times in the 
                        last two years. 
                                 CECIL
                        I know Dr. King is supposed to be a 
                        great man, but I don’t understand 
                        what he’s done to my son.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t worry about your job, Cecil, 
                        I’ll keep this quiet.  

                                 CECIL
                        Thank you, Mr. President, I don’t 
                        want to lose my job...but I just 
                        don’t know what to do.

                                 JACK
                        Neither do I. 
                             (Then)
                        But those kids...

           His voice trails off, this is hard for him to say. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        ...those kids have changed my 
                        heart, Cecil...

           Tears form in Jack’s eyes. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        ...they’ve changed my heart. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Jack sits in front of a TV news camera in the Oval Office. 
           Bobby stands nearby, watching his brother address the nation. 

                                 JACK
                        One hundred years of delay have 
                        passed since President Lincoln 
                        freed the slaves, yet their heirs, 
                        their grandsons, are not fully free 
                        from the bonds of injustice. 

           INT. PRISON CELL - BIRMINGHAM - NIGHT

           Louis is in a prison cell reading the speech in a newspaper. 
           A small look of pride, his work is starting to pay off. 

                                 JACK V.O.
                        Next week I shall ask the Congress 
                        to enact legislation giving all 
                        Americans the right to be served in 
                        facilities open to the public.
           INT. COLORED HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Carol is in a hotel room for ‘blacks only’ with five bruised 
           Freedom Riders watching the speech. 

                                 JACK (FROM THE TV)
                        This seems to me to be an 
                        elementary right. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           A small smile forms on Bobby’s face as his brother finishes 
           his historic address. Bobby has been transformed as well. 

                                 JACK
                        A great change is at hand, and our 
                        task, our obligation, is to make 
                        that revolution, that change...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           The Butlers all watch the speech on a TV. 

                                 JACK (FROM THE TV)
                        ...peaceful and constructive for 
                        all.

           Everyone applauds, except for Cecil who looks upset.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil still looks upset.

                                 CECIL
                        I knew this would embolden those 
                        kids. Their rebellion was workin’ 
                        and there was no way they were 
                        gonna stop now.

           INT. DISHWASHING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil and Carter help out the dishwashers wash the china. 
           Everyone is energized except for Cecil who looks distracted. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I worried all the time that someone 
                        was gonna get killed. Every day I 
                        expected the call and I couldn’t 
                        think about nuthin’ else. 
           A Polk plate slips through Cecil’s fingers and SHATTERS on to 
           the floor. Cecil stares at the destroyed plate in mild shock.

                                 CECIL
                        It...it just slipped. 

                                 DISHWASHER
                        Don’t worry about it, Cecil. 

                                 CARTER
                        It ain’t nuthin’. 

           But Cecil looks really upset at himself. Then Booker walks 
           into the room, his face is ashen. 

                                 CARTER (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter with you? It’s 
                        just a plate. 

           Booker can’t speak, clearly shaken about something else. 

                                 CECIL
                        What’s wrong, Booker?

           Booker looks at the room. 

                                 BOOKER
                        The President’s been shot. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           The flag outside of the White House is lowered to half mast. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        We laid him in state in the exact 
                        same manner as Abraham Lincoln.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil and Booker place black webbing over the windows, the 
           room has been completely transformed into a mausoleum.

           MILITARY GUARDS bring in the flag draped coffin and place it 
           on the alter covered in black. Jackie and Bobby follow, she 
           still wears her pink skirt covered in Jack’s blood. 

                                 RD WARNER
                        Mrs. Kennedy, would you like me to 
                        have a change of clothes brought 
                        down? 

           Jackie shakes her head, no. Defiant. 
                                 JACKIE
                        I want them to see, I want them all 
                        to see what they did to my husband. 

           Cecil stares at the coffin, devastated with grief. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - NIGHT

           Still in her bloodied skirt, Jackie wanders the hall looking 
           at the paintings as she clutches one of her husband’s ties. 
           Cecil gingerly walks over to her as she mutters: 

                                 JACKIE
                        So now he is a legend, when he 
                        would have preferred to be a man. 

                                 CECIL
                        Is there anything I can do for you, 
                        Mrs. Kennedy? Please tell me how 
                        can I help you.

           She smiles at Cecil, holds out the tie for him. 

                                 JACKIE
                        This is for you. 

                                 CECIL
                        Mrs. Kennedy, I can’t take that. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Please, Cecil, he’d want you to 
                        have it, Jack was very fond of you. 

           He takes the tie. 

                                 CECIL
                        I will always treasure it. 

           She touches his face, then continues strolling down the hall, 
           looks almost like a ghost. Cecil walks the other direction.  
           As he passes the Lincoln Bedroom he hears Bobby sobbing:

                                 BOBBY
                        Why!? Why, God? Why!?

           Cecil stares at the door clutching President Kennedy’s tie, 
           he can’t help it as the tears fall down his face.
           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil lies in bed in his tux, the tie still in his hand. 
           Gloria is clutched in his arms, face red from crying. They 
           lie there in silence. Then Cecil slowly starts to tell her - 

                                 CECIL
                        She’s very witty. Most people don’t 
                        know that, but she’s very witty and 
                        sometimes she can be silly. She’s 
                        very relaxed and playful around the 
                        house, but when she’s in public she 
                        transforms into a different person. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Really?

                                 CECIL
                        That’s when she becomes more aloof, 
                        and mysterious, but always elegant. 
                        She’s very complex...and 
                        beautiful...and wonderful. 
                             (Turns to her)
                        What else do you want to know about 
                        Jackie? I’ll tell you anything you 
                        want to know.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Cecil, Carter, Booker and Freddie Fallows are out on the golf 
           course watching Booker miss a long put. They yell, ‘OHHHHHH!’ 

                                 CARTER
                        The white man prevented you from 
                        hitting your shot! 

                                 BOOKER
                        You know he did!

           They all laugh as they stroll to the next hole.

                                 BOOKER (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to have a fund-raiser 
                        at church next month for all those 
                        kids in Mississippi trying to 
                        register black folk. You bloods 
                        should come down. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        ‘Black’ folk?
                                 BOOKER
                        That’s right, ace boon coon, we 
                        ain’t no negroes no mo’!

                                 CARTER
                        I’ll go. I want to go. 

                                 BOOKER
                        What about you two Tom’s? Those 
                        kids are putting it on the line. 

                                 CECIL
                        Not for me. 

                                 BOOKER
                        Alright, alright. What about you, 
                        Mr. Fallows? 

                                 FREDDIE
                        I will be in the Bahamas, 
                        celebrating my retirement.
                             (Then)
                        Congratulations, Carter, you are 
                        going to be the new Maitre d. 

           The Butlers are stunned, Cecil beams at Carter. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s time for me to move on, 
                        gentleman, I’m getting old. 

                                 BOOKER
                        But you gonna miss out on all the 
                        fun with LBJ!

           They all laugh with clear sarcasm. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           LYNDON JOHNSON, 55, gray haired with glasses, fiery, manic, 
           sits on the toilet with his pants at his ankles surrounded by 
           four queasy staff members. Cecil is jammed in the corner. 

                                 LBJ
                        You sorry sap ass motherfuckers

           INT. QUEENS ROOM - DAY

           LBJ screams at Cecil in the Queens Room: 

                                 LBJ
                        Next time there is a light on in an 
                        empty room, I will fire every sorry 
                        son of a bitch in this house. I 
                        mean it, Cecil, I’ll go back to 
                        Texas and run the country from a 
                        dirt shack if I have to! Is that 
                        what you want?!

                                 CECIL
                        No, sir. 

           Cecil flicks off the light switch. LBJ instantly flips to a 
           gregarious, jovial southerner as he slaps Cecil on the back.  

                                 LBJ
                        Now that’s what I’m talkin’ about!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Cecil and Booker are playing cards, both drinking coffee. 
           Carter reads a newspaper, looks at his watch, it’s 3am. 

                                 CARTER
                        Does the man ever sleep?

           In walks LBJ’s wife, LADY BIRD, sweet and private, she speaks 
           in an elegant Texan accent. They both immediately stand up.

                                 CECIL
                        What can we do for you, Mrs. 
                        Johnson? 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I just feel terrible about Lyndon’s 
                        schedule. He’s been staying up all 
                        night long trying to get this bill 
                        passed, and y'all are stuck here. 

                                 BOOKER
                        We don’t mind at all, Mrs. Johnson. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I was thinking you could have some 
                        food pre-made for Lyndon that he’d 
                        heat up himself if he wants to eat 
                        in the middle of the night. 
                                 CECIL
                        I can’t tell you how much we 
                        appreciate the gesture, Mrs. 
                        Johnson, but no President will ever 
                        serve himself as long as we are the 
                        White House butlers. 

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Are you sure?

           Booker emphatically nods with pride. 

                                 CECIL
                        We serve the President, so that the 
                        President can serve the country. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TREATY ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil walks into the Treaty Room carrying a tray with a 
           silver lid. LBJ is seated at the desk on the phone.

                                 LBJ (ON THE PHONE)
                        I know it’s three in the morning, 
                        Senator, but I actually wasn’t 
                        calling for you, I wanted to speak 
                        to your wife. 
                             (The voice responds)
                        Then you’ll just have to wake her 
                        up now, won’t you.

           He motions for Cecil to serve him. Cecil elaborately sets 
           down a place mat, a gold fork, knife and spoon. 

                                 LBJ (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Good morning, Barbara, this is your 
                        President speaking, I sure hope I 
                        didn’t wake you. 

           Cecil places a large plate of green beans in front of LBJ, he 
           covers the mouth piece, asks Cecil: 

                                 LBJ (CONT’D)
                        These canned?

           Cecil nods. LBJ gives him a pleased wink. 

                                 LBJ (CONT’D)
                        The reason why I’m calling so late 
                        is your husband is wavering on 
                        signing Kennedy’s Civil Rights 
                        Bill, and the American negra’ needs 
                        your husband’s support. 
           Cecil sets down a tapioca pudding and plate of pancakes next 
           to the green beans, LBJ grins at his bizarre feast. 

                                 LBJ (CONT’D)
                        Now, until he agrees to vote for 
                        this bill, I’m gonna have to call 
                        you every night at three in the 
                        morning, and if he doesn’t vote 
                        with me, well, I may just keep on 
                        calling for the next year or two to 
                        tell you how disappointed I am. 

           As Cecil walks out, he glances at LBJ who digs in to the 
           green bean. Cecil looks baffled by LBJ. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I never before seen a man who said 
                        ‘nigger’ so much, work so hard to 
                        help negroes.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           90 year old Cecil is hand washing his socks in the sink. 

                                 CECIL
                        Sometimes people grow up one way, 
                        but then they can become someone 
                        else, I guess. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - PANTRY ROOM - DAY

           The butlers are in the pantry restocking the shelf with 
           glasses and cups. They all look exhausted.  

                                 BOOKER
                        I don’t think I’ve had a full 
                        night’s sleep in a year. 

           Cecil and Carter nod in agreement. Then, Booker’s face drops 
           in amazement as he sees something. Carter sees what Booker 
           sees, he too is stunned. Carter taps Cecil who jumps up. 

           They stare forward in quiet shock at the end of the pantry, 
           Booker’s eyes fill with tears. Standing across from them is -

           MARTIN LUTHER KING. 

           Only 35, King is very handsome with a rare ability to exude 
           warmth and dignity at the same time. 
                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        I’m so sorry to disturb you, 
                        gentleman, but I wanted to meet you 
                        all. I’m Martin. 

           He steps forward and holds out his hand to Booker. 

                                 BOOKER
                        This is the greatest honor of my 
                        life, Dr. King. 

           Martin Luther King smiles, he’s very approachable.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        The honor is all mine. 

           He shakes hands with Carter who is also beaming. Cecil shakes 
           his hand last, he is formal, a touch cool.

                                 CECIL
                        A pleasure to meet you, Dr. King. 

           King grins at their tuxedos. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        My, oh, my, y'all look just superb. 

           Cecil can’t help it as a tiny smile creeps out. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - DAY

           LBJ sits across from MLK, each flanked by their aides. Cecil 
           stands nearby underneath a magnolia tree. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        Your success with the Civil Rights 
                        Bill is greatly appreciated within 
                        the negro community, Mr. President. 

           A tiny drop of water FALLS from the magnolia tree and lands 
           on the back of Cecil’s neck. It sends shivers down his spin, 
           but he stands perfectly still, doesn’t move.  

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING (CONT’D)
                        No President has done more for the 
                        negro since Abraham Lincoln freed 
                        us from chains.

           LBJ is beaming, feels great about what he accomplished.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not enough. 
           LBJ’s smile drops. Cecil glances over in surprise.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        That was the first time I ever 
                        started really listenin’. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BATHROOM DAY

           90 year old Cecil is wringing his socks out. 

                                 CECIL
                        Oh, sure, I’d hear things from time 
                        to time, but I would never listen. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        So why’d you start now?

                                 CECIL
                        A negro was tellin’ the President 
                        of the United States that a five 
                        course meal ain’t good enough, he 
                        wants all eight courses. I never 
                        heard nuthin’ like it in my life. 

           EXT. ROSE GARDEN - DAY

           Martin Luther King lights into LBJ: 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        Only 5% of the negroes in 
                        Mississippi are registered to vote, 
                        11% in Alabama. We desperately need 
                        a Voting Rights Bill if we’re going 
                        to insure we are no longer blocked 
                        from Southern voting booths. 

           Cecil stares forward in stunned amazement. 

                                 LBJ
                        Goddamit, King! You know how many 
                        bridges I had to promise to get the 
                        last bill passed! I owe every two 
                        bit Congressman three bridges, a 
                        park and a fuckin’ airport. I spent 
                        eight months grabbing all these 
                        dumb sons-a-bitches by the balls 
                        and I got no more balls to grab, 
                        Dr. King, I used up all my negra’ 
                        capital! 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        On the bridges and the balls.
                                 LBJ
                        That’s right, Dr. King. Now y'all 
                        are just gonna have to cool down 
                        for a little while. 

           Another drop of water falls from the tree on to Cecil’s neck, 
           he shuts his eyes in pain. Chinese water torture. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        I should warn you, Mr. President, 
                        that I’ve got people in the streets 
                        down South right now trying to 
                        register the negro vote. 

           Cecil’s eyes flicker in concern.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING (CONT’D)
                        My guess is that it’s going to go 
                        from cool to hot very fast. 

                                 LBJ
                        Where?

           Cecil glances over at King right as a drop forms above him.

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        Selma. 

           The drop falls...

           INT. REGISTRAR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A black male APPLICANT, 50’s, is in a REGISTRAR OFFICE, being 
           escorted by Louis. The REGISTRAR, snide, reads a question:  

                                 REGISTRAR
                        If the President does not wish to 
                        sign a bill, how many days is he 
                        allowed in which to return it to 
                        Congress for reconsideration?

           The black applicant looks at him, baffled. The Registrar 
           stamps the word ‘REJECTED’ on his application. Louis shakes 
           his head in frustration. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           A lively party is going down in the basement of the Gains 
           House. Cecil serves all his friends martinis and appetizers. 
                                 GINA
                        My niece went to register to vote 
                        in Georgia and they made her wait 
                        for hours. Then when she finally 
                        got in, she had to take a test with 
                        all sort of crazy questions. Stuff 
                        only an expert would know. 

                                 HOWARD
                        And the white folks are asked who 
                        the first president was. 

           Cecil continues to serve, he looks like he’s not listening. 

                                 GLORIA
                        And then those three kids were 
                        killed in Mississippi registering 
                        black folk. 

           Cecil tries to hide his fear at this news. 

                                 GINA
                        The only reason why the President 
                        sent the FBI is cuz two of them 
                        were white. 

           Everyone nods, except for Cecil. Gloria turns to him. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Shouldn’t the President do more to 
                        pass a voting bill?

                                 CECIL
                        President Johnson just passed the 
                        greatest piece of civil rights 
                        legislation since Lincoln freed the 
                        slaves, it’s going to be very 
                        difficult to pass another bill 
                        anytime soon. 

           Most of the room nods in agreement, when Cecil speaks they 
           listen. He holds up a tray of cocktails to lighten the mood.

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Now how about some more spirits 
                        while we wait? 

           They all smile as they grab another drink. Gloria stares at 
           Cecil, it’s clear she disagrees with him. 
           INT. BROWN’S CHAPEL - SELMA, ALABAMA - NIGHT

           Louis and Carol are with a huge crowd in the pews. They 
           listen to a 39 year old black speaker in a black suit, skinny 
           tie and browline glasses. His name is MALCOLM X.

                                 MALCOLM X
                        Back during slavery, there were two 
                        kinds of negroes, there was the 
                        house negro and the field negro. 
                        The house negro lived better than 
                        the field negro. He ate better, he 
                        dressed better, and he lived right 
                        up next to his master. 

           Louis stares at Malcolm X, taken by what he’s saying.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - FLASHBACK - 8 YEARS EARLIER

           Cecil stands in front of the family in his White House Tuxedo 
           for the first time.  14 year old Louis looks at him, uneasy.

           INT. BROWN’S CHAPEL - SELMA, ALABAMA - NIGHT

                                 MALCOLM X
                        Then you had the field negro who 
                        hated the master because they 
                        caught hell and felt the sting of 
                        the lash. 

           Louis starts to nod. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ALABAMA - COUNTRY ROAD - FLASHBACK - 2 YEARS EARLIER

           The Freedom Bus burns as Louis gets clubbed in the head. 

           INT. BROWN’S CHAPEL - SELMA, ALABAMA - NIGHT

                                 MALCOLM X
                        And today you still have house 
                        negroes and field negroes!

           The audience applauds as Louis nods in agreement.  
                                 MALCOLM X (CONT’D)
                        The same old slave masters today 
                        have house negroes, who are nothing 
                        more than 20th century Uncle Tom’s 
                        keeping us passive in non-violence. 
                        That’s Uncle Tom making you non-
                        violent, so you suffer peacefully.

           Louis’ face drops, he no longer likes this speech. 

                                 MALCOLM X (CONT’D)
                        Dr. King came to Selma with his 
                        message of non-violence and I think 
                        the white people of Selma would do 
                        well to listen to Dr. King, before 
                        the field negro comes along and 
                        does things another way. 

           The crowd breaks out in applause, but Louis looks pissed. He 
           glances at Carol who has a grin on her face. Louis does not 
           like what he sees. 

           INT. ALLEY WAY - SELMA, ALABAMA - NIGHT

           Louis and Carol are walking down a dark alley, he looks 
           disturbed, unsure of what to make of Malcolm X. Carol also 
           looks disturbed, but she’s now unsure of what to make of MLK.

           Just then - a GUNSHOT rings through the night. Louis 
           instinctually grabs Carol and shoves her up against a wall, 
           their faces inches apart from each other. Then -

           She grabs his face and KISSES him on the mouth. Their mouths 
           and arms inner-twine as they furiously make out in the alley.  

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gloria walks down the stairs and finds Cecil standing in the 
           living room, he holds up a personal check. 

                                 CECIL
                        What is this?

           Gloria cringes, knows that she’s been caught. 

                                 GLORIA
                        What?

                                 CECIL
                        Have you been sending Louis money?
                                 GLORIA
                        He needs it. 

                                 CECIL
                        We’re not gonna pay for him to kill 
                        himself.

           Cecil rips the check up. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        If he wants to get thrown in jail 
                        then he can pay his own way! 

           Cecil storms up the stairs. Gloria watches him go, upset.

           INT. NEGRO HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Louis and Carol lay naked under bed covers in a dank motel 
           room. Louis looks quietly content, but Carol is all business. 

                                 CAROL
                        We’re losing the press. 

           Louis doesn’t say anything. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        We’re losing the momentum. King is 
                        in prison and no one cares, 
                        something’s got to happen, we got 
                        to make something happen. 

           He turns to her: 

                                 LOUIS
                        Marry me. 

           Silence. She doesn’t respond.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Every time I’m rottin’ in jail, all 
                        I think about is you. You keep me 
                        sane in this insane world. I want 
                        you to be my wife. 

                                 CAROL
                        I’ve hated myself since before I 
                        was born. How am I supposed to know 
                        how to love you?

           Louis stares at her for a beat. Then - 
                                 LOUIS
                        If I can wait out Jim Crow, I can 
                        wait out you. 

           She tries not to smile, but she clearly liked the answer.

           EXT. DALLAS COURTHOUSE - SELMA, ALABAMA - DAY

           Hundreds of black protestors are marching through downtown 
           Selma toward the courthouse. As always, crowds of whites are 
           lined up on the sidewalks screaming and booing at them. 

           Police in riot gear stand between the whites and blacks. 
           Louis and Carol march with the crowd. Carol looks worried, 
           she whispers to Louis in hushed fury.  

                                 CAROL
                        There’s no press here, we’re losing 
                        this thing. We are losin’!

           She turns to him, an anger building deep in her soul. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        You understand me, you stupid 
                        nigger, we’re gonna lose Selma!

           SHERIFF JIM CLARK, fat, jabs his nightstick into Louis ribs. 

                                 SHERIFF JIM CLARK
                        Get in the middle of the street. 

           Carol grabs the nightstick and stares at the Sheriff. 

                                 SHERIFF JIM CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What in the hell do you think ya 
                        doin’?  

           Carol lifts her fist and PUNCHES Sheriff Clark right in the 
           face. Totally blind sided, he falls over. 

           Louis looks terrified and grabs Carol, but she shoves him 
           off, jumps on top of the Sheriff and PUNCHES him again. And 
           again. And again. And again. And again.  

           Three cops finally jump on top of her and start beating her 
           with their nightsticks. A PHOTOGRAPHER frantically shoots 
           pictures of the beating. 

           INT. CHURCH - WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           In a packed black church, a PASTOR holds up a copy of the NY 
           Times with a photo of Carol getting beat on the front page.
                                 PASTOR
                        Tomorrow morning these brave men, 
                        women and children in Selma are 
                        going to begin a march to 
                        Montgomery and we need to give them 
                        all the support we can!

           Hats are being passed around where people toss in their 
           dollar bills and change. Booker and his wife, THELMA, pretty,  
           sit in the pews next to Carter and his wife, SOPHIE, shy. 

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        Whatever change you’ve got, put it 
                        in the till because every dollar is 
                        goin’ to Selma!

           Gloria sneaks into the back of the church. She takes out a 
           thick roll of one dollar bills and places it in a hat. 

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        Now let us pray for them. 
                             (Shuts his eyes)
                        Oh, dear lord, protect these brave 
                        men and women as they march for 
                        freedom. 

           No one is praying harder than Gloria. 

                                 PASTOR (CONT’D)
                        Protect them as they seek to 
                        protect us. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FULL SCREEN - ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE: 

           Black & white news footage of the black protestors getting 
           clubbed by a militia on the Edmund Pettus bridge.

                        ‘The Alabama State Gaurd brutally 
                        suppressed a march from Selma to 
                        Montgomery today in what has been 
                        dubbed ‘Bloody Sunday.’ 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           LBJ watches the newscast on three separate televisions at the 
           same time. Lady Bird watches with him, horrified. Cecil 
           stands behind him, trying to find his son on TV. 
           EXT. EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE - SELMA - DAY

           Louis is on the ground coughing from tear gas as riot police 
           and horses trample everywhere around him. A bandaged Carol 
           lies on top of a young teenage girl, protecting her. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil looks terrified, but LBJ is stoic as the news footage 
           reflects off his glasses, it effects him on a deep level.

                                 LBJ
                        The South is never gonna vote 
                        Democratic again.

           Cecil looks at him, not sure what he means. 

           INT. CONGRESS - DAY

           LBJ stands at the lectern in Congress addressing the Senate, 
           the House of Representatives and the country: 

                                 LBJ
                        Every American citizen must have an 
                        equal right to vote. Yet the harsh 
                        fact is that in many places in this 
                        country men and women are kept from 
                        voting because they are Negroes. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cecil, Booker and Carter watch the speech in the kitchen. 

                                 LBJ (FROM THE TV)
                        The negro is given a test. He may 
                        be asked to recite the entire 
                        Constitution, or explain the most 
                        complex provisions of State law.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gloria watches alone, enthralled...she’s part of this now.

                                 LBJ (FROM THE TV)
                        And even a college degree cannot be 
                        used to prove that he can read and 
                        write. For the fact is that the 
                        only way to pass these barriers is 
                        to show a white skin. 
           INT. SELMA BLACK HOTEL - DAY

           Louis, Carol and Martin Luther King are crammed in a room 
           full of beaten up Selma protestors. Everyone is bandaged and 
           bruised as they watch the speech. 

                                 LBJ (FROM THE TV)
                        On Wednesday, I will send to 
                        Congress a law designed to 
                        eliminate illegal barriers to the 
                        right to vote. 

           The room is beaming, several hugs and pats on the back. 

           INT. CONGRESS - DAY

           LBJ gets worked up as he speaks deep from his heart: 

                                 LBJ
                        What happened in Selma is part of a 
                        far larger movement which reaches 
                        into every section and State of 
                        America. Their cause must be our 
                        cause too. Because it's not just 
                        Negroes, but really it's all of us 
                        who must overcome the crippling 
                        legacy of bigotry and injustice.

           CLOSE UP - LBJ

                                 LBJ (CONT’D)
                        And we shall overcome.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           The protestors cheer in celebration, Louis and Carol hug in 
           joy. The only person not cheering is Martin Luther King 
           because his face is covered in tears. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cecil watches LBJ on the TV, taken by what he’s saying. 

                                 LBJ (FROM THE TV)
                        The real hero of this struggle is 
                        the American negro. His actions and 
                        protests have awakened the 
                        conscience of this nation. 
                                 BOOKER
                        It’s those kids in Selma, they did 
                        this. They made this happen. 

           A tiny smile forms on Cecil’s face. 

                                 LBJ (FROM THE TV)
                        His demonstrations have been 
                        designed to call attention to 
                        injustice, designed to provoke 
                        change, designed to stir reform. 

           For the first time, Cecil looks truly proud of his son. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           90 year old Cecil is in awe at the memory. 

                                 CECIL
                        The greatest politician of our time 
                        said he could never pass that bill, 
                        and then because of my son and his 
                        friends, the Voting Rights Act of 
                        1964 was passed.
                             (Then )
                        Ain’t that somethin’. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - RD WARNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cecil sits across from the Chief Usher, RD Warner. Cecil is 
           nervous, gripping his sweaty palms. 

                                 CECIL
                        Since the black staff does just as 
                        much work as the white staff, I 
                        believe our salaries should reflect 
                        our service. 

                                 RD WARNER
                        ‘Black’ staff?

                                 CECIL
                        I also feel that we should have 
                        opportunities at advancement. Black 
                        houseman are never promoted to the 
                        engineer’s office.

           RD Warner stares at Cecil for a long beat. Then -
                                 RD WARNER
                        You’re very well liked here, Cecil,  
                        but if you’re unhappy with your 
                        salary or position, than I suggest 
                        you seek employment elsewhere. 

           Cecil looks surprised that he got such a hard rebuke, but he 
           quickly covers it up with a warm, but defeated smile. 

           INT. LORRAINE MOTEL - MEMPHIS - DAY

           Martin Luther King is in his hotel room seated across from 
           his various associates and aides. Louis sits across from him. 
           They are watching footage of the Vietnam War on television. 

                                 NEWSCAST
                        “US Casualties are on the rise in 
                        Vietnam, giving fuel to critics who 
                        say there is no end in sight for 
                        what has become a bloody war.” 

           Martin Luther King shakes his head, frustrated. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        President Johnson may have a big 
                        heart, but he is making a tragic 
                        error in Vietnam. 

           Everyone nods their heads in agreement. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING (CONT’D)
                        How many of your parents support 
                        the war?

           Almost all of them raise their hands. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING (CONT’D)
                        That’s why we’ve got to keep 
                        speaking out against it. 
                             (To Louis)
                        Why do your parents support it?

                                 LOUIS
                        We haven’t spoken about it 
                        specifically, I just know they do. 

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        What does your dad do?

           Louis looks embarrassed to say. 

                                 LOUIS
                        He’s a butler. 
                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        Ah, yes. The black domestic. They 
                        serve a great role in our history. 

                                 LOUIS
                        They do?

                                 MARTIN LUTHER KING
                        The black domestic defies racial 
                        stereotypes by being hardworking 
                        and trustworthy. He slowly breaks 
                        down racial hatreds by the example 
                        of his strong work ethic and 
                        dignified character. 
                             (Then)
                        So even though we perceive the 
                        butler as being subservient, they 
                        are in many ways subversive without 
                        even knowing it. 

           Louis stares at him, never thought about his dad in this way. 

           EXT. LORRAINE MOTEL - MEMPHIS - TWILIGHT

           Louis walks out of the Lorraine Motel, he is deep in thought, 
           effected by what MLK said about his father. Then - 

           The sounds of GUNSHOTS explode in the air. Louis drops to his 
           knees for cover. He looks up and sees King’s aides standing 
           over a man lying on the balcony. 

           They point to roof tops across the way. 

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Thousands of people are in the streets in Cecil’s 
           neighborhood. People are crying, screaming in anger. 

           A furious black man picks up a trash can and throws it into a 
           store window, glass shatters everywhere. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hundreds of NATIONAL GUARDSMEN line up in front of the White 
           House in full riot gear. Shields and clubs ready for action. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           Still in his Tuxedo, Cecil drives his car down a dark street, 
           it’s dark and quiet, almost eerie. On the radio -
                                 RADIO NEWSCAST
                        “Riots have broken out in DC, 
                        fueled by anger over the 
                        assassination of Martin Luth--”

           Cecil hits the brakes as THREE BLACK MAN dart out in the 
           street in front of him, running from a liquor store. 

           BOOM!!! The store EXPLODES! Cecil’s car FLIPS onto it’s side. 

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           The riot has tripled in size. Stores are on fire as windows 
           are smashed and buildings set on fire. All the renovations 
           and upgrades of the last decade destroyed in minutes. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - BLACK SUBURB - NIGHT

           Cecil squirms out of the passenger side window of his car, 
           bleeding at his temples. He starts walking down the street. 

           A MOB of hundreds of black men are coming toward him. Gun 
           shots are fired into the air as the mob breaks windows.

           Police sirens whirl as a RIOT SQUAD pulls up at the end of 
           the block. The RIOTERS march toward the riot police with 
           Cecil directly in between. He doesn’t know which way to go. 

           Tear gas is volleyed through the air and lands in the middle 
           of the rioters. Cecil starts coughing from the tear gas. 

           EXT. STORE FRONT - NIGHT

           A man smashes windows with a baseball bat as fires rage 
           around him. It is violent and aggressive as other LOOTERS 
           back away from him. He turns around as we see it’s - 

           Louis. There is a dark anger in his eyes, transformed by 
           rage. Carol hurries over to him, puts her arms around him. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m not taking it no mo’, 
                        baby...I’m not taking it.

           EXT. OTIS PLACE - NIGHT

           Cecil walks up his block, dabbing a handkerchief on his 
           forehead. People stare at the fires that consume the city. 
           Gloria waits on the balcony with Gina and Elroy who’s 18 now. 
           She runs into the street and gives Cecil a huge bear hug. 

                                 CECIL
                        I’m okay, honey bear, I’m alright. 

           Elroy stares at the fires with anger and frustration. 

                                 ELROY
                        Why are they setting their own 
                        neighborhood on fire?! 

                                 CECIL
                        They’re angry, Elroy. 

                                 GLORIA
                        It’s happening all over the 
                        country. 

           They all stare out at the fires that engulf Washington DC.

                                 CECIL
                        America is burning for Martin 
                        Luther King. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - A WEEK LATER

           Cecil drives his tattered car through the war torn streets. 
           Burnt buildings, rubble everywhere, military police in tanks. 
           There is a sadness in him at the ruins of his neighborhood. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Three months later, Bobby Kennedy 
                        was assassinated.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Cecil gets out of his car and walks toward the White House. 

                                 CECIL V.O. 
                        Seemed like riots were breaking out 
                        everyday. They even had one in 
                        Chicago during the Democratic 
                        Convention. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY

           Hundreds of protestors stand outside the back gate of the 
           White House entrance. They are mostly white students and 
           HIPPIES dressed in colorful tie-dye clothes and beads. 
                                 CECIL V.O.
                        And now the white kids were just as 
                        angry as the black kids. 

           Holding up Anti-Vietnam War signs, they scream at Cecil as he 
           pushes his way through the crowd. 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        How can you work there?!/You’re 
                        just a nigger to them!/LBJ is a 
                        baby killer!

           Cecil maintains his warm smile as the Protestors shout.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           The butlers and housemen prepare the State Dining Room. The 
           Protestors outside the White House are heard: 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY! 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           -A Maid makes a bed, glancing toward the window.  

                                 PROTESTORS V.O.
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY!

           -A Calligrapher writes out an invitation, distracted. 

                                 PROTESTORS V.O. (CONT’D)
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY!

           -The Florist designs a new arrangement, she looks upset. 

                                 PROTESTORS V.O. (CONT’D)
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           LBJ stares out the window at the furious protestors. 

                                 PROTESTORS V.O.
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY!
           LBJ looks like a worn out old man, tired, drained, but mostly 
           defeated. Cecil stands behind him, sets down a can of Fresca. 

                                 CECIL
                        I brought you a Fresca, Mr. 
                        President.

           LBJ looks back at him, smiles through his sadness.

                                 LBJ
                        Thank you, Cecil. 

           He takes a huge swig, it makes him feel a little better.  

                                 LBJ (CONT’D)
                        How’s your boy doing?

           Cecil doesn’t answer immediately, tough to talk about Louis.

                                 CECIL
                        I don’t know, Mr. President. 
                        Sometimes I feel like we’re living 
                        in two different worlds. All I want 
                        is for him to be safe, but no 
                        matter what I say, he always gets 
                        so angry at me.

           The Protestors get even louder: 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        HEY, HEY, LBJ! HOW MANY KIDS HAVE 
                        YOU KILLED TODAY!

                                 CECIL
                        He keeps telling me that I don’t 
                        understand him...and maybe he’s 
                        right. Maybe I just don’t 
                        understand him anymore. 

           LBJ looks at Cecil with a deep pain. He feels the same way 
           about the country. 

                                 LBJ
                        Sometimes it’s hard to be a father.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil is ironing a pair of black pants. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Were you sad that LBJ didn’t run 
                        for a second term?
           Cecil looks at his watch. 

                                 CECIL
                        How much more time do we have? I 
                        don’t want to be late. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        We’ve got a few more hours. 
                             (Then)
                        Were you sad to see him go?

                                 CECIL
                        I’m always sad when the First 
                        Family leaves. Always. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO ENTRANCE - DAY

           The moving van is parked as Housemen carry LBJ’s boxes to it. 
           Right after a Houseman shuts the van door, it takes off. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        But I was also secretly excited 
                        that an old friend was comin’ back.

           An identical moving van immediately pulls up in its place. We 
           hear the voice of the new President: 

                                 RICHARD V.O.
                        I, Richard Milhous Nixon, do 
                        solemnly swear...  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - DAY

           Richard Nixon and his wife, PAT NIXON, 56, walk down the 
           Center Hall flanked by staff and RD Warner. She is poised and 
           lean with a perfect blond coif. Pat is quiet, but not cold. 

           They are taking a tour of their new living quarters led by RD 
           Warner. He is flanked by a few aides and the Nixon daughters, 
           TRICIA, 22, petite blond and JULIE, 20, brunette. 

           Nixon smiles as he gives Cecil his signature Victory salute, 
           Cecil gives it back to him. 

           EXT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           Gloria is in the kitchen, rolling dough for dinner. She looks 
           unhappy, perhaps something is missing from her life. Just 
           then, there is a knock at the door. She opens it to see -  
           Louis and Carol. They both have afros and wear black pants 
           and black leather jackets, a militant ‘black power’ look. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Hi, Ma. 

           Gloria tears up at the site of her son, so excited to see 
           him. She flings open the door and gives him a huge hug. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Ma, I want you to meet my fiance, 
                        Carol Blue. 

           Gloria’s eyes light up. She screams: 

                                 GLORIA
                        The dear lord has finally answered 
                        my prayers! 

           She throws her arms around Carol, embracing her in a big hug. 

           INT. GAINS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The entire family is having dinner along with several 
           neighbors, including Gina and Elroy, who is dressed in a Navy 
           uniform. An impromptu welcome home party. 

           There is a tension in the air as no one knows what to make of  
           Louis and Carol’s ‘black power’ look. Cecil is particularly 
           put off. Louis glances at Elroy, hates his Navy uniform. 

                                 LOUIS
                        You goin’ to Vietnam?

                                 ELROY
                        Yes, sir. 

           Gina puts her arm around him. 

                                 GINA
                        We all so proud. 

           Everyone nods. Louis and Carol glance at each other, then go 
           back to their food, biting their tongues. More silence. 

                                 GLORIA
                        So, Carol, I have all sorts of 
                        cooking supplies you can have when 
                        you two move in together. 

                                 CAROL
                        Thank you, Mrs. Gains, but I don’t 
                        cook. 
                                 GLORIA
                        What?

                                 LOUIS
                        The sisters in our political 
                        organization refuse to partake in 
                        traditional gender roles. 

           This makes Gloria feel a little self conscious.

                                 GLORIA
                        Oh, that’s very...unique. 

                                 ELROY
                        What’s your political organization 
                        called?

                                 LOUIS
                        The Black Panther Party. 

           Silence. 

                                 CECIL
                        What kind of name is that?

                                 LOUIS
                        We promote Black Power through 
                        pride in our African heritage as 
                        expressed in the teachings and self 
                        discipline of Brothers Huey Newton 
                        and Bobby Seale. 

                                 CAROL
                        We provide free breakfast for 
                        children, free medical clinics, and 
                        free self defense classes. 

                                 CECIL
                        Self defense classes?

                                 LOUIS
                        We ain’t gonna get beat no mo’. 

           This lands like a hammer. The room looks uncomfortable. 

                                 GLORIA
                        That reminds me of a movie I just 
                        saw that you might like. ‘In the 
                        Heat of the Night’. Sidney Poitier 
                        plays a cop that goes Sout--

                                 LOUIS
                        I won’t see anything with Sidney 
                        Poitier. 
                                 CECIL
                        Why not?

                                 LOUIS
                        Sidney Poitier is the white man’s 
                        fantasy of what he wants the black 
                        to be. Well behaved with no sense 
                        of his manhood as a sexual being.

                                 CECIL
                        But his movies have him fighting 
                        for equal rights. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Only in a way that is acceptable to 
                        the white status quo. He earns the 
                        white man’s respect with false 
                        dignity instead of fighting against 
                        the immorality of his degradation.
                             (Then)
                        And the brother can’t act. 

           Carol and him laugh. Cecil looks upset.

                                 CECIL
                        He won the Academy Award...he’s 
                        broken barriers for our people. 

                                 LOUIS
                        By being white, by acting white. 
                        Sidney Poitier is nothing but a 
                        rich Uncle Tom. 

           Cecil jumps to his feet and screams: 

                                 CECIL
                        GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                        I WILL NOT SIT HERE AND HAVE YOU 
                        RIDICULE THE GREATEST NEGRO STAR OF

                                 LOUIS
                        HE’S AN UNCLE TOM!

           Cecil SMASHES a plate.

                                 CECIL
                        GET OUT!
                                 LOUIS
                        I’M SORRY, BUTLER! I DIDN’T MEAN TO 
                        MAKE FUN OF YO HERO!

           Gloria SLAPS Louis across the face. Hard. Gina gasps. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Never disrespect your father in

                        have is because of him. Everything!

           Silence. Then, Louis laughs, nods to Carol to leave.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Shit, alright. I’m gone. You

                        girl get y'all some mo’ rights.  

                                 CECIL
                        Get out. 

                                 LOUIS

                                 CECIL
                        Just get out. 

           Louis and Carol turn around and walk out of the devastated 
           room. Cecil stares at them, fuming in anger. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Cecil walks down a hall with a tray of tea, the anger and 
           bitterness still plastered across his face. 

           Right when he turns into the room, his face instantly flips 
           to his pleasant smile. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil brings in a tea for Nixon who is deep in conversation 
           with his two closest advisors - BOB HALDEMAN, 44, crew cut, 
           intense, and JOHN EHRLICHMAN, 45, balding, boy scout face. 

                                 HALDEMAN
                        We think the time calls for a 
                        period of benign neglect.

           Cecil pours tea for Nixon. 
                                 NIXON
                        Benign neglect?

                                 EHRLICHMAN
                        The polls overwhelmingly show white 
                        voters are tired of the race issue 
                        and feel enough has been done. 

           Cecil pours tea for Ehrlichman, glances at him, but 
           Ehrlichman doesn’t notice. 

                                 HALDEMAN
                        And the Southern Strategy is 
                        clearly working. We gained momentum 
                        in ‘68, but we think we can flip 
                        the South for good in ‘72. 

           Nixon thinks it over, stares at Cecil who pours tea. 

                                 NIXON
                        There’s this whole black power 
                        movement going on, right? What if 
                        Nixon promotes black power to mean 
                        black businesses, and we find ways 
                        to support black entrepreneurs. We 
                        pass the buck on desegregation to 
                        the courts, but push black 
                        enterprise to win over the 20% that 
                        could vote our way. 

           Haldeman and Erhlichman exchange glances, they love it.  

                                 HALDEMAN
                        That’s excellent, sir. 

           Cecil picks up his tray and heads for the door. 

                                 EHRLICHMAN
                        We just need to make sure that 
                        ‘Nixon’s black power’ doesn’t 
                        equate Nixon with the Black 
                        Panthers. 

           Cecil pauses for a slight beat. 

                                 NIXON
                        God no! Did you read Hoover’s 
                        memo?! It’s terrifying. I gave him 
                        the green light to go after them 
                        with all we got. 

           Cecil’s eyes shut in pain as he walks out the door. 
           INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Ten BLACK PANTHERS, all in black jackets and berets, load 
           shotguns in a smoked filled room. The leader of this group 
           ELDRIDGE HUDGINS, 29, black, muscular, loads his shotgun. 

                                 ELDRIDGE HUDGINS
                        Always beware of the nigger with a 
                        gun. 

           A few people in the room laugh, but Louis is uncomfortable. 
           He looks around at the guns, the smoke, just doesn’t like 
           what he sees. He whispers to Carol. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I got to talk to you. 

           INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Louis speaks to Carol in the hall outside the room. 

                                 LOUIS
                        We should get out of here. 

                                 CAROL
                        What?

                                 LOUIS
                        This is a mistake. We should go. 

                                 CAROL
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 LOUIS
                        I was always proud to be in 
                        jail...but I don’t think I’d be 
                        proud to be there for what we’re 
                        about to do. 

           Carol looks stunned. Eldridge Huggins sticks his head out. 

                                 ELDRIDGE HUGGINS
                        Is there a problem here?

                                 CAROL
                        Louis wants to leave. 

           Eldridge Huggins stares at him. 

                                 ELDRIDGE HUGGINS
                        You scared, brother?
                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, I’m scared, and I’m not your 
                        brother.  

                                 ELDRIDGE HUGGINS
                        What about you, soul sister? You 
                        gonna go with this jive ass 
                        peckerwood?

           Carol looks at Louis, then at Eldridge Huggins. 

                                 CAROL
                        No, soul brother, I’m with you. 

           She walks over to Huggins and puts her arm around him. 

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not getting beat no mo’, Louis. 

           EXT. OAKLAND STREET - NIGHT

           Louis walks down a quiet Oakland street, deeply disturbed. A 
           POLICE CAR slowly drives by him, then continues on its way. 
           Louis watches the car for a moment, then runs after it. 

           EXT. HOUSE - OAKLAND - NIGHT

           The Panthers are staked out with their shotguns - one behind 
           a tree, two behind a house, three more behind a fence. Carol 
           grips her shotgun, but now she looks unsure. 

           EXT. OAKLAND STREET - NIGHT

           Louis runs toward the police car that’s half a mile down the 
           street. He waves his arms at the police car. 

           EXT. HOUSE - OAKLAND - NIGHT

           The police car slowly drives down the block looking for an 
           address, inching closer toward its assassins. 

           The Panthers give each other slight nods. Carol nods back, 
           but she’s starting to sweat, doesn’t want to do this now. 

           Right when the car gets in their cross hairs, the Panthers 
           start BLASTING away. BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           Carol watches for a second, then starts BLASTING as she 
           screams in rage.  
           Louis appears at the head of the block and sees the firing 
           squad. Police sirens can be heard off in the distance as the 
           Panthers immediately take off running. 

           Carol sees Louis at the head of the block. They stare at each 
           other, Carol with shame in her eyes. Then she runs off. 

           Louis watches her go as the sirens get louder and louder. 
           Finally, he runs away. 

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Cecil drives down the street that still has many burnt down 
           buildings from the ‘68 riot. A few new storefronts have 
           opened that sell incense, candles and African clothes.

           Men and woman have AFROS and wear colorful DASHIKIS. A sense 
           of AFRICAN PRIDE has been infused into the neighborhood. 
           Cecil eyes it all, just doesn’t know what to make of it. 

           INT. ALLEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Cecil walks into the house and sees Gloria on the couch 
           watching news coverage of Watergate.

                        Can you please turn that off? I 
                        have to deal with Watergate 
                        everyday at work, I don’t want to

                        just because your boss is a two bit 
                        criminal with a gang of Cuban thugs 
                        on his payroll.

                                 GLORIA
                        Nixon’s henchmen. The same guys 
                        that broke into Daniel Ellsberg’s 
                        psychiatrist office were behind the 
                        Watergate break-in’s, it’s obvious 
                        this is a conspiracy.

                        What do you want me to do about it?

                        Cuz if the staff quit every time a 
                        President did something we didn’t 
                        like, there’d be no staff!

                                 CECIL
                        And when did you start getting so

                        black man in his entir--

           Just then - they see a MILITARY CAR drive slowly down the 
           street. They hurry to the window to see the car pull up to a 
           house. Out walks a MILITARY OFFICER and a PRIEST.

                                 CECIL
                        Oh my god. 

           Cecil and Gloria hurry out of the house, they look terrified. 
           Many neighbors are coming out of their homes as the Officer 
           and Priest knock on a front door.  

           The door opens revealing Gina, she stares at them in mortal 
           fear. Before they can speak she screams: 

                                 GINA
                        No! Not my Elroy! No!

           Cecil has hurried over and holds her as she WAILS in pain: 
                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Please God! Not my Elroy! NOT MY 
                        ELROY!

           The neighbors all surround Gina, many are crying. Cecil 
           continues to hold Gina as she wails in his arms. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I never felt more lost in all my

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil ties a black tie around his shirt collar. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Everything was changin’ around me 
                        so fast. Vietnam took our Elroy and 
                        Gloria was startin’ to drift away. 
                             (Then)
                        Everywhere I turned, someone new 
                        was leavin’ me behind...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - YELLOW OVAL ROOM - DAY

           Nixon stands in front of the entire White House staff with 
           Pat and his two daughters. 

                                 NIXON
                        I want you all to know that I leave 
                        with deep regret in my heart. You 
                        lifted me up during the tough 
                        moments and for that I will always 
                        be grateful.

           Several of the staff are crying, but not Cecil. He stares at 
           Nixon with a bitter detachment. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        We think that when we suffer a 
                        defeat, that all is ended. 

           He looks right at Cecil. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        But the greatness comes when you 
                        are really tested...

           Cecil looks surprised, never thought he’d ever be tested. 
                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        ...because only if you've been in 
                        the deepest valley...

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO ENTRANCE - DAY

           The Houseman shuts the back of the moving van.  

                                 NIXON V.O.
                        ...can you ever know how 
                        magnificent it is to be on the 
                        highest mountain.

           Right as the moving van drives off, an identical moving van 
           pulls up in its place. We hear the voice of GERALD FORD: 

                                 GERALD FORD
                        I, Gerald Rudolph Ford, do solemnly 
                        swear--

           The moving van immediately pulls off and a new moving van 
           pulls up right where it was parked. We hear the distinct 
           southern twang of our next President: 

                                 JIMMY 
                        I, Jimmy Carter, do solemnly 
                        swear... 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - DAY

           The staff hurries through the Central Hall, bringing in the 
           Carter’s new furniture that has a distinct country flair.

           The new Chief Usher, SCOTT REXFORD, mid-40’s, clean cut, 
           oversees the melee, he is much warmer than RD Warner. 

                                 SCOTT REXFORD
                        38 minutes to go. You all are doing 
                        great!

           Willie Nelson’s ‘On the Road Again’, plays over the sequence:  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The new President, JIMMY CARTER, 52, cherub-like, exudes 
           warmth and charm. He feels like a sweet uncle. He wears an 
           apron as he pours green water from a pot into a bowl. 
                                 JIMMY
                        The juice from the collared greens 
                        contains an abundance of the 
                        vegetable’s minerals and vitamins. 
                             (Big smile)
                        We call it pot likker.

           The Chef grins, but a little worried that his culinary skills 
           are going to be under utilized for the next four years. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CROSS HALL - DAY

           ‘On the Road Again’ continues as Jimmy’s daughter, AMY, 9, 
           round nerdy glasses, roller skates through the Cross Hall. 
           Cecil jumps out of the way holding a tray. 

           EXT. SOUTH LAWN - NIGHT

           A huge Southern style BBQ is taking place on the South Lawn 
           with a crawfish boil, piles of corn bread and BBQ. WILLIE 
           NELSON is up on a stage singing ‘On The Road Again’. 

           Jimmy dances with his wife, ROSALYN, pretty and charming. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - DAY

           Jimmy Carter stands at a podium in front of the press corps. 

                                 JIMMY
                        ...and that is why I am proud to 
                        appoint the country’s first black 
                        female Cabinet member, Patricia 
                        Harris, as head of Housing and 
                        Urban Development. 

           PATRICIA HARRIS, 52, black, walks up to the podium. Cecil 
           applauds, then stops, remembering he’s not supposed to clap.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           Gloria beams with pride at a big front page photo on the 
           Washington Post of Patricia Harris. She looks up, 
           thinking...this sparks something in her.  

           INT. COMBAHEE RIVER COLLECTIVE - DAY

           Gloria walks into the office of the Combahee River 
           Collective. It’s filled with young black woman in their 20’s 
           and 30’s. Many of them with bushy Afros. 
           Posters cover the walls with pictures of black women marching 
           in rallies with the slogan - “A SEPARATE ROAD TO FEMINISM”. A 
           female STAFF MEMBER look up at the older Gloria. 

                                 STAFF MEMBER
                        Can I help you?

           Gloria doesn’t respond, she looks nervous. 

           INT. COMBAHEE RIVER COLLECTIVE - OFFICE - DAY

           Gloria sits in a small office across from BARBARA SMITH, 30, 
           wears an army jacket. She has a tough, but cool vibe.

                        sexism, homophobia and classicism 
                        to ensure that the most

                        American society, the black woman, 
                        will no longer be ignored. 

           Gloria has a stunned look on her face, doesn’t know what to 
           say. Barbara Smith can tell she is overwhelmed. 

                                 BARBARA SMITH (CONT’D)
                        So tell me, Gloria, what exactly

                        The black woman was completely left 
                        behind by the Civil Rights 
                        movement. It was always ‘One Man, 
                        One Vote’, the word ‘woman’ was 
                        never mentioned even though we were 
                        an integral part of the struggle. 

           Slight beat.

           INT. ELKS CLUB - STATE ASSEMBLY DEBATE - NIGHT

           Dressed in a suit and tie, Louis stands at a podium in front 
           of a medium sized audience of about 100 people. A banner 
           above him announces ‘STATE ASSEMBLY DEBATE’. 

           The room is sparsely decorated, a low budget operation, but 
           Louis passionately addresses the modest crowd. In his mid-
           30’s now, he’s lost a little hair and gained a few pounds. 

                                 LOUIS
                        With the economy spiraling out of 
                        control, there is no greater time 
                        for Affirmative Action than now. I 
                        know these measures are not popular 
                        with white voters, as they seem to 
                        feel that racism is a thing of the 
                        past, but the truth is that black 
                        America is still significantly 
                        disadvantaged due to past and 
                        present discrimination. 

           The MODERATOR turns to Louis main competitor, KEITH ALANS, a 
           black conservative in a bow tie, he speaks from a podium.  

                                 KEITH ALANS
                        Mr. Gains and I may share the same 
                        skin color, but that is all we 
                        share. Affirmative Action is racism 
                        in reverse and it only creates more 
                        hostility by causing whites to 
                        resent blacks.

                        he must do it with his own 
                        achievements.

                        for 400 years and then accuse him 
                        of being dirty. 

                                 KEITH ALANS
                        Even our liberal President agrees 
                        that Affirmative Action should be 
                        phased out as he has already begun 
                        slashing these programs. 

           Louis shoots him an icy look. 

                                 LOUIS
                        To my great disappointment, 
                        President Carter is not a liberal. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Jimmy Carter sits across from the Black Congressional Caucus. 
           They are stern with him, all look frustrated. Their leader is 
           REP. JOHN CONYERS, 49, tough, no nonsense.

           Cecil refills everyone’s glasses with waters. He seems 
           focused on the water, but it’s clear he’s listening.

                                 REP. JOHN CONYERS
                        You received 94% of the black vote 
                        in the second closest election of 
                        the century, Mr. President. We 
                        elected you, and I’m sorry to say 
                        that we feel betrayed by these cuts 
                        to social programs. 

                                 JIMMY
                        My first priority has got to be 
                        getting inflation down or the 
                        economy is going to continue to 
                        spiral out of control.   

                                 REP. JOHN CONYERS
                        Which is exactly why we need more 
                        economic investment in the inner 
                        cities, not less. White businesses 
                        have fled in droves and it has 
                        created rampant black unemployment.
                                 JIMMY
                        It’s not just the black community 
                        that is suffering--

                                 REP. JOHN CONYERS
                        --but we are disproportionately 
                        affected. 

                                 JIMMY
                        I’ve got to keep the budgets tight, 
                        everyone is just going to have to 
                        learn to get by with less. 

           The black leaders exchange frustrated glances. John Conyers 
           rises to his feet. Cecil looks surprised. 

                                 REP. JOHN CONYERS
                        We’re used to getting less, Mr. 
                        President, we were just hoping for 
                        more from you. 

           He walks out of the room, Cecil looks stunned. 

           EXT. LOUIS GAINS ELECTION HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           The small campaign headquarters is covered in deflated 
           balloons that matches everyone’s deflated spirit. The only 
           person not upset is Louis who tries to cheer everyone up. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I know everyone is disappointed, 
                        and no one more so than me. But we 
                        have to remember that even though 
                        we lost tonight, we need to 
                        celebrate that another brother has 
                        won an election. Now I know he may 
                        not be our kind of brother... 

           Everyone laughs. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        ...but a black man is going to the 
                        state assembly and for that we 
                        should all be thrilled. 

           Polite applause.  

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Ten years ago we couldn’t even vote 
                        in the South and now we’ve got 
                        brothers and sisters in Congress 
                        and state offices. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Maynard Jackson is the mayor of 
                        Atlanta, Tom Bradley in Los 
                        Angeles, Carl Stokes, Shirley 
                        Chisolm, Barbara Jordan and the 
                        list goes on and on! We are doing 
                        it! We are starting to live the 
                        American dream!

           Everyone is applauding like crazy now. Even though Louis 
           lost, he looks like a leader. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been through so many dark 
                        times, but in all those years 
                        gettin’ beat and thrown in prison, 
                        I never thought I’d see the day 
                        that I would have to give a 
                        concession speech. 

           The room gives a warm and joyous applause to this. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        I want to thank you all for your 
                        hard work, and I want to thank my 
                        beautiful wife, Sarah, for all 
                        those long hours on the trail. 

           Everyone applauds Louis’ gorgeous wife, SARAH, 30, black. She 
           smiles at the crowd. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t the end tonight, it’s 
                        only the beginning. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil is on the phone as Gloria anxiously waits for news. As 
           Cecil’s eyes drop, so do Gloria’s. 

                                 CECIL (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Thank you, I appreciate it. 

           He hangs up, turns to his wife. Then sadly shakes his head. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        He lost 51 to 49%. 

           Gloria cringes at how close it was. 

                                 GLORIA
                        Should we call him? 
                                 CECIL
                        It’s been so long. Do you think he 
                        wants to hear from us tonight?

           Gloria shrugs, isn’t sure. 

           INT. LOUIS GAINS ELECTION HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The room has emptied out a bit. Louis lounges on a couch, 
           arms clutched around Sarah. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I still can’t believe I lost to 
                        that honky nigger. 

           She busts up laughing. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Everyone knows the fool only got 
                        into Harvard because of Affirmative 
                        Action! What’s the matter with 
                        these people?!

           An AIDE yells from the other end of the room. 

                                 AIDE
                        Louis, you got a phone call. 

           Louis walks over to the phone, picks it up. He hears: 

                                 CAROL V.O.
                        I’m so sorry you lost. 

           Louis sits up, obviously hasn’t heard from her in years. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Where are you?

           INT. FEDERAL STATE PRISON - NIGHT

           Carol is in a prison uniform in a federal penitentiary. Her 
           arms are covered in prison tatoos, she’s been here for years. 

                                 CAROL
                        I love you, Louis. I’m sorry I 
                        never could say that before, but I 
                        really do love you. 

           INTERCUT - LOUIS AND CAROL

                                 LOUIS
                        What happened? Where did you go?
                                 CAROL
                        Don’t ever forget that, okay, baby, 
                        please don’t ever forget it.  

           She hangs up. 

           Louis slowly hangs up the phone, then looks over at his wife. 
           He smiles at his beautiful Sarah...happy with his life. 

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Driving to work, Cecil sees several boarded up buildings with 
           ‘FOR RENT’ and ‘FORECLOSED’ signs. All of the African-Pride 
           stores have shut down and no new businesses are moving in. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Every where I looked, it seemed 
                        like another black man was losin’ 
                        somethin’ new.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Cecil eyes the headline on Booker’s newspaper: ‘SUPREME COURT 
           RULES FOR BAKKE, ENDS RACIAL QUOTAS.” 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        And for the first time, I was 
                        startin’ to get mad. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHIEF USHER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cecil sits across from the Chief Usher, Scott Rexford.  

                                 CECIL
                        I’ve been here for twenty years 
                        now, and for all that time, the 
                        black help has been getting a 
                        smaller salary than the white help. 
                        I just don’t think it’s right.  

           Scott Rexford is much warmer than the previous Chief Usher.

                                 SCOTT REXFORD
                        I don’t think it is either, Cecil. 

                                 CECIL
                        And there are black housemen who 
                        should be engineers by now, they 
                        should’ve been promoted years ago. 
                                 SCOTT REXFORD
                        I fully agree, and I plan on making 
                        several promotions immediately. The 
                        raises are going to be tougher 
                        because of the recession. 

           Cecil smiles his warm smile. 

                                 CECIL
                        I know that we’re in a recession, 
                        but I can’t wait out these excuses 
                        anymore. I have to be paid the same 
                        as the white help or I’ll have to 
                        move on. 

           Silence. Scott Rexford is impressed at his forcefulness. 

                                 SCOTT REXFORD
                        I know that no one wants that, 
                        including the President. I’ll get 
                        into it immediately. 

                                 CECIL
                        It’s important that it’s not just 
                        me, all of the black help needs to 
                        get equal pay to the white staff. 

           Scott Rexford smiles. 

                                 SCOTT REXFORD
                        We’ll find a way to make this work.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STAIR LANDING - DAY

           Cecil walks up the stair landing with a small look of pride 
           on his face, he sees Jimmy Carter sitting on the floor of the 
           Treaty Room tieing a fly fishing fly.

           Cecil stares at the President, he looks beaten up by the job, 
           depressed. Jimmy sees Cecil through the doorway. 

                                 JIMMY
                        You ever do much fishing, Cecil?

                                 CECIL
                        No, sir. 

                                 JIMMY
                        My daddy used to take me fly 
                        fishing as a boy. 
                             (Then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        I bet when I’m on my death bed, 
                        I’ll think of my daddy, and I 
                        probably won’t even remember I was 
                        President. 

           Cecil grins, but the conversation is a touch painful. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Were you close with your father?

           Cecil shakes his head, no. 

                                 CECIL
                        I never knew him.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m sorry, Cecil, that’s a real 
                        shame. 

                                 CECIL
                        I sometimes wonder what he looked 
                        like. 

                                 JIMMY
                        If he could see you now, I bet he’d 
                        be real proud of you. 

                                 CECIL
                        I bet your father would be very 
                        proud of you, Mr. President. 

           Slight beat. 

                                 JIMMY
                        I think he might be disappointed.  

                                 CECIL
                        I don’t think so, Mr. President. 
                        His son made it to the White House.

                                 JIMMY
                        We both made it, Cecil. 

                                 CECIL
                        Yes we did, Mr. President. 

           Slight beat, Jimmy’s face falls knowing his doomed fate. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Except you’ll get to stay. 
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO ENTRANCE - DAY

           A moving van is pulling out as a new moving van pulls in. We 
           hear the raspy older voice of our next president: 

                                 RONNIE
                        I, Ronald Wilson Reagan, do 
                        solemnly swear... 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           RONALD ‘RONNIE’ REAGAN, 69, exudes a sweet, likable quality. 
           He feels like a favorite Grandfather. He is in the kitchen 
           with the butlers and the kitchen staff telling them a joke. 

                                 RONNIE
                        So the psychiatrist took the 
                        pessimistic brother to a room piled 
                        to the ceiling with brand-new toys. 
                        But instead of yelping with 
                        delight, the little boy burst into 
                        tears. "What's the matter? Don't 
                        you want to play with any of the 
                        toys,” asked the psychiatrist. 
                        "Yes," the little boy bawled, "but 
                        if I did I'd only break them."

           The staff is smiling, a few have already started laughing. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Next the psychiatrist treated the 
                        optimistic brother. Trying to 
                        dampen his out look, he took him to 
                        a room piled to the ceiling with 
                        horse manure. The optimist yelped 
                        with delight, clambered to the top 
                        of the pile and began gleefully 
                        digging out scoop after scoop with 
                        his bare hands. 

           A few people grimace, but Cecil is laughing. Ronnie starts to 
           chuckle as he nears the punch line. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        "What do you think you're doing?", 
                        the psychiatrist asked. 
                             (Then)
                        "With all this manure," the 
                        optimistic boy replied, "there must 
                        be a pony in here somewhere!"
           The whole room bust out in laughter, everyone is beaming, 
           they love Ronald Reagan. Just then, his wife, NANCY, 59, 
           walks into the room in a stylish red suit. 

           As soon as she walks in, Ronnie tenses up a touch, becomes a 
           different person around Nancy. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Good talking to everyone. 

           He pecks Nancy on the cheek as he hurries out of the room. 
           Booker whispers to Cecil: 

                                 BOOKER
                        Just like at my house. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Ronnie sits with PAT BUCHANAN, 47, jowly, the Communications 
           Director. They are across from three Republican Senators, 
           RICHARD LUGAR, 53, BOB DOLE, 62 and NANCY KASSEBAUM, 53. 

           Cecil pours tea for Senator Dole who smiles at him. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I want to make myself clear on this 
                        issue. If Congress passes sanctions 
                        against South Africa, I will be 
                        forced to veto those sanctions. 

           Cecil stops pouring for a split second, then starts up again. 

                                 SENATOR LUGAR
                        Mr. President, we feel that you are 
                        missing a major point here. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Which is what, Senator Lugar?

           Cecil pours tea for Senator Kassebaum who nods at him. 

                                 SENATOR LUGAR
                        The brutal repression of South 
                        Africa’s black citizens is no 
                        longer just a foreign policy issue. 
                        It’s a domestic civil rights issue. 

           Pat Buchanan snaps at him. 

                                 PAT BUCHANAN
                        If we impose sanctions on South 
                        African it will make us appear weak 
                        to Russia!
           Cecil stands at the back, staring forward, it’s clear he’s 
           listening. Senator Kassebaum turns to Ronnie with urgency: 

                                 SENATOR KASSEBAUM
                        Mr. President, the three of us are 
                        Senators from your own party, you 
                        can’t get a friendlier room than 
                        this. That is why we feel so 
                        comfortable telling you that South 
                        Africa is a human rights disaster. 
                        Blacks are beaten, tortured and 
                        gunned down in the streets. The 
                        America people are horrified by 
                        Apartheid.   

           Ronnie looks frustrated with the Senators. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I’m sorry, Senator Kassebaum, but I 
                        will not show weakness to Russia by 
                        backing down on this issue.  

                                 SENATOR LUGAR
                        But Mr. President, your own 
                        personal world leadership is at 
                        stake. The United States of America 
                        needs to be on the right side of 
                        history on the race issue. 

           Ronnie looks at them all with his iron will, when he is 
           convinced he’s right, nothing can change his mind. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Let me be clear so that there’s no 
                        confusion, if Congress passes this 
                        bill, I will veto it. Period. 

           Pat Buchanan smiles at the three Republican Senators who just 
           stare at Ronnie, they can’t believe it. 

           Cecil also stares at Ronnie, he can’t believe it either. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DISHWASHING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil pours out the left over tea from his teapot. He looks 
           disturbed on a deep level. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ronnie sits alone behind his desk, he is writing a check out 
           for $2000. Cecil walks in. 
                                 CECIL
                        Yes, Mr. President. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I have a secret mission for you, 
                        Cecil. 

                                 CECIL
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I like to send people money when 
                        they write me about their financial 
                        problems, but my staff has been 
                        trying to get me to stop. You think 
                        you could help me keep this going?

           Ronnie places the check in an envelope and hands it to Cecil. 

                                 CECIL
                        Absolutely, Mr. President. 

           Ronnie looks up at him, something on his mind. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Cecil, did you ever go to those 
                        civil rights rallies in the 
                        sixties?

                                 CECIL
                        No, sir, I was too old for that 
                        sort of thing. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I know what you mean. 

           Ronnie looks troubled, trying to work through his feelings. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        This whole civil rights issue...I 
                        sometimes fear I’m on the wrong 
                        side of it...that I’m just wrong. 

           He turns to Cecil, a touch lost. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? 

           Cecil stares at him, amazed.  

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil stares into the video camera, still amazed. 
                                 CECIL
                        Never in my life had a President of 
                        the United States asked me what I 
                        thought about anything. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        So what did you tell him?

                                 CECIL
                        I told him the truth. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Cecil smiles at the President with understanding. 

                                 CECIL
                        I sometimes think the same thing 
                        about myself, Mr. President. 

           Ronnie nods. Then points at the envelope with the check - 

                                 RONNIE
                        I appreciate your help with our 
                        little project. And don’t tell 
                        Nancy about it. 

                                 CECIL
                        I won’t, Mr. President. 

           INT. HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As Cecil walks into the hallway he hears from behind him. 

                                 NANCY
                        Cecil.

           Cecil tenses up, quickly puts the envelope in his pocket. 

                                 CECIL
                        Yes, Mrs. Reagan? 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re very well liked around here. 
                        Everyone says you’re the man that 
                        got them raises and promotions. I 
                        had no idea you were such a rebel. 
                        How’d you get to be like that?

           Cecil smiles, trying to play it off like a joke.  
                                 CECIL
                        I’m not a rebel, Mrs. Reagan, it 
                        just seemed like it was time. 

           She smiles at him, clearly likes Cecil. 

                                 NANCY
                        I wanted to talk to you because I’d 
                        like to personally invite you to 
                        the State Dinner next week. 

                                 CECIL
                        But I’m going to be there, Mrs. 
                        Reagan. 

                                 NANCY
                        No, Cecil, not as a butler, I’m 
                        inviting you as a guest. 

           Cecil is stunned, doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 CECIL
                        But...the President prefers for me 
                        to serve him personally. 

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t worry about, Ronnie. I’ll 
                        take care of that. So we’ll see you 
                        and your wife next week, yes?

                                 CECIL
                             (Stunned)
                        Yes, Ma’m. 

           EXT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           Wearing a three piece tux, Cecil walks out of his house with 
           Gloria who is in a ball gown. They are greeted with a wild 
           round of applause from the neighbors who are all outside. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

           Gloria is being escorted by a Military aide toward the East 
           Room. She looks around in total amazement, Cinderella at the 
           ball. Cecil wanders behind her like all the other male dates.

                                 BOOKER
                        Can I get you champagne, Mr. Gains?

           Cecil slaps him on the shoulder. 
                                 CECIL
                        Oh, come on now!

           Booker starts to laugh. Then from behind them they hear:

                                 MILITARY AIDE
                        Ladies and Gentleman, the President 
                        and First Lady of the United 
                        States. 

           The Military Band begins ‘Hail to the Chief’ as Ronnie and 
           Nancy walk down the hall to great fanfare. 

           Gloria stares at Nancy who greets all of her guests with 
           charisma. Gloria is in awe of Nancy as she whispers to Cecil. 

                                 GLORIA
                        She’s so strong. 

           INT. STATE DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

           They are seated at separate tables as all of the butlers 
           smile at Cecil, very proud. A BUTLER serves him tomato soup. 

                                 BUTLER
                        This one is made special, Mr. 
                        Gains. 

                                 CECIL
                        Oh, come on now!

           Cecil glances over at Gloria who is seated near Nancy, she 
           beams at the First Lady who is controlling the table. 

           Cecil looks around at all of the butlers serving the room - 
           carefully setting down dishes, refilling water and wine 
           glasses. They are an impressive, well oiled machine. 

           But Cecil’s smile slowly starts to drop. He doesn’t know why, 
           but he doesn’t like what he sees. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil looks confused at the memory. 

                                 CECIL
                        It was real different sittin’ at 
                        the table instead of servin’ it. 
                        Real different. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cecil walks into the kitchen where Chef Luke is preparing a 
           glorious chocolate mouse. All of the staff looks confused. 

                                 CHEF LUKE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 CECIL
                        I wanted to see if you needed any 
                        help. 

                                 CHEF LUKE
                        Get back up there!

                                 CECIL
                        Alright, alright. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - NIGHT

           All the guests are having after dinner drinks. Cecil looks 
           even more unhappy, but Gloria is shinning, outgoing. Booker 
           walks over, whispers to Cecil.  

                                 BOOKER
                        How’s it going, blood?

                                 CECIL
                        Real nice. 
                             (Then)
                        Be even nicer if I was here for 
                        real instead of for show. 

           Booker smiles at Cecil with empathy, he finally gets it. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - NIGHT

           They walk into the house, Gloria is on cloud nine, still on a 
           high from the night. Cecil looks conflicted, almost confused. 

                                 GLORIA
                        I think that was one of the 
                        greatest nights of my life. 

           Cecil smiles, but it’s clear he had a different experience.

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gloria is asleep, but Cecil lies wide awake. 
                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I couldn’t understand why such a 
                        lovely night would cause me so much 
                        trouble.  

           He looks over at Gloria who is sound asleep with a big smile.

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        It had a whole different effect on 
                        Gloria. 

           EXT. RALLY  - DAY

           A huge rally is taking place with hundreds of black women 
           facing a stage where a nervous Gloria stands at a microphone.

                                 GLORIA
                        I’m just a quiet house wife from 
                        Washington DC, I never once saw 
                        myself as having the courage to 
                        stand up in front of people and 
                        speak out. 
                             (Then)
                        But for far too long the black 
                        woman has lived in the shadows. I 
                        say it is time we step out from the 
                        dark and let our voices be heard! 

           The crowd roars with approval, no one louder than Cecil. But 
           as Gloria continues her speech, Cecil looks a touch lost. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        The more Gloria came into her own, 
                        the more confused I felt. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

           Cecil passes out cookies to people in the White House tour,  
           he looks unhappy. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        For the first time in 34 years I 
                        started to feel restless at work.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DISHWASHING ROOM - DAY

           Cecil is washing dishes, looks almost angry. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I felt like I didn’t know who I was 
                        anymore. 
           INT. GAINS HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           90 year old Cecil is wearing a tie and pants, he cleans off 
           his suit jacket with a lint brush. 

                                 CECIL
                        Then I remembered that the last 
                        time I felt this way was after I 
                        read those books when I was a kid. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Cecil is in a library looking at the stacks of books. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        So I figured they might explain to 
                        me why I was upset again all these 
                        years later. 

           He pulls a copy of ‘EYES ON THE PRIZE’ off the shelf. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER

           He sits at a table reading the book. There is a picture from 
           1960 of the black students at the sit-ins being taunted. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        I remembered when this happened, 
                        but I didn’t know how bad it got. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Cecil reads ‘RACE, REFORM AND REBELLION’ about the Freedom 
           Riders, there is a picture of the burning bus. 

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        Readin’ about these kids made me 
                        embarrassed about how wrong I had 
                        been about them at first. They were 
                        never criminals...

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cecil sits on the couch reading ‘PILLAR OF FIRE’, there are 
           pictures of the various student protestors.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...they were heroes. All of them. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT'D)
                        James Bevel, John Lewis, Ella 
                        Baker, Stokey Carmichael, Bernard 
                        Lafayette, Carol Nash. 

           He turns the page and there is a full page picture of Louis 
           holding a sign that says ‘I AM A MAN.’ Cecil is stunned.

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        And then there he was, my boy...

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Cecil smiles into the camera. 

                                 CECIL
                        ...right along the rest of them. 

           For the first time we see the CAMERA MAN -

           It’s Louis, now 66, he’s bald with grey temples. Tears roll 
           down his cheek as he listens to his father. Cecil smiles at 
           his son, so proud. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        We had barely spoken for almost ten 
                        years, and when I saw your picture 
                        I realized that it had been the 
                        worst ten years of my life. I never 
                        knew I could miss someone as much I 
                        missed you. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I missed you too, Dad, I missed you 
                        so much. 

                                 CECIL
                        When you were born I promised you 
                        that nuthin’ was gonna ever tear us 
                        apart...

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Cecil walks down the street, there is still rubble from the 
           ‘68 riots, most of the buildings are run down and boarded up, 
           a DRUG DEALER on the corner, a PROSTITUTE on another.

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...and now it was time to keep my 
                        promise. 
           EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN EMBASSY - DAY

           Hundreds of protestors are outside the South African Embassy 
           with signs ‘Freedom in South Africa’ and ‘End Apartheid’.  
           Louis is at the front of the crowd standing next to Amy 
           Carter, who is now 18. Louis talks to a REPORTER. 

                                 LOUIS 
                        Twenty-five years ago we marched in 
                        this country for our rights, today 
                        we march to free the people of 
                        South Africa! 

           The crowd cheers around him. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Were you surprised by President 
                        Reagan’s veto?

                                 LOUIS
                        Ronald Reagan has attacked or 
                        dismantled every civil rights 
                        program that has ever been put in 
                        to place. Aiding the oppression of 
                        black South Africans is consistent 
                        with his policies on race issu--.  

           Louis stops talking as he sees Cecil watching him from across 
           the street. Louis is stunned. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Please excuse me for a minute. 

           The Reporter moves on to Amy Carter. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Amy, does your father, former 
                        President Carter approve of what 
                        you are doing here?

           Louis walks up to Cecil. The two of them stare at each other 
           for a long beat. It’s been so many years.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Hi, Dad. 

                                 CECIL
                        Hi, Louis. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What are you doing here?

                                 CECIL
                        I came here to protest with you. 
                                 LOUIS
                        But we’re gonna get arrested, 
                        you’ll lose your job. 

                                 CECIL
                        I resigned today. 

           Louis is shocked, can’t believe it. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Why?

           Cecil smiles. 

                                 CECIL
                        I want to join the Beloved 
                        Community. 

           Louis beams as he wraps his arms around his dad in a huge 
           hug. This time, he’s the one that doesn’t want to let go. 

           INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

           Cecil and Louis sit side by side in a holding cell crammed 
           with 20 other protestors. Cecil looks nervous. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Don’t worry, Dad, we’ll be out in a 
                        few hours. 

                                 CECIL
                        How many times have you been 
                        arrested?

                                 LOUIS
                        Sixty-three. 

           Cecil is stunned, had no idea. They sit for a moment. Then, 
           Cecil starts to sing: 

                                 CECIL
                        ‘We shall overcome. We shall 
                        overcome.

           Louis joins in with him - 

                                 CECIL AND LOUIS
                        ‘We shall overcome someday.’ 

           They continue singing into the next scene...
           EXT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY 

           Cecil and Gloria are twenty years older with full heads of 
           grey hair. Cecil helps Gloria gingerly walk down their block, 
           ‘BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT’ signs are on every lawn.

                                 CECIL AND LOUIS V.O.
                        ‘We are not afraid. We are not 
                        afraid...

           EXT. CECIL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           They continue their walk through the neighborhood, it has 
           been revitalized, lots of new buildings and stores, no more 
           rubble. ‘BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT’ signs in every window. 

                                 CECIL AND LOUIS V.O.
                        ‘...we are not afraid someday.’ 

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL - DAY

           They walk up a tree lined street to an elementary school with 
           a sign - ‘Polling Station #54. Vote here on November 4!’ They 
           stare at it for a long moment, then Gloria tears up. 

                                 GLORIA
                        My grandparents were born slaves,

                        and vote for a black man to be 
                        President of the United States. 

           She turns to Cecil with tears in her eyes.

                        my lifetime, and now I’m not only 
                        gonna see it, but I’m gonna be a 
                        part of it. 

           Cecil takes her hand. 

                                 CECIL
                        Ain’t it something, honey bear.

                        He’d have me send checks to people 
                        that sent him letters about how

           Cecil shrugs. Gloria thinks for a moment, then confesses:

                        you told me to stop. 

                                 LOUIS
                        For how long?

                                 GLORIA
                        Years. 

           Cecil stares at her, then smiles. 

                                 CECIL
                        I did too. 

                                 GLORIA
                        No!

                                 CECIL
                        He never knew it was from me.

           They both start to laugh as Cecil walks into the bathroom. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        I stopped after the fight, but I 
                        didn’t want to. How much would you 
                        send him?

           She doesn’t respond. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        How much did you send him?

           He walks back into the bedroom. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Honey bea--?
           He stops as he sees that Gloria is passed out in an unusual 
           position. Cecil immediately knows that something is wrong.  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Cecil is at a podium in front of a packed church next to a 
           casket. The audience is filled with a huge crowd, watching 
           Cecil eulogizes with a joy at his Gloria’s beautiful life. 

                                 CECIL
                        As a poor negro girl growing up in 
                        the deep south, never in her 
                        wildest dreams did my beautiful 
                        wife think she would lead marches 
                        and rallies in front of hundreds of 
                        black women. 

           The audience applauds. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        As a poor negro girl in the deep 
                        south, never in her wildest dreams 
                        did my beautiful wife dream that 
                        she would she see her son become a 
                        United States Congressman. 

           Louis smiles as the audience applauds the Congressman. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        And as a poor negro girl in the 
                        South, never in her wildest dreams 
                        would my beautiful wife think she’d 
                        see her husband arrested for 
                        protesting the Iraq War. Both of 
                        them!

           Wild applause. 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        The story of my Gloria, is the 
                        story of this country. She lived 
                        most of her life quiet in the 
                        shadows, afraid to lift her head. 
                        But when the truth became clear, 
                        she found the courage to speak her 
                        mind. Not just as a black woman, 
                        but as a proud American. She lived 
                        a wonderful life, and I am so proud 
                        to know her. My family’s only 
                        regret...
           EXT. GAINS HOUSE  - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Louis is in the basement of his father’s house. He looks at 
           all pictures on the walls of Cecil with all of the 
           presidents, but instead of the actors that played the 
           Presidents, it’s Cecil with the actual Presidents.  

                                 CECIL V.O.
                        ...is that she never got to vote 
                        for a black man, an African-
                        American, for President of the 
                        United States.

           Louis looks at a black and white photo of Cecil with Ike. A 
           picture of Cecil serving LBJ. A bronze bust of Robert Kennedy 
           sits next to JFK’s tie that Jackie gave him. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        But in my heart I’ll know that she 
                        will see his victory...

           A picture of Cecil, Booker and Carter smiling with Nixon is 
           next to a picture of Cecil and Nancy Reagan. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        ...she’ll be up in Heaven smiling 
                        down with all of our ancestors... 

           He looks at the book case that is filled with dozens of book 
           on African-American history. He pulls a book off the shelf 
           and starts to thumb through the pictures. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        ...so proud of how far America has 
                        come. 

           He stops at - a picture of the smiling Emmet Till. All these 
           years later, the image is still very painful for him. 

                                 CECIL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        Louis! Get up here!

           Louis hurries up the steps. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The living room is packed with people - Cecil, Louis, Sarah, 
           Booker, Carter, Howard, Gina and her new husband. Lots of 
           kids and grandchildren. All eyes are glued on the TV: 
                                 CNN ANCHOR
                        We can officially announce that 
                        Barack Obama will be the 44th 
                        President of the United State. 

           The room screams in joy, hugs and tears. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FULL SCREEN - ARCHIVAL NEWS FOOTAGE: 

           The real footage of President Barack Obama, his wife 
           Michelle, and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, standing on 
           stage in Grant Park waving to the crowd of thousands. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone in the Gains house watches the TV in awe as 
           President Barack Obama and his family wave to the crowd.

           There are no tears, no cheers, no noise, just silence, 
           stunned silence as they stare at the new First Family. Louis 
           and Cecil both turn to each other, they can’t believe it. 

           FROM THE TV - BARACK OBAMA BEGINS HIS SPEECH:

                                 BARACK OBAMA
                        “If there is anyone out there who 
                        still doubts that America is a 
                        place where all things are 
                        possible; who still wonders if the 
                        dream of our founders is alive in 
                        our time; who still questions the 
                        power of our democracy, tonight is 
                        your answer.”

           Cecil puts his arm around Louis, holds his son. 

           INT. GAINS HOUSE - DAY

           90 year old Cecil wears the suit that he has been preparing 
           the whole film as he ties a tie on Louis. 

                                 CECIL
                        So let me ask you a question, 
                        Congressman. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Yes, sir?
                                 CECIL
                        Why did you have to make your dad 
                        worry about you so much all those 
                        years? 

           Louis thinks about it, then: 

                                 LOUIS
                        So one day he could meet the man 
                        we’re about to meet. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Cecil and Louis sit in the Entrance Hall of the White House. 
           Cecil looks around - the paintings, the sculptures, the 
           clocks - it truly is American splendor. 

           Through a door, he sees the HEAD BUTLER, black, teaching a 
           new young butler. All of the china, flatware and stem ware 
           are lined up exactly how they were when Freddie taught Cecil. 

           Cecil can’t help but notice that both butlers are black. A 
           maid walks by, she is Mexican. Two housemen carry an antique 
           wooden bench down the hall. They are both black. 

           Cecil’s eyes drop ever so slightly. Then, the new Chief 
           Usher, ADMIRAL STEPHEN ROCHON, black, walks up to them. 

                                 ADMIRAL ROCHON
                        Mr. Gains, Congressman Gains, I’m 
                        Admiral Rochon, the Chief Usher. 

           Cecil looks surprised that he’s African-American. 

                                 CECIL
                        It’s nice to meet you, Admiral. Did 
                        you sign on with President Obama?

                                 ADMIRAL ROCHON
                        No, I started with President Bush. 
                        The last one. 

                                 CECIL
                             (Smiles)
                        Well that’s just fine. 

                                 ADMIRAL ROCHON
                        I just wanted to tell you what an 
                        honor it is to meet you both. 

                                 LOUIS
                        The honor is ours, Admiral. 
           Admiral Rochon gestures toward the State Dining Room.

                                 ADMIRAL ROCHON
                        President Obama is ready for you. 

           They look at each other as they get up and walk down the hall 
           toward the State Dining Room passing all the Presidential 
           portraits - LBJ, NIXON, IKE, CARTER, REAGAN AND JFK.

           The Secret Service opens the door as they see the back of 
           PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. He is looking up at the great 
           painting of Abraham Lincoln that hangs above the mantel.

           A smile forms on Cecil’s face as the butler and his son walk 
           toward the first black President of the United States. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
