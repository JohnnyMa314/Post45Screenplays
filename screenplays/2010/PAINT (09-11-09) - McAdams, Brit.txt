                   EXT.  CARL  NARGLE'S  GARDEN  - DAY 

                   Carl  Nargle,  mid  40's  and  white  with  a  large  pale  Afro,  a 
                   pipe,  and  a  passion  for  denim,  strolls  through  a 
                   dreamlike  garden  at  the  base  of  Mt.  Mansfield.  He  stops 
                   to  talk  to  a  bush  in  Vermont's  most  recognizable  whisper. 

                                         CARL 
           And  who  is  this?  Well,  it's  our 
           good  friend  Marcy,  a  lush  juniper 
           bush  chock-full  of  ripe  indigo 
           berries.  Are  you  going  to  share 
           today,  Miss  Marcy? 

                   A  berry  drops  to  the  ground.

                        And  maybe,  since  winter  is  right 
                                 around  the  corner,  Miss  Marcy  will 
                        give  him  an  extra  berry  to  take 
                        home  to  Mrs.  Brownshoes. 

                   Marcy  drops  a  berry  into  Mr.  Brownshoes'  mouth.  Mr. 
                   Brownshoes  tucks  it  into  his  cheek  and  smiles.

                   Carl  winces  like  a  boxer  taking  a  body  blow  as  she 
                   searches  for  a  piece  of  paper.

                             springtime  bud  our  silver  bush 
                             radiates  virility.  Not  that  old

                             life.  Many  silver  bushes  hide 
                             giant  stumps  capable  of  growing 
                             into  mighty  oaks  without  the  help 
                             of  a  magic  pill  to  help  make  the 
                             wood  harder.  Besides,  our  bush  is 
                             mostly  brown  anyway  with  a 
                             testosterone-packed  man  flower

                             fuchsia  bush  but  that's  what  makes 
                             this  bush  so  special  and  so 
                             masculine.

                        but  I'm  pretty  good  at  it. 

                   They  stop  and  look  at  the  TV.  After  a  beat,  they  head

                   Stephan  mumbles  in  front  of  the  easel. 

                                          STEPHAN 
           Because,  I  guess  I  like  flowers 
                        and  because  I  like  to  paint. 

                   Carl  walks  away  in  shock.  Tony,  Jenna,  Beverly  and 
                   Katherine  follow.  He  drops  his  pipe  before  Jenna  can  take 
                   it.  Beverly  tries  to  drape  his  jacket  over  his  shoulders 
                   but  it also  falls  to  the  floor. 

                   INT.  TONY'S  OFFICE  - MOMENTS  LATER 

                   Tony  sits  at  his  desk.  Carl  looks  out  the  window.  An 
                   anxious  Jenna  pulls  the  door  almost  shut  and  leaves.

           I  have  no  doubt  that  a  little 
           friendly  competition  will  bring 
           out  the  best  in  you. 

                   Carl  doesn't  say  a  word.

           Obviously,  there  is  no  competition 
                            between  you  and  Stephan.  What  I  am 
           saying  is  that  the  young  bull  is 
           always  happy  to  learn  from  the  old 
                            bull.  Though,  inevitably  the  young 
                            bull  ultimately  attacks  and  kills 
                            the  old  bull.  Not  that  you're  an 
                            old  bull  but ..•  this  is  not 
                            helping.  I  respect  you  almost  as 
                            much  as  I  love  you.  You  say  the 
                            word  and  I  will  fire  him  right 
           now.

                             Carl  was  next  to  me  in  line.  I 
                             stepped  up  to  the  teller.  I  was  so 
                             excited  to  get  checks  with  my  name 
                             on  them.  He  slid  up  behind  me  and 
                             whispered ••.

                        It was  love  at  first  sight.  I 
           never  opened  the  checking  account. 
           Dropped  out  of  junior  college  two 
           weeks  later  and  started  working 
           here.  This  is  horrible  to  say  but 
           the  truth  is,  if  I  could  ever  feel 
           the  way  I  felt  that  day  even  just
                        for  a  minute,  I'd  do  it  again.

                        I'm  not  good  at  talking  about 
           myself.

           What  do  you  want  to  talk  about? 

                   Stephan  finally  looks  her  in  the  eye.

                        Carl.  How  he  gained  his  mystique. 
           Became  who  he  is.

                        I'm  trying  to  talk  deeper.

                        That's  not  what ..•  When  Carl 
                        paints  he  speaks  from  the  heart. 

                                          STEPHAN 
           What  about  when  he's  not  painting? 

                                          KATHERINE 
                        That's  the  hardest  part.  Being 
                        able  to  separate  the  art  from  the 
                        artist.  If  you  find  beauty  in  the 
                        art  you  can't  but  help  find  beauty 
                        in  the  artist. 

                                          STEPHAN 

                        But  Carl  is  beautiful.

                        The  bigger  the  artist  becomes  the 
                                 less  he  is  like  his  art.  It's  hard 
                        to  have  them  both  be  beautiful. 
                        Carl  doesn't  know  who  he  is 
                                 anymore.

                  Jenna  opens  the  door.  Carl  steps  in  and  inhales  deeply. 
                  After  a  beat,  he  examines  the  painting  over  the  mantle.

                  Jenna  is  too  overwhelmed  to  speak.  Carl  goes  back  outside

                  Carl  re-enters  carrying  a  painting  shrouded  in  plastic. 
                  Jenna  hurries  to  take  down  the  picture  above  the  mantle 
                  but  she's  too  nervous.

                        .2  in  the  14-24  age  group.  I've 
           never  checked  that  demo  before. 
                            Never  had  to.

           So  we  agree  that  you  will  fire 
                            him?

                            watching  Stephan.  This  is  big  news 
           for  us.  These  are  the  types  of 
           ratings  that  can  turn  this  place
           around!

                   rests  it  against  the  wall  and  stays  to  watch  Stephan.

                                 Today's  painting  is  inspired  by 
                                 you  and  by  a  special  person  who 
                                 told  me  she  believes  in  me  and 
                                 even  bought  me  a  meal.  As  my  way 
                                 of  saying  thank  you  I'm  going  to 
                                 paint  her  a  love  train. 

                   Carl  sees  Katherine  blush.  Jenna  takes  Carl's  pipe  while 
                   watching  Stephan.  Beverly,  instead  of  draping  Carl's 
                   jacket  over  his  shoulders,  hands  it to  him  along  with  an 
                   empty  teacup.  She  can't  take  her  eyes  off  of  Stephan. 
                   Neither  can  Katherine  or  Wendy.  Carl  can't  believe  it.

                                 sexy  and  had  an  exotic  name?  Would 
                                 you  watch  then?  Well,  one  thing's

                   snowy  village  in  a  1995  episode  of  Paint:  with  Carl 
                   Nargle.

                        July  27,  1995.  I  had  a  problem 
           with  the  perspective  on  the 
                        steeple  in  the  foreground. 

                   Katherine  checks  the  date  on  the  tape.

                   mountainscape  on  the  shelf  and  smiles  fondly.  He  removes 
                   the  plastic  and  sees  that  it  is  labeled,  "December  18, 
                   1998."  He  admires  it  and  then  looks  at  the  canvas  behind 
                   it.  It's  remarkably  similar.  He  flips  through  his 
                   paintings  faster  and  faster.  They  are  all  the  same.  They 
                   become  a  blur  of  dates  and  mountainscapes.  Carl  collapses 
                   on  the  floor.

                   in  his  living  room.  She  finally  works  up  the  courage  to 
                   shut  off  the  engine  and  get  out  of  the  car.

                   Jenna  goes  to  the  front  door  and  starts  putting  on  her 
                   hat.  Carl  gives  chase.

                        In  1994  Bradford  Lenihan  said  The 
           Burlington  Museum  of  Art  was 
           lacking  a  good  painting  of 
           Vermont's  tallest  peak--Mount 
           Mansfield.

           Don't  tell  me.  Bradford  Lenihan 
           didn't  like  how  you  painted  it.

                                          STEPHAN 
           Wow.  You  saw  that  coffee  and  you 
                        took  it.  I've  been  pushing 
                        Katherine  to  go  after  what  she 
           wants .•• 

                   Stephan  puts  his  arm  around  Katherine.  She  can't  look  at 
                   Carl.

                        We  should  go.

                   Katherine,  trying  to  save  Carl  some  embarrassment,  slowly 
                   pulls  away.

                   Carl  drives  his  van  through  a  freezing  Vermont  morning.  A
                   snowplow  is  mounted  to  the  front.  Fresh  snowbanks  line 
                   the  streets.

                   Carl's  van  blasts  snow  out  of  a  driveway.  Mary  (the 
                   little woman  from  church)  comes  out  of  her  house.  She 
                   leans  into  his  window  and  hands  him  a  steaming  mug.

                        to  Disney  World.  Captain  Ken 
                        invited  us  to  the  cockpit.  There 
           were  72  gages  and  switches  above 
                        the  captain's  yoke.  Each  one  of 
                        them  is  etched  in  my  mind.  But  the 
           most  amazing  thing  was  how  the 
                        setting  sun  reflected  off  the  fuel 
                        gauge  onto  the  captain's  left 
                        thumbnail.  I'm  going  to  paint  that 
                        for  you  right  now.

                             Hey ••• 


                   Beverly  looks  at  the  boxes.

                             What's  this  for?

                             I  was  going  to  throw  them  out  but 
                             the  station  bought  them  so  I  just 
                             figured  I  should  give  them  back. 

                                          BEVERLY 

                             OK •••

                             So,  I'll be  seeing  you •.. 

                   Carl  tUrns  to  leave  and  then  stops. 

                                          CARL  (CONT'D) 
                             You  know  I'm  alone,  Beverly .

           I  heard  that. 


                                         CARL 
           So,  I'm  free  at  night  or  during 
           the  day. 

                                         BEVERLY 

           That's  good  to  know. 


                   Carl  waits  for  her  to  make  a  move.  It  is  awkward. 

                                         CARL 
           Sorry  I  wasn't  better  to  you  and 
           Jenna  and  wendy  and  Katherine. 
           Goodbye. 

                   Carl  walks  back  to  his  van. 

                                          BEVERLY 
           Don't  you  mean,  thanks  for  going 
           to  a  special  place  with  me,  Carl 
           Nargle? 

                                          CARL 

                        Sure. 


                   EXT.  BURLINGTON  CITY  STREET  - CONTINUOUS 

                   Carl  pulls  to  a  stop  at  a  light. 

                   INT.  CARL'S  VAN  - CONTINUOUS 

                   The  snow  accumulates  on  a  street  sign.  Carl's  eye  is 
                   drawn  to  the  building  behind  it.  It  is  The  Burlington 
                   Museum  of  Art. 

                   EXT.  BURLINGTON  CITY  STREET  - CONTINUOUS 

                   Carl  parks  his  van  and  gets  out.  He  looks  at  himself  in 
                   the  side  mirror  and  straightens  his  shirt  and  rounds  his 
                   Afro.  Carl  takes  a  deep  breath  and  walks  toward  the 
                   museum. 

                   INT.  BURLINGTON  MUSEUM  - MOMENTS  LATER 

                   Carl  can't  help  but  admire  works  of  impressionists, 
                   cubists  and  American  folk  artists  as  he  makes  his  way 
                   through  the  gallery.  Carl  knocks  on  the  Curator's  open 
                   office  door.  Bradford  Lenihan,  former  Today  in  Burlington 
                   panelist,  looks  up  from  his  desk.

           Yes.  Mr.  Carl  Nargle.  To  what  do  I 
           owe  the  honor  of  a  visit  from  a 
           living  Vermont  state  treasure? 

                                         CARL 
                            Wow.  That  is  certainly  a  nice 
           thing  to  hear.  I  always  hoped  you 
           watched  the  show  or  knew  of  it. 
                            Well,  I  don't  know  if  you  know 
           but,  well,  I've  retired. 

                                         BRADFORD  LENIHAN 
                            Would  you  like  me  to  make  an 
           announcement  to  our  visitors? 

                   Carl  isn't  sure  if  Bradford  is  giving  him  a  hard  time. 

                                         CARL 
                            No •••  I  a,  I  have  5,247  paintings 
                            that  need  a  home.  I  would  be 
           incredibly  honored  if  The 
                            Burlington  Museum  of  Art  would 
           accept  them.  There  are  a  lot  of 
                            paintings  of  Mount  Mansfield  if 
                            that's  something  you're  looking 
           for.  They  are  my  entire  body  of 
                            work  and  they  are  obviously 
                            precious  to  me. 

                   Bradford  Lenihan  stares  at  Carl.

                            work  of  a  master.  Someone 
                            appreciated  for  skill  and 
                            originality.  For  impacting  the 
                            world  of  art.  We  even  take  the  art 
                            of  someone  who  is  merely  competent 
                            but  offers  something  unique  to

           You  should  be.  I  have  watched  your 
           program  over  the  years.  Mountain 
           ponds  and  juniper  bushes  and  happy 
           little  things  painted,  and  I  use 
           that  word  liberally,  in  an  hour's 
           time.  It's  the  fast  food  of  art. 
           We  do  not  waste  our  time  on  Happy 
           Meals  at  Burlington,  Mr.  Nargle. 
           But,  do  you  know  what  hallowed 
           halls  might  display  your  type  of 
           art? 

                   Carl  shakes  his  head,  "No."

                            A  Motel  Six  or  perhaps,  if  you're 
           lucky,  A  Red  Roof  Inn--a  bit  more 
           upscale.  You  have  single-handedly 
           set  back  Vermont  art  decades.  You 
           could  not  pay  me  enough  money  to 
           display  a  Carl  Nargle  in  The 
           Burlington  Museum  of  Art. 

                   Carl  drops  his  head.

                   the  fresh  inch  of  snow  from  the  driver's  side  window  and 
                   looks  at  his  reflection.  He  hates  what  he  sees. 

                   INT.  CARL'S  BEDROOOM  - NIGHT

                   behind  him.  Night  turns  to  day.  Bob  Seger's  "Against  the 
                  Wind"  plays  and  continues  through  the  plowing  sequence.

                  A  impatient  Man  waits  in  his  car  for  Carl  to  finish 
                  plowing  his  driveway.  Carl  clears  out  a  path.  The  annoyed 
                  Man  drives  away  without  acknowledging  Carl. 

                  EXT.  RURAL  DRIVEWAY  - LATER 

                  Carl's  van  is  stuck  in  a  snow  bank.  He  struggles  to  free 
                  the  blade.  He  is  alone.  He  gets  it  unstuck  and  goes  back 
                  to  plowing. 

                  EXT.  HIGHWAY  - LATER 

                  Carl  lies  on  his  back  reattaching  the  chain  to  his  left 
                  rear  tire.  An  la-wheeler  thunders  past  and  covers  him  in 
                  snow. 

                  EXT.  HOUSE  - AFTERNOON 

                  A  Woman  talks  to  Carl  through  the  screen  door.

                  She  opens  the  screen  door  just  enough  to  hand  Carl  money.

                  spots  Stephan's  Prius  idling  in  the  driveway.  He  stops 
                  and  stares  at  the  license  plate  that  reads,  "PAINTER." 
                  Carl  is  frozen.  He  puts  the  van  in  reverse.

                   floors  it and  slams  into  the  snowbank.  Against  the  Wind 
                   swells.  Carl  plows  the  bank  right  into  the  rear  of 
                   Stephan's  car.  Carl  backs  up  again,  quickly  shifts  into 
                   drive  and  goes  right  across  Stephan's  yard,  taking  a 
                   giant  pile  of  snow  and  Stephan's  mailbox  with  him.  He 
                   pushes  a  wall  of  snow  up  against  Stephan's  door.  Carl 
                   backs  up  quickly.

                   the  Santa  and  Reindeer  set  on  the  yard.  The  telephone 
                  pole  falls  over  as  Carl  knocks  Santa  through  stephan's 
                   rear  passenger  window  and  slams  snow  up  and  over

                  Snow  and  the  garage  blockade  Stephan's  Prius  from  all 
                  four  directions.  Santa  sticks  out  of  his  side  window.  The 
                  telephone  pole  lies  across  the  yard.  Carl  speeds  off  and 
                  disappears  around  the  corner.  Stephan  steps  out  of  his 
                  house  and  stops  dead  in  his  tracks  as  he  surveys  the 
                  destruction.  His  phone  rings.  He  realizes  the  sound  is 
                  coming  from  inside  his  car.  He  rushes  to  his  car  but  he 
                  can't  get  anywhere  close  to  opening  any  of  his  doors.  He 
                  climbs  up  on  the  front  bumper,  looks  in  and  sees  his 
                  cellphone  on  the  front  seat.

                                          BARTENDER 

                                 You  want  another? 


                   Carl  nods,  "Yes."

                   Carl's  head  jerks  up  toward  the  TV.  He  feels  guilty.  A 
                   Celtics  Fan  approaches  the  bartender.

                             Can  we  switch  to  Sportscenter? 

                   The  Bartender  looks  over  at  Carl  as  he  unscrews  the  cap 
                   on  Carl's  wine. 

                                          CARL 
                             Sure.  (To  the  Bartender)  Time  to 
                             stop  watching  it,  huh? 

                                          CELTICS  FAN 

                             Fuck  yeah. 


                   Carl'S  phone  rings.  He  looks  at  it  like  he  has  never  used 
                   a  cellphone.  The  Bartender  takes  it,  pushes  the  answer 
                   button  and  hands  it to  Carl. 

                                          BARTENDER

                            tell,  a  recollection,  a  love  lost. 
                            Maybe  the  view  of  her  and  this 
                            mountain  is  the  only  place  in  his 
                            life  that  ever  made  sense.  A  time 
                            that  is  lost.  A  time  that  will 
                            never  be  again.  But  a  time  that 
                            will  never  be  forgotten. 

                  We  reveal  that  Carl  has  painted  a  stunning  portrait  of 
                  Katherine  on  a  porch  with  Mount  Mansfield  behind  her.

                  Carl  puts  the  finishing  touches  on  his  mountain 
                  masterpiece  as  Stephan  rushes  in.  The  portrait  of 
                  Katherine  stops  him  in  his  tracks.

                            Isn't  she  beautiful?  The  girl's 
                            not  bad  either. 

                  Katherine  stands  in  front  of  Stephan  with  tears  in  her 
                  eyes.  Carl  anxiously  watches  the  two.

                            Well,  look  who's  here.  It's 
                            Stephan,  the  host  of  Paint.  I  know 
                            he  has  something  exciting  to  share 
                            with  you  in  the  hour  and  a  half  we 
                            have  left.  Maybe  something  that 
                            will  challenge  you  to  become  a 
                            better  artist  the  way  he 
                            challenged  me  to  be  a  better 
                            artist.  I  guess  that  leaves  me 
                            with  one  last  thing  to  say  and 
                            that's,  thanks  for  going  to  a 
                            special  place  with  me,  Carl 
                            Nargle. 

                  Carl  signs  his  name  on  the  painting.  He  can't  help  but 
                  admire  it before  taking  it off  the  easel  and  walking  out 
                  the  back  door.  No  one  says  a  word.  After  a  beat,  Stephan 
                  takes  his  place  on  stage.

                        I'll be  brief.  I  am  looking  for 
                        representations  of  his  work.  I 
                        recently  spoke  with  him  about 
                        showing  at  Burlington.

           with  his  passing  his  work  would 
                        have  become  quite  valuable. 
           Especially  if  there  were  only  a 
                        few  left.  The  Burlington  Museum  of 
           art  cannot  be  a  complete 
           representation  of  Vermont  beaux­
           arts  without  at  least  one  Nargle.

           certain  there  are  five  Nargles  in

           than  seven  or  eight  total.

                   paintings.  He  looks  up  at  mighty  Mount  Mansfield  and 
                   smiles.  Sydney  steps  out.

                             Do  you  know  what  that's  worth?

                   Reuben  hangs  the  painting  up  next  to  the  hairstyle  chart 
                   and  admires  it  like  a  proud  father.  Sydney  puts  his  arm 
                   around  Reuben.
