           THE ENTIRE FILM TAKES PLACE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF ONE APARTMENT.  

                         THE CAMERA NEVER LEAVES THE APARTMENT.

                         ALL PHONE CONVERSATIONS ARE ONE SIDED.
           OVER BLACK -- The sound of SIX GRUFF YAKUZA MEATHEADS talking 
           in BROKEN ENGLISH mixed with JAPANESE.  It’s a testosterone 
           fueled locker room atmosphere.  Menace permeates the air.

                        Get Her!

           Cackles and hoots abound.

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A WOMAN (EVERLY) 30, limps into a white tiled bathroom.  It 
           gives off a travel worn motel room vibe.  She looks shell 
           shocked.  

           Everly leans against the bathroom door, shutting it.  She 
           fumbles for the lock without looking.  Her heart pounding out 
           of her chest.  Adrenaline the only thing keeping her going.  

           The Yakuza Meatheads yammer in the other room, their words 
           indistinct.  Everly turns to a tiny hamper by the door.  As 
           she sifts through it, we see the arch of her spine -- Her 
           vulnerability truly exposed.  She pulls on a dirty, tight, 
           SPAGHETTI STRINGED NIGHT SHIRT.  

           Everly looks in the mirror as she holds onto the sink below 
           it.  The muscles in her arms tensing as she forces herself to 
           meet her gaze.  The Yakuzas make a ruckus while horsing 
           around, it snaps Everly out of it.  

           She goes and turns on the shower.  A stream whistles down 
           creating WHITE NOISE.  The STEAM rising from the water lets 
           us in on how cold our surroundings are.

           Someone tries to open the bathroom door.

                                 SUMO PALOOKA (O.C.)
                        Hey -- Open the door.

                                 EVERLY
                               (calls out)
                        A second...

                                 SUMO PALOOKA (O.C.)
                        Gotta piss.
           The Yakuza Meatheads CHORTLE in the BG.  Everly nervously 
           fumbles to the water tank of the toilet.  She lifts the lid 
           and removes a GALLON SIZED ZIPLOCK BAG.  Inside is a TINY 
           BALLOON OF BROWN POWDER, a cheap CELL PHONE and a GUN.

           Everly takes out the gun and slides down to the floor between 
           the shower and the toilet.  She looks at the balloon of 
           heroin,  but her gaze comes back to the cell phone.  This is 
           not her heart’s first desire... Still, she dials a number and 
           waits for someone to pick up -- it’s agonizing.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into phone)
                        It’s Everly -- Please don’t hang 
                        up.  
                               (beat)
                        ...Mom?

           They hung up.  Everly’s heart sinks.  Now BANGING on the 
           door.

                                 SUMO PALOOKA (O.C.)
                        Quit fucking around.   

                                 OTHER YAKUZA (O.C.)
                               (heavy Japanese accent)
                        Time for round two.

           More BANGING.  Everly looks at the door, resigned to her 
           fate.

                                 THIRD YAKUZA (O.C.)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Break it down.  Who gives a shit?  

           The Meatheads cheer in the BG as the door JARS violently.

                                 EVERLY
                        Coming.

           Everly gets up and opens the door.  In front of her stands a 
           three hundred fifty pound, bald SUMO PALOOKA with a FU MANCHU 
           and a FULL BODY MULTICOLORED TATTOO OF A WATERFALL.  He’s 
           wearing red satin boxers and black socks.

                                 SUMO PALOOKA
                        Finally.  My teeth were flo --

           BLAM! -- Everly brings up the gun and SHOOTS HIM IN THE FACE.  
           The Palooka flops to the ground, his blood spray hangs in the 
           steam in the air.
           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           All the MEN look on stunned.  They’re a surly group of YAKUZA 
           MEATHEADS -- grizzled, with intricate FULL BODY TATTOOS.  All 
           the men (save one) are in various stages of undress, having 
           previously taken their turn with Everly.  

           There’s a messed up BED in the room, a VIDEO CAMERA ON A 
           TRIPOD is positioned over it.  

                                                                    CUT TO:

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! -- Everly unloads the gun at the Meatheads, 
           as she walks out of the wafting steam emanating from the 
           bathroom.

           What ensues is a gritty, execution style gun battle that’s as 
           sloppy as it is quick.  The element of surprise and the 
           Meatheads’ unpreparedness in undress definitely favors 
           Everly.  

           One of the Yakuzas TWIRLS AROUND as he’s shot and starts 
           unloading his AUTOMATIC MACHINE HANDGUN across the 
           kitchenette wall behind him; accidently RIDDLING another 
           Meathead Brother as he’s going for his gun.  

           Everly isn’t the greatest shot.  Through the mayhem she 
           misses or will hit a Meathead, but not kill him, causing her 
           to have to fire more than once per target.  

           The FULLY CLOTHED MAN puts up his hands in reproach.  

                                 FULLY CLOTHED MAN
                        Wait --

           Everly BLASTS HIM in the gut.  He staggers back, plopping 
           down on the couch -- DEAD.  

           A Mortally Wounded Meathead manages to SHOOT EVERLY.  The 
           shot PIERCES CLEAN THROUGH her side, above her waist.  She 
           steadies herself and re-aims at him --  

           Click. 

           -- Everly’s gun is EMPTY.  

           The Mortally Wounded Meathead now raises his gun.  His hatred 
           willing him to survive long enough to pull the trigger.  He’s 
           got Everly dead to rights.  but -- too late.  His head falls 
           at a sickening angle.  He’s gone. 

           Everly -- The last woman standing.  She holds the wound above 
           her waist.  Her blood soaking through her clothes, painting 
           her right side down the thigh to the ankle and foot.  
           Despite this, or maybe because of the sharpness of the pain, 
           she’s able to breathe normally for the first time.  

           Everly lowers the gun, letting it fall out of her hand to the 
           ground.  What the fuck did she just do?

           BUMP-BUMP! -- Everly looks up.  

           There’s a THUMPING coming from the ceiling, as if someone is 
           banging on the apartment floor above.  

                                 OLD CRONE (O.C.)
                               (muffled; barely legible)
                        QUIT THE RACKET!

           Everly flashes up an “Are you fucking kidding me?” look.

                                                        CUT TO TITLE CARD:

           White on black.  A simple statement --

                                            EVERLY

                                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Everly falls to her knees.  She hunches over, bracing 
           herself, as blood from her wound drips through her fingers.  

           HER EXIT WOUND BLOOD SPLATTER RUNS DOWN THE WALL behind her.  
           [THE LENGTH OF ITS TENDRILS A MOTIF FOR US TO MARK THE 
           PASSAGE OF TIME THROUGHOUT THE FILM.]  

           Everly scans her surroundings.  The Yakuza Meatheads are 
           strewn about like rag dolls, felled at impossible angles.  
           She crawls over to the nearest Meathead.  His dead face looks 
           up at her -- his eyes lifeless and judgemental.  Everly meets 
           his spectral glare as she pries the REVOLVER from his cold 
           dead hand.

           She falls back on her good side towards the bathroom and 
           kicks her feet, while pushing back on her butt.  It’s a 
           struggle.  

           As she’s pulling herself through the bathroom archway, 
           someone KNOCKS on the APARTMENT DOOR.  Everly levels the 
           revolver at it.

                                 YOUNG LATINA (O.C.)
                        Everything okay in there?

                                 EVERLY
                        Um... Peachy.
                                 YOUNG LATINA (O.C.)
                        You sure?

           The door slowly starts to open and an innocent looking YOUNG 
           LATINA PROSTITUTE (19) pretty, sticks her head in.  Her eyes 
           dart around the carnage in the room --

                                 YOUNG LATINA (CONT’D)
                               (more to herself)
                        Ah la chingada.

           -- before landing on Everly, who’s pointing the revolver at 
           her.  Their eyes meet.  The Young Latina wants no part of 
           this maelstrom.

                                 YOUNG LATINA (CONT’D)
                               (quick; to Everly)
                        Okay then, bye.

           And with that the Young Latina shuts the door.  Everly lowers 
           the gun once she hears her hustle down the hall into her 
           apartment.  She then resumes her arduous journey into the 
           bathroom.  

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Everly looks up at the heroin balloon right next to her cell 
           phone, resting on the toilet tank.  She reaches up, but we’re 
           not sure for which one.  Her bloody right hand is tainting 
           everything it touches.  She can’t seem to muster up the 
           strength to reach.  It’s almost like she’s given up. 

           Resigned, Everly falls back, her head hitting the ground.  
           Her eyes remaining focused on the heroin balloon and or the 
           phone.  Her indecision a decision, as she listlessly drowns 
           in the white noise of the shower and drifts through the steam 
           it creates. 

           BRRRRIIIING! -- The sound of a CELL PHONE from the other room 
           PIERCES THROUGH the peaceful white noise of the shower.  It 
           startles Everly from her gaze.  She looks at the open 
           bathroom door as the steam breathes out it into the 
           apartment. 

           Unable to ignore its ringing, Everly winces as she turns over 
           and crawls out of the bathroom on her belly.  With each ring 
           the cell gets progressively louder and more obtrusive. 

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Everly pulls herself up using the archway to the bathroom.  
           We see her BLOOD SPLATTER WOUND ON THE WALL has dripped down 
           a bit more.  She leaves her HANDPRINT in it as she pushes off 
           to the center of the room, trying to locate the ringing.
           It stops abruptly.  

           A beat as Everly lets out a frustrated breath.  Then in 
           unison, MULTIPLE CELL PHONES RING.  It’s startling and spooky 
           as shit.   

           Everly scrambles to a Dead Yakuza Meathead and grabs the cell 
           out of his pocket.  The screen reads TAIKO.  She throws it 
           down, SMASHING it.  She goes over to the fully clothed DEAD 
           MAN on the couch and grabs his ringing cell.  It also reads 
           TAIKO.  She throws it against the wall; the ring dies in a 
           whining splutter.

           Still vexed by the ringing that won’t abate, she picks up 
           another Yakuza’s phone.  She looks at the cell a long time, 
           the shrill ring dissecting her.  She answers it.  

           The moment she picks up, the remaining cells stop ringing.  
           Her jagged breath now the only soundtrack in the room.  A 
           beat goes by.

                                 TAIKO (O.S.)
                               (calm, cool, collected)
                        Everly.

           Everly freezes.  It’s as if Satan himself were on the other 
           end.  She can only bring herself to give an assenting murmur.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Are they all dead?

           A very long beat.  Taiko is not the kind of man to repeat 
           himself.  He knows he commands her full attention.

                                 EVERLY
                        Yes.

           Now a long beat from Taiko.  One can only imagine him 
           gathering himself, suppressing his rage on the other end --

                                 TAIKO
                        What am I going to do with you?

           Everly eyes the video camera on the tripod aimed at the bed.  
           She already knows the answer to that.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        You know I'm going to have to hurt 
                        you now.
                               (no response from Everly)
                        I mean really hurt you.  A line’s 
                        been crossed here.  What my men did 
                        -- That was nothing compared to 
                        what I’m gonna do to you now.
           Everly has to steady herself off that thought.  She eyes the 
           bed and the tripod again.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Did you get my present?  My men 
                        were going to leave it with you... 
                        after.  

           Paranoid, Everly glances around.  This is the first time we 
           really get a good look at our surroundings.  

           The apartment is a big ONE ROOM rectangular studio loft with 
           HARDWOOD FLOORS and PICTURE WINDOWS looking out over a quiet 
           industrial street.  Below the windows is the COUCH with the 
           Dead Man on it.  A KING SIZED BED is the centerpiece of the 
           room.  A small FIBER-OPTIC CHRISTMAS TREE gleams on a BAR 
           next to one of the walls.  A wall mounted LCD TV behind it.  
           There’s a KITCHENETTE off to the side next to the BATHROOM 
           DOOR.  It’s a tad run down (and bloody) but it gives off an 
           executive suite type vibe.  Some CHINTZY CHRISTMAS 
           DECORATIONS and tinsel seep out of the “hotel room” motif.

           Everly spots an EXPENSIVELY WRAPPED FESTIVE BOX WITH A BOW 
           sitting on one of the bar stools under the twinkling tree.  

                                 EVERLY
                        I see it.

                                 TAIKO
                        Open it.  I picked it out myself.

           Everly steps to the bar and places the cell down.  The fiber 
           optic tree lights create a myriad of colors on her face as 
           her hands tremble over the present.  

           Everly tugs on the ribbon strand, it comes apart easily.  She 
           looks down at the wrapping and slits her finger through the 
           tape of the top fold.  The paper easily unblossoms down.  The 
           sides of the box fall, revealing a MAN’S SEVERED HEAD.  His 
           eyes GORY HOLES.  A SPIKE RAMMED THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS SKULL.

           Everly SCREAMS in horror.  She frantically goes for the door 
           and opens it.  In the HALLWAY is a weather beaten, ex-sumo 
           Samoan DOORMAN in full uniform, inching towards her with a 
           raised SHOTGUN, a BLUETOOTH on his ear.  Their eyes meet.  

                                 DOORMAN
                               (into Bluetooth)
                        Got her.

           Before he can react, Everly SLAMS the door and chains it.  
           She steels herself and picks up the phone again, turning her 
           back to the severed head.
                                 TAIKO
                        Now having seen what I did to your 
                        DEA agent friend -- Who was just 
                        doing his job.  Nothing personal.  
                        Imagine what I'm going to do to 
                        you.
                               (beat)
                        221 Shaffer Ave.

                                 EVERLY
                               (meek; can’t believe it)
                        What?

                                 TAIKO
                               (amused)
                        My men are already there waiting 
                        for my call.

                                 EVERLY
                        Please.  You can do anything you 
                        want to me.  I’ll let you.

                                 TAIKO
                        I don’t need your permission.  You 
                        seem to have forgotten -- You’re my 
                        property.  Just like that building 
                        you’re in.  I own you.  

                                 EVERLY
                        It would have been my third strike.  
                        I didn’t go to them.  

                                 TAIKO
                        I know.

                                 EVERLY
                        I didn’t have a choice.

                                 TAIKO
                        There’s always a choice, Everly.  
                        You just made the wrong one. 

                                 EVERLY
                        Taiko --

                                 TAIKO
                        Don’t say my name with your whore 
                        mouth.

                                 EVERLY
                        Please.  I’ll do whatever you want.  
                        I’ll cut off my hands. 
                               (breaks her to say)
                        You can bring more men over.
                                 TAIKO
                        How old is she now?

                                 EVERLY
                        Don’t...

                                 TAIKO
                        Gotta be four.

                                 EVERLY
                        Please...

                                 TAIKO
                        What’s her name again?

           Long beat.  It shames Everly to even say it --

                                 EVERLY
                        Maisey.

                                 TAIKO
                        Maisey.  And your mother’s Edith, 
                        right?  She must be so proud.

                                 EVERLY
                        I stay away from them.  I haven’t 
                        seen my daughter in years.  She has 
                        a different life from this.  From 
                        me.  I wanted that for her.

                                 TAIKO
                        Evidently not badly enough.

                                 EVERLY
                        You cared for me once.  I know you 
                        did.  I’m begging -- 

                                 TAIKO
                        “Once” isn’t today.  Isn’t “Now”.  
                        Now I have to hurt you where you 
                        haven’t numbed yourself into 
                        oblivion yet.  Where it’s raw.

           And it is raw.  Very raw.  

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        I tell you what, I’ll make it quick 
                        on your mother.  She’s suffered 
                        enough having you for a daughter.  
                        And then having to raise her own 
                        granddaughter with no help.  She’s 
                        really the victim in this whole 
                        scenario.
                                 EVERLY
                               (rage building)
                        I swear to God if you --

                                 TAIKO
                               (amused)
                        You must realize you’re not getting 
                        out of that apartment alive.  

                                 EVERLY
                        We’ll see.

                                 TAIKO
                        Yes -- We will.  But I tell you 
                        what, since we did have so many 
                        “good times” together “once”, I'll 
                        let you live just long enough so 
                        you can introduce me to your 
                        daughter -- delicate little Maisey.  
                        I’m sure she’ll more than earn back 
                        what you’ve cost me.  

                                 EVERLY
                        FUCK YOU!

           Everly SLAMS down the phone in a rage.  The THUMPING on the 
           ceiling starts again.  We hear the OLD CRONE’S muffled 
           indignant castigation --  Everly shoots a look upwards as she 
           storms into the bathroom.

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Everly takes out her cell phone, hits redial and paces.

                                 EVERLY
                        Please pick up.  Please...
                               (someone finally does)
                        Mom!  Listen --

                                 EDITH
                        Everly, I don’t want to talk.  I 
                        can’t deal with your -- 

                                 EVERLY
                        No, listen!  You have to take 
                        Maisey and get out of the house 
                        right now.

                                 EDITH
                        What?
                                 EVERLY
                        There are men.  There.  They’re 
                        already there.  They’re coming for 
                        you.  They’re gonna take Maisey.

                                 EDITH
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom, you have to go.

                                 EDITH
                        I’ll do no such thing.

           Through the phone Everly hears a KNOCK on Edith’s front door.

                                 EVERLY
                        Don’t answer that!  Take Maisey and 
                        run!

                                 EDITH
                        Everly --

           BRACK! -- Everly hears the front door KICKED in and Edith 
           SCREAMING.  Then the sound of Edith running down a hall and 
           SLAMMING a door as the muffled voices of two Yakuza Goons 
           give chase.  

           The whole time we’re on Everly.  Each utterance, each noise 
           is like a knife being twisted in her gut.  As she helplessly 
           listens on, she crumples to the floor.

           Back to the cell, we hear the sound of a scared LITTLE GIRL 
           (MAISEY) CRY.  We hear Edith, terrified, BREAKING a window.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I’m right behind you, Honey.

           The sound of the bedroom door BUSTING open as the Yakuza 
           Goons CRASH in.  Edith SHRIEKS as we hear broken glass and an 
           ignominious fall to the ground.

                                 YAKUZA GOON #1
                               (in Japanese; unsubtitled)
                        Cut her off!

           Everly hears Edith and Maisey running to a CAR -- Edith 
           throwing Maisey in and SLAMMING her door.  We hear the Yakuza 
           Goons in pursuit.  Maisey is hysterical.

                                 EVERLY
                               (yells into phone)
                        Get out of there!
           SHOTS are fired.  We hear the sound of Edith’s rear window 
           EXPLODING.  Suddenly, the car ROARS OUT.  Everly hears a 
           Yakuza Goon’s swearing fade into the BG as GUNSHOTS ring out 
           in the distance.

                                 EDITH
                        Are you okay?  Maisey?  Are you 
                        okay?  

           Tears and fear well up in Everly’s face as she waits for a 
           response.  Then --

                                 MAISEY
                        I think so...

           Relief from Everly.  

                                 EDITH
                        Good girl.  Pick up the phone.  
                        Give it here.

           Everly hears Maisey hand the phone to Edith.  

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Everly?

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom, are you okay?

                                 EDITH
                        No!  What is this?

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           While she’s talking to Edith, Everly comes out into the 
           living room, heads to the KITCHENETTE and takes a dirty 
           BUTTER KNIFE from the sink.  She pushes away a DEAD YAKUZA 
           MEATHEAD, who leaves channels of blood in between the kitchen 
           tiles on the floor.  She pries away some of them REVEALING a 
           HIDEY-HOLE with a BLACK TRAVEL SUITCASE inside. 

           Everly drags up the suitcase, it’s heavy and awkward.

                                 EVERLY
                        I’m in trouble.  But that doesn’t 
                        matter.  I have to get you two 
                        safe.

           ON THE PHONE: The sound of POLICE SIRENS WAILING towards 
           Edith.

                                 EDITH
                        I see the police.  I’m gonna flag 
                        them down.
                                 EVERLY
                        No!  Mom.  This man.  He owns the 
                        police.  This man I'm in trouble 
                        with -- He’s untouchable.  
                        Nowhere’s safe.

           ON THE PHONE: The sound of POLICE SIRENS zooming past Edith 
           and heading off into the distance.

                                 EDITH
                        What have you done?

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom, there’s no time now.  Drive to 
                        the corner of 7th and Grand, 
                        downtown.  If I’m not there by  
                        forty-five past the hour --

                                 EDITH
                        What do you mean “if”?

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom, please...

           Everly unzips the suitcase, revealing EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
           DOLLARS in cash.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                               (into cell)
                        It’ll be okay.  I’ve got a plan.

           Everly hangs up as she looks down at the money, almost 
           transfixed by it and the freedom it represents.  PAN UP to 
           the bullet hole riddled wall behind her.  At the center is 
           one BIG BLISTERED BULLET HOLE.  An EYEBALL peers down at 
           Everly from it, spying on her.

                                                        CUT TO TITLE CARD:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           FROM THE OPPOSITE ANGLE AS BEFORE WE SEE -- 

           BLAM! -- Everly brings up the gun and SHOOTS THE SUMO PALOOKA 
           IN THE FACE.  
           NOW FROM THE YAKUZA MEATHEADS’ PURVIEW; we see Everly start 
           to unload on them.  One of the Meatheads twirls as he’s hit 
           and starts unloading his AUTOMATIC MACHINE HANDGUN across the 
           kitchenette wall -- BULLET HOLES BLISTERING THROUGH --  

           INT. ADJACENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           [EVERYTHING IS SEEN THROUGH A BULLET HOLE IN THE WALL -- AS 
           IF WE’RE WATCHING A STAGE PLAY UNFOLD.]

           A “JOHN” sits up into frame and look back at the wall.  He’s 
           lying down on a bed below the camera wall.

                                 JOHN
                        What was that?

           He looks down as an AFRO continues to bob up and down just 
           out of frame.  Without breaking stride, ZELDA, (mid 20’s) a 
           real firecracker, pushes him down.

           The camera TREMBLES from the force of the wall being riddled 
           with bullets, as muffled gunshots and Yakuza Meathead death 
           cries continue to ring out.  The John gets on his elbows and 
           looks back at the wall again.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, what is that?

           Zelda stops and looks up, annoyed.

                                 ZELDA
                        Bitch next door likes to watch the 
                        “Predator”.  Gets her wet.  Doesn’t 
                        understand yet what it means to 
                        earn for one’s self for a livin’.  
                        Now you want your dick sucked or 
                        not?  Don’t matter none to me if 
                        you butternut.  You’re paying by 
                        the minute not the ounce.

           Sex sells.  The John emphatically nods his head “yes”.  He 
           takes the TV remote laying beside him and turns up the TV 
           which is playing “Emmit Otter’s Jugband Christmas” to drown 
           out the mayhem next door.  Meanwhile, Zelda goes back to 
           bobbing out of frame.

           The crescendo of the gunfight causes our wall to JOLT 
           VIOLENTLY.  The John JUMPS out of bed.  Zelda hockey checks 
           him back onto it.  She stands and screams at the wall.

                                 ZELDA (CONT’D)
                        Bitch, you’re messing with my 
                        concentration.  You do not fuck 
                        with my rent!
                                 JOHN
                        Maybe I should...

                                 ZELDA
                        Shut the fuck up before I smack the 
                        shit out of you.  You’re getting 
                        your dick sucked.  Be happy.

                                 JOHN
                               (scared shitless)
                        I’m happy.  I’m very happy.

           Zelda cools her jets a bit, then goes back down and resumes.  
           The John looks fearfully back at the wall -- All nerves.

                                                        CUT TO TITLE CARD:

                        Thanks Santa, it’s the gift that 
                        keeps on giving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. ADJACENT APARTMENT - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Through the bullet hole in the wall we see -- Same view as 
           before.  Emmit Otter is still loving Christmas.  Zelda is 
           feverishly working the John just out of frame.  The John, 
           obviously in pain, writhes on the sheets.  

                                 JOHN
                        I just wanna go.  Please...

           Zelda stops and looks up, pissed.  Before she can say 
           anything her CELL PHONE RINGS.  She gets up, but not before 
           VICIOUSLY BITCH SLAPPING the John’s erection (out of frame of 
           course), sending him rolling off the bed and onto the floor.  
           Zelda looks at who’s calling, her demeanor changes to playful 
           Southern Belle.

                                 ZELDA
                               (into cell)
                        Hey Big Buddha.  Zelda been missing 
                        all your love -- every inch of it.
                               (looks towards wall)
                        Yeah, no shit.  That bitch has been 
                        fucking with my feng shui ever 
                        since you moved her in here, Taiko.  
                        Don’t know what you ever saw in 
                        that bottom bitch.
                               (beat; looks at wall with 
                                new eyes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        For real?  Bitch did what?  I 
                        thought she was watching “Die Hard” 
                        or some shit.

           Zelda goes to her CLOSET and takes out a SUITCASE full of 
           SAI’S and KNIVES.  Meanwhile the naked John crawls on the 
           ground grabbing his clothes. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT’D)
                               (into cell)
                        Oh you know I can handle that.  Be 
                        my pleasure.  Though usual rates do 
                        apply.  Don’t worry, I’ll get her 
                        ready for you.  Good and ready -- 

           Zelda doesn’t like Taiko’s reply, denying her that pleasure.  
           She hangs up.

                                 ZELDA (CONT’D)
                               (disgusted; to herself)
                        Men.

           Zelda expertly twirls TWO SAI’S and steps onto the bed to 
           investigate the bullet holes.  She points one of the sais at 
           the John then motions to the door.

                                 ZELDA (CONT’D)
                        Get while the getting’s good.

                                 JOHN
                               (frantically pulling on 
                                his clothes)
                        Just let me get --

                                 ZELDA
                        Now faggot!

           The John runs out her door, half naked.  From the angle of 
           the open door, we can see the DOORMAN bivouacked in the 
           opposite corner of the hallway aiming his shotgun down at 
           Everly’s apartment.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Zelda comes up fully into frame and peers in through our 
           bullet hole.  DOLLY OUT so we see Everly with the suitcase of 
           money right when we last left her.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into cell)
                        It’ll be okay.  I’ve got a plan.

           Everly zips up the suitcase and gathers all the YAKUZA 
           MEATHEADS GUNS into the center of the room.  
           She hears something from behind the front door.  The knob 
           gently twist.  Someone used a key to unlock it.  

           Everly picks up a hand gun as the door delicately opens, 
           quietly making the chain taught.  

           The tip of a SAI slips through one of the chain links and 
           twists it up.  

           Then with ferocity, Zelda RAMS into the door.  The pressure 
           on the chain causes it to slide down the razor sharp steel of 
           the sai and BURST the link apart.

           Everly raises the gun and aims dead center, pulling the 
           trigger as Zelda, wielding duel sais, KAMIKAZES towards her --  

           Click 

           -- It was her empty gun from the initial shoot out.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck stick.

           Everly HURLS the gun at Zelda.  It THUMPS into her chest, 
           which sends her skidding down as she CAREENS into Everly and 
           they begin to viciously cat fight.  

           The Doorman ventures in, but can’t get a clear shot.  Zelda 
           is on top of Everly.  One of the sais is about to PIERCE 
           THROUGH her shoulder.  It’s tip just starting to draw blood.  

           Everly’s other hand is by Zelda’s mouth.  Zelda chomps down, 
           BITING Everly's fingers.  She SHRIEKS. 

           Everly manages to move her body to the side, so the sai RIPS 
           through her flesh, SLICES down the side of her upper arm and 
           STABS into the floor next to them.  

           Using the hand in Zelda’s mouth, Everly wrenches it down by 
           the sai, so one of its backwards blades GASHES THROUGH 
           Zelda’s cheek.  

           Zelda lets go of Everly’s fingers and staggers back.  She 
           touches her cheek gash, more horrified at her disfigurement 
           than the pain.  

           The Doorman takes aim.  Zelda THROWS her other sai at him.  
           It STABS through the front door and NAILS his shoulder.  He 
           falls out of the room backwards and accidentally SHOOTS up at 
           the ceiling.

                                 ZELDA
                               (pissed; to door)
                        No one fucks this skank but me!  
           Everly tries to pull the other sai out of the floor, using 
           her injured hand.

                                 EVERLY
                        Sorry -- Not into chicks.

           Zelda CRASHES into Everly again.  

           They roll on the ground by the sai, gnashing at each other 
           even more viciously than before -- if that’s at all possible.  

           Everly manages to grab a GUN as they roll over the pile.  
           They fight for it.  

           THEY SHOOT OFF A COUPLE ROUNDS INTO THE CEILING.  This causes 
           the upstairs Crone to THUMP DOWN on her floor, HARD.  

           Zelda and Everly take a second from their mortal combat to 
           look up.  In retort, they let off a few more blasts at the 
           ceiling -- That seems to shut the Crone up. 

           The fight finishes up with Zelda on top of Everly again, 
           using both hands to force the gun at Everly's forehead.  

           Out of the corner of her eye, Everly sees ANOTHER GUN by her 
           free hand.  She frantically grabs for it.  

           Everly gets the gun just as Zelda SHOOTS TWO SHOTS into the 
           floor by Everly's head.  The bullets searing through her 
           strewn hair.  

           Everly takes her gun and RAMS it into the Zelda’s screaming 
           mouth.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Suck it.

           BLAM! -- Zelda’s body JOLTS back and plops down on top of 
           Everly.  

           Beat as Everly catches her breath.  

           Just then, the Doorman returns, KICKING OPEN the door. 

           Everly sits up (with Zelda still on top of her) and SHOOTS.  

           The Doorman FALLS backwards again.  The door’s momentum from 
           him kicking it open fulcrums around and shuts it.  His 
           SHOTGUN has fallen to the ground in the archway, keeping the 
           door ajar.

           Everly rolls Zelda off her and with her gun aimed, heads over 
           to the shotgun.  She can’t leave the door open.  She has to 
           go over and move the shotgun to shut it.
           Everly touches the business end of the shotgun and looks out 
           the ajar door, her gun trained on the hallway outside.  She 
           meets eyes with the dazed Doorman, who scrambles to the 
           shotgun.  

           Everly aims her gun point blank at the Doorman.  He rolls 
           away just as Everly shoots.  

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! -- The Doorman CATERWAULS up and manages to 
           run down the hall with Everly shooting after him.  He 
           PINBALLS into the ELEVATOR DOORS at the far end of the 
           hallway before BANKING OFF them around the corner into 
           another hall, out of view.

           [WITHOUT THE CAMERA LEAVING THE APARTMENT] -- Everly lifts up 
           the shotgun and looks down the hall.  She steps out a little, 
           never fully leaving the room.  Her RIGHT FOOT leaving BLOODY 
           FOOTPRINTS from her wound dripping down her leg.  

           Suddenly, the Doorman POPS OUT from behind the corner with 
           ANOTHER SHOTGUN and FIRES at her.  

           Everly, using her doorway for cover, POPS OUT and shoots back 
           at him with the shotgun, western shoot-out style.  The 
           hallway walls around them BUST OUT with shotgun explosions.  

           There’s a silence after a few volleys, as both seem to be 
           reloading.  Everly figures out how to awkwardly/frantically 
           reload, singeing herself in the process.

                                 DOORMAN (O.C.)
                               (curses out; feeble)
                        Bitch!

           More silence.  Then we hear the sound of CELL PHONES RINGING 
           IN UNISON behind all the apartment doors on the floor just 
           like before with the Yakuza Meatheads.  This signifier scares 
           the shit out of Everly.  She knows what’s coming.

                                 EVERLY
                        Fuck-balls.

           She SLAMS the door and rushes to the other side of the 
           apartment by the gun pile.  Just as she gets there, a 
           SCREAMING OLD SLAG IN GARTERS AND HIGH HEELS, wielding a 
           baseball bat, comes HOWLING in like a banshee.

           BOOM! -- Everly BLOWS HER AWAY, sending her flying backwards.  

           A WAVE OF FOUR TENANT WHORES from the floor come KAMIKAZING 
           IN one right after the other -- Everly BLOWS THEM AWAY in 
           succession.   
           As Everly frantically reloads, FIVE MORE SLAGS come in and 
           SWARM AROUND HER -- ROMERO ZOMBIE STYLE.  

           LOOKING DIRECTLY DOWN, we see Everly on her back, with the 
           shotgun aimed up.  She pulls the trigger, BLOWING BACK THE 
           SLAGS from their craven circular huddle over her.  They splay 
           out backwards in unison, like a synchronized swimming 
           movement.  Blood and buckshot fly upwards, spackling the 
           ceiling like confetti.  

           With all the slags seemingly vanquished, Everly plops down on 
           the couch next to the Dead Man, exhausted.  She looks over 
           the massacred landscape of her apartment.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a lot of whores.

           CU OF DOOR:  From behind the door we hear the Doorman.

                                 DOORMAN (O.C.)
                        You still alive in there, Bitch?

           No answer.  The Doorman KICKS the door open in a shotgun 
           stance.  The handle of the sai sticks into the wall so the 
           door doesn’t bounce back.  

           He looks around and sees Dead Whores and Yakuza Meatheads 
           strewn about the apartment.  The walls and ceiling look like 
           Jackson Pollack took advantage of a sale on red paint.  

           The Dead Man is alone on the couch.

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Christ, that’s a lot of dead 
                        whores.

           Track the Doorman’s feet as he looks for Everly.  We see him 
           walk past a PARTICULARLY BLOODY SLAG by the sai stuck in the 
           floor.  IT’S EVERLY PLAYING POSSUM.

           Everly gets up, pulls the sai out and begins to stalk him.  
           The Doorman sees her BLOODY PHANTASMAGORIC IMAGE right behind 
           him in the REFLECTION OF ONE OF THE PICTURE WINDOWS.  He 
           startles just as she STABS THE SAI INTO HIS SHOULDER.  

           The Doorman CRIES OUT and twirls around, FIRING the shotgun.  
           Everly manages to JUMP OVER the bar just in time.  The 
           Doorman runs out, wailing, with the sai sticking straight out 
           of his shoulder.  Once he’s out of sight --

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                               (cries out)
                        Fucking Bitch.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                               (”are you kidding me?”)
                        With a sai?

           The Doorman HURLS THE SAI BACK INTO THE APARTMENT with zero 
           skill.  It SKITTERS across the floor.  

           Everly runs to the door and locks it.  She also TIPS OVER a 
           CABINET that’s next to the door as a barricade.  She takes a 
           moment to collect herself.

                                 DEAD MAN (O.C.)
                               (weak)
                        Excuse me...

           Everly turns, gun trained.  Who said that?  She scopes around 
           the room, eyeing all the dead bodies.  There’s an eerie 
           quality to the detached voice, almost like the space has 
           become haunted.

           Continuing her gun trained cartography of the room, she scans 
           past the DEAD MAN on the couch.  He coughs bits of blood and 
           she puts her sights back on him as he stirs.  Though mortally 
           wounded -- He’s alive... barely.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Could I bother you for a glass of 
                        water?

           Everly thinks about it.  Then lowers her gun.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Everly grabs a dirty glass with blood specks freckled across 
           it from the sink in the kitchenette.  She fills it from the 
           tap.  The blood specks dilute the water, turning it a musky 
           yellowish pink.  While there, she grabs a ROLL OF DUCT TAPE 
           out of a drawer and puts it on her wrist like a bracelet.  
           She pads over to the Dead Man and hands it to him.

           He meekly looks at it.  Too weak to grasp the glass.  The 
           Dead Man looks and acts like a detached spirit waiting to 
           pass into the netherworld.  There’s a hollowness to him, as 
           if he’s a sorrowful zombie.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Could you...?

           Everly gives an “Are you fucking kidding me?” look.

           QUICK CUTS: of Everly OPENING an arterial sprayed kitchen 
           cabinet -- GRABBING a NEON ORANGE STRAW -- BENDING it -- 
           WEDGING the cup in the Dead Man’s breast pocket and PLOPPING 
           the straw in.  End with the Dead Man demurely SIPPING out of 
           the straw.  
           Everly grabs a BOTTLE OF BOURBON from the bar.  One of the 
           last standing.  The top blown off into a jagged spout.  She 
           guzzles from the bottle, trying to numb her pain.  

           Everly steadies herself, palms down on the bar and looks at 
           the Dead Man, deciding what to do with him.  He looks back at 
           her innocently as he slurps from his straw.

           Everly looks down at her throbbing injured hand; it’s gnarly.  
           She takes the remainder of the bourbon and pours it over the 
           hand, disinfecting it.  She tries not to scream as the 
           bourbon ignites a fire in her appendage.  Even the Dead Man 
           winces a bit.  Everly slams the bar with her good fist, grabs 
           the gun and storms over to the Dead Man in a rage.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                               (matter-of-factly)
                        Don’t waste the bullet.  I’m not 
                        going anywhere.  ‘Sides, you’re 
                        gonna need em all.  And even 
                        then...

           Everly wants to kill him.  She clenches and unclenches her 
           hurt hand, trying to wring life back into it.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Who knows, maybe I’ll live long 
                        enough to tell Taiko what you did 
                        here.

                                 EVERLY
                               (lowers her gun)
                        I sincerely doubt it.

           Everly gives him the once over, deciding what to do with this 
           new development.  

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Get up.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Can’t...

           Everly KICKS the Dead Man in the leg, hard.  He doesn’t 
           flinch.  She checks out his gut wound.  

                                 EVERLY
                        Yeah, that doesn’t look good...

           The Dead Man laugh/wheezes a bit.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I can’t even move my head to see.
                                 EVERLY
                               (not ashamed)
                        Must have severed the spine.

           BRIIING -- Everly turns to her cell.  All the Dead Man can do 
           is dart his eyes towards the sound.  Satisfied he’s not going 
           anywhere, she picks it up.  

           As Everly talks, she stands by the motionless Dead Man on the 
           couch in front of her picture windows.  It’s as if she’s 
           having a conversation with her reflection. 

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you?

                                 EDITH
                        I stopped on the side of the 
                        freeway, trying to figure out what 
                        I’m doing listening to you of all 
                        people.  

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom, you’ve got to keep moving.

                                 EDITH
                        I'm not doing anything till I get 
                        some answers.

           We hear cars ZOOM by adding a manic BG track to the 
           conversation. 

                                 EVERLY
                        Taiko will have had the police 
                        department put an APB out on you 
                        already.  

                                 EDITH
                        Taiko?  Is that the man who was 
                        more important to you than your own 
                        daughter?

                                 EVERLY
                        Can we not do this now.

                                 EDITH
                        I have a little girl scared out of 
                        her mind sitting in my shot up 
                        station wagon thanks to you.  So, 
                        sorry if I'm not inclined to take 
                        your feelings into consideration at 
                        the moment.
                                 EVERLY
                        It wasn’t like that and you know 
                        it.  

                                 EDITH
                        Then what was it like?

                                 EVERLY
                               (flustered; has to give 
                                her something)
                        He offered me a way.  A lifestyle I 
                        couldn’t provide for Maisey by 
                        myself.  One you weren’t able to 
                        provide for me.

                                 EDITH
                        I never had to sell my soul, 
                        amongst other things, to provide 
                        for you.

                                 EVERLY
                        No, you didn’t...  You just worked 
                        yourself to the bone.

                                 EDITH
                        And what am I doing now?

                                 EVERLY
                               (guilty)
                        I have money.  Enough for you and 
                        Maisey to start a new life.  Just 
                        meet me.  I’m leaving soon.  Okay?

           Long beat as we hear an 18 WHEELER HONK and ZOOM by over the 
           phone.

                                 EDITH
                        ...Okay.

           Edith hangs up leaving Everly to stare at her reflection in 
           the window.  There’s almost no resemblance to the shattered 
           woman we first met.

                                 EVERLY
                               (points to Dead Man)
                        Stay.

           The Dead Man just looks at her, processing all he just heard.

           Everly walks into the bathroom past her BLOOD SPLATTER 
           TENDRILS, which have dripped further down the wall.
           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The lack of blood should be startling in contrast to Everly’s 
           bloody battered image.  The white noise of the shower creates 
           a sonic barrier, as if she’s entering another world -- A safe 
           haven.  

           Everly places the gun next to the heroin balloon on the edge 
           of the sink.  She holds it in her gaze a beat longer than she 
           should.

           Clothed in her night shirt and panties, Everly steps into the 
           steam of the shower.  She takes a moment to feel the water 
           cascading down her as it melts away the layer of blood and 
           gore lacquered over her.  

           Everly delicately tries to lift up her shirt, but it’s stuck 
           to the wound.  With great care she strips off the shirt and 
           looks down.  The skin’s shredded, blood pulsing out of it.  

           She takes some body wash and quickly does her hair, then 
           steels herself as she squirts some of the bottle into the 
           wound to clean it out.  Everly winces and tumbles, catching 
           herself onto all fours under the spray of the shower.  She 
           breathes in as she watches a stream of her blood circle the 
           drain.  

           She crawls up and out of the palpitating shower, takes a 
           towel and dries quickly.  She then presses the towel into her 
           side, trying to staunch the bleeding.  She has to steady 
           herself from the pain.   

           Everly grabs a tiny WASH CLOTH and places it over the wound.  
           She takes the duct tape and wraps it around her midriff 
           several times, securing the washcloth in place.  

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Everly takes the gun and duct tape and walks out of the 
           bathroom, gun aimed at the Dead Man just incase.  Her other 
           hand covering her breasts.  The Dead Man looks at her and 
           innocently, sucks on his straw.

           Everly goes over to the tipped cabinet blocking the door and 
           opens one of the drawers.  Her clothes spill out.  

           DEAD MAN’S POV: Everly strips off her panties, steps through 
           a new pair, throws on some jeans and a nondescript numbered 
           baby tee jersey, before putting her hair in a pony tail.  She 
           then steps over to the bar and rips off little hangers of 
           duct tape, WRAPPING THEM AROUND HER BITTEN FINGERS LIKE BAND 
           AID RINGS.  She finishes up by tying on some track sneakers.  
           All in all she looks pretty normal now.  
                                 DEAD MAN
                        You know Taiko’s never gonna let 
                        you leave this building alive.

                                 EVERLY
                               (looks at littered corpses)
                        What gives you that impression?  

           Everly goes over and steps on the couch by the Dead Man and 
           looks out the picture window.  

           Four stories down, she sees DOORMAN #2 -- The surlier Tweedle 
           Dee to the Doorman’s Tweedle Dum.  He’s bouncing a rubber 
           ball in front of a PSYCHOTIC PRESA CANARIO ATTACK DOG going 
           ape shit on a leash.  The balls rhythm hypnotizes the dog 
           into a frothy rage.

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        Banzai, Ball -- Ball!

           Doorman #2 hucks the ball at the Dog.  It viciously snatches 
           the ball in its jaws and wrenches it as if it were snapping 
           it’s connected neck.  Doorman #2 looks up at Everly and 
           smiles, menacingly.  She backs away from the window.

           Even without Doorman #2 and his maniac dog, the quiet 
           industrial street is too open -- There’s no cover and it’s 
           too high.  There’s no way she could get out using this 
           window.  

           Everly takes two guns from the stockpile and stuffs one in 
           her belt behind her and the other in front by her crotch.  
           She then grabs the shotgun and puts in the last four shells.

           Readied, she slides the cabinet barricade out of the way and 
           slowly opens the door.

           BOOM! -- A SHOTGUN BLAST aimed where her head would be 
           EXPLODES OFF a piece of the door and a hunk of the archway.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Gotcha, Bitch!

           Everly gets up and fires a retaliatory blast down the hall 
           and then one into the knob of the apartment door directly 
           across from her own.  It bursts open.

                                 EVERLY
                        Stop calling me bitch!

           Everly runs across the hall into the EMPTY APARTMENT.  She 
           lands in a dive, pulling out one of the hand guns as she 
           skids around.  The Doorman comes running and shoots into the 
           other apartment.  We see Everly duck out of sight.  
           [FROM OUR VIEW -- NEVER LEAVING EVERLY'S APARTMENT] We hear a 
           shoot out in the empty apartment across the hall.  We see 
           glimpses of the Doorman and Everly come into view every once 
           in a while in the doorway.

           The Doorman needs to reload the shotgun.  He makes a running 
           leap into Everly's apartment, kicking the door shut.   

           A tract of bullet holes pierce the door right by him.  The 
           Doorman just manages to roll out of the way.   

           The Doorman takes a deep breath trying to settle his blood 
           pressure.  He hears movement from behind the door and snaps 
           to.   

           He frantically reloads the shotgun just as Everly KICKS OPEN 
           her apartment door.  The Doorman turns and shoots.  She ducks 
           away into the hall.  Their roles now reversed.

           The Doorman tries to get a good angle to shoot Everly as she 
           runs back into the apartment across the way.  

           Everly tips over a dresser by the door and uses it as a 
           barricade to pop up and shoot into her apartment at the 
           Doorman.

           The Doorman’s finally out of ammo.  We see his desperate 
           anguish as he realizes how over his head he’s in at the 
           moment.  

           He tries to pull himself together.  He spies Everly’s gun 
           stockpile in the center of the room.  The Doorman psyches 
           himself up, then scrambles into the open to grab a gun from 
           it.  Everly's shots chip away around him.  

           Now the Doorman is beside the door, heaving for air.  The 
           hallway wall behind him SHAKES SAVAGELY -- taking a pummeling 
           from Everly’s shotgun blasts.  It’s insanity.  

           He opens up his jacket and takes out THREE GRENADES.  Due to 
           the mayhem behind him, he juggles them a bit and almost drops 
           one, but catches himself.  He pulls the pin on one with his 
           teeth and TOSSES it over Everly's head into the other 
           apartment.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Eat it, Bitch!

           Everly registers the danger and JUMPS OVER the dresser out 
           into the open hall before the grenade EXPLODES --

           KA-BOOM! 
           -- Everly rolls around in the hall trying to shake off the 
           concussion blast.  The Doorman picks up a gun and aims it at 
           her prone form.

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Now you die, Bitch!

                                 DEAD MAN (O.C.)
                        Ralph --

           Startled, the Doorman turns around to the Dead Man on the 
           couch behind him.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...

           The Doorman realizes -- Too late.  

           BLAM! BLAM! -- Everly shoots the Doorman from behind.  
           BULLETS BUST THROUGH HIS GUT, collapsing him to the ground.  

           THE LAST TWO GRENADES GO ROLLING THROUGH THE BLOODY MAYHEM, 
           STOPPING BY THE DEAD MAN’S FEET.

           Everly PICKS UP the Doorman’s SHOTGUN and aims it down at 
           him.  On his belly, the Doorman struggles towards the 
           grenades.  She kicks him over.  The Doorman looks into her 
           eyes with a Hell glint.

                                 EVERLY
                        Sorry I never tipped you at 
                        Christmas.

           The Doorman laughs a bit.  Is she fucking serious?  Everly 
           pulls the trigger --  

           Click.  

           -- She looks down at the shotgun... Unbelievable...  

                                 DOORMAN
                               (with dying breath)
                        Fucking Bitch...

           SKLUARSH! -- Everly takes the butt of the shotgun and SMASHES 
           it down.  

           Just then POLICE SIRENS whirl outside.  Everly peaks out the 
           window and sees FOUR PATROL CARS PULL UP out front. 

           Doorman #2 reigns in his dog as he jabbers with one of the 
           UNIFORMED OFFICERS.
           Everly tosses the shotgun aside and grabs two more pistols 
           from the stockpile.  She takes her cell and grabs the wheeled 
           travel suitcase stuffed with money.  She looks back at the 
           Dead Man.  

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Taiko will already have the 
                        building surrounded.  You’ll never 
                        make it outside.

                                 EVERLY
                        Can’t stay in here.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        He’s toying with you.  This is what 
                        he does.  All he cares about is his 
                        personal amusement.  

                                 EVERLY
                        You act like I don’t know the man.

           They share a look.  Both know the answer to that all too 
           well.

           The two start to hear muffled evacuation sounds as the rest 
           of the tenants are taken out of the building above and below 
           them.

           FROM UPSTAIRS in the Old Crone (Mrs. Haberdash’s) apartment 
           directly above.

                                 POLICE MAN (O.C.)
                        Ma’am, the building isn’t safe.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (O.C.)
                        WHAT?

                                 POLICE MAN (O.C.)
                        I said it’s not safe.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (O.C.)
                        THERE’S SUCH A RUCKUS AND MY 
                        STORIES ARE ON.

                                 POLICE MAN (O.C.)
                        Please unchain the door.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (O.C.)
                        GOOD NIGHT.

                                 POLICE MAN (O.C.)
                        Ma’am....

           We hear the door shut.
           Everly takes the TV remote and turns on the LCD on the wall 
           above the bar.  It has a bullet hole in the screen, but 
           otherwise works.  

           Everly flips through till she finds the aux channel video 
           SECURITY CAM FEED FOR THE LOBBY of the building.  She sees 
           Doorman #2 pacing around, his attack dog lurks menacingly.  A 
           YAKUZA FLUNKY loiters by one of the pillars, dragging on a 
           cigarette.  A STREAM OF TENANTS are being ESCORTED OUT 
           through the lobby by uniformed policemen.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I suppose it would be too much to 
                        ask of you to kill me rather than 
                        have to face Taiko.

                                 EVERLY
                        You mean show you mercy after what 
                        you did?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I didn’t join in.  I could have.  

                                 EVERLY
                        You think cause you filmed it, that 
                        makes you less guilty?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        If I hadn’t, Taiko would have 
                        killed me.  

                                 EVERLY
                        And look where that got you.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I didn’t say it wasn’t deserved.   

                                 EVERLY
                        Well then...

           This is her only shot -- Everly leaves the TV on, takes the 
           suitcase and heads out the door.

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (calls out)
                        Don’t leave it for him to see.

           A moment, then Everly comes back into the archway.  She 
           hadn’t thought of that.  She appraises the Dead Man, almost 
           as if he is a bit human.  She leaves the suitcase by the door 
           and goes over to the TIPPED OVER TRIPOD and picks up the 
           CAMERA.  She pauses, debating whether to stare directly into 
           the eye of the storm.
                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t... 

           She looks at him, then back at the camera.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Trust me.  Destroy it.

           Everly presses play and looks on the view screen.  

           TIGHT ON EVERLY’S FACE as the pain and agony of watching her 
           rape seeps onto her visage.  We hear the sound of the Yakuza 
           Meatheads cheer on an assailant as Everly tries not to give 
           in.   

           The Dead Man turns his head, ashamed.  

           Watching this back forever kills a part of Everly.  Just 
           hearing it and reading her expression, completely justifies 
           what she’s done to these monsters for revenge and what she’ll 
           do to them forthcoming.  

           Everly turns the video off as it reaches the apex and we hear 
           her finally break.  She rips out the mini DV tape and TEARS 
           IT APART.  

           Inconsolable, she takes the camera on the tripod and begins 
           to BEAT IT AROUND.  BREAKING it apart against the Dead Yakuza 
           Meatheads.  

           All the while the Dead Man can’t bring himself to look at 
           her.  Almost as if he’s trying to give her the dignity of 
           privacy for this moment.

           Everly turns back to the Dead Man.  All her rage focused like 
           a laser point at him.  The last of the men she can hurt, who 
           hurt her.  She rages over to him.

                                 EVERLY
                        Look at me!

           He can’t bring himself to.  He begins to whimper.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Look at me!

           Everly takes her gun and presses it into his eye socket -- 
           HARD.  With his other eye, the Dead Man meets her gaze.  
           They’re face to face.  This is the most alive we’ve seen the 
           Dead Man since he’s been shot.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Death’s too easy an out for you.  I 
                        hope they save you for him.
                                 DEAD MAN
                        Maybe that would be justice.  
                               (wheezes; haunts him)
                        I've done things so vile -- so 
                        disgusting...

                                 EVERLY
                        Am I'm supposed to absolve you now 
                        that you’re dying?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (laughs; coughs blood)
                        No.  Hold onto your hatred.  It 
                        will fuel you through the night.

           Everly steps away.  An understanding has been forged.  She 
           takes a couch pillow over the muzzle of the gun and aims it 
           at the Dead Man’s head.  He gratefully closes his eyes --  

           Click.  

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                               (opens eyes; resigned to 
                                his fate)
                        ...You’ve used a lot of bullets.

                                 EVERLY
                               (tosses empty gun)
                        I gotta start making two piles.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        If you’re going to have any shot of 
                        escaping -- This is it.  While 
                        they’re evacuating.  Before they 
                        realize the Doorman’s dead.

           Everly nods to the Dead Man, then takes the suitcase and 
           walks out the door, closing it behind her.  Before she can 
           shut it fully --

                                 MAN (O.C.)
                        Can I help you, Ma’am?

           We catch glimpses of a BEAT COP in full blues THROUGH THE 
           CRACK OF THE DOOR talking to her.  His measure is clipped 
           friendliness combined with controlled menace.

                                 EVERLY
                        Was just leaving.

           Beat.  The Cop smiles and nods to himself as he invades her 
           space -- pushing her back into the apartment, causing the 
           crack in the door to get wider.
                                 COP
                        You know that’s not possible, 
                        Ma’am.

                                 EVERLY
                        Aren’t you evacuating the building?

                                 COP
                        No, Ma’am.  Not everyone, Ma’am. 

           He let’s that sit with her, then --

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                               (not asking)
                        Why don’t you step back inside.

           Everly is speechless.

           The Cop opens the apartment door, exposing the Dead Yakuzas 
           and Whores dotted about.  He takes it all in, then looks at 
           her as pleasant as can be --

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                               (tips his hat)
                        You have a nice night now, Ma’am. 

           Everly backs into the apartment as the Cop shuts the door -- 
           locking her back into her cage. 

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (disappointed)
                        Konnichiwa.

           Everly's completely trapped.  She thinks about her next move, 
           then dials her cell.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into cell)
                        It’s Everly.

                                 TAIKO
                        I know.

                                 EVERLY
                        I’m honored I rate so highly that 
                        you had to call in your police 
                        thugs. 

                                 TAIKO
                        What’s the use of having power if 
                        you don’t flaunt it?  Besides I 
                        wanted to ensure we are 
                        uninterrupted tonight.
                                 EVERLY
                        Lucky me.

                                 TAIKO
                        Indeed...

           A beat, time for a new tack --

                                 EVERLY
                        Sorry I killed all your whores.

                                 TAIKO
                        I wouldn’t have thought you had it 
                        in you.

                                 EVERLY
                        Taiko, you’d be amazed what you can 
                        accomplish when you put your mind 
                        to it.
                               (playful)
                        You hear from your Yakuza goons in 
                        the valley yet?

                                 TAIKO
                        Yes.

                                 EVERLY
                        Just not your night, tonight.
                               (no response)
                        Sorry you won’t get the chance to 
                        meet my daughter.  Guess you’ll 
                        just have to settle for visiting 
                        me.

           Taiko laughs, this off-puts Everly.  The Dead Man can’t 
           believe what she’s saying.

                                 TAIKO
                        Just how far do you think a broken 
                        down old woman and a little girl 
                        can get from me?

                                 EVERLY
                        Unless you’re suddenly traveling in 
                        different social circles.  I’d bet 
                        pretty far.

                                 TAIKO
                        I wouldn’t wager something you’re 
                        not willing to lose.

                                 EVERLY
                        You’ve already taken everything 
                        from me.
                                 TAIKO
                        Have I...

           Everly hangs up.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I think that guaranteed Taiko’s 
                        personal attention to the 
                        situation.

           Everly agrees.  Next on the agenda -- 

           DEAD MAN’S POV: As he observes Everly pace around the dead 
           bodies littered about, while talking on her cell.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into phone)
                        Mom, where are you?
                               (beat)
                        Things have changed.  I need you to 
                        come to me.  
                               (beat)
                        I know it’s dangerous.  But it’s 
                        the only way.  
                               (beat)
                        Me getting out of this building is 
                        the least of my worries.  Once I 
                        know you two are safe I'll worry 
                        about myself.
                               (beat)
                        I live in an apartment building.  
                        It’s being evacuated.  Some of the 
                        floors are rent controlled.  So 
                        there’s regular tenants.  Say 
                        you’re getting your mother -- Mrs. 
                        Haberdash in 4b.  I live right 
                        under her in 3b.
                               (beat)
                        Just walk in with Maisey --  
                        They’re not gonna do anything 
                        unless I provoke them.  They know 
                        they have me.  You’ll be able to 
                        get in and out.  They would never 
                        suspect you two to come to me.
                               (beat)
                        Why?  Cause it’s insane.  But Mom, 
                        it’s the only way.
                               (looks at suitcase)
                        It’s almost a million dollars.
                               (beat)
                        7th and Flower.  1516 7th Street -- 
                        And Mom, hurry.
           Everly hangs up the phone, not sure if she just did the right 
           thing. 

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Risky.  

                                 EVERLY
                               (doubting herself)
                        You mean foolish.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Who says they’re mutually 
                        exclusive?

                                 EVERLY
                        Looks like we’re having company.

           Everly eyes all the dead bodies littering the apartment.  
           It’s a Nightmare Hellscape.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Maybe they can meet you in the 
                        hall?

           Everly flashes him a look.

           SEQUENCE -- Some public domain, Big Band Christmas music 
           plays as Everly cleans up her apartment.  

           -- Everly stuffs bodies into the kitchenette floor hole.  

           -- Everly drags Yakuza Meatheads into the bathroom -- Piling 
           them in the still running shower.  The bodies plug the tub.  
           Water spills out onto the bathroom floor.  

           -- Everly hides bodies anywhere she can.  

           -- The Dead Man sips from his straw and watches.  

           -- Everly takes off the bed sheets and spreads them on the 
           ground, trying to mop up the puddles of blood as best she 
           can.  She throws the bloody sheets into the apartment across.  

           -- Everly looks down at her HEROIN BALLOON deciding what to 
           do with them.  Their allure still magnetic.  Finally, she 
           throws them in the trash next to the toilet.  Out of sight, 
           but not out of reach.  

           -- As Everly walks out of the bathroom, we see the BLOOD 
           TENDRILS have dripped lower.  

           -- She sees the police pull away below and take up strategic 
           perimeter positions a block away.  Their whirling light bars 
           flashing ominously in the distance.  
           Everly looks around the apartment at her handiwork.  Not too 
           shabby.  Now the only remnant left is the Dead Man.  She 
           stands over him. 

                                 EVERLY
                        I don’t even know your name?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Does it matter at this point?  

                                 EVERLY
                               (she takes him in)
                        Well, “Dead Man” -- You gonna play 
                        nice or am I --

           There’s a KNOCKING on the door.  It’s stern and actually 
           spooks Everly.  The Dead Man and Everly lock eyes?  This 
           couldn’t be Edith and Maisey, it’s too soon.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        If it were Taiko he’d be knocking 
                        with shotgun blasts.

           Everly walks over to the door, gun raised.  She peers out the 
           peep hole, then opens it. 

           REVEAL A LITTLE OLD LADY -- Everly’s upstairs old crone 
           neighbor (MRS. HABERDASH) in a muumuu and rollers on a 
           walker, waggling her finger.  Her hearing aid is so loud we 
           hear it SCREECH before she talks.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH
                               (hard of hearing; shouting)
                        I’VE LIVED IN THIS BUILDING FOR 
                        FORTY-SEVEN YEARS.  NEVER HAVE I 
                        HEARD SUCH A COMMOTION.  THERE ARE 
                        HUMAN BEINGS THAT LIVE HERE TOO. 
                        YOU DON’T THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU DO?  
                        THE DISGRACE.  MISCREANT.

                                 EVERLY
                               (dumbfounded)
                        Er...  ah...  Sorry...

           Mrs. Haberdash leans in, she can barely hear and seems to 
           have mild dementia.  Disgusted, she waves off Everly.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH
                        FEH.

           Everly can only watch on as Mrs. Haberdash struggles with her 
           walker back down the hall.  She’s seemingly oblivious to the 
           gun blasts and blood all around her.  The tennis balls on the 
           front of her walker leave a trail through the plaster debris.  
           Everly sees the Young Latina’s apartment door open a crack 
           (it’s down the hall directly across from Zelda’s apartment, 
           where the Doorman was bivouacked).  She peaks out, sees 
           Haberdash dragging past her and then makes quick eye contact 
           with Everly before darting back in and shutting her door.

           Everly shuts her door and leans against it.

           The Dead Man starts to have a coughing fit.  He’s dying in 
           front of her.  

                                 EVERLY
                        You know we met before.  

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I was wondering if you’d realize.  
                        Seems a lifetime ago...

                                 EVERLY
                               (agrees)
                        Before Taiko introduced me to 
                        heroin.   

                                 DEAD MAN
                        He enjoys exerting control over the  
                        things he chooses to surround 
                        himself with -- Bending them to his 
                        will.

                                 EVERLY
                        Till he breaks them...

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (rueful; knows first hand)
                        And everything breaks. 

                                 EVERLY
                        I did things for him...  Things I 
                        couldn’t even imagine myself...  
                               (whispers; devastated)
                        Giving up my daughter.

           That’s the first time she’s admitted it.  Everly breathes; 
           then,

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I loved him once...

           The Dead Man lets that resonate.  He looks down at all the 
           blood that's poured out of him.  It’s soaked through the 
           couch cushions, making them soggy.
                                 DEAD MAN
                        Taiko doesn’t know love.  He 
                        doesn’t understand value other than 
                        as a possession. 
                               (meets her gaze; sorry)
                        You weren’t the first.

                                 EVERLY
                        I will be the last.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        No.  If you can escape this 
                        building with your family -- Go and 
                        never look back.  Cause that, that 
                        love is something Taiko can never 
                        have.  Can never fathom.  A bond 
                        when forged he can never break.

                                 EVERLY
                        You believe that?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (meek bloody smile)
                        It only matters if you do...

           The Dead Man nods to the suitcase.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get the money?

                                 EVERLY
                        It’s Taiko’s.  I hold it till his 
                        fences can launder it through his 
                        legitimate businesses. So I guess 
                        all things considered, it’s my 
                        severance package.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Surprising he would leave so much 
                        money with you.

                                 EVERLY
                        He bought my loyalty cheap.  One of 
                        his underlings comes over every 
                        couple of days.  Adds to the till.  
                        Drops off a balloon.  
                               (looks away)
                        I thank him.  Then every two weeks 
                        they pick it all up and we start 
                        again.  Cycle of my life.

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (teeth chattering)
                        I’m freezing.
           Everly pulls out a blanket from a CLOSET NOOK and wraps the 
           Dead Man in it.  He looks pathetic.  Everly’s cell rings.  
           She’s relieved when she sees who it is.

                                 EVERLY
                        Ready to meet the family?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (manages a small smile)
                        Are you?

           That gives Everly pause as she answers the cell.

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom?

                                 EDITH
                        I just drove by some police.  They 
                        were setting up a barricade.  And 
                        there’s are all these strange men 
                        around your building.

                                 EVERLY
                        How many?

           Everly goes next to the Dead Man and peeks out the window.  
           She sees a BEAT UP STATION WAGON with a shot out rear window 
           drive by.  Outside she sees YAKUZA FLUNKIES in the shadows 
           sparsed out at strategic places, casing the building.  Their 
           cigarette embers betraying them.  Police lights flash in the 
           distance.

                                 EDITH
                        I don’t know, like a gang.  They’re 
                        spread out up and down the street.  
                        They’re all watching the building 
                        and chain smoking.  Are they 
                        waiting for you?

                                 EVERLY
                        Yeah.

                                 EDITH
                        Everly, this is crazy.

                                 EVERLY
                        If you can’t -- you can’t.  But 
                        unless this one man is stopped, 
                        you’ll never be safe.  You can 
                        never go home.  That’s what this 
                        money is for.  To save you.
                                 EDITH
                        Everly, I'm not involved in this.  
                        Why would someone --

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom.  It is what it is and I'm 
                        sorry.  But for Maisey.  For every 
                        time you tried to help me and I 
                        wouldn’t let you.  Please.  Let me 
                        help you now.

           No response...  Then --

                                 EDITH
                        I just parked.  
                               (as she gets out)
                        Come on, Maisey.  Take my hand, 
                        Honey.

                                 MAISEY
                        Where are we going?

                                 EDITH
                        Inside.

                                 MAISEY
                        I don’t want to.

                                 EDITH
                        I know.  It’ll be okay.

           Everly looks on the TV at the closed circuit security feed to 
           the lobby cam.  She sees Doorman #2 (minus the dog).  A 
           YAKUZA FLUNKY loiters against a pillar, smoking a cigarette.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into cell)
                        Take the elevator to the fourth 
                        floor then come down the stairs to 
                        the third.  If you see any men on 
                        the floor -- leave.

                                 EDITH
                        There are men all over the stairs 
                        outside.  

                                 MAISEY
                        They’re scary.

                                 EDITH
                        I know, Honey.  Here --

           Everly hears Edith pick up Maisey.
                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                               (to Everly)
                        We’re walking into the lobby now.

           Everly goes to the hallway and looks out.  It’s all clear.  
           She stands in the archway and watches the TV.  She can see 
           Edith carrying Maisey as she walks up the steps between a 
           column of men’s shadows and smoke from their cigarettes.  The 
           Yakuza Flunky in the lobby takes notice.

           Everly hears her mother’s footsteps echo in the lobby over 
           the phone.  The muffled sound of the PRESA CANARIO’S 
           thunderous barking coming from behind a door plays under, 
           unsettling the tenor of the scene.  

           ON THE LCD -- Doorman #2 eyes Edith and comes out from behind 
           his desk. 

                                 EVERLY
                               (into cell)
                        Say something.

                                 EDITH
                               (faking into phone)
                        We’re here.  Yes, Mother.  I have 
                        your granddaughter with me.

           ON THE LCD --Doorman #2 passive aggressively blocks her way.  
           It’d read as too eager if we didn’t know the truth.

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        Can I help you, Ma'am?

                                 EDITH
                               (keeps walking)
                        Yes.  You have some strange men 
                        loitering outside.  I was scared to 
                        even come in and visit my mother.

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        Sorry, ma'am.  They’re waiting for 
                        a friend.  Who exactly are you 
                        going to visit?  We’re not really 
                        letting anyone up. 

           Edith takes a slight readjusting beat.

                                 EDITH
                               (into phone)
                        Hold on, Mom.
                               (to Doorman #2)
                        My mother -- Mrs. Haberdash in 4b.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        She called me up complaining about 
                        an awful racket ...people trying to 
                        kick her out of her place.  
                               (shoots Flunky a look)
                        This used to be a nice 
                        neighborhood. 

           A tense beat, then --

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        Right.  Mrs. Haberdash.  Lovely 
                        lady.  Tell her sorry for the 
                        noise.  Unfortunate incident.
                               (steps aside)
                        Should be over soon.

           Edith walks over to the elevator.  Doorman #2 nods to the 
           Yakuza Flunky.  He gets in behind her.

                                 EDITH
                               (into phone)
                        We’re on the elevator.  Be right 
                        up.
                               (nervous to Flunky)
                        What floor, sir?

                                 YAKUZA FLUNKY
                        Three.

                                 EDITH
                        Three it is.

           Edith hangs up the phone.  Everly’s in a panic.  If she 
           shoots the Flunky it will alert everyone downstairs that 
           there’s a problem.

           Everly watches the elevator dial go past two.  She looks and 
           grabs the SAI off the door.  

           The elevator door dings open.  Everly sees EDITH holding 
           MAISEY next to the YAKUZA FLUNKY -- Everyone frozen in time.  

           Then, the Yakuza Flunky sneers and steps off the elevator.

           As the elevator door shuts with Edith and Maisey still 
           inside, the Flunky takes out a GUN.  

           Everly darts back into her apartment.  

           We hear the Flunky running after her.  

           Everly crouches down beside the door, sai in hand.  
           As the Flunky runs in, she times it perfectly, RAMMING the 
           sai into his crotch.  

           The Flunky lets out a COMIC PAINED HYENA CACKLE as he 
           collapses to the ground.  

           Everly KICK SHUTS the door and flops him over, then mounts 
           him, struggling to get the gun before he shoots.  

           There’s a KNOCK on the door.

                                 EDITH  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Everly?

                                 EVERLY
                        Just a sec.

           She pulls out the sai and rams it into the Flunky’s neck.   
           It’s unpleasant.  The Dead Man cringes.  

           Everly drags the dead Flunky behind the bar.  She leans 
           against it and looks at the Dead Man.  He motions to the 
           severed DEA AGENT’S HEAD that’s on the stool next to her.  
           Everly doesn’t know what to do with it.  She brings up the 
           flaps and reconstructs the box quickly, then refixes the 
           festive paper so it looks like a present.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                               (to Dead Man)
                        Thanks.

           The Dead Man nods -- That’s the least of your worries...

           Everly opens the door.  There stands EDITH (60’s, soccer mom 
           vibe) and next to her MAISEY (5, a beautiful, precocious 
           little moppet).  Everly doesn’t even register Edith.  She 
           just stands in awe looking down at Maisey.  

           Maisey looks up at her pleasantly.  She doesn’t seem to 
           recognize Everly -- This, the deepest cut.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

                                 MAISEY
                        Hello.

           Everly kneels in front of her daughter.  Coming to her level 
           so they’re eye to eye.  Sharing a moment she never thought 
           she’d have just an hour ago.

                                 EVERLY
                        I’m Everly.
                                 MAISEY
                        My name’s Maisey.

                                 EVERLY
                        I know... I --

                                 EDITH
                        Can we come in?

                                 EVERLY
                               (can’t take eyes off 
                                Maisey)
                        Of course.

                                 EDITH
                        C’mon, Maisey.

           Edith puts out her hand for Maisey to take and guides her 
           into the apartment.  

           Awkward Beat -- Edith can’t make eye contact with Everly.  
           There’s a ton unsaid between the two women.  Edith checks out 
           the apartment, sees the blood sprayed all over the ceiling 
           and walls.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Is that...?

                                 EVERLY
                        Ah, yeah...

           Edith walks over and startles when she sees the Dead Man, 
           earnestly smiling up at her from the couch.  She pulls Maisey 
           behind her for safety.

                                 EDITH
                        Oh, ah...  Hello?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Moshi moshi.

                                 EDITH
                        Who’s your “friend”?

                                 EVERLY
                        He came with the place.  Not 
                        important.

           The Dead Man just smiles.  Maisey peaks out from behind Edith 
           and waves to him.  He meekly smiles back.
                                 EDITH
                        Maisey, I have to talk to Everly.  
                        Wait out here.  Don’t touch 
                        anything.

           Everly sees Edith has spotted water seeping out of the 
           bathroom door from the shower.  It’s already spread through 
           most of the apartment.

                                 EVERLY
                        Oh ah, must have left the shower 
                        running.
                               (to Dead Man; re: Maisey)
                        Keep an eye on her.

           The Dead Man looks at her.  An odd request all things 
           considered.  The Dead Man is nodding off, he’s about to die.  
           It takes immense effort to talk.

                                 DEAD MAN 
                        Yes.

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They walk into the bathroom.  Everly leaves the door slightly 
           ajar.

                                 EDITH
                               (turns to shower)
                        Why is the water --

                                 EVERLY
                        Don’t!

           Too late.  Edith pulls the curtain and sees a MOUNTAIN OF 
           DEAD YAKUZA MEATHEADS STACKED UP IN THE TUB.  Water cascades 
           down over them.  A waterfall of pinkish blood water pouring 
           over the edge, flooding the floor out into the apartment.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Open the curtain.

                                 EDITH
                        Everly!

                                 EVERLY
                        I had to put them somewhere.  I 
                        couldn’t let Maisey see.

                                 EDITH
                        Did you kill all these men?
                                 EVERLY
                               (awkward pause)
                        It’s not like I’m proud of it.

                                 EDITH
                        What have you done?

                                 EVERLY
                        What I had to do to get to this 
                        moment.  And I’ll do what ever it 
                        takes to get to the next.

           Edith sits on the toilet lid, exhausted, shaking her head.

                                 EDITH
                        What have you done?

           Edith grabs some toilet paper and wipes away her tears.

                                 EVERLY
                               (goes to comfort)
                        Mom...

                                 EDITH
                               (brushes her away)
                        -- Don’t.

           Wounded, Everly takes a step back.  Edith blows her nose and 
           tosses the rag in the basket.  She stops and stares inside.  
           Everly realizes too late -- Fuck!  Edith brings out the 
           HEROIN BALLOON.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                               (re: heroin)
                        All cause of this, right?

           Everly can’t answer.  Her shamed silence, the loudest truth 
           possible.  Edith looks at Everly with utter contempt.  She 
           tosses the heroin back in the trash and stands up.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t think it was possible for 
                        you to hurt me anymore.  I’d 
                        thought I'd seen it all.  But you 
                        just keep inventing new ways.

                                 EVERLY
                        You think I asked for this?

           Edith SLAPS Everly in the face, HARD.  Fire in her eyes.  She 
           SLAPS her again two more times, back to back on the same 
           cheek.  Tears gush out of Everly.  She just takes it.
                                 EDITH
                               (grabs Everly’s arms)
                        I don’t see track marks.

                                 EVERLY
                               (no hiding anymore...)
                        I shoot between my toes or skin 
                        pop.

                                 EDITH
                        Skin pop?

                                 EVERLY
                        It’s -- It’s not important.

                                 EDITH
                        I’ve been thinking about this ever 
                        since what happened back at the 
                        house.  And I’ve come to a 
                        decision.  We’re all gonna get out 
                        of this building.  All of us.  But 
                        after that, we go our separate 
                        ways.  Maisey and I will go it 
                        alone.

                                 EVERLY
                        I understand.

                                 EDITH
                        She doesn’t know who you are.  
                        She’s stopped asking if her mother 
                        was ever going to come home years 
                        ago.  She just accepted.  It’s time 
                        we all did.

                                 EVERLY
                               (this is the hardest)
                        It’ll be better if I don’t know 
                        where you two go.

                                 EDITH
                        So then this is it.

                                 EVERLY
                        This is it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Maisey looks at the Dead Man alone on the couch.

                                 MAISEY
                        Do you live here?
                                 DEAD MAN
                        Just visiting.

           Maisey goes over to a cubby hole by the kitchenette.  She 
           opens it.  Out of her line of vision, TWO EXPIRED SLAGS are 
           stuffed inside.  The Dead Man sees though --

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t open that!

                                 MAISEY
                               (thinks it’s a game)
                        Why not?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (thinks quick)
                        Cooties.

           Maisey freaks a little, shuts the door without looking and 
           darts away to the center of the room.  Relieved, the Dead Man 
           gratefully sighs, then hacks up a lung.  His strength all but 
           gone.  The blanket he’s swathed in seeping with his blood.

                                 MAISEY
                        Are you sick?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (playing)
                        Did you know I used to be a singer?

                                 MAISEY
                        Really?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (raspy; sings)
                        The itsy bitsy spider goes up the 
                        water spout...  

           Maisey laughs.  It makes the Dead Man smile, possibly 
           reminding him of his own children.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Down came the rain --

           The Dead Man coughs violently.

                                 MAISEY
                        Why do you have a blanket?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I’m cold.
                                 MAISEY
                               (looks around)
                        I don’t like it here.

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Me neither.

           Maisey looks around the apartment.  She eyes the fritzing 
           Christmas tree and the severed head present on the bar.

                                 MAISEY
                        Is that a Christmas present?

                                 DEAD MAN
                               (not sure of what to say)
                        ....Maybe
                               (calls out)
                        Everly.

                                 MAISEY
                        Can I open it?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.
                               (calls out louder)
                        Everly!

           Maisey goes towards the present.

                                 MAISEY
                        What do you think it is?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        I couldn’t even imagine.

           Maisey climbs up a bar stool and goes to open it.

                                 DEAD MAN (CONT’D)
                               (takes all his will)
                        EVERLY!

           Everly rushes out, gun raised at Maisey, who gets startled 
           and upset.  

                                 EVERLY
                               (to Maisey)
                        No!

           Everly tucks away the gun, grabs the “present” and puts it up 
           out of reach.  Maisey runs to Edith, afraid of Everly.  

                                 EDITH
                        It’s okay.
                                 EVERLY
                               (not sure what to do)
                        I’m sorry, Honey.  It’s just it’s 
                        not actually a present.  It’s 
                        empty.

           Everly kneels down to her, causing Maisey to hide behind 
           Edith’s legs for protection.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need to be afraid of me.

           Maisey skirts a little more behind Edith.  She doesn’t 
           necessarily believe that.  This hurts Everly more than any 
           gunshot wound.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        You know I do have something.  A 
                        Christmas gift, in fact.  But it’s 
                        for a very special little girl.  
                        You think that could be you?

           Maisey shyly motions from behind Edith, her curiosity peaked.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Wanna see?  

           Everly goes over to the closet nook and digs in the back on 
           the top shelf.  She pulls out a big stuffed HELLO KITTY DOLL 
           in a plastic shopping bag.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t get a chance to wrap it.

           Maisey looks up at Edith.  She nods her ascent and Maisey 
           tentatively comes over and takes the bag from Everly.

                                 EDITH
                        What do you say?

                                 MAISEY
                               (to Everly)
                        Thank you.

           Everly watches her look over the doll.  Maisey approves, 
           hugging it close.  This is the first time Everly’s ever seen 
           Maisey get a gift.  It really lands on her.

                                 EVERLY
                               (no, thank you)
                        You’re welcome.

           Maisey holds up the Hello Kitty to the Dead Man.
                                 DEAD MAN
                        She’s very pretty -- like you.

                                 EDITH
                        Grams and Everly have to finish up 
                        in the other room.  Just one more 
                        second.

           She places Maisey and the doll on the arm of the couch. 

                                 EVERLY
                               (to Maisey and doll)
                        You two stay put.
                               (to Dead Man)
                        Watch her.

           The Dead Man can only grunt and nod awake at this point.

                                 EDITH
                               (worried; to Maisey)
                        Don’t get too close to him.

           Maisey just hugs the doll and sits on the arm of the couch 
           looking at the Dead Man.  Everly and Edith go back into the 
           bathroom, leaving the door slightly ajar.

           Maisey watches the Dead Man dying, it looks like he’s nodding 
           off and then will wake up.

                                 MAISEY
                        Are you sleepy?

                                 DEAD MAN
                        Very...

                                 MAISEY
                        What’s your name?

           And with that the Dead Man nods over, blood slacking out of 
           his nose and mouth.  This scares Maisey, who gets off the 
           couch and backs away towards the front door.  She’s very 
           freaked out by this place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           Everly looks out the door crack trying to keep an eye on 
           Maisey.  But she’s not there.  

                                 EVERLY
                        Maisey?

           Everly and Edith rush out of the bathroom.  They look around 
           for Maisey.  She’s gone.  Everly sees the Dead Man has died.  
                                 EDITH
                        Maisey?

           Everly spots the FRONT DOOR IS OPEN.

                                 EVERLY
                        Oh no...

           She rushes to it.  

           There in the hallway, she sees Maisey holding Hello Kitty, 
           looking at DOORMAN #2 and his attack dog GROWLING back at 
           her.  

           Doorman #2 is on his knees petting his dog, whispering in its 
           ear.  It growls more intensely.  The dog looks like it’s 
           being prepped to attack.  It’s terrifying.

           Everly grabs hold of Maisey.  There’s a stare down for a 
           brief instance between her and Doorman #2.  He cracks a 
           devilish grin, then to the dog --

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        Kill.

           Doorman #2 unleashes the attack dog.  Everly takes Maisey and  
           HAULS ASS back into the apartment.  The maniac dog is already 
           on top of them.  Everly PICKS UP Maisey as they run through 
           her door -- The dog right behind. 

           They almost make it to Edith and the bathroom door before the 
           dog FEROCIOUSLY BOUNDS into the apartment.

                                 EVERLY
                        Take her!

           With the dog almost on top of them, Everly manages to TOSS 
           Maisey to Edith.  Edith immediately SLAMS the bathroom door 
           shut, insuring Maisey’s safety. 

           Everly turns, just as the attack dog LUNGES for her.  The 
           force and the power of the beast is so vicious, that Everly 
           goes sliding across the wet floor.  Her head by the Dead 
           Man’s feet and GRENADES under the couch. 

           Doorman #2 leans against the doorway, arms crossed, holding a 
           handgun (should things get out of hand), enjoying the show.  

           The dog BARKS, CHOMPING monstrously at Everly.  She sees the 
           bathroom door squeak open.  Edith peaks out the crack.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                               (to Edith)
                        Don’t!
           Everly looks over at the Dead Man who has been stewing in his 
           own viscous juices for the last hour.  She pushes away the 
           attack dog with her feet.  

           Everly grabs the Dead Man’s LEG and drags him between her and 
           the dog, just as it ATTACKS AGAIN.

           The dog RIPS into the Dead Man, gleefully mauling his bloody 
           meat.  Everly takes the respite to GRAB one of the GRENADES 
           that was by the Dead Man’s feet and gets up.

           Doorman #2 frantically points at Everly --

                                 DOORMAN #2
                               (in Japanese)
                        No, Banzai!  Kill!  Banzai -- Kill!

           The dog stops flailing the corpse and looks over at Everly, 
           still clamped down on the Dead Man’s leg.  Everly PULLS THE 
           PIN on the bloody grenade as she shows it to the Dog, like 
           she’s gonna play catch with him.

                                 EVERLY
                               (waves grenade)
                        Banzai, Ball -- Ball!

           Once she sees the dog is locked onto the grenade, she throws 
           it over Doorman #2’s head and out the front door.  Before 
           Doorman #2 can react, the dog is already careening out the 
           door in hot pursuit.  He instinctively takes a step towards 
           the dog in the hallway, but it’s too late.

                                 DOORMAN #2
                        BANZAI!! --

           KA-BOOM! -- We hear the WILHELM SCREAM as the hallway wall 
           SHAKES and crumbles, revealing a GASH AT HEAD HEIGHT THAT 
           ALMOST RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE APARTMENT WALL, EXPOSING ITSELF 
           TO THE HALLWAY.  Smoke and ash billow out.

           Everly picks herself off the ground and tries to open the 
           bathroom door.  It’s locked.  She knocks on it.

                                 EVERLY
                        Open up.  It's okay.

           Edith cracks the door open.

                                 EDITH
                        It is?

                                 EVERLY
                        Relatively speaking.  We have to go.
           Edith gingerly opens the door and steps out with Maisey.  
           Maisey spots the mauled Dead Man and hugs into Edith’s leg.  
           Everly sees she’s upset and kneels down to her.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about your friend.  I 
                        don’t want you to be scared.  If 
                        you get afraid just close your 
                        eyes.  Okay?

                                 MAISEY
                               (closes eyes tight)
                        Okay.

           Maisey (with her eyes still closed) motions up at Edith 
           giving the universal “I wanna be carried” sign.  Edith picks 
           her up.  Maisey hugs into her closing her eyes.  Edith and 
           Everly share a look, then --

                                 EVERLY
                        C’mon.

           Everly looks over at the TV screen  She sees the GANG OF 
           YAKUZA FLUNKIES having a frenzied “storm the gates” pow wow 
           in lobby.  She gets the SUITCASE of money, a GUN and the 
           FINAL GRENADE.  Everly sees one of the Flunkies leave the 
           palaver to press the elevator button.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

                                 EDITH
                               (motions to Maisey)
                        Everly!

                                 EVERLY
                        Sorry.

           [WITH THE CAMERA STILL IN THE APARTMENT LOOKING OUT THE NEWLY 
           FORMED GRENADE WALL GASH]  The women head out the apartment 
           door into the hallway.   We watch them go down the hall 
           through the gash in the wall.  Everly sees the elevator 
           heading down from the 8th floor.  

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Watch out for the dog bits.

                                 EDITH
                               (to Maisey)
                        Honey, keep your eyes closed.

           Everly stops and knocks on the YOUNG LATINA’S DOOR.  No 
           answer.  Everly BANGS on it with desperation.
                                 EVERLY
                        I know you’re in there.  Please.  I 
                        need your help.
                               (nothing; MORE BANGING)
                        I’m begging you!

           Everly keeps eyeing the length of the hall as the elevator 
           goes down past the third floor.  She doesn’t like to be this 
           exposed, especially with her Mom and Maisey in tow.  After a 
           moment the Young Latina opens her door, the chain still in 
           place.  Everly sees the elevator hit the first floor.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Please help us.

                                 YOUNG LATINA
                        I can’t.

                                 EVERLY
                        They’re gonna kill my family if you 
                        don’t.

           The muffled sound of the rowdy Yakuza Flunkies piling into 
           the elevator in the lobby can be heard.

                                 YOUNG LATINA
                        I don’t wanna get involved.

                                 EVERLY
                        Please, just hide them.  They’re 
                        only after me.  They don’t even 
                        know they’re here.

           Everly sees the elevator starting to come up.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        They’re coming.  They’re coming 
                        now.

           The Young Latina looks at Maisey, clutching her Hello Kitty 
           doll for dear life while being held by Edith, terrified.  She 
           takes pity on her.

                                 YOUNG LATINA
                        Okay.  For the little one.
                               (to Maisey)
                        I like Hello Kitty too.

                                 EVERLY
                        Gracias.

           The Young Latina shuts the door.  A tense beat as the three 
           are left hanging in the hallway.  
           Then we hear her unchain the door and open it.  Edith and 
           Maisey go in.  Everly hands Edith the suitcase and a gun.

                                 EDITH
                        Wait?  What are you doing?

                                 EVERLY
                        They’re never gonna stop till they 
                        have me.

                                 EDITH
                        Everly --

           The elevator dings open just as Everly SHUTS THE DOOR on 
           Edith -- REVEAL TEN YAKUZA FLUNKIES all amped up on meth, 
           ready to rock n roll.  

           The one at the front sees Everly and grins.  This is gonna be 
           fun.  He doesn’t register the GRENADE Everly TOSSES AT THEM 
           till it’s to late.  They all look down at it, then up at her 
           in unison --

           KA-BOOM!! -- The grenade goes off in the elevator, PUREEING 
           ALL THE FLUNKIES INSIDE.  The elevator PLUMMETS.  The sound 
           of rended metal careens downwards, till we hear it hit bottom 
           with a gust of violence.  Dust billows up the shaft like the 
           scream from a monster’s gullet.

           Everly heads back into her apartment and CHECKS THE TV SCREEN 
           to see the elevator crashing out carnage.  Smoke and dust 
           fills the lobby.  

           ON THE TV SCREEN: In the lobby, a group of military looking 
           YAKUZA MERCS seem to be suiting up from various foot lockers.  
           This looks intense.  

           In the midst of the paramilitary operation, a SLIGHT MAN in a 
           cream cotton summer suit and matching fedora saunters in.  He 
           looks totally out of place in this milieu.  The Man appraises 
           the Mercs suiting up in full body armor, masks and goggles -- 
           preparing for a black-ops siege.

           The Slight Man looks up and points at the video camera as he 
           speaks to one of the Mercs next to him.  The Merc raises his 
           gun and SHOOTS OUT THE FEED.

                                 EVERLY
                        Fuck-bag.

           POP! -- All the power goes out.  The apartment is barely 
           illuminated by the hues of the street lights outside.  We 
           start to hear the ominous sound of men marching.  Everly 
           ducks out of frame as the sound grows louder and louder, 
           until it stops all together.
           In the darkness, through the wall gash, we begin to make out 
           RED SNIPER SIGHT LASERS PIERCING THROUGH THE BLACKNESS.

           A knock.  Then a beat...  Then -- BOOM!! -- 

           The door EXPLODES inwards into a million shards.  We see FOUR 
           YAKUZA MERCS with HEAVY DUTY SNIPER SIGHTED MACHINE GUNS in 
           full covert ops uniforms, covered head to toe, wearing night 
           vision goggles.

           The Mercs stalk through the shower water which is still 
           leaking out onto the floor, creating an apartment lake an 
           inch deep.  With military precision, they flank out, each 
           taking a quadrant.  

           In walks the Slight Man from the lobby -- THE SADIST (early 
           60’s).  He has rat like features.  A DRAGON’S TAIL TATOO 
           wraps around his neck, ending with the spike of the tail 
           etched onto his cheek.  A knife scar runs through the other.  
           The top of his hands are TATTOOED WITH DRAGON SCALES.  The 
           bottoms are scared with CHEMICAL BURNS.  He has long claw 
           like fingernails.  Two fingers on one hand have been fused 
           together from some sort of flesh burning accident.  In the 
           other he carries a LEASH that heads out the apartment, going 
           somewhere down the hall. 

           [THE SADIST ONLY SPEAKS IN JAPANESE UNLESS NOTED.] 

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Begin.

           And with that, the Mercs OPEN FIRE, absolutely shredding 
           everything in the apartment to bits.  They are packing heavy, 
           HEAVY artillery.  THE PICTURE WINDOWS BLOW OUT.  The sofa is 
           padding and sawdust.  The walls crumble and crack, exposing 
           support beams.  The Yakuza Mercs are efficient and brutal.  
           Nothing could survive this purging.  All the while, the 
           Sadist stands in the middle of them, admiring the effort.  

           INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two of the Yakuza Mercs KICK IN the bathroom door.  Their 
           laser sights go over the shower curtain.  One pulls it aside 
           to see the pile of dead bodies heaped on top of each other.  
           The shower still spraying down water, which is flooding 
           through the apartment.  Everly nowhere in sight.

                                 YAKUZA MERC #1
                               (subtitled in Japanese)
                        Clear.
           The two Mercs turn towards the door and head out.  Just then, 
           REVEAL EVERLY unwinding herself from the mountain of Yakuza 
           corpses in the tub.  She takes her gun and points it at the 
           last Merc -- 

           BLAM! 

           -- HEAD SHOT.  

           As the Second Merc turns, Everly SHOOTS HIM.  He crumbles to 
           the ground.  

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Everly comes FIRING OUT.  

           The Sadist doesn’t move.  He just watches -- a spectator to 
           the carnage.  

           Everly manages to hit the Third Merc with two out of three 
           shots.  He goes down, shooting up into the ceiling.  

           The Fourth and final Merc has her dead to rights.  He pulls 
           the trigger --  

           Click.  

           -- The Fourth Merc shot his load decimating the apartment.  
           He looks down at his empty gun, upset.  

                                 EVERLY
                        I know the feeling...

           As the Fourth Merc goes for another weapon, Everly SHOOTS 
           HIM.  The Sadist grins and claps, enjoying her handiwork.  

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Superb.

           Everly walks over to the Sadist, gun trained.

                                 EVERLY
                        Who are you?

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        I am truly sorry for you that our 
                        paths have crossed.  Though if it’s 
                        any consultation, I believe we will 
                        make beautiful art together.  If 
                        but for a brief moment.
                                 EVERLY
                        Huh?

           The Sadist brings his hand out of his pocket and smiles at 
           Everly.  He then BLOWS POWDER off his hand into her face.  
           Blinded, she stumbles around coughing.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        You may now enter my presence.

           In come FOUR ABNORMALLY LANKY YAKUZA CREEPS wearing Chinese 
           STRAW PEASANT HATS, demonic KABUKI MASKS and ORNATE SILK 
           KIMONOS -- each in a different primary color and each with a 
           different intricate design.  Their outfits are encased in a 
           CLEAR FORM FITTING SHRINK WRAP UNIFORM to preserve their 
           beauty.  They each have a CLEAR PLASTIC GUN BELT around their 
           waste with a PEARL HANDLED ANTIQUE PISTOL.  Albino hands with 
           abnormally long fingernails stick out from their sleeves.  
           The Creeps seem to glide around, but their feet are exposed, 
           showing the disgusting effects of Chinese foot binding. 

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese to Everly; 
                                subtitled)
                        Not to worry, the effects don’t 
                        last long.  Just gives me enough 
                        time to set up for our engagement.

           The Creeps swarm in like they’ve done this a million times.  
           One grabs Everly, who is too busy trying to breathe to put up 
           much of a struggle.  The other two grab the bed and drag it 
           to the center of the room.  The fourth and final Creep brings 
           in a HARD TRAVEL CASE and places it on one of the barstools.  
           All the while the Sadist hasn’t moved.  He’s just observing 
           her while holding his leash.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Bring her to me.  

           The Sadist grabs Everly’s face by the cheeks and turns it.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT'D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Let me see what I have to begin 
                        with.
                               (appraises Everly’s face)
                        Very good.  Very good.  Taiko has 
                        immaculate taste as always.
                               (to Creeps)
                        I approve.  She is worthy.
           The three Creeps bring Everly over to the bed and strap her 
           to the posts, spread eagle.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled to 
                                Yakuza Creep #4)
                        Let there be light.

           Yakuza Creep #4 talks into a walkie-talkie.  The power 
           sputters back on.  Everly’s apartment now looks like a 
           scorched Dresden bombing, circa World War Two thanks to the 
           Merc’s handiwork. 

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        And there was light...

           The Sadist takes one of the Dead Mercs and jams his claw-like 
           hand into a bloody exit-wound.  He then goes over and paints 
           the lights in the apartment red with the Merc’s blood, using 
           his bloody palm.  We hear the sizzling of the Sadist’s flesh 
           as he holds onto the bulbs and halogen lamps, getting a 
           release from his pain.  

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        To help set the mood.

           The room is now doused in a hellish red hue.

                                 EVERLY
                               (blinking; blinded)
                        What are you doing?

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Now, now.  Shhhhhh.  Shhhhhh.  We 
                        haven’t even started.  Nothing to 
                        be afraid of yet.  Save your 
                        strength.

           Everly SCREAMS.  She still can’t see.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        I know.  I know.  The powder is an 
                        irritant.  Your eyes will flush it 
                        out soon.  There -- there.  We all 
                        must live with pain.  Otherwise, 
                        how would we know we’re alive?

           And with that, the Sadist saunters over to Everly splayed out 
           on the bed.  She struggles to free herself, but her bonds are 
           too tight.  She has little to no wiggle room.  
           The Sadist goes to the post by her foot and WRAPS THE LEASH 
           AROUND IT.  Still DRAGGING THE LEASH he moves to the other 
           side, working his way around the bed, PULLING THE LEASH 
           ALONG, MAKING A TAUT X over Everly.  

           Once the Sadist heads back to her feet, we see what is being 
           dragged in on the other end of the leash.  It’s a BALDING, 
           PUDGY, SCHMOE OF AN ASIAN MAN (early 50’s) in CLOTH SUMO 
           UNDERWEAR and GLASSES.  He has various scars, nicks and road 
           rashes across his chest and arms.  He’s crouched into what 
           looks to be a giant, squeaky wheeled, GOLDEN BIRD CAGE.  His 
           head sticking out a hole in the top -- The Man looks like 
           he’d be a meager accountant or pediatrician, not involved in 
           this insanity.  

           By the time the Sadist saunters to the end of the bed, he has 
           pulled in the Man in the bird cage next to him.  Everly can 
           kinda blink what’s going on.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Please allow me to introduce 
                        myself.  You may call me...
                               (curtseys; then in perfect 
                                English)
                        The Sadist.

           The Sadist crouches down next to the Man in the birdcage, who 
           is looking around, not sure of what to make of all this.  He 
           just blinks rapidly and takes it all in.  He comes off a 
           tad... slow.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (back to subtitled 
                                Japanese)
                        And this is my...
                               (in perfect English)
                        Masochist.

           He smiles lovingly at Everly as he caresses the Masochist’s 
           head.  This is the creepiest thing ever.  Upon hearing his 
           name, the Masochist starts to go mental -- SCREAMING at the 
           top of his lungs.

                                 MASOCHIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        I AM A PIECE OF DOG SHIT.

           POW!! -- The Sadist PUNCHES the Masochist in the face, 
           sending the cage toppling over on its side.

                                 MASOCHIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        YES!  STEP ON ME! 
           The Sadist, sadistically STOMPS on the Masochist.

                                 MASOCHIST (CONT’D)
                               (satiated; in Japanese; 
                                subtitled)
                        AGAIN!  YES!  AGAIN!

           The Sadist composes himself after having released so much 
           sexual aggression.  A Yakuza Creep straightens out the 
           Masochist’s cage.

                                 MASOCHIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        NO!  I DON’T DESERVE TO BE RIGHTED.  
                        I AM AN ANIMAL IN HEAT.  A DEAD RAT 
                        FLOATING IN A SEWER OF PISS.

           The Sadist loses his shit again and maniacally STOMPS on the 
           cage.  He then flashes the Masochist a look and suppresses 
           his rage, forcing it through to a veneer merriment.  He 
           tidies himself after his outburst and softly pets his 
           Masochist.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        He’s still very innocent.  Really 
                        no more than a child.  Now 
                        apologize.

                                 MASOCHIST
                               (to Everly; subdued; in 
                                Japanese; subtitled)
                        My apologies.

           As Everly struggles against her restraints, the Sadist goes 
           over to the bar stool and opens up the hard case.  Inside are 
           rows of VIALS AND AMPOULES FILLED WITH MYSTERIOUS COLORED 
           LIQUIDS.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Like I said, I am an artist.  The 
                        world is my canvas.  
                               (motions to vials)
                        This is my paint.  
                               (points to her with fused 
                                fingers)
                        You shall be my brush tonight.
                               (picks up vial; in perfect 
                                English)
                        Sulfuric acid.
                               (picks another; in perfect 
                                English)

                                 THE SADIST (CONT'D)
                               (another; in perfect 
                                English)
                        Battery acid.
                               (yet another; in perfect 
                                English)
                        Sodium Hydroxide.
                               (back to subtitled 
                                Japanese)
                        And this one...

           The Sadist picks up a clear vial of liquid and walks over to 
           the bed.  Everly struggles harder to free herself.  He stands 
           over her from behind, looking down, amused at her futile 
           tenacity.  

           The Sadist opens the container, takes a plunger and hovers it 
           over her face.  Everly clenches her eyes shut, squirming her 
           head around, trying to avoid it.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Now, now.  We must help each other 
                        through this.  Do not fear.  Fear 
                        is a vessel of failure.  With our 
                        work here tonight.  I hope to make 
                        you more than “fear”.  
                               (to Creeps)
                        Hold her head.

           The Creeps come and hold her head in place.  Everly SCREAMS.  
           The Sadist squirts the contents of the plunger into one eye.  

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in perfect English)
                        H2O.

           He squirts another bit in her eyes to clear out the powder, 
           then takes out a handkerchief and delicately wipes them 
           clean.  Everly looks up at him, sneering down at her with his 
           rat like features.  The Sadist then drinks the rest of the 
           contents of the vial. 

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (to Masochist; in 
                                Japanese; subtitled)
                        Have you been a proud boy?  

                                 MASOCHIST
                               (like a child; in 
                                Japanese; subtitled)
                        NO!  NO!
                                 THE SADIST
                               (playful; in Japanese; 
                                subtitled)
                        Have you?

                                 MASOCHIST
                               (like a child; in 
                                Japanese; subtitled)
                        NO!

           The Sadist walks over to the Masochist and crushes the vial 
           in his charred fist.  We hear the sound of the glass 
           pulverizing, as blood drips from his hand.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (babying; in Japanese; 
                                subtitled)
                        Proud boys must be punished.

                                 MASOCHIST
                               (screams; in Japanese; 
                                subtitled)
                        I AM A PROUD BOY GONE BAD; LIKE  
                        SOUR MILK FROM AN ENGORGED UDDER.

           With his free hand, the Sadist YANKS BACK the Masochist's 
           side hair and MASHES the glass into his mouth.  The Masochist 
           struggles a bit before taking it in.  The Sadist is given a 
           piece of duct tape by one of his Creeps and places it over 
           the Masochist’s mouth.

           The Masochist struggles in sadistic glee and unbearable pain.  
           All the while the Sadist makes play eating “num, num” sounds

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        When you swallow it all you can 
                        talk again.  Then you will have 
                        something to be proud of.  Now let 
                        me create on another’s canvas.

           The Masochist nods in pain -- perhaps beginning the process.

           The Sadist turns his attention back to Everly.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Now where were we?
                               (walks back to bed)
                        Oh yes.  Fear.

           The Sadist climbs onto the bed -- LYING ON TOP OF THE TAUT X 
           HE CREATED WITH THE LEASH.  He HOVERS DIRECTLY ABOVE Everly, 
           looking down at her like the Cheshire Cat.
                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Such a pretty face to start with.  
                        But in the end... 
                               (shows bloody palm scars)
                        ...I will make it magnificent.

           Everly SPITS up onto the Sadist’s face.  He savors it.  
           Allowing the thick lugey to drop back down onto her.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Thank you.
                               (to Creep)
                        Show her my gratitude.

           Two of the Creeps take out TASER GUNS and shoot lines into 
           Everly’s side -- SHOCKING HER.  She JOSTLES around, being 
           ELECTROCUTED directly under the Sadist.  He lies on the “X” 
           above her, studying her struggle. 

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Enough.

           The Creeps, stop BUT LEAVE THE TASER LINES IMBEDDED INTO HER 
           SIDES.  The Sadist rolls off his perch and heads back over to 
           the case to pick out a vial.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        This one’s nasty stuff.  I usually 
                        like to work up to it.  Momentum.  
                        But you have spirit.  So consider 
                        this a taste of things to come.

           The Sadist comes over to Everly’s midsection.

                                 EVERLY
                        No.  Don’t.  Please.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Begging doesn’t become you, my 
                        dear.  Embrace the inevitable.

           The Sadist takes the plunger out of the vial and motions it 
           over Everly's body, taunting her with it.  The DROP 
           precariously eschewing out of the tip, only being held back 
           by the Sadists’s delicate pressure.  He finally puts a drop 
           on the restraint holding Everly’s hand.  It SIZZLES as it 
           BURNS THROUGH.
           Everly is FUCKING FREAKING.  The Sadist loves it.  He takes 
           another plunger full.

                                 EVERLY
                               (completely broken)
                        Please.  Please...

           The Sadist just smiles at her, then SQUIRTS it out on her 
           inner thigh.  Everly immediately begins to scream like she’s 
           being murdered.  Her jeans begin to smoke at the contact 
           point.  The jeans material MELTS and FUSES into the skin of 
           her inner thigh.  The Sadist watches her pain for a few 
           beats, then leisurely goes back to the case to pick out a new 
           torture liquid. 

           Just then, Mrs. Haberdash upstairs starts stamping on the 
           floor louder than she ever has.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (O.S.)
                               (muffled)
                        TRYING TO WATCH MY STORIES!!!

                                 EVERLY
                               (at the top of her lungs)
                        HELP!  HEL--

           In unison, the two Creeps on either side of her bed swarm in 
           and cover Everly’s mouth with their hands -- One on top of 
           the other.  Everly’s screaming now muzzled through their 
           albino skin.

           The Sadist brings his fused fingers to his lips and shushes 
           Everly.  

                                 MRS. HABERDASH
                               (muffled)
                        I’M FED UP!

           Everyone looks up at the bullet hole riddled ceiling.  The 
           Sadist goes over to the Masochist and unlocks his cage.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Pay our upstairs neighbor a visit.  

           The Masochist comes out of the cage awkwardly, ass first.  
           It’d be comical if it wasn’t so perverse.  Once out, the 
           Masochist stands before the Sadist.  

           The Sadist holds his shoulders, appraising him. 
                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        Have a story to tell when you 
                        return.

           The Masochist bows with honor before doing an about face and 
           scampering out of the apartment.  We hear him run down the 
           hall, up the stairs and back up the hall before knocking on 
           Mrs. Haberdash’s apartment door.

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (O.S.)
                               (muffled)
                        HUH?  I CAN’T HEAR YOU.

           We hear the door open -- then her screaming.  The Sadist 
           looks up as if listening to his child’s first piano recital, 
           nodding proudly at what’s transpiring, then -- 

           KA-BOOM!! -- The Sadist’s attitude changes.  

           Another KA-BOOM!! -- then --

                                 MRS. HABERDASH (CONT’D)
                               (muffled)
                        AL QAEDA!  AL QAEDA!

           The Sadist looks stymied, then to his Yakuza Creeps.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        I think I need a new
                               (English accent)
                        Masochist.

           BLAM!!  BLAM!! -- THE TWO CREEPS BEHIND THE SADIST ARE BLOWN 
           AWAY BY EDITH.  One’s Kabuki mask EXPLODES OUT, the other 
           timbers over like a felled red wood.  

           Edith shakily points the gun at the Sadist and pulls the 
           trigger, but he DEFTLY DODGES.  With heretofore unseen 
           agility, the Sadist goes over and PUNCHES Edith in the 
           throat.  She CRUMPLES to the ground.

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom!

           Everly struggles with her restraints.  The burnt bit by her 
           hand tears a little.  She pulls to help it along.  She eyes 
           the Creep standing over her and his GUN BELT (which is within 
           reach).

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        My sincerest apologies.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE SADIST (CONT'D)
                        This is most unprofessional.  I so 
                        wished for a perfect session with 
                        you.  I like the spirit, but it’s 
                        time to break that.

           One of the remaining two Creeps grabs Edith and holds her up.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        So...  This is your mother.  I see 
                        a resemblance.  The weariness 
                        around the eyes.  Well that makes 
                        sense then.  A mother will defend 
                        her cub to the death.  Cannot hold 
                        maternal instincts against someone.  
                        This is the basic weakness of man.  
                        We lack the compassion of 
                        nurturing.  It is an unfortunate 
                        truth for you both to experience 
                        with me.

                                 EVERLY
                               (very calm)
                        I know you can understand me.  If 
                        you touch her -- I will kill you.

           The Sadist waves her off, totally dialed in on Edith. 

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        This requires a delicate touch.  A 
                        splash of irony.  I have just the 
                        thing.

           As the Sadist goes window shopping through his vial 
           collection the woman desperately lock eyes.  

                                 EVERLY
                        Why did you come back?

                                 EDITH
                        You’re my daughter.

           Edith realizing what’s coming, takes this momentary respite 
           to say her peace.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Everly, I'm sorry I failed you.

                                 EVERLY
                        No.  You didn’t.  You were there 
                        for who needed it most.
                                 EDITH
                        I love you.

           The Sadist turns back with a container.  

                                 EVERLY
                        Mom!

           It doesn’t seem like the Sadist has heard a word they’ve 
           said. He goes over to Edith, but faces Everly.

                                 THE SADIST
                               (to Creep; in Japanese; 
                                unsubtitled)
                        Open her mouth.
                               (shows vial; in perfect 
                                English)
                        Drano.

           The Sadist GRABS EDITH’S THROAT, forcing her mouth open as 
           she struggles.  Everly cries out as THE SADIST POURS DRANO 
           INTO EDITH’S MOUTH.  The Creep clamps her nose as the Sadist 
           covers her mouth.  Edith struggles not to swallow.  Finally, 
           she has no choice.  The Sadist eases her into it.  She 
           SWALLOWS and the Creep lets go.

                                 EVERLY
                               (inconsolable)
                        MOM!!!

           The Sadist turns to savor Everly's reaction to watching her 
           mother die.  Edith starts to shake.  The Yakuza Creep holds 
           her up.  Her eyes look at Everly as she tries to croak out a 
           word before shutting down.

           The Sadist savors Everly’s anguish, as Edith slumps to the 
           ground.  Dead.  Spent.  He turns back to Edith, crouches down 
           and spoons her, listening to Everly’s woe as if it were a 
           lullaby. 

                                 THE SADIST
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        I love to feel the warmth leave the 
                        body.  The life essence exiting.  
                        It’s exquisite.

           As the Creeps study the Sadist, Everly makes one last 
           desperate go at her restraint -- IT GIVES.  She manages to 
           GRAB THE GUN out of the Creep’s belt and SHOOTS HIM POINT 
           BLANK IN THE GUT.  He falls over her.  His mask coming off 
           exposing his mouth and one eye have been sewn shut with 
           coarse black string.  
           The Creep by the Sadist SHOOTS, but hits the Dead Creep 
           slumped over Everly.  Everly sits up, aims and SHOOTS the 
           Creep in the chest three times.  

           Everly shoots off her other arm restraint as the Sadist comes 
           up over the bottom of the bed, curious, still basking in his 
           afterglow.  

           Everly SHOOTS him in the shoulder.  He twirls around on the 
           ground, crawling away through the vile blood filled water.  
           Everly undoes her feet and climbs off the bed dragging the 
           still embedded taser lines with her. 

           SHE’S GONNA KILL THIS MOTHERFUCKER!!!

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        The pain is so REAL.  The fear IS 
                        palpable.

           EVERLY GRABS A VIAL FROM HIS CASE AND POURS IT OVER THE 
           SADIST’S BACK.  It immediately leaves chemical burns through 
           his clothes.  

           The Sadist SCREECHES in orgasmic Christmas morning glee.  

           Everly KICKS him in the face -- He falls over.   His 
           chemically burnt back sizzles in the water.  

           She takes another vial.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (frightened pain; in 
                                Japanese; subtitled)
                        Which one is that?  Let me see -- 
                        Let me make sure you have the right 
                        one.

           The Sadist sees which one she has -- doesn’t like it.

                                 THE SADIST (CONT’D)
                               (in Japanese; subtitled)
                        No!  Too soon...

           He clenches his mouth shut, afraid.  Everly pulls him up by 
           his hair and opens the vial.  She POURS THE LIQUID OVER HIS 
           LIPS.  They immediately BUBBLE and DISSOLVE.  The liquid acid 
           corroding through his teeth -- She pours the entire contents 
           down his gullet.  

           The Sadist PUSHES Everly away, stands up and gulps.  He 
           convulses and looks afraid.

           A beat as they look at each other, then ---
           The ACID CASCADES OUT, BURNING THROUGH THE SADIST’S STOMACH. 
           Hollowed out, he falls to the ground.  FUCKING DEAD.

           Everly rushes to Edith’s prone form and holds her.  Kisses 
           her forehead.  Taking the time to simply hug her, something 
           she was never able to do when they were both alive.  The air 
           is thick with anguish, guilt and regret.  Till --

                                 EVERLY
                        Maisey...

           Everly places her mother down.  Gets up.  Looks around.  
           Picks up and STRAPS ON TWO MACHINE GUNS then walks out into 
           the hall, locked and loaded.  Her cell phone RINGS...

           A beat.

           Everly steps back into the apartment.  She goes over to her 
           cell on the bar and answers it.   

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        We’re not done yet, Fuck-mouth.

                                 TAIKO
                        No.  Not by a long shot.

           Unbeknownst to Everly, behind her, A LIGHT COMES ON IN ONE OF 
           THE WALL-SIZED WINDOWS IN THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET.  We 
           see a MAN’S SILHOUETTE walk into the lit frame.  He’s looking 
           at her.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry about your mother.  You 
                        know I take great pains to be 
                        proven a man of my word.  I would 
                        have made her death swifter, but 
                        these things can get messy in the 
                        heat of the moment.

           Everly pauses.  The hair on the back of her neck stands up.

                                 EVERLY
                        How did you know --

                                 TAIKO
                        You didn’t think I'd miss such a 
                        command performance. 

           Everly gets a sinking feeling.  She turns around and sees the 
           Man in the window in the building across the street -- TAIKO.

           They face each other -- a chasm apart.  
           Next to Taiko is a PLUSH CHAIR with a TELESCOPE STAND in 
           front of it.  A VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod points at her 
           apartment.  On the wall behind is a FLAT SCREEN TV, SHOWING A 
           CLOSE UP OF EVERLY thanks to the video camera.  It’s the 
           perfect perch for Taiko to play Emperor Nero and watch his 
           gladiators do battle.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Good to see you again, Everly.

                                 EVERLY
                        How long --

                                 TAIKO
                        All night.  Since the moment my men 
                        first came.  Its been impressive.  
                        I must say, worth the body count.

           Everly raises her machine gun.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t.

           A YAKUZA STORM TROOPER kneels down next to Taiko and aims a 
           COMPACT, SHOULDER LAUNCHED BAZOOKA at her. 

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (matter of fact)
                        I think mine’s bigger.

                                 EVERLY
                        It’s not the size.  It’s what you 
                        do with it.

           Everly hangs up the phone.  She watches Taiko laugh and come 
           over to his window.  He leans against it and redials.  Everly 
           looks at him and let’s her cell ring a couple of times before 
           answering it.

                                 TAIKO
                        That was rather rude.  Let’s focus 
                        on the business at hand -- The here 
                        and now.

                                 EVERLY
                        You mean where I blow your brains 
                        out?

                                 TAIKO
                        Violence doesn’t solve everything, 
                        Everly.  Just most things.
                               (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAIKO (CONT'D)
                        So your plan was to take my money 
                        and escape with your little girl 
                        and just disappear?

                                 EVERLY
                        Sounded good to me.

                                 TAIKO
                        Except for the part where 
                        everything unravels.  

                                 EVERLY
                               (re: collateral damage)
                        Does this look like I’m keeping it 
                        together?

                                 TAIKO
                        I meant the part where I tell you 
                        about the money.

           That shut her up.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Did you really think once I 
                        discovered you were selling me out 
                        to the DEA I would entrust you with 
                        anything of even the slightest 
                        value?  The money’s worthless.  A 
                        final present for the DEA to find 
                        with your desecrated carcass and 
                        your case handler’s severed head.  
                        About the only value that money has 
                        is as toilet paper.

                                 EVERLY
                               (rug out from under her)
                        You’re lying...

                                 TAIKO
                        Am I?

           Beat, as the truth hits Everly like a ton of bricks.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        You think I just woke up this 
                        morning and decided to exact 
                        revenge on a lark? 

           On Everly’s stunned silence.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        The expression on your face, even 
                        from this far makes it all worth 
                        it.
           Everly turns away from the window.  We see her wounded 
           trapped look.  She’s fucked.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        No reason to hide your true self at 
                        this late juncture.  When we’re 
                        done tonight, far worse will be 
                        etched on your face.  Know you 
                        endangered your mother and daughter 
                        for nothing.  Handed them right to 
                        me in fact.  

           Everly has to brace her hand on her knee.  She’s woozy.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        But we still have business to 
                        attend to you and I.  I seem to 
                        remember making you a promise about 
                        young Maisey.  And you know the 
                        lengths I am willing to go to to be 
                        proven a man of my word.

           Everly twirls around and FIRES the machine gun across the 
           street -- OBLITERATING TAIKO’S WINDOW and chair set up.  

           Taiko DUCKS out of sight.  

           The Yakuza Storm Trooper FIRES THE BAZOOKA.  It SOARS across 
           the street into the apartment.  

           Everly barely has time to register it before the apartment 
           gets NAPALMED.  

           The CONCUSSION FORCE BLOWS OUT what’s left of the apartment 
           walls.  The space is literally just beams and rubble.  

           The sprinklers pop on, pissing out the flames that are 
           licking what’s left of the remnants of the walls and support 
           beams.  At least two inches of water from the shower and the 
           sprinkler fill the entire space like a reservoir.

           [STILL LOOKING OUT FROM THE RUINS OF EVERLY’S APARTMENT] 

           Taiko throws down his cell phone in disgust -- Pissed at how 
           massive the explosion was.  The Bazooka Trooper realizes he 
           fucked up.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (shouts out across chasm)
                        EVERLY!  

           Nothing.  Taiko paces.  Mortified the Bazooka Trooper kneels 
           down.  He knows the price of failure in Taiko’s world.
                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (shouts out across chasm)
                        ANSWER ME!  

           Still nothing.  Taiko goes over and takes his SAMURAI SWORD 
           from its sheath.  The Bazooka Storm Trooper prepares himself 
           for Seppuku.

           Without hesitation Taiko SLICES OFF THE STORM TROOPER’S HEAD.   

           Taiko calls out again --

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        EVERLY!

           On one side of the frame, in the FG, we see EVERLY catching 
           her breath, hiding behind the kitchenette counter.  The 
           flames on the ceiling reflecting in the bloody gore water -- 
           creating an oily shimmering psychedelic kaleidoscope effect 
           on its slicked surface.  On the other side of the frame in 
           the BG, we see TAIKO looking into the apartment.

           Everly gathers herself and gets ready to make a run for a 
           machine gun lying out of the water on top of a prone Merc.  

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        WE’RE NOT DONE!

           Everly darts and SCOOPS up the machine gun.  She BOUNCES OFF 
           the far wall, before righting herself and FIRING into the 
           building at Taiko.  He ducks out of view between the windows.

           Everly continues shooting till she finishes the clip.  Taiko 
           walks back out into the window frame.  The sprinklers abate, 
           leaving spot fires around the apartment.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        FEEL BETTER?

                                 EVERLY
                               (mimes “can’t hear you”)
                        WHY DON’T YOU COME OVER HERE AND 
                        ASK.

                                 TAIKO
                        I PLAN TO.  SEE YOU IN A MOMENT.

           Taiko walks out of the building space in the BG.  The moment 
           he disappears, Everly starts looking for another machine gun.  

           We hear the sound of a SQUAD OF STORM TROOPERS MARCHING up 
           stairs with military precession.  The marching is coming from 
           the floors above and below.  
           It gets DEAFENING as its blunted precision comes to rest in 
           the apartments directly over and under her.  Then it stops, 
           suddenly...

                                 YAKUZA STORM TROOPER ABOVE (O.S.)
                               (muffled from above; 
                                subtitled in Japanese)
                        Ready!

           Everly looks up, standing in three inches of water amidst all 
           the bodies.  Then --

                                 YAKUZA STORM TROOPER BELOW (O.S.)
                               (muffled from below; 
                                subtitled in Japanese)
                        Aim!

           She looks down at the floor.  An extended eerie silence beat 
           of calm hits.  

                                 BOTH YAKUZA STORM TROOPERS (O.S.)
                               (muffled from ABOVE and BELOW; 
                                subtitled in Japanese)
                        Fire!

           Then... ANARCHY --

           PATTERNS OF MACHINE GUN BULLETS POP UP OUT OF THE WATER LIKE 
           A FOUNTAIN OF DEATH.  The Storm Troopers below SHOOT UP INTO 
           THEIR CEILING IN THE FAR RIGHT CORNER OF THE APARTMENT.  Dead 
           bodies floating in the water jostle about, pulsing up, 
           riddled with bullets.  

           Everly runs onto the bed.  The bullets thudding into the 
           bottom of the frame.  

           Then BULLETS START TO RAIN DOWN FROM THE CEILING IN THE FAR 
           LEFT CORNER of the apartment.  There’s nowhere to hide.  As 
           the flak systematically decimates the area in concert -- 
           North and south/east and west.  

           Everly eyes the picture windows.  It’s her only shot.  She 
           gets off the bed and staggers for them. 

           Everly’s being chased by the ricochetting bullet barrage 
           coming north and south that’s scourging her apartment.  

           Everly makes it to the window with the bullets hot on her 
           tail.  She just has time to turn and see the oncoming 
           onslaught, before she FALLS BACKWARDS OUT THE WINDOW to avoid 
           becoming shrapnel. 
           A beat, as we the audience collect ourselves and realize that 
           amidst the buzz saw of lead flying around, our heroine just 
           DROPPED OUT A FOUR STORY WINDOW.  DOLLY IN as debris and flak 
           whiz by, till we see EVERLY’S HANDS CLAMPED DOWN ON THE 
           WINDOW LEDGE.  She’s holding on for dear life.   

           WE SEE EVERLY HANGING OUT THE APARTMENT WINDOW FOUR STORIES 
           UP scrambling to find purchase with her feet.  Finally, the 
           unrelenting onslaught dies out.

                                 BOTH YAKUZA STORM TROOPERS (O.S.) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                               (muffled; subtitled in 
                                Japanese)
                        Prepare frontal assault.

           Everly struggles to pull herself back up into the apartment.  
           She kicks against the side of the building for leverage and 
           clambers back in.  

           The water is now draining down into the apartment below from 
           all the bullet holes shot up into the floor. 

           Everly goes over to one of the DEAD TATTERED YAKUZA MERCS.  
           She pulls off his GRENADE BELT.  She goes to a large hole in 
           the floor where most of the water is draining into.

           She grips the grenade belt in a loop and PULLS THE PINS on 
           all of them at once.

                                 EVERLY
                               (into floor)
                        Sayonara, Fuck Faces.

           She tosses the grenade belt into the hole as it swirls and 
           flushes down with the water into the apartment below.  We 
           hear Yakuza Storm Troopers startle.  Everly hops back onto 
           the tattered bed --

           KA-”FUCKING”-BOOM!!! 

           -- The remaining water SHOOTS UP all the way onto the ceiling 
           as the entire building jolts from the explosion.

           CU on Everly relaxed on the bed, almost post coital.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Hope it was good for you...

           We hear the sound of the Yakuza Storm Troopers gather 
           upstairs,  Everly grabs a machine gun.  The entire floor is 
           splinters, beams and floorboards.
           She listens to the ruckus of soldiers as they come down onto 
           her floor.  Everly, with her back to the picture windows has 
           both machine guns aimed at the front door.  If she’s going 
           out, she’s going out in a blaze of glory.  Then --

           PLUNK...PLUNK...PLUNK -- THREE SMOKE CANISTERS loft into the 
           apartment through the blasted out picture windows from the 
           street below.  YELLOW SMOKE USHERS OUT of them, completely 
           blanketing the area, creating an eerie sense of open space 
           through the billowing smoke.  

           PLUNK...PLUNK -- TWO MORE CANISTERS shoot in from the 
           hallway, completely enveloping the apartment in yellow 
           smog/smoke.  

           Light raining in from the bullet holes above and below, along 
           with the moonlight and street lamps from outside, create 
           German Expressionistic abstract spacial mazes in the smoke.

           What results is a DYNAMIC GUNFIGHT -- This entire action 
           sequence takes place following Everly in THIRD PERSON, 
           switching into and out of FIRST PERSON POV, like a living 
           breathing video game. 

           -- The Yakuza Storm Troopers enter into the apartment as 
           shadow wraiths.  

           -- Yakuza Storm Troopers grapple down through the picture 
           windows from above.   

           -- The gunplay in this scene is more exact -- more cat and 
           mouse.  It comes in single shots or spurts -- not melee.  
           It’s a hunt.

           -- The Storm Trooper’s assault rifle laser sights make 
           intersecting geometric patterns slicing through the smoke.  

           -- The Troopers move about the space using their assault 
           rifle sight beams to hunt for Everly.  It’s intense.  

           -- The crosscutting laser sights beams shift with the Storm 
           Trooper’s movement.  A terrifying reminder of the hunt, but 
           also an indicator of where Everly’s enemies are for her to 
           hunt.

           -- Everly runs out of ammo and has to use a knife to kill 
           some Storm Troopers as an homage to first person shooters.  

           -- Everly grabs the spike on the severed DEA agent head and 
           STABS it into one of the Storm Trooper’s.

           -- Everly ducks as the smoke reveals two storm troopers who 
           think they have a bead on her and fire.  Reveal with smoke 
           that they just shot each other.  
           -- Everly sets up a dead body that a Storm Trooper thinks is 
           her through the haze.  She sneaks up and stabs the Trooper in 
           the neck, his blood spraying out, hanging and mixing in the 
           yellow smoke, turning it orange.  

           -- EVERLY IS WOUNDED AGAIN.  A shot that really staggers her.  
           A signifier that we’re reaching the end.  

           AS THE SMOKE DISSIPATES we can begin to make out the 
           apartment’s outline through the haze.  The spot fires still 
           burning like beacon posts about the room.  The space has 
           literally become a portal to hell.  There’s no other way to 
           describe it.  Mars would be more hospitable.

           A WOUNDED YAKUZA STORM TROOPER sneaks up behind Everly and 
           grabs her, placing a KNIFE under her throat.

                                 WOUNDED YAKUZA STORM TROOPER
                               (in Japanese; unsubtitled)
                        Got her!

           Everly struggles, but the man is too powerful and the knife 
           too sharp.  A Yakuza Storm Trooper walks in the door, his 
           laser sight on Everly’s heaving chest.  Once he sees she’s 
           incapacitated, he motions out into the hall and heads in.  He 
           grabs one arm as the Wounded Trooper grabs the other.  All 
           three face the front door.

           In walks a BUILT MAN in a BLACK SUIT, its style should evoke 
           business samurai chic.  The man wears a GAS MASK and has a 
           SAMURAI SWORD strapped to his back.  He stands in front of 
           Everly, appraising her.  

           Meet TAIKO -- mid 40’s, modern day Samurai/Yakuza rouge.  
           Kill you in 3 seconds flat -- 1.5 if you have his full 
           attention.  

                                 TAIKO
                               (warmly)
                        Hello, Everly.

           THWAM!! -- Taiko KICKS Everly between her legs.  She falls to 
           the ground.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Cuff her to the bed and leave.

           The two Storm Troopers drag Everly to the bed, throw her on 
           it and cuff one hand to the top of the frame.  

           Taiko saunters around the apartment, checking out the 
           remnants of the mayhem as if he were antique shopping.  
                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        I love what you’ve done with the 
                        place.  Airy.

           A Storm Trooper goes to cuff her other hand.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Leave it.  I think the fight’s 
                        finally out of her.  

           Taiko takes off his samurai sword and then removes his top 
           coat, throwing it on a Yakuza Storm Trooper that Everly 
           stabbed into the wall -- using him as a coat rack.  

           The two Storm Troopers leave.  It’s just Everly and Taiko.  

           Everly struggles to breathe on the bed.  She looks over at 
           the bathroom and sees her original EXIT WOUND BLOOD BLAST, 
           which has been marking the passage of time for us.  THE 
           TENDRILS FINALLY REACHING DOWN TO THE FLOOR.  

           Everly looks at the FRESH GUNSHOT WOUND on her other side.  
           It’s much worse than the first.  Blood already soaking 
           through the mattress.  She doesn’t have long.

           Taiko faces her and finally takes off his gas mask.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (smiles)
                        And so it ends.

           Taiko UNSHEATHES the SAMURAI SWORD.  Its glimmering beauty 
           pristine in the moonlight of this decrepit hellhole.

                                 EVERLY
                        Not dead yet...

                                 TAIKO
                        No, not yet.

                                 EVERLY
                        Not for lack of trying either.

                                 TAIKO
                        You have been a revelation.

                                 EVERLY
                        I have my moments.  So that it?  
                        You gonna chop my head off?

           Taiko makes a HACKING motion to show just how expertly he 
           wields the blade.
                                 TAIKO
                        The thought had crossed my mind.

           Everly flops over the headboard frame she’s cuffed to and 
           rotates the bed around, trying to keep it in between her and 
           Taiko.  For his part, Taiko doesn’t seem to mind.  He just 
           continues stalking around her.  

           Everly goes to grab a hand gun that’s on the floor.  Taiko 
           pulls the other end of the bed towards him, dragging her away 
           from it.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (points sword at her)
                        We’ve played by my rules all night.  
                        We’re not going to stop now.

           Everly just stands there.  She’s not going to cower in front 
           of him.  She’s been through too much.  

                                 EVERLY
                        If you’re gonna do it.  Do it.

                                 TAIKO
                               (smiles; in good time)
                        You know this sword is worth more 
                        than this entire building.

                                 EVERLY
                               (looks around at ruins)
                        I believe it.

                                 TAIKO
                               (proudly displays sword)
                        A weapon of exquisite grace and 
                        cunning.  The perfect force of 
                        trauma to the human spirit.  A 
                        weapon so graceful it sings --
                               (slashes; we hear a WOOSH)
                        -- with every stroke.

                                 EVERLY
                        And here I thought it was just an 
                        extension of your penis.

                                 TAIKO
                               (hardly)
                        But I wouldn’t waste the dirty rag 
                        I would clean your blood off it 
                        with to give you the honor of death 
                        by its song.

           Taiko hurls the sword through the air, it WHIZZES BY and 
           STABS INTO a bit of wall at shoulder height behind Everly.  
           The blade sticking out.  Everly smiles, there’s one bullet 
           dodged at least.  Taiko smiles back.  He takes a WALLET FULL 
           OF SYRINGES out of his jacket and shows her.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        You lived as a junkie.  And you’ll 
                        die as one.

           GAME TIME.  Everly and Taiko play tug of war with the bed.  
           She’ll drag it a step back and to the right and he’ll pull it 
           two steps forward.  She’s too weak and he’s too powerful.  

           Taiko jumps onto the bed and KICKS Everly.  She falls to the 
           ground.  He pulls her up, flipping her over onto the bed with 
           him.  He PUNCHES her wound.  She can’t help but cry out in 
           pain.

           Taiko puts his knee over Everly’s free arm, kneeling on her, 
           pinning it down.  In this position Taiko’s head is at the 
           same level as his samurai sword.

           Taiko takes out the needle wallet and removes a SYRINGE.  
           Everly’s too faint from the punch and her injuries to put up 
           much of a fight.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what an airslip is, my 
                        dear?

           Everly looks.  There’s nothing in the syringe.  TAIKO STABS 
           IT INTO HER CAROTID ARTERY.  Everly SCREAMS like a wounded 
           animal.

                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                        An airslip is a particularly nasty 
                        way to die.  But poetic in your 
                        case and quiet frankly fitting for 
                        what a pain in the ass cunt burn 
                        you’ve been to me tonight.  What 
                        happens is I inject air into your 
                        blood stream and when it pumps 
                        through and reaches your heart it 
                        stutters -- killing you.  Rather 
                        painfully I might add.  Basically 
                        it’s inducing a series of heart 
                        attacks in rapid succession.  Trust 
                        me, it’s more painful than it 
                        sounds.

           Taiko PRESSES DOWN THE PLUNGER on the syringe, administering 
           the airslip.  Everly immediately writhes in pain as if she’s 
           being tortured.
                                 TAIKO (CONT’D)
                               (tender)
                        I want you to know, after I watch 
                        you die, I’m gonna scour this 
                        building for your daughter.  And 
                        then I'll tell her about my sword, 
                        right before I lob off her pretty 
                        little head.

           Everly struggles.  Taiko laughs at her agony.  

           Everly manages to free her arm that was pinned down.  

           She bucks Taiko off her a bit, to a point where she can 
           swivel her legs in front of him and KICK HIM IN THE CHEST --

           SLORSH!! -- There’s a stillness as both try to comprehend 
           what just occurred.  

           Taiko looks down --  

           WHY IS HIS SWORD IN FRONT OF HIM NOW?  

           -- The realization dawns on Taiko just as his CLEAVED head 
           ROLLS OFF his neck and shoulders.  

           Everly KICKS TAIKO’S HEADLESS CORPSE AWAY, watching as the 
           embedded blade drinks his blood -- dripping off the steel.  

           Everly struggles, then realizes it’s useless.  She’s dying.  
           She tries to come to grips with it.  The fear and anguish 
           riddled on her face.  Each breath a torturous struggle.  Till 
           finally...

                                 EVERLY
                        Maisey...

                                                        CUT TO TITLE CARD:

                                        10 MINUTES AGO

                                 YOUNG LATINA (V.O.)
                        Get in the closet!

           The insanity of the Yakuza Storm Trooper gunfight’s audio 
           shreds through the title card.

           [FROM THIS POINT ON EVERYTHING IS FROM MAISEY’S EYE LEVEL.  
           WE’RE IN MAISEY’S WORLD AND HOW SHE SEES THINGS NOW -- LARGER 
           THAN LIFE.  THIS IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THE CAMERA IS LEAVING 
           THE CONFINES OF THE APARTMENT.]
           INT. YOUNG LATINA’S SHOT UP APARTMENT - CLOSET - NIGHT

           Audio cut to the shots chipping away in the closet -- 

           REVEAL BULLETS RIDDLING THE YOUNG LATINA.  Maisey SCREAMS 
           next to her, protected by the suitcase barricade of worthless 
           money -- flak ripping into its side.  

           The Dead Latina slumps over on top of Maisey, crushing down 
           on her.  The Latina’s hand limp on Maisey’s head.

           Maisey cries out, struggling to free herself from under the 
           weight.

                                                        CUT TO TITLE CARD:

                                            MAISEY

           INT. YOUNG LATINA’S SHOT UP APARTMENT - LATER

           Things have quieted down a bit.  CU on the closet door as 
           Maisey finally manages to get it open and tumbles out onto 
           her stomach with her Hello Kitty Doll as a cushion.  The Dead 
           Latina topples out behind her. 

           Freaked, Maisey gets up, clutching the doll and looks around.  
           It’s like a living nightmare.

                                 MAISEY
                               (calls out)
                        Hello?  ...Hello?  ...Grams?

           Maisey’s trying to be a brave girl, stifling back tears.  She 
           slowly makes her way to the front door.

                                 MAISEY (CONT’D)
                        Help!  Please...  Help!

           Maisey just looks at the big forboding door.  She turns and 
           looks back at the Dead Latina.  She’d rather take her chances 
           out there.  

           Maisey twists the knob, opening the door.  She steps back as 
           she looks in the hallway.  There’s vague gore and carnage and 
           lingering dust from the yellow smoke bombs.  It looks like 
           another world out there.

                                 MAISEY (CONT’D)
                               (remembers; to herself)
                        Just keep your eyes closed if 
                        you’re afraid.
           SINGLE CAM SHOT -- Track Maisey as she CLOSES HER EYES and 
           heads out into the decimation of the hallway back towards 
           Everly’s apartment.  She clutches the Hello Kitty for dear 
           life and waves her free hand in front of her, so she doesn’t 
           bump into anything.  

           The trek is slow and arduous.  She trips over a dead Yakuza’s 
           ankle, but catches her balance -- NEVER OPENING HER EYES.  
           Her fear palpable.  She continues to walk forward towards 
           Everly’s apartment TILL HER HAND TOUCHES A MAN’S THIGH.  She 
           stops.

                                 MAISEY (CONT’D)
                               (eyes shut)
                        Hello...?

           REVEAL THE MASOCHIST.  He’s severely nicked up, carrying a 
           BLOODY MEAT CLEAVER.  Duct tape still over his mouth, 
           chipmunk puffed, glass shard cheeks.  

                                 MAISEY (CONT’D)
                               (eyes shut; really scared)
                        Please...

           The Masochist swallows the glass and removes the duct tape.  
           As he speaks, his voice sounds appropriately like he just 
           swallowed a mouthful of glass.  HE SPEAKS IN PERFECT ENGLISH. 

                                 MASOCHIST
                        It’s okay, little girl.  Open your 
                        eyes.  Don’t be afraid.

           Maisey does.  She sees him -- startles and IMMEDIATELY SHUTS 
           THEM AGAIN, desperately clutching her Hello Kitty into her 
           like a shield.  The Masochist lovingly laughs, how cute.  He 
           raises the meat cleaver over his head, ready to hack Maisey 
           in half.

                                 MASOCHIST (CONT’D)
                        Your mother’s a --

           KA-BOOM!!! -- REALLY GREAT FUCKING SHOT!!  

           The Masochist BANKS OFF the wall from the shot’s momentum -- 
           falling DEAD beside Maisey.  

           REVEAL EVERLY STILL CUFFED TO THE BED, holding a SMOKING GUN 
           halfway out of her apartment archway.  She dragged the bed 
           frame to the door.  

           Once we register it’s her, she COLLAPSES to the ground.  Her 
           cuffed hand pathetically dangling -- holding her up.  She’s 
           dying.
                                 EVERLY
                               (looks at Maisey)
                        It’s okay.  It’s over.  You can 
                        open your eyes now.

           Maisey shakes her head “no”.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t blame you.  I promise, 
                        you’re safe.  I’m not gonna let 
                        anything happen to you.

           Maisey opens her eyes and sees Everly.  They take each other 
           in.  The sound of SIRENS, AMBULANCES and FIRE TRUCKS pull up 
           outside.

           We hear a stand off/commotion in the BG walla coming from out 
           front of the building.

                                 DEA AGENT (O.S.)
                        DEA!  Put your hands behind your 
                        head and get on the ground.

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        But we’re police.

                                 DEA AGENT (O.S.)
                               (forceful)
                        DOWN!  NOW!

                                 EVERLY
                               (beckons with free hand)
                        Come here.  Wait with me.

           Maisey tentatively comes over to her.  Everly struggles to 
           look up.  Her breathing is pronounced.

                                 MAISEY
                        I know who you are.

           Tears stream out of Everly, uncontrollably.

                                 EVERLY
                               (kills her)
                        You do?

                                 MAISEY
                        I have your picture in my room.

                                 EVERLY
                               (almost too much to speak)
                        That makes me so happy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVERLY (CONT'D)
                               (trying to breathe through 
                                sorrow of this loss)
                        Take my hand.

           Maisey looks down at Everly’s hand, then after a beat takes 
           it.  Note the size difference.  Where Everly’s hand is 
           bloody, battered and gnarled (the duct tape rings wrung, 
           exposing her wounds from the Zelda bite) Maisey’s are clean, 
           young and pure.

                                 MAISEY
                        Why did you leave?

           Everly knows Maisey is too young to hear the truth.  This is 
           the hardest thing she’s ever had to do -- letting go just as 
           she’s meeting her daughter for the first time.

                                 EVERLY
                        I had to do what was best for you 
                        and that was living with Grams.  
                        But not a day went by.  Not an 
                        hour.  Not a minute, that I didn’t 
                        think about you.  I’ve been walking 
                        around with a hole in my heart for 
                        so long and just seeing you has 
                        filled it.  Know I love you always 
                        and forever.

                                 MAISEY
                               (wants to believe)
                        Always and forever.

           Maisey turns as she hears the DEA come up the stairs.

                                 DEA SWAT AGENT (O.C.)
                        Clear!

                                 EVERLY
                               (knows this is it)
                        It’s gonna be okay.  Look at me.

           Everly gazes at her daughter with her dying breath.

                                 EVERLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be --

           Everly’s expression doesn’t change, she just stops speaking.  
           Holding Maisey’s hand -- LIFELESS.

                                 DEA SWAT AGENT (O.C.)
                        Over here!  There’s a little girl.

           Maisey doesn’t react.  She just looks down at her mother.  
           The realization of loss and sorrow on her face is crushing.
           A DEA SWAT AGENT and EMTs rush to Maisey.

                                 EMT #1
                        Are you hurt?

                                 DEA SWAT AGENT
                        She’s in shock.

                                 EMT #2
                        Get her out of here.  

           The DEA SWAT Agent picks up Maisey, BREAKING HER GRASP ON 
           EVERLY.

                                 MAISEY
                               (anguish)
                        MOM!

           Maisey reaches out crying for her mother as the EMTs 
           frantically work to save Everly.  They can tell it’s a lost 
           cause, but there’s an urgency to try for the kid.

                                 EMT #1
                        Get me three hundred cc’s of eppi 
                        and prep the paddles.

           Follow the DEA SWAT Agent hugging Maisey as he guards her 
           head into his shoulder to protect her from the horror show 
           all around.  DEA SWAT members fan out, clearing areas on the 
           floor.  

                                 EMT #2
                               (hands bore needle)
                        Here!  
                               (turns to paddles)
                        Charging.

           As we track down the hall with Maisey -- we see EMT #1 
           prepares to stab Everly in the heart with a BORE NEEDLE and 
           inject the adrenaline in the BG.

                                 EMT #1
                        C’mon, lady.  Fight!

           ON MAISEY: As she’s whisked off the floor and into the 
           stairwell past fire and police personnel on their way up.  
           She holds onto the DEA SWAT Agent with one hand, the Hello 
           Kitty Doll bouncing off his back in the other.  

           They go down the stairs, out the lobby, then FINALLY OUTSIDE  
           -- THE SUN RISING.  Police cars, fire trucks and ambulances 
           parked around out front.  
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN

           Finally Maisey and the audience are given a chance to breathe 
           after the suffocating confines endured in the apartment.  

           OFF MAISEY -- emotionless, looking up to the bright sky, a 
           world of possibilities, as we --

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

                                            EVERLY
