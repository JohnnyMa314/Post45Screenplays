           We're CLOSE on a DOOR LOCK. Specks of dust cling to 
           darkened wood.

           Swiftly, purposefully, a GLOVED HAND swoops in, a THIN 
           ROD clutched between the fingers.

           The rod slides into the keyhole. A few quick movements. 
           And, just like that, the door is UNLOCKED.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. JEFFERSON AUTO BODY SHOP - LOS ANGELES - MORNING

           CLOSE on another GLOVED HAND. Tinkering with something. 

           We’re elsewhere. Underneath a CAR. It’s dark here, oil 
           drips glistening. A MAN rolls out, auto mechanic uniform, 
           covered in grime. Rises to his feet. Bends his neck back. 
           Crack.  

           This is HARRY NOVAK. 28, but looks like he’s weathered 
           ten years more. 

           We’re in an AUTO SHOP, late-morning bustle...

                                 HEAD MECHANIC (O.S.)
                        You! New guy! Oil gauge on three!

           Harry springs off his gloves, reaches into a pocket, 
           checks a watch. Nope. Time to go.  

                                 HARRY
                        Can’t do it. Remember?

           The HEAD MECHANIC -- old-timer, sardine-thin, seated in a 
           booth -- checks his own clock. Annoyed. It’s 11:56am. 

           EXT. AUTO BODY SHOP - LOS ANGELES - MOMENTS LATER

           High-end BMW’s and polished hybrids rolling into the shop 
           -- and a beat-up grey Pontiac rolling out. 

           This one is Harry’s car. Rusted chrome and battered 
           fender. It SPEEDS away, a wreck, tires screeching. 

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Harry unzips his uniform with one hand, drives with the 
           other. One eye on the road, the other on the time. 

           If he floors it he won’t be late... 
           EXT. YMCA - LOS ANGELES - MORNING

           A battered YMCA opens its doors, and a flood of YOUNG 
           KIDS exit, carrying towels and bathing suits. We're in 
           East L.A. Palm trees, graffiti.

           A FOUR YEAR-OLD GIRL steps out, hand held by an 
           INSTRUCTOR. The girl’s name is SOPHIE and she’s got -- 
           brown hair, green eyes, tie-dyed shirt and jeans, pink 
           stud earrings, birthmark on the left side of her neck.  

           The Instructor turns to round up a few of the other kids. 
           PARENTS are parked at the curb. Sophie is, for a moment, 
           on her own. 

           No one watching her...

           SUDDENLY -- an arm REACHES IN through the crowd. Burly, 
           tattoo, track marks near the wrist. About to GRASP 
           Sophie’s shirt. 

           SPINNING around--

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Woah -- who are you??

           It’s HARRY. Flustered. His uniform off. 

                                 HARRY
                        Harry Novak. I’m -- I’m the father.

           At the sound of his voice, Sophie spins around and beams--

                                 SOPHIE
                        Daddy!!

           Lighting up with a loving grin--

                                 HARRY
                        Queen Sophie!

           He wraps his arms around her.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                                 (uneasy)
                        Ok... Normally Katie takes the kids out 
                        front... Sorry...

                                 HARRY
                        No problemo. How she doing? She a regular 
                        Michael Phelps out there?

                                 KATIE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Novak!
           Harry turns. KATIE -- the other instructor, a hard-ass -- 
           has marched to their side.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        An hour. A full hour we’ve been trying to 
                        call you. 

                                 HARRY
                        Excuse me?

                                 KATIE
                        Her lesson ended one hour ago.

           Harry senses Sophie next to him. Motions for Katie to 
           wait, lifts Sophie up in his arms and carries her to his 
           Pontiac, parked just a few yards away.  

           Slips her in and turns back to the INSTRUCTORS...

                                 HARRY
                        An hour? But it’s...it’s noon, isn’t it?

                                 KATIE
                        The lesson ended at eleven.

                                 HARRY
                        Eleven... Look, I’m sorry, I fucked up 
                        the time--

           They flinch at his language. He notices.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        --but...could you...inform me of her 
                        swimming...I mean, how it’s going...?

                                 KATIE
                        I can inform you that if you don’t pay 
                        your balance there won’t be any more 
                        swimming.

                                 HARRY
                        I thought I had ‘til the end of the 
                        month...

                                 KATIE
                        The end of the month was yesterday, Mr. 
                        Novak.

           A moment. He nods. Humiliated. 

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        And in case you didn’t notice, she’s 
                        sitting in an unlocked car right now with 
                        no one watching her.
           He turns. Glares back at Katie. Knows what she’s 
           implying. Her whole way of looking at him says it all 
           anyway: You’re not fit to be a father. 

                                 HARRY
                                 (pissed, hurt, holding it in)
                        Thanks for pointing that out. I 
                        appreciate it.

           He heads back to his Pontiac. Feels the eyes on him. 
           Slides in, starts up, in a hurry to get away...

           EXT. HARRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           An even poorer part of L.A. A graffiti-stained bus stop, 
           unkempt shrubbery lining the sidewalks, music blaring 
           from an opened window.

           Harry's Pontiac rolls to a stop. He gets out, hurries 
           around to Sophie's side, opens her door.

                                 HARRY
                        Your Majesty...

           She giggles, takes his hand, steps out.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           A ratty four-story complex from the seventies. Harry digs 
           into a MAIL SLOT, pulls out a wad of ENVELOPES...

           INT. ELEVATOR - APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry stands by Sophie's side as the elevator crawls up. 
           Flips through the envelopes. Most of them look like 
           bills. Gas, water, phone. Headings like “CERT WATER” and 
           “T-MOBILE RED PLAN”.

           Each seems to further weigh down his features. He rips 
           one open, pulls out the letter. We can read a fragment: 
           “...inform you that your payment of $1,091.28 for the 
           period 4/12/09-5/12/09 is now overdue. You may request a 
           copy of your records if...”

           Harry takes a moment. Then, slowly, he folds the letter 
           back up. 

           He catches Sophie looking at him. Turns to her. Manages a 
           smile.
           INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry reaches a door. Keeping up appearances for Sophie--

                                 HARRY
                        The Queen’s palace!

           Leans in to open the door, when...

           His eyes land on the door's edge. It's off.

           Perplexed, Harry gently eases against the door. It slides 
           OPEN... Did he forget...?

           INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Cautiously, his breaths quickened, Harry steps in... 
           Gropes for the light switch...

                                 HARRY
                        The hell...?

           The light flicks on -- revealing broken lamps, overturned 
           chairs and tables, opened drawers and pantries...

           Harry's eyes go wide. His keys fall to the floor. Sophie 
           is visibly confused.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What happened, Daddy?

           Harry spins around to face her. Trying to think...

                                 HARRY
                        Uh... Just... Stay here. Don’t move.

           He races to the nearest closet, opens it, grabs a 
           BASEBALL BAT. Moves forward, eyes peeled...

           Hurries into a BEDROOM, bat held high. Old swimming 
           medals hanging from the walls. Drawers have been opened 
           here, too.

           Harry beelines to one, reaches in. A small JEWELRY BOX -- 
           just a few rings and a single wedding band -- sits next 
           to a dozen pairs of socks.

           He heads back toward the nearest shelf. A line-up of 
           medals, seemingly untouched. And, on the desk, his 
           COMPUTER.

           His brow arches. It's all there... 
           He hurries back down the hall, peers into the LIVING 
           ROOM... A SMALL TV sits atop a counter.

           Harry moves toward it. Pulls it out. Inspects it. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        What’s wrong with the TV, Daddy?

                                 HARRY
                        Nothing... Nothing...

           He doesn’t get it. Keeps moving. Slips into the BATHROOM. 
           Opens the MEDICINE CLOSET. Rows of pill bottles, all in 
           place.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s all here...

           He steps out. Confused. Drops the bat. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        They didn’t take anything...

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who’s they?

           Distracted, Harry whips out his CELL. Begins to dial: 9- 
           1--

           The LANDLINE RINGS. Harry jumps. Turns. Races to it.

                                 HARRY
                        Hello??

                                 VOICE
                        Yeah, this is Anthony Cardullo at R&P 
                        Auto. This Harold Novak?

                                 HARRY
                                 (what is this?)
                        Yes...??

                                 VOICE
                        I’m interviewing for a mechanic, full-
                        time. I called up Jefferson and a guy 
                        there slipped me your app. Said you were 
                        looking for that kind of gig?

           Beat. Harry stops. The words hit him, out of left field.

           With a changed tone-- 

                                 HARRY
                        Uh... Yeah... Yeah, I definitely am...
                                 VOICE
                        Good. Would you be available to come in 
                        today? I gotta fill the slot this week. 
                        Say 1:30?

           Harry takes a moment. Still panting, trying to juggle his 
           thoughts. Looks at his cell. The numbers “9” and “1” 
           dialed...

                                 HARRY
                        Uh... 1:30...

                                 VOICE
                        I’ve been calling all day. Union’s 
                        breathing down my neck. All goes well 
                        you’d be starting Friday.

           Beat. Harry hesitates. Looks around. The mess... His 
           daughter at the doorway... Things are happening too 
           quickly...

           But then his eyes land on the ENVELOPES... The BILLS...

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Novak...?

           Beat.

                                 HARRY
                        1:30’s perfect.

                                 VOICE
                        Good. Nebraska and 3rd. 

           Harry grasps for a POST-IT and a PEN. Scribbles down 
           “NEBRASKA AND 3rd”.

                                 HARRY
                        Got it. I’ll be there.

           He hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Looks Sophie in the 
           eye. 

           Takes another moment to collect himself. And then, his 
           voice brighter now, a sense of hope overshadowing 
           everything else--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        We’re taking a trip.

           He looks down at his note -- and all of a sudden, the 
           apartment doesn’t seem so important...
           He pulls the door open, feels his pockets, remembers his 
           keys. Spots them on the floor. Kneels down to pick them 
           up.

           Then stops. Befuddled again...

           He leans in. Examines the floor. Touches it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Daddy...

                                 HARRY
                        Sorry... It’s just... I don’t get it... 
                        Almost looks like it’s been...cleaned...

           He looks at his cell. 12:47. The clock is ticking. He 
           takes another breath, hurries Sophie out, as WE MOVE IN 
           CLOSER TO THE CARPETED FLOOR...

           Sure enough, up close, there’s not a stray speck to be 
           seen. The carpet is SPOTLESS. 

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - DAY

           Remnants of McDonald’s piled into a bag. The car careens 
           down the road. Harry is full of anticipation. Next to 
           him, Sophie chows down the last bits of a Happy Meal. 

                                 HARRY
                        Eat up. Phelps eats like a champ.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who’s Phell’s?

                                 HARRY
                        Phelps. Michael Phelps. You know this.
                                 (then,)
                        Don’t worry about back there, sweetie. 
                        This works out we’ll move to a better 
                        neighborhood. How d’you like the sound of 
                        that? 

           She shrugs. Doesn’t mean much to her. He checks the car 
           clock. 1:15. Speeds up some more...

           EXT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car ascends a ramp... Merges onto the 405 South...

           Only to slow nearly to a halt. 
           INT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Harry gazes forward. 

           Up ahead is a HUGE TRAFFIC JAM.

           A sea of motionless cars extending as far as the eye can 
           see. Exhaust fumes billowing. Horns blaring. Drivers 
           shouting. A pure L.A. nightmare.

                                 HARRY
                        No...

           Fearing what this might mean, he checks the car clock 
           again. 1:17.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit...

           Beat. A moment of silence, as though the air had been 
           sucked out of the car.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m ugly...

           Harry turns to her. She’s staring at her reflection in 
           the visor, scratching at the birthmark on her neck.

                                 HARRY
                        What’re you talking about? You’re 
                        beautiful... You look like your Mommy.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No... I’m ugly. And my home is ugly.

                                 HARRY
                        Did someone call you that today? That’s 
                        what L.A. kids do, you know.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Sarah says her daddy reads books to her.

                                 HARRY
                        Who’s Sarah?

                                 SOPHIE
                        A girl.

                                 HARRY
                        I can read you books... If you want...

                                 SOPHIE
                        Sarah’s mommy picks her up from lessons.
                                 HARRY
                        Well... You know your Mommy would’ve 
                        loved to pick you up...

                                 SOPHIE
                        How do you know she went to Heaven?

           Harry glances again at the cars ahead. The mid-day sun 
           beats down on the windshields and asphalt.

           This is one of those conversations he does not want to 
           have right now.

                                 HARRY
                        ‘Cause I know. Daddy knows these things. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I saw a picture of Mommy and me in your 
                        room. She looked sad.

           Harry looks at her.

                                 HARRY
                        What were you doing in Daddy’s room?

           She doesn’t answer.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie, answer me when I ask you a 
                        question. 

           No reply. Agitated, both by her and by the traffic--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie, it’s rude not to answer someone 
                        when they’re talking to you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Katie called you a bad name today.

                                 HARRY
                                 (sotto)
                        Katie’s a bitch.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What’s a bitch?

           Harried, fed up--

                                 HARRY
                        It’s a... It’s a dog that’s a girl.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Do you have lots of pictures of Mommy?
                                 HARRY
                        That’s enough talking about Mommy, ok? 
                        Eat your fries, they’ll get cold...

           He looks left, at the nearest lane. The lane beyond it is 
           moving. He’s agitated, restless.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Come on...

           EXT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The Pontiac inches out. Amid honking, it slices its way 
           into the moving lane -- which promptly grinds to a stop.

           Harry’s tiny car is now bordered by big SUV’s and vans. 
           He can’t see either end of the highway. It’s a forest of 
           vehicles. 

           No exit.

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Back inside. Harry looks at his clock. 1:27. Lets it out.

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Did Mommy say bad words?

                                 HARRY
                        Enough about Mommy!

           Beat. He looks at her. Immediately regrets snapping. 
           Shifts his wheel to the left. The next lane over is 
           starting to budge.

           But there’s no entry-point. One car after another blocks 
           him off. Big cars -- mini-vans and pick-up trucks.

           He looks to his right. Standstill. A white mini-van. 
           SMILEY-FACE STICKER posted on the back-seat window.

           More honking. Harry looks forward. There’s some movement 
           up ahead, but it’s just beyond the car in front -- a 
           small blue Toyota that hasn’t moved an inch.

           Then -- the Toyota’s door swings open. The driver -- a 
           schlumpy KID in his early twenties, a few years younger 
           than Harry -- steps out. 
           Horns blare. Drivers curse.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Come on! Get in your car!

           The Kid is frazzled, harried. Moves over to the front of 
           his automobile. Lifts up the hood. Closes it. Has no idea 
           what he’s doing.

                                 ANOTHER DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Goddamnit...

           More horns. Harry’s glare softens. He watches the Kid -- 
           shaking, out of his element. He seems to suddenly feel 
           for him. Maybe the Kid reminds him of himself...

           He turns to Sophie. Gently--

                                 HARRY
                        Stay here, kiddo. 

           She doesn’t look at him. She’s angry. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Hey... Your Majesty...?

           She’s still angry. He gives up, steps out.

           EXT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Winces in the sunlight. Approaches the Kid. The horns are 
           deafening now.

                                 KID
                        I -- I’m --

                                 HARRY
                        It’s ok. What’s the problem?

                                 KID
                        I don’t know, it started making these 
                        noises...

                                 HARRY
                        New car?

                                 KID
                        Two days...

           Harry moves over to the hood. Reaches in, takes a look. 
           Catches a glimpse of Sophie, still in her seat, looking 
           glum.
                                 HARRY
                        You got a...wrench...? Bottle opener...?

                                 KID
                        Bottle opener.

           He pulls out a SWISS ARMY KNIFE. Hands it to Harry, who 
           finds the bottle opener, reaches back under the hood.

                                 HARRY
                        Carburator. Cable’s loose. 

           He hooks the bottle opener around the cable. Twists.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        That should do it.

                                 KID
                        God... Thank you so much.

           Harry nods. Closes the hood, hands the Kid back the 
           knife. 

           The Kid gets in. Key in the ignition. The car starts.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Come on, man! Get back to your car!

           Harry turns. Heads back to his Pontiac.

           Then FREEZES.

           His front passenger seat is empty.

           He takes a few steps further. Leans in through the 
           window. Glances behind at the back-seat. 

           No Sophie.

           More annoyed than anything else--

                                 HARRY
                        You gotta be kidding me...

           He starts pacing around the vehicle. Amid the roar of the 
           horns--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie!

           He traces a full circle around his car. No Sophie. He 
           stops. He’s confused. Where could she have gone?
           He looks back inside. Pokes his head in, checks under the 
           seats. His daughter is nowhere to be seen.

           He looks around. Just the cars and the road.

           Beat. He’s bewildered. And, sure enough, his irritation 
           is fading -- replaced by something else... 

           A gnawing sense of dread...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie...

           A tremor in his voice now, the color rapidly fading from 
           his cheeks, Harry spins, his eyes darting to and fro.

           All around him are cars. White Hondas and black Saturns. 
           Green pick-ups and beige sedans. 

           He spins back. His heart in his throat--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie!

           He starts running. Running from one lane to the next, 
           past one motionless car after another.

           Almost steps into a moving lane. A mad flurry of honks. 
           And more angry drivers yell:

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Get back in your car, asshole!

           Harry staggers back. His hand to his forehead, his eyes 
           throbbing, his whole body shaking...

           This can’t be happening.

                                 HARRY
                        Sophie... Sophie...

           He bends down, his eyes scouring the asphalt. Is she 
           hiding somewhere?

           No sight of her. He shoots back up, his eyes roaming 
           again. Hurries to the nearest car. Pounds on the DRIVER’S 
           window.

                                 DRIVER
                        Look buddy, would you get--

           Spitting out words like a madman--
                                 HARRY
                        Have you seen -- have you seen a girl? A 
                        little girl? Brown hair--??

                                 DRIVER
                                 (not listening)
                        We’re all trying to get a move on here, 
                        buddy, so why don’t--

           The clock in his mind ticking, Harry races forward -- to 
           the next car over. An OLD WOMAN behind the wheel.

                                 HARRY
                        A little girl -- have you seen a little 
                        girl?? Four years old??

           The Woman shakes her head, barely registers him. Next car 
           over--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I need your help! Have you seen a girl? 
                        She’s my daughter--

           The window is rolled up in his face. Near tears, Harry 
           keeps running -- down one lane, then down another -- feet 
           scurrying, dashing past cars...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Sophie!! Sophie!!!

           A resurgent wave of horns. The traffic is starting to 
           move, slowly picking up momentum...

           Harry’s eyes leap from one car to another... Wheels start 
           to spin, engines start to spew...

           The cars are big... Sleek... Windows rolled up, blocking 
           out the heat and fumes... Dark interiors, traced 
           reflections on the glass...

           Harry’s mind reels, his thoughts finally crystallizing...

           Sophie is in one of them.

           He dashes toward the first car in sight -- the white mini-
           van to his Pontiac’s right. He BANGS on the window with 
           his fist. The car surges ahead...

           He spins, runs to the next car, to his Pontiac’s left. A 
           sedan. Pounds again on the glass. The same result.

           By now, the Pontiac is the only stagnant car on the road. 
           One fed-up driver after another honks, then cuts into the 
           other lane.
           VOICES tumble out of the vehicles--

                                 VOICE
                        Asshole!

                                 VOICE #2
                        Watch out!

                                 VOICE #3
                        Get in your car!

           Harry spots a familiar flash of blue up ahead. The Kid’s 
           Toyota. He runs for it, but it’s going too fast. He spins 
           again -- searching for cars he recognizes from earlier. 

           Cars into which Sophie might have been pulled...

                                 HARRY
                        Help!! Somebody help me!!!

           He looks like nothing so much as a drunkard, or simply 
           deranged. Cars steer clear of him as they gain speed.

           He stops. Staggers back. Takes it in.

           He stands alone, in the middle lane of Los Angeles’s 
           busiest freeway, cars rushing past him on either side.

           And Sophie is nowhere to be found.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Quiet. Just the shuffling of paperwork, the hum of 
           fluorescent lights. 

           Harry is seated. Still. Near-catatonic.

                                 OFFICER
                        Photo?

           Harry looks up. As though surprised to see a POLICE 
           OFFICER seated before him. JENNIFER REILLY, 26, rookie.

           He comes to. Reaches into his wallet. Pulls out a pocket-
           size photo. A smiling Sophie, her hair pulled back in a 
           pony-tail. Reilly makes a note. 

                                 REILLY
                        Any chance she just ran off?

                                 HARRY
                        There was nowhere to go... Cars were 
                        stopped... The ramp was too high... 
           His eyes drift into space. He mouths a few words... Then 
           they come together--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t... I don’t understand... Who 
                        would... Who would do this? I don’t have 
                        money... I don’t have anything...

           Then, almost breaking down...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        She’s the only thing I’ve got...

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        Eighty percent of all child abductions, 
                        it’s someone the child’s parent knows.

           Harry turns, startled. Forgot about the other man in the 
           room. SERGEANT RICHARD VARGAS, 30, cocksure, with all the 
           bravado of youth. Big Dirty Harry fan. 

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Harry? Can I call you Harry? 
                                 (doesn’t wait for a response)
                        Anyone you know who could do this?

                                 HARRY
                        No... I don’t know anyone...

                                 VARGAS
                        How’s that?

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve... I moved here less than two years 
                        ago... She was two... I go from job to 
                        job, I don’t have friends, it’s hard 
                        enough making ends meet...

           Just then, Vargas seems to notice Harry’s arms. The 
           tattoo, the track marks. Makes a mental note.

                                 VARGAS
                        Family?

                                 HARRY
                        No...

                                 VARGAS
                        How ‘bout the girl’s mother?

                                 HARRY
                        No... No... It’s just me and her.
                                 (then, stuttering, anxiety 
                                 mounting)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        There...there was a blue Toyota, 
                        some...some kid driver... I...

                                 VARGAS
                        You know what an amber alert is?

           Harry’s eyes well with tears. How can this be happening?

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, Harry. Amber alert’s a good 
                        thing. What you’ve got now is a window 
                        where there’s a real, real good chance 
                        your kid’ll be found. And you know how we 
                        find her? By some rando calling in the 
                        precinct ‘cause he saw the amber, or he 
                        watched it on TV, or he saw the kid at a 
                        soda fountain. Kapish?

           Harry tries to breathe. Trying to control the panic...

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Finding a blue Toyota in Los Angeles 
                        ain’t easy. But when it comes to finding 
                        your kid -- the odds are in your favor.

           Beat. Harry takes a moment. Then nods...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Red block letters illuminate a sign, poised over the 
           afternoon traffic:

           “CHILD MISSING. SOPHIE NOVAK. AGE 4. 3 FT 2 IN. 40 LB. BR 
           HAIR, GR EYES, BIRTHMARK ON NECK, TIE-DYED SHIRT, LAST 
           SEEN ON 405 EXIT 22. CALL 1-800-MYCHILD WITH INFO.”

           EXT. STOREFRONT - EARLY MORNING

           The PHOTO of Sophie -- now black-and-white, the 
           centerpiece of a “MISSING CHILD” poster. A pair of 
           workers paste copies along storefront windows...

                                  RADIO JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        Police urge anyone with any information 
                        to immediately call 1-800-MYCHILD...

           And we’re in...

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           It’s late afternoon...
                                 ANCHOR
                        ...the Los Angeles Police Department’s 
                        new hotline, which will be taking calls 
                        every hour of the day...

           WE PULL BACK... The park looks just like any other, but 
           we’re not in L.A. anymore...

           We drift up... We can see over the tops of the houses... 
           A body of water, glittering in the checkered sunlight. 
           And, rising from a canopy of mist...

           ...the Golden Gate Bridge.

           INT. TRAURIG & GREEN - EVENING

           An ELEVATOR opens. A man exits. JAKE HOLLANDER, 40, 
           corporate law. Ivy League handsome, but weary...

                                 JAKE
                        Were the shredders by the men’s room? 
                                 (waits)
                        Well, yes, it’s important, if NovaSat 
                        puts its shredders next to its lavatories 
                        it means it doesn’t care about shredding. 
                        Juries like that sort of thing.

           He ENTERS his OFFICE. Flat-screen TV, mini-bar. Massive 
           windows give out on the San Francisco skyline. This is 
           what success looks like. 

           He collapses at his desk, opens his laptop, eager to end 
           the call...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Those are the details that count. If your 
                        client is incapable of getting his act 
                        together, there’re plenty of firms out 
                        there who don’t mind losing. 

           A few clicks of the mouse. He checks his BOOKMARK 
           LISTINGS. The first tab to check is MISSING PERSONS. His 
           routine. He searches NEW while the VOICE on the other 
           line rambles on...

           Then -- an image loads. It’s the PHOTOGRAPH OF SOPHIE.

           Jake freezes. Goes pale. He’s visibly STUNNED.

           His eyes lock on the picture. It can’t be...

           Then--
                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Uh... Carl, can I call you back?... Ok.

           He hangs up. Speed-dials another number. Waits. 

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO HOME - EVENING

           We’re in a PALATIAL HOME. Vaulted windows, gleaming 
           counters, Persian rugs. Everything about the place spells 
           wealth. We DRIFT DOWN A HALLWAY... 

           Through an opened bathroom doorway we can see a WOMAN. 
           39, cashmere bathrobe, 3-carat wedding ring, rose cheeks 
           and early wrinkles. Quiet desperation in her eyes.

           Her name is ELLEN HOLLANDER. She raises a glass of water 
           to her lips. Takes a sip. WE SINK DOWN to her free hand. 
           Two PILLS lie on the upturned palm.

           Slowly, Ellen slides the pills into her mouth. Takes 
           another sip of water. Swallows.

           She stares at her reflection. 

           Then -- RINGING. Ellen jumps. It’s the phone. She takes a 
           moment. 

           Exits the bathroom... Heads down the hallway, passing an 
           array of framed photographs... One is of her, Jake, and a 
           GIRL ROUGHLY TWO YEARS IN AGE. 

           She picks up the phone, slowly, wearily.

                                 JAKE (O.S.)
                        Ellen?? Are you there?

                                 ELLEN
                                 (thin-voiced, exhausted)
                        What...?

                                 JAKE (O.S.)
                        Ellen, I’m sending you a link. I want you 
                        to look at the picture. Now.

                                 ELLEN
                        What? Is this--?

                                 JAKE
                        Just look at it. Please.

           Ellen takes another moment. Puts down the phone, her 
           glass of water still in hand. Heads to a glass-plate 
           coffee table, a laptop opened to the side. Types. Waits. 
           Then, all of a sudden, her sunken eyes go wide. She 
           GASPS.

                                 ELLEN
                        Oh my God...

           WE CAN’T SEE what she sees -- but the effect it has on 
           her is clear.

           Her right hand lets go. The glass of water falls. 

           SLOW, AS IT HITS THE FLOOR AND SHATTERS...

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           A PHONE rings. A soda-guzzling cop on the late shift 
           picks up.

                                 COP
                        Los Angeles Police Department, Special 
                        Investigations.

                                 JAKE (O.S.)
                        This is Jake Hollander. I was wondering 
                        if you’d found my daughter yet.

           EXT. 405 SOUTH - DAWN

           Darkness. Little traffic now. Harry’s Pontiac rolls down 
           the rightmost lane, pulls off the road, comes to a stop. 
           He opens his door, gets out. 

           We’re on the 405 South, near Exit 22. Back where it all 
           happened...

           Harry peers around. Features weighed down by fear, hasn’t 
           slept all night, hasn’t eaten since before the incident. 
           He walks ahead a few yards, looking over the road, 
           tracing where his car was then. 

           He stops. Leans down, eyes close to the road. SPOTS 
           SOMETHING. We can’t see what...

           He looks to his left. No headlights visible. Makes a dash 
           to the nearest lane. Bends down, picks up a stud EARRING. 
           Looks at it. It’s a pink stud. It’s Sophie’s... And it’s 
           coated with DRIED BLOOD...

           He makes his way back off the road. Stares at the 
           earring, clutches it in his hand...

           He BREAKS DOWN. 
           Bursts into tears. Crumples up and sinks to the asphalt, 
           overwhelmed, weeping as though it were all just hitting 
           him...

           A PHONE RINGS. It’s his cell... His adrenaline suddenly 
           high, he digs into his pocket and pulls it out.

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        Harry Novak?

           Wiping away the tears, full of both hope and dread--

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah...??

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        We’re going to need you to come down to 
                        S.I.U. right away. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS - MORNING

           Harry breathlessly hurries down a hallway. 

                                 HARRY
                        He a cop?

           He’s addressing the officer escorting him -- SAMMY 
           LITVAK, 29, smart-aleck, a cop of limited skills. 

                                 LITVAK
                        I’m a desk-rat, I don’t know squat. All I 
                        know is he wears $300 shoes and he’s got 
                        a fetching wife. So I’d say he’s not a 
                        cop.

                                 HARRY
                        Well, does he know something??

                                 LITVAK
                        My line of work, everybody knows 
                        something. Question is, does he know 
                        something worthwhile?

           He stops by a stray chair. Motions an anxious Harry to 
           sit down. 

                                 LITVAK (CONT’D)
                        But judging by his shoes, and the fact 
                        that he flew in from San Francisco on a 4 
                        a.m. private jet -- I’d say he knows 
                        something worthwhile.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Two photos, positioned side by side. One is Sophie’s 
           portrait, the one we’ve seen many times already. 

           The other is of a girl about TWO YEARS OF AGE. She’s the 
           girl we saw in the photo Ellen Hollander passed by. She’s 
           got the same tufts of brown hair as Sophie, the same 
           green eyes, the same freckles, the same exaggerated 
           dimples...

           And the same birthmark on the left side of the neck...

                                 JAKE
                        This was taken one month before Wren 
                        disappeared.

           He and Ellen are hunched over the photographs, Vargas 
           hovering above. The Hollanders look nervous, tired, Jake 
           nursing a water bottle in one hand...  

                                 VARGAS
                        And that was -- what, May ‘08?

                                 JAKE
                        A little over two years ago, yeah...

           Vargas takes the two photos, lifts them up, studies them. 
           The similarity is striking. He nods.

                                 VARGAS
                        Uh-huh...

           Starts heading for the door. Turns toward the Hollanders 
           as he OPENS it--

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get my superior in here, he’s 
                        outta the office...

           WE DRIFT DOWN THE HALL -- 

           -- to HARRY. He sees Vargas... Sees that Vargas is 
           talking to someone... Leaps from his seat--

                                 HARRY
                        Is that him?

           Vargas spins around, startled. What’s Harry doing there?

                                 VARGAS
                        Harry, I’ll... Gimme one sec...
           ON THE HOLLANDERS: Ears perked all of a sudden. Who is 
           Vargas talking to? 

           ON HARRY: Catches a glimpse of JAKE HOLLANDER through the 
           doorway down the hall... Marching toward Vargas--

                                 HARRY
                        Is that the man who flew in...? Does 
                        he...does he know where my girl is...?

           ON THE HOLLANDERS: Realizing who Harry is...

                                 VARGAS
                        Harry, you can’t come in here...

                                 HARRY
                        What does he...what does he know...?? You 
                        called me down here...

                                 VARGAS
                        You gotta wait, Harry--
                                 (to Litvak)
                        Fuck’s sake, man, I told you 2nd floor...

                                 LITVAK
                        You said 3rd floor...

           ON THE HOLLANDERS: Edging toward the doorway, behind 
           Vargas... Catching sight of Harry... The tattoo, the 
           tattered shirt...

                                 HARRY
                        Who is he?? Does he know where she is??

                                 VARGAS
                        Harry, you cannot be here right now--

           The words only agitate Harry more... Sweat dripping from 
           his brow, his eyes crazed... What’s going on?

           Jake Hollander brimming with rage now, locking on 
           Harry... His grip on his WATER BOTTLE tightening... His 
           nails DIGGING IN...

           Ellen approaching from behind... Locking on Harry as 
           well... Everyone getting closer and closer... 

                                 HARRY
                        Does he know someth--

                                 ELLEN
                        What have you done with her?

           Silence. 
           All eyes turn to Ellen, standing at the doorway. Harry is 
           frozen. He looks at her.

           Stuttering, his words quivering--

                                 HARRY
                        What... What do you mean...?

           Then he notices the veins in Jake’s hand bulging... The 
           nails digging into the bottle... Ellen’s eyes, so full of 
           fury... What is happening?

           Then, exploding, FLINGING her arms at Harry--

                                 ELLEN
                        You bastard!!!

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen--!

           Harry staggers back, red-faced from the blows, losing his 
           bearings... Jake and Vargas jump in, hold Ellen back, try 
           to calm her down... 

           She shrieks and screams, deep, guttural cries, tears 
           streaming down her face, letting it all SPILL...

           EXT. PIER - TOPANGA BEACH - DAY

           Waves lapping at the dock. A few FISHING BOATS moored. 

           A man in skipper gear slices into a fish. He knows what 
           he’s doing, but he’s no fisherman. Late fifties, pale 
           skin, silver hair, glasses. His name’s HOLLIS WALTERS. 

           A CELL RINGS. Walters stops. Both his hands are covered 
           in fish guts. What to do?

           Slowly, carefully, he slips a half-clean glove onto his 
           right hand, then eases one finger into his pocket to pull 
           out the phone. A real balancing act...

                                 WALTERS
                        Yes? 

           He waits, listens. Sighs. Casts a disappointed look back 
           at his fish.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Alright... I’m coming...

           He hangs up, moves the phone to his left hand -- the fish-
           gut-covered one -- and then realizes what he just did. 
           INT. POLICE STATION - SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS - DAY

           Walters walks down the hallway, wiping his cell phone 
           obsessively with a tissue. Sniffs it. Still fishy.

           About to open a door when a red-faced Vargas corners him, 
           hands him a FOLDER and points to the next door down--

                                 VARGAS
                        The fucker’s in there.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           On Harry. Seated at a table, the harsh glow of overhead 
           lights beating down on him. Scared, disoriented...

           Walters steps in, Vargas behind. Walters is calm, his 
           words soft and composed -- a real contrast to his hothead 
           companion.

                                 WALTERS
                        Mr. Novak? My name is Hollis Walters. I 
                        run the Missing Persons unit.  

                                 HARRY
                        You gotta help me -- I don’t understand 
                        why I’m here, I should be out there, I 
                        should be looking for my daughter--

                                 VARGAS
                        She really your daughter?

                                 HARRY
                        What do you mean??

                                 WALTERS
                                 (to Vargas)
                        Could you please leave us for a moment?

           Vargas’s face goes red: “What?” Walters’ face responds: 
           “Go.” Beat. Then, as a pissed-off Vargas slinks out--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Novak... Calm down... 

           Harry tries to breathe, close to hyperventilating...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Calm down, Mr. Novak... Harry, I’m here 
                        to help you... Ok?

           Beat. Harry shakes his head, eyes to the floor...
                                 HARRY
                        You fucking bastards... The one time a 
                        guy like me needs your help... The one 
                        time I ask for help...

                                 WALTERS
                        Harry, I am going to help you. Ok? But 
                        you’ve got to cooperate. Now I’m going to 
                        explain to you what’s happening...

           Beat. Opening the FOLDER, flipping through the pages of a 
           POLICE REPORT-- 

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Two years ago, May 2008, these folks, the 
                        Hollanders, their little girl was 
                        kidnapped. She was two years old. She was 
                        grabbed from their front yard. They never 
                        found her. Her name was Wren. 
                                 (then,)
                        Now, Harry, what these folks are saying -- 
                        what they’re saying is that this girl...

           He pulls out the PHOTO OF SOPHIE--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        ...is Wren.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s bullshit. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Ok. That might be. I used to counsel 
                        people just like the Hollanders and I’ve 
                        seen this sort of thing happen. They see 
                        a kid who looks like theirs, and they 
                        grab at it. It’s natural.

           Harry nods. For the first time, a reassuring word.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Have some water.

           He gestures to a plastic cup of water on the table.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        You’re dehydrated. Have you eaten?

           Harry looks at the water. The thought of eating or 
           drinking anything makes him sick...

                                 HARRY
                        I’m fine... Thank you...
                                 WALTERS
                                 (back to the folder)
                        Says here Sophie was enrolled in swimming 
                        lessons...?

           Harry looks at him. Seems Walters is trying to warm to 
           him. He wonders why. Should he play along...?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, well, I... I used to swim, so...

                                 WALTERS
                        Really? Competitively?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah... In high school...

                                 WALTERS
                        What happened to swimming?

           Walters whips out a pen. Scrawls done some notes. 

                                 HARRY
                        I had Sophie.

           Beat. Walters stops. Looks at Harry.

           Then notes the tattoo. The track marks. 

           Scrawls some more. Harry notices... Getting worried 
           again...

                                 WALTERS
                        Do you have some family here we can talk 
                        to? Anyone who’ll back up that Sophie’s 
                        your kid?

                                 HARRY
                        No... My mom raised me on her own... 
                        She’s dead... My dad, he left when I was 
                        a baby...

                                 WALTERS
                        Any brothers? Sisters?

                                 HARRY
                        No...

                                 WALTERS
                        How about Sophie’s mother? She dead?

           Beat. Harry hesitates before replying. He’s not used to 
           telling the truth about Sophie’s mother--
                                 HARRY
                        No... But she left us when we got to 
                        L.A... I have no idea where she is...

                                 WALTERS
                        What’s her name?

                                 HARRY
                        Ramona... Ramona Mendez...

                                 WALTERS
                        Where were you before L.A.?

                                 HARRY
                        San Francisco...

                                 WALTERS
                        San Francisco?

           A moment passes. Harry realizes what it sounds like... 
           The same place the Hollanders are from...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        When did you leave San Francisco?

                                 HARRY
                        Uh... June... June 2008...

           Walters glances at the report. A glimpse of text: “May 
           30th, 2008, Wren Hollander abducted...” Makes another 
           note. Harry notices. Realizes he’s losing ground...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I... Saint John’s... In San Francisco... 
                        It’s where she was born... Call Saint 
                        John’s... And I... I came by a police 
                        station...Santa Monica, missing work 
                        papers, ID’s... Sophie was with me, both 
                        our pictures got taken... We spoke to 
                        cops, it’s all on record. Does that work? 

                                 WALTERS
                        Was the police station more than two 
                        years ago?

                                 HARRY
                        No... It was after I moved to L.A...

                                 WALTERS
                        So that could’ve been Wren. I’ll call the 
                        hospital. In the meantime, do you have a 
                        birth certificate? Baby photos?
                                 HARRY
                        For God’s sake, she’s my daughter!

                                 WALTERS
                        I never said she wasn’t, Harry--

                                 HARRY
                        What are you accusing me of?? Tell me! Do 
                        you think I kidnapped my own child? You 
                        think I nabbed their kid in San Francisco 
                        and passed her off as my own?

                                 WALTERS
                        Who said it was San Francisco?

           Beat. Confused--

                                 HARRY
                        What...?

                                 WALTERS
                        You lived in San Francisco. I never 
                        mentioned where the Hollanders lived.

                                 HARRY
                        I... I was... They told me Hollander was 
                        from San Francisco...

           Beat. Walters nods. Makes another note.

                                 WALTERS
                        Birth certificate and baby photos. We’ll 
                        start there.

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A drawer is YANKED open. Hands dive in, rummage around. 
           Harry watches from a few yards off, while Walters digs 
           through papers. 

           Vargas is off to the side, carrying a clipboard, moseying 
           around. Eyes the overturned furniture, the mess...

                                 VARGAS
                        Consider a housekeeper? 

                                 HARRY
                        I was... There was a... A burglary...

           Walters stops. He and Vargas stare at Harry.

                                 VARGAS
                        A burglary?
                                 HARRY
                        Right before she was taken...

                                 VARGAS
                        You never said anything about a burglary.
                        Where’d you report it?

           Harry thinks. Realizes he made a huge mistake...

                                 HARRY
                        I... I didn’t... I had to hurry out, then 
                        Sophie was taken...

           Vargas looks at Walters. Yeah, right.

                                 VARGAS
                        I don’t see no baby photos.

                                 HARRY
                        The bedside drawer, there’s one of Sophie 
                        as a baby. She’s in her mother’s arms...

           Walters heads there, searches. Stops. Shakes his head.

                                 WALTERS
                        I don’t see it...

                                 HARRY
                        It’s there.

           Walters shrugs. Can’t find it. Exasperated, Harry starts 
           rummaging as well. But there are no photos in the drawer.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                                 (confused)
                        I know it’s here...

           Walters looks up. Joins eyes with Vargas again.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        She was talking about that picture in the 
                        car... Maybe she moved it...

           Vargas nods. Bullshit.

                                 VARGAS
                        And there’s no one you can call up? No 
                        one who’s known you and the kid for more 
                        than two years? I mean, Christ--

                                 HARRY
                        No... And I don’t know people here... I 
                        spend every hour trying to put food on 
                        the table, I--
                                 WALTERS
                        May we see the birth certificate, Harry?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah... Yeah, of course...

           He moves to another table... Starts looking...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I keep all my legal documents here...

           But he’s having trouble finding anything. Agitated...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s here... I know it’s here, I keep all 
                        of them here...

           He dives into another drawer... Opens a folder of legal 
           documents. There’s a photocopy of his passport, taxes... 
           But nothing mentioning Sophie... 

           Then it comes to him.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what they took...

                                 VARGAS
                        Come again?

                                 HARRY
                        The...the burglary... It looked like they 
                        hadn’t taken anything...

           He peers over, RACES to the kitchen... The fridge...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        There were pictures here.

           He turns to the cops. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m being set up.

           Vargas shoots Walters a final look. It says it all.

                                 VARGAS
                        Why didn’t you report the burglary?

                                 HARRY
                        What do you mean...? You don’t believe 
                        me? I’m telling you somebody set me up.

           Vargas eyes Harry: track marks, tattoo. Then the 
           apartment: chipped paint, cracked ceilings...
                                 VARGAS
                        And what makes you so special?

           Walters’ BEEPER goes off. He glances at it, looks up--

                                 WALTERS
                        We’ve got her.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           CLOSE ON a KNUCKLE rapping on a door.

           Vargas, two other POLICE OFFICERS, and Harry are grouped 
           outside an apartment. Vargas knocks again.

                                 VARGAS
                        She speak English?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah... But are you sure it’s her?

                                 VARGAS
                        This number hers?

           He hands Harry a SLIP OF PAPER. A number scrawled on it.

                                 HARRY
                        I have no idea. We haven’t spoken in two 
                        years.

           Then -- SOUNDS behind the door.

                                 VARGAS
                        Well...
                                 (nods to the dank, decrepit 
                                 surroundings)
                        The place looks about right, don’t it?

           RAMONA MENDEZ -- 26, strung-out but was once a beauty -- 
           opens the door. A grimy kitchen behind her, the shades in 
           the place drawn.

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Are you Ramona Mendez?

           Beat. No answer. She looks around.

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Policía. ¿Es usted Ramona Mendez? 

                                 HARRY
                        She speaks English.
           Ramona sees Harry.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ramona... It’s me... Harry... 

           No answer. She stares at him, looks back at the police. 
           She seems afraid.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry... It’s been so long... It’s so 
                        fucking stupid -- I just -- I just need 
                        you to tell them we had a child...

                                 VARGAS
                        Ma’am, this man is claiming you are the 
                        mother of his child. He claims that child 
                        went missing.
                                 (then,)
                        Are you the mother of his child?

           Ramona looks at Vargas. Then shakes her head.

                                 RAMONA
                        No conozco a ese hombre...

           Beat. Harry looks at her. Stunned.

                                 HARRY
                        Ramona, listen to me. I’m not here to 
                        accuse you of anything. Four years ago, 
                        you had a baby. Our baby. I know you 
                        remember. Her name was Sophie.
                                 (then,)
                        Sophie’s been taken from me. She’s been 
                        kidnapped, Ramona, and these people don’t 
                        believe she’s our child.

           Ramona looks at him, at Vargas, at the other cops.

           A moment passes. But she just shakes her head again.

                                 RAMONA
                        No conozco... I don’t know him...

                                 HARRY
                        Ramona...

           But she retreats. Harry can only stare at her, dumb-
           founded. Questions racing through his mind.

           Is she involved?

           Or, just maybe, is this not a set-up...?
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           The two flyers. Sophie and Wren...

           Wren’s missing poster reads: “MISSING: WREN HOLLANDER. 
           AGE 2 YEARS 1 MONTH. 2 FEET 6 INCHES. 28 LB. BROWN HAIR. 
           GREEN EYES. BLUE SHIRT, YELLOW SKIRT, WHITE SANDALS. 
           LITTLE MERMAID NAP-SACK, BIRTHMARK ON NECK. LAST SEEN 52 
           BLITHEDALE, SAN FRANCISCO 94102.”

           Next, a web page: “Still Missing After One Year or More”, 
           with a link to a site: www.missingkids.com. A series of 
           children’s pictures. The third on the list: Wren 
           Hollander. Then, a CG image, titled “What Wren May Look 
           Like Today.” The resemblance to Sophie is striking.

                                 JEFFRIES (O.S.)
                        Notice the jaw... The mandible a hair off 
                        in both... Low resolution but you can 
                        still tell the eyes are the same color... 
                        Similar birthmark...

           FLOYD JEFFRIES, analyst and profiler for S.I.U., is 
           pointing to the flyers, addressing Walters and Vargas. 

                                 VARGAS
                        So that’s it, right? It’s the same girl.

                                 WALTERS
                        Not necessarily. Kids that young, even 
                        parents can mistake them.

                                 VARGAS
                        Come on, man, what are the chances? 
                        Report said Hollander saw a grey Pontiac. 
                        He and Wren were outside, right? He goes 
                        in to take a call, then sees this grey 
                        Pontiac driving away and Wren’s gone. 
                        Well, Harry drives a grey Pontiac. And we 
                        got ‘em both in San Francisco, the girls 
                        look identical, we got “no-conozco”- 
                        Ramona, and St. John’s Hospital had no  
                        record of a Sophie Novak. You need more? 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        How about DNA?

                                 WALTERS
                        We’re working on it. No traces in Harry’s 
                        apartment yet. 

                                 VARGAS
                        That’s ‘cause the fucker wiped the place 
                        down.
           Walters turns to Vargas, tired of his Dirty Harry shtick--

                                 WALTERS
                        You know, your hard-on for this guy’s 
                        gravestone is counterproductive. 

                                 VARGAS
                        That’s a big word, Dr. Phil. I suppose I 
                        should ask him how he feels instead?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Maybe.

           Beat. Walters and Vargas turn to Jeffries. Huh?

                                 JEFFRIES (CONT’D)
                        Hollis... I know it’s been a while since 
                        you closed the books... But does reverse-
                        Stockholm ring a bell?

                                 WALTERS
                        I think so. Kidnapper grows protective of 
                        his victim.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Even more than that. He creates a role 
                        for his victim. Gets so used to her being 
                        his that he blots out the memory of 
                        things ever being different.

           Walters thinks. It’s an idea he never considered. It 
           takes Vargas another moment to register...

                                 VARGAS
                        Wait, so he would...forget having 
                        kidnapped her?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Would explain why he reported her 
                        disappearance to us. In his mind, she’s 
                        his daughter. 

           Vargas nods. Weighs this... To his side, we glimpse a 
           stack of police records -- and, lying atop it, a MUG SHOT 
           of a 25-YEAR-OLD HARRY...

                                 JEFFRIES (CONT’D)
                        I mean, yes, maybe Harry’s lying. Or 
                        maybe he’s the victim of some set-up. But 
                        where do I put my two cents? He kidnapped 
                        Wren Hollander. He just doesn’t remember.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY 

           A single bulb hits Harry’s face. He’s moved down the 
           ladder. We’re now in a low-rent interrogation room, the 
           kind where cops get mean -- and Harry looks like he 
           hasn’t slept or seen sunlight in over a day...

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        Tell us your story, Harry.

                                 HARRY
                                 (bewildered, losing it)
                        What do you mean...?

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        I’m curious. How’d you meet Ramona?

           Harry looks up. Looming over him are Vargas, Walters, 
           Jeffries, and SHERIFF THOMAS CRISCO, 62, head honcho. The 
           inquisitors.

                                 HARRY
                        I... We were just kids... We were in high 
                        school...

                                 VARGAS
                        And what happened?

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        We stayed together after school, tried to 
                        get work... But when Ramona got pregnant 
                        she didn’t tell anyone... I thought she 
                        couldn’t take care of the baby so I moved 
                        in with her, I tried to help... I tried 
                        to make ends meet...

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        But you had prospects before, didn’t you? 
                        Says here you were a good swimmer.

                                 HARRY
                        Well, prospects have a way of changing 
                        when a baby comes along...

                                 VARGAS
                        You sure that was it? You sure you ain’t 
                        forgetting something? 

                                 HARRY
                        What...? What do you mean...?

           Vargas points to the TRACK MARKS on Harry’s arm. 
                                 VARGAS
                        We got a whole rap sheet on you, amigo. 
                        Heroin possession. Stolen cars. Not your 
                        typical swimmer.

           Harry looks at him. Lips trembling, eyes wavering...

                                 HARRY
                        I fucked up, ok? I never had money, I had 
                        to support Ramona... My life got out of 
                        hand but that doesn’t make me a 
                        kidnapper. I’ve been raising Sophie on my 
                        own for two years, I’ve been a good 
                        father, I swear--

                                 VARGAS
                        When did Ramona run off?  

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t... After...

                                 VARGAS
                        After what? After jail?

           Walters watches on, uneasy. Vargas is enjoying himself, 
           primed for the kill...

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        It’s all here, Harry. Come hell or high 
                        water we can’t find a single hospital 
                        record of a Sophie Novak being born, but 
                        lo and behold we sure can find mug shots.

           He procures one. The MUG SHOT we saw earlier.

           Harry stares at the photo. Hasn’t seen it in two years...

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        You served hard time. January to May 
                        2008. You got out one day before Wren was 
                        taken. If you already had a kid, where 
                        was she while you were inside?

                                 HARRY
                        She was with Ramona...

                                 VARGAS
                        And you conveniently decide to move to 
                        L.A. right after Wren is nabbed?

                                 HARRY
                        Ramona wanted to leave after I got out... 
                                 VARGAS
                        Why? ‘Cause you’d just nabbed a kid?

                                 HARRY
                        Christ’s sake, I don’t know why...

                                 VARGAS
                        Thought you said Ramona ran off.

                                 HARRY
                        She ran off once we were in L.A...

                                 VARGAS
                        Why?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know...

           Jumping in, calmly--

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Think about it, Harry. Your story’s got 
                        holes in it. It’s convoluted. Why would 
                        someone go to the trouble of setting you 
                        up? Why all of this? And we talked to 
                        instructors at the YMCA -- they say you 
                        were always forgetting things, mixing up 
                        times, that Sophie said her mom was dead--

                                 HARRY
                        No, that’s, that’s just what I told her--

                                 JEFFRIES
                        My point is: could you be misremembering?

           Harry is startled.

                                 HARRY
                        How... How could I...misremember?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        It happens. Under great duress, people 
                        suppress harmful memories. Drugs like 
                        heroin blur things even more.

           The words hang in the air...

                                 JEFFRIES (CONT’D)
                        Wren believes you’re her father. Kids her 
                        age can’t remember two years ago...

           Harry turns, averts Jeffries’ gaze, refusing to let it 
           get to him...
                                 JEFFRIES (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you believe you’re her father as 
                        well...

                                 HARRY
                        But I am her father!

           Snapping, red-faced, ready to break Harry in two--

                                 VARGAS
                        Cut the crap! You drive the same car 
                        Hollander saw, you were in the same city, 
                        you shared the same streets, the same 
                        parks, you left one week after Wren went 
                        missing, you got no evidence of  
                        paternity--

           Harry shakes his head... Overwhelmed...

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Admit what you did, you piece of shit!

           Crying out, his protest ripped from his gut--

                                 HARRY
                        I didn’t do anything!!!

           Harry breaks down. Tears bursting from his eyes, his 
           whole body shaking... Collapsing under the weight of it 
           all...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        She’s my daughter... I love her... She’s 
                        my daughter...

           Vargas is about to retort -- but Walters PINS him back.

           Jeffries eyes Crisco, then leans down to WHISPER to 
           Harry, as though he were his closest ally in the world...

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Is it just possible, Harry, that you only 
                        wish she were?

           Beat. Harry lets the words sink into him this time... 

           He has no response.

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The place is swarming with cops. Detectives searching, 
           forensics mapping off sections of the floorboard...
                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Sir, you want to look at this?

           A DETECTIVE turns. Makes his way past flashlight shafts 
           to a BEDROOM, and a young COP kneeling by the bed...

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Found this underneath.

           It’s a Little Mermaid napsack. The Detective takes it. On 
           the bag is a tag. An address written on it:

           “Hollanders. 52 Blithedale, San Francisco, CA 94104.”

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Call S.I.U.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           CLOSE ON a pair of HANDCUFFS. 

           Litvak whips them out, grabs Harry’s wrists. We’re in a 
           hallway, and Harry is in a daze...

                                 LITVAK
                        Harold Novak, you are under arrest for 
                        the abduction of Wren Hollander. You have 
                        the right to remain silent. Anything you 
                        say or do can and will be used against 
                        you in a court of law. You have the right 
                        to an attorney. If you cannot afford an 
                        attorney...

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           The DOORS SWING OPEN. Harry is escorted out -- now 
           officially a criminal.

           Cuffed, the L.A. sunlight hitting him like a brick, he 
           walks down the steps, Litvak by his side. He turns and 
           notices the flyers and posters on the doors...  

           A new “MISSING CHILD” poster. Sophie’s picture, and the 
           name “WREN HOLLANDER” printed above it...

           Walters walks up to join Litvak. Opens a car door. Slides 
           Harry in...

           INT. COP CAR - DAY

           The car is moving, Litvak driving, Walters by his side. 
           Harry is in the back, eyes red from crying. He looks out 
           the window. Buildings speed by.

           He’s helpless. Defeated. Completely alone. 

           Beat. He shifts his hands to his right. Reaches one 
           finger into his pants pocket. Pulls out something we’ve 
           seen before...

           SOPHIE’S EARRING. The one he found on the 405. 

           He stares at it. Lets the image burn into his eyes -- the 
           image and what it means...

                                 HARRY
                        Sophie...

           He turns to the cops ahead. Litvak and Walters, both 
           oblivious. He looks down at his handcuffs. Takes a 
           moment. His thoughts slowly taking focus now...

           He has to do something.

           EXT. COP CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The car STOPS at a traffic light...

           INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Litvak notices something in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR...

           Harry is slumped over, jaw slack, eyes closed. Puzzled, 
           Litvak looks over at Walters--

                                 LITVAK
                        See that?

           Walters nods.

                                 LITVAK (CONT’D)
                        He a narco?

           Litvak turns around, jabs Harry with his finger. 

                                 LITVAK (CONT’D)
                        Harry... Wake up...

           He stops. Leaves his hand on Harry for a moment. Turns to 
           Walters--

                                 LITVAK (CONT’D)
                        He’s not breathing.
                                 WALTERS
                        Stay put. 

                                 LITVAK
                        I’m pulling over...

           We’re on a more or less empty side-road, the back of a 
           BUILDING COMPLEX jutting out at the corner. Litvak gets 
           out of the car, goes over to Harry, opens the door. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Sam, get back in the car--

           Unseen, Harry OPENS one eye a crack. SEES Litvak’s GUN, 
           hanging from his strap...

           In a SURGE of movement, like an athlete, Harry LEAPS UP, 
           GRABS THE GUN, swerves around and WRAPS his cuffs around 
           Litvak’s neck. 

           Walters BURSTS out of the vehicle, his own gun in hand.

                                 HARRY
                        Stay there!

           Harry points Litvak’s gun at the cop’s temple. Beat.

                                 WALTERS
                        Careful, Harry... You don’t want to do 
                        this...

                                 HARRY
                        Shut up. Put your gun down.
                                 (no response)
                        Put it down!

           Walters acquiesces.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Now unlock me.

                                 WALTERS
                        You’re making a big mistake...

                                 HARRY
                        Unlock me!

                                 LITVAK
                                 (spitting)
                        Unlock the prick, damnit!

           Walters nods, steps forward, takes out keys. UNLOCKS 
           Harry. 
           Harry keeps the gun on Litvak, steps back. Turns, eyes a 
           back entrance into the BUILDING behind him. Starts making 
           his way in that direction... His eyes spinning, his 
           breath stifled... The few PASSERSBY watching... 

           Walters barks at them--

                                 WALTERS
                        Stay back!

           And then, keeping close to Harry--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me... If she’s your kid, let 
                        the cops find her... Don’t make this 
                        mistake.

           Panting, sweating, knowing Walters may be right, knowing 
           that running only makes him look guilty, Harry continues 
           backward... Toward the entryway...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Harry... We can help you...

           Beat. Harry shakes his head.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s too late. 

           With that, he DIVES in, dragging Litvak with him. Walters 
           retrieves his gun and DASHES after.

           INT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Out of sight, Harry YANKS Litvak to the side, PUSHES his 
           head against a wall, and SPRINTS away, gun in hand. 
           Litvak collapses.

           Less than a second later, Walters races in. Sees Litvak. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Where’d he go, where’d he go??

           Litvak is too dazed to reply. Walters runs off, gun held 
           high. We’re in...

           INT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Steam, massive dish-washing machines and racks. Harry 
           runs, passing EMPLOYEES. It doesn’t take long for him to 
           realize he’s in the back of a SUPERMARKET DELI.
           He darts behind one rack and scoots by another, running 
           in zig-zags, footsteps clattering behind him... 

           He stops. Slides the GUN under his belt, trying to 
           conceal it... Spots an employee’s UNIFORM hanging on one 
           of the racks. A white button-down and a hat. He GRABS it.

           ON WALTERS: Landing where Harry just was. The clank of 
           dishes and motors, the spray of hoses and faucets. He 
           raises his weapon, eyes scanning. Whips out a WALKIE-
           TALKIE--

                                 WALTERS
                        S3U, I need five blues... 423 Grove... 
                        Suspect is free and armed...

           ON HARRY: Wearing the uniform, moving further down the 
           deli path. There’s no exit on this side. His eyes drift 
           to the other end of the SUPERMARKET...

           The cashiers, registers -- and MAIN DOORS... Perhaps his 
           only way out...

           Between him and there, the entire expanse of the super-
           market. Aisles and aisles stacked with every imaginable 
           product. A sea of all colors, tinged in fluorescent 
           light...

           He moves forward, keeping his head down, his eyes 
           alert...

           ON WALTERS: Still in the DELI... Looking... He steps out 
           onto the main floor... Heads toward the aisles...

                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t drag your hoodie on the floor...

           A MOTHER is scolding her TEENAGED SON. Walters passes 
           them by. The Son sighs, annoyed, keeps dragging the 
           hoodie, finally lets go of it altogether...

           A few customers notice Walters and his gun and back away, 
           worried. Most others don’t seem to pay any heed.

           ON HARRY: Turning into another aisle... He SEES WALTERS. 

           He turns around immediately. Silently slips into the 
           neighboring aisle. Retracing his footsteps when--

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Excuse me?

           Harry turns, startled. A YOUNG COUPLE stands before him.
                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Where can I find protein shakes?

           Beat. Harry looks back down -- at the supermarket uniform 
           he’s wearing... 

           Doesn’t want to draw attention...

                                 HARRY
                        Aisle 10...

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Isn’t this Aisle 10?

           Moving away, pointing...

                                 HARRY
                        Down there...

                                 CUSTOMER
                        That’s dairy.

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know... Use a map...

           He keeps walking, turns another corner... 

           ON WALTERS: Fruits and vegetables... He scours his 
           surroundings. Turns a corner...

           And then, the same YOUNG COUPLE rounds a bend and passes 
           right by him, complaining to one another... 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        ...The hell... If you work here you 
                        should know these things...

           Walters pays little attention.

           Then he stops. Thinks. It clicks.

           He spins around, eyes scanning the horizon... He sees an 
           employee in a uniform, in his fifties. Not Harry. 

           Walters hurries to another aisle. Sees another uniformed 
           man. Back turned to him. Auburn hair. Harry’s size. 
           Harry’s pants... 

           Walters runs forward, GRABS the man, TURNS him around. 
           It’s not Harry.

           ON HARRY: Reaches the end of one aisle, turns into 
           another...
           ON WALTERS: Turns into a new aisle, gun raised...

           AERIAL VIEW: Harry and Walters are in adjacent aisles, 
           Walters on Harry’s right, the two now separated only by a 
           single rack of food...

           Unbeknownst to both, they’re moving in the same 
           direction... Toward the same corner...

           ON HARRY: Walking... Looking ahead... 

           Another CUSTOMER hurries past, chatting on her CELL.

                                 CUSTOMER ON CELL
                        Then you tell him we’re not paying for 
                        the drapes...

           The Customer turns right. She’s still talking, out of 
           sight--

                                 CUSTOMER ON CELL (O.S.) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care what he told you, it’s--

           Suddenly, her voice DROPS OFF. 

           Harry’s ears perk up. What happened? Did she go out of 
           earshot? Did her line drop out?

           WE DRIFT PAST THE RACK OF FOOD... Now we’re...

           ON WALTERS: The Customer silent now, her worried eyes on 
           Walters. She quickly moves out of the cop’s way, her 
           phone hanging by her side...

           Walters keeps moving forward, one step at a time, gun 
           raised... Doesn’t yet know how close he is...

           ON HARRY: Eyes ahead... There’s no one in sight now... 

           But all is silent... And the silence has caught his 
           attention...

           He slows down... One step at a time now... He looks 
           rightward... Wondering...

           Could Walters be on the other side?

           He looks down... Notices a gap under the FOOD RACK. Just 
           a slight etching of a shadow can be seen, cast by the 
           overhead lights...
           ON WALTERS: Also looking down... Hearing footsteps on the 
           other side of the rack... They’re slowing down... He 
           slows his pace with them... Guessing...

           ON HARRY: Eyes locked on the shadow... He stops. 

           ON WALTERS: Still moving... But notices that the 
           footsteps have ceased... He too comes to a stop. Is it 
           Harry? 

           ON HARRY: The shadow is by his feet now... He stays 
           absolutely still... The supermarket noises have faded 
           away... All silence, except for breathing...

           AERIAL VIEW: Harry and Walters, directly across from one 
           another. They’d be staring face to face if it weren’t for 
           the food rack.

           And then -- Harry starts moving backward... Retracing his 
           steps... And finally BREAKING INTO A SPRINT.

           Walters hears this. Does the same. Gun raised, turning a 
           corner, catching a glimpse of Harry as he dashes off--

                                 WALTERS
                        Freeze!!

           Harry runs as fast as his legs can carry him. Colliding 
           into other customers, speeding back toward the other end 
           of the supermarket... The deli... The bakery...

           Walters chases after... He’s fast, close on his tail...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Stop that man! Stop him!

           CUSTOMERS and EMPLOYEES see Harry. Do as told. Run toward 
           him, grab at him.

           He yanks free from their grasp. More chase after him. He 
           knocks down items of the dairy aisle as he runs. 

           Cartons of milk EXPLODE on the ground at the feet of his 
           pursuers. They TRIP and FALL in a pool of white -- and 
           momentarily BLOCK Walters’ way.

           ON HARRY: Catches sight of the Mother and Teenaged Son we 
           saw earlier, the Son’s hoodie still lying on the floor. 
           Harry grabs it, keeps running...

           Dashes past the BAKERY... Into the KITCHEN... Toward a 
           BACK EXIT...
           EXT. BACK OF SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Stumbles out... Hears SIRENS... More COP CARS... 

           Spots a DUMPSTER... Thinking fast...

           EXT. FRONT OF SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Four COP CARS screech to a HALT...

           INT. SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           POLICE SWARM the place. SCREAMS from CUSTOMERS as the 
           cops wave their guns, dashing from aisle to aisle, 
           shouting at one another...

                                 OFFICERS
                        Go, go, go!

           Walters joins them, trying to catch his breath...

           They STOP one uniformed EMPLOYEE after another. Others 
           move toward the entrance and exit.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Block all exits!

           Race into the BAKERY...

           EXT. BACK OF SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Out the back exit... See the DUMPSTER...

           One COP raises his hand, motions to his PARTNERS to stop.

           Points to the dumpster... There, atop the trash, is an 
           employee’s HAT... The kind Harry was wearing...

           Their guns aimed, the policemen approach the dumpster, 
           REACH into it, ready to pull Harry out... 

           They grab at something. Pull it out. It’s the employee’s 
           UNIFORM Harry was wearing. 

           But Harry has disappeared.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Harry. Hurrying down a neighboring side road, wearing the 
           Teenaged Son’s HOODIE.
           All is quiet. He’s safe for now...

           INT. MOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

           Dim lighting, peeling wallpaper. An old television set 
           buzzes in the corner.

           Harry ENTERS, hooded. Sees the DESK CLERK -- forties, 
           butter-yellow dress, glued to the TV.

           Breathing deeply, his fear almost crawling out of his 
           skin, Harry approaches her. A CITY BUS rolls down the 
           street outside.

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, hi, I’d... I’d like a room... 
                        Please...

           The Clerk wheels her chair around to face him. Looks him 
           in the eye. 

           And, just then, Harry SEES what’s on the TV behind her.

           His PHOTO. And an ANCHOR, her voice just audible-- 

                                 ANCHOR
                        ...to help us parse through a story that 
                        grows more shocking every hour...

                                 DESK CLERK
                        How many nights?

           Harry is startled. 

                                 HARRY
                        Uh... One... One night...

           He plops down some cash, as the Clerk starts typing. He 
           glances again at the TV. The ANCHOR is now turned to face 
           a suit-clad WOMAN -- an expert guest, it seems...

                                 WOMAN
                        ...has developed what some call “reverse-
                        Stockholm Syndrome”, meaning the 
                        kidnapper begins to believe...

           The Clerk is still typing, back turned away from the TV. 
           But Harry catches his reflection in a MIRROR behind her. 
           He leans in closer. Behind him, he can see in the 
           reflection, is another mirror...
                                 DESK CLERK
                        Would you like to join our Deluxe 
                        Angeleno discount club? 

           Harry turns around. The mirror directly behind him is 
           reflecting the TV, with his photo still displayed.

           Which means the Clerk, her back to the TV, can see it.

                                 HARRY
                        Uh, no... No, thank you...

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Are you sure? Club members save 15% and 
                        can attend the July Pool Party.

                                 HARRY
                        I’m sure.

           The Clerk shrugs. Takes the cash. Harry breathes out. She 
           seems not to have noticed his image on the TV...

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Room 106. 

           Harry nods. Takes the key. Hurries away...

           The Clerk rolls her eyes. Asshole. Wheels back around to 
           resume watching TV, just as Harry’s PHOTO disappears and--

                                 ANCHOR
                        Talking dogs? Pure fantasy, you might 
                        say. Well, our next story this evening...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Harry enters. Shuts the door. Locks it.

           Clicks on the light. Takes a few steps -- then sits down.

           Tries to swallow. He can’t. Strains his throat, tries to 
           calm himself, tries to breathe...

           Sees the BATHROOM. Lunges for the sink. Splashes cold 
           water on his face, starts coughing, choking...

           VOMIT courses out of his mouth. His whole stomach heaving 
           up...

           He sinks to his feet... Crying... What the fuck do I do? 
           What the fuck do I do?
           He pulls out his phone. With it, a SLIP OF PAPER. The one 
           Vargas handed him outside Ramona’s...

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           RINGING. It’s the landline. Ramona picks up.

                                 RAMONA
                        Hello...?

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Harry stammers, holding back the tears--

                                 HARRY
                        Ramona... It’s Harry... Harry Novak...

           Silence. Then--

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        I don’t know you. 

                                 HARRY
                        You do! You know me... For God’s sake, 
                        please... 
                                 (breaking down)
                        Tell me... Tell me you know me...

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        I don’t.

                                 HARRY
                        Tell me! You do know me! 

           She HANGS UP. Harry crumples, the phone falling, the 
           final words tumbling from his lips...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you...?

           He sits there on the floor, the phone by his side, 
           feeling himself slowly lose his grip on everything...

           Reaches back into his pocket. Pulls out Sophie’s EARRING 
           again. Then Sophie’s PHOTO. Looks at both. Feels them in 
           his hands. Wonders...

           Could it be...?
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

           The blue and purple of dawn. Red block letters on a sign 
           over the highway:

           “CHILD MISSING. WREN HOLLANDER. AGE 4. 3 FT 2 IN. 40 LB. 
           BR HAIR, GR EYES, BIRTHMARK ON NECK, TIE-DYED SHIRT, LAST 
           SEEN ON 405 EXIT 22. CALL 1-800-MYCHILD WITH INFO.”

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS PLAZA HOTEL - DAY

           Jake and Ellen Hollander, standing in front of the 
           Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel, microphones in their faces. 
           Haggard, worn. Neither has slept in over two nights. 

           REPORTERS yell and clamor--

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Are you afraid the storm will hamper the 
                        search?

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Do you think Wren ran away from her 
                        abductor?

                                 REPORTER #3
                        What does Wren look like now?

                                 JAKE
                        She might still be wearing her tie-dyed 
                        shirt... She has earrings... She’s 
                        missing one of them... Brown hair... The 
                        posters have the most recent image we 
                        have of her...
                                 (stuttering, losing it)
                        Look at the posters...

           He can’t take it anymore, retreats. From the sidelines, 
           Walters emerges, waves the REPORTERS away. A few other 
           COPS stand by.

                                 WALTERS
                        Alright, that’s enough, that’s enough...

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Ellen steps in, gasping, overwhelmed by the crowd 
           outside. Heads to a couch, retreating within herself.

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen...
           She pulls out a bottle of pills. Takes one, trying to 
           calm herself...

           Jake hurries after her, reaching out -- when his CELL 
           GOES OFF. He waits a moment, considers it, answers--

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Jake Hollander.

           Ellen stares at him. Hoping it might be important...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        No, Carl, listen -- Hargrove handles the 
                        NovaSat accounts, so if we’re going to 
                        court in September... 

           Ellen is livid.

                                 ELLEN
                        How dare you...

                                 JAKE
                        What? Carl, I can’t hear you. Repeat what 
                        you just said--

                                 ELLEN
                        How dare you!!

           She GRABS his phone and THROWS it to the ground. Jake is 
           shocked.

                                 JAKE
                        Are you out of your--?

                                 ELLEN
                        Wren’s missing and you take fucking work 
                        calls??

                                 JAKE
                        Wren’s been missing for two years, you 
                        want to measure grief? This is my job--

                                 ELLEN
                        Your job is what did this.

           Beat. Jake glares at her. Both crushed and enraged.

                                 JAKE
                        You have no right to--

                                 ELLEN
                        Justify it. Go on, justify it. You’re a 
                        lawyer, it’s what you do. How important 
                        was that call?
                                 JAKE
                        Don’t you dare do this to me--

                                 ELLEN
                        As important as the call you took that 
                        morning? What kind of a father leaves a 
                        two year-old alone outside to take a 
                        fucking call??

                                 JAKE
                        I did not leave her, I turned my back for 
                        one second--

                                 ELLEN
                        That one second killed her!

           She BURSTS into tears. Sinks to the couch. Shakes her 
           head, unable to take it anymore, her insides in knots--

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen... How can you say that...? 
                        You...you know she’s not dead... This 
                        proves it... We know she’s alive...

                                 ELLEN
                        We don’t know anything...

           Trying to control herself, trying to explain...

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t understand, Jake... I... I 
                        can’t sleep, I can’t breathe...

           She looks up at him. Earnestly, at her most vulnerable--

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I need her back, Jake... I need her...

           Jake looks at her. 

           Slowly, his anger fades. He scoops up his phone, turns it 
           off. Then sits by his wife’s side...

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I just -- I remember the last thing I 
                        said to her... She was bothering me and I 
                        -- I told her to be quiet. And that was 
                        it, that was the last thing I said. Those 
                        were the last words she ever heard from 
                        her mother...

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen...
           He reaches out. Holds her as she cries. 

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Ellen... Listen to me... That picture he 
                        had of her. She was four in it. Four. 
                        That means that when everyone said she 
                        was dead, that we were deluded, that we 
                        needed to move on -- she was alive. Do 
                        you know what that means? We’re going to 
                        find her... 

           Beat. Ellen allows his words to sink in, calm her... 
           Takes a breath... Then, her tears giving way to coiled 
           hatred...

                                 ELLEN
                        I want that monster dead.

           Beat. Silence. 

           Then--

                                 JAKE
                        We’re going to find her. And I promise 
                        you, Ellen -- Harry Novak will pay for 
                        what he did.

           EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Harry exits the building... Hasn’t slept, eyes peeled for 
           cops... 

           We’re in a parking lot... Harry moves quickly, spots a 
           BRICK, picks it up...

           Makes his way to the nearest car. Looks both ways. 
           SMASHES the window in with the brick. Brushes the shards 
           away with his hoodie. Gets in.

           Reaches toward the ignition... Pulls out the front with 
           the side of a nickel... Reveals the wires...

           Touches two together... Wraps them around...

           He knows what he’s doing. He’s done this before.

           The CAR surges to life. Harry grabs the wheel, pulls out, 
           turns onto the road, and speeds away.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A string of decayed apartment buildings. We’re in the 
           belly of L.A. Broken windows, guns on street corners.

           A car pulls up. Harry’s.

           INT. RAMONA MENDEZ’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Harry walks down a HALLWAY. We’ve been here before...

           Trying to remember which door it was... Stops at one. 
           117. KNOCKS.

           The door opens. It’s Ramona. 

           She stares at Harry. Beat. 

           She PUSHES the door, making to SLAM it shut -- but Harry 
           JAMS his foot in, blocking it. He PUSHES the door back 
           open. Marches forward, as Ramona staggers back.

           She eyes a TELEPHONE. Makes for it. Picks it up. Starts 
           dialing: 9--

           Harry YANKS the telephone wire out of the wall-jack. Then 
           TUGS the wire back, ripping the phone out of Ramona’s 
           hands. Keeps moving toward her, absolutely determined.

                                 RAMONA
                        Get the fuck out of here.

                                 HARRY
                        Do you know me?

                                 RAMONA
                        Get the fuck out! 
                                 (calling)
                        Help! Help me!!

           Harry GRABS her, squeezes her arms--

                                 HARRY
                        Be quiet! Be quiet!

                                 RAMONA
                        Help!!

           She STRUGGLES from his grasp, PUSHES him -- and, 
           frenzied, he HITS her, his right hand striking her left 
           cheek. 

           She falls back, against the couch, her face burning red. 
           He reels back. Shocked by what he did. Unsure what to--

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Is that how you treated her once I left? 
                        She makes some noise and you shut her up?

           Harry freezes. Stares at her.

                                 HARRY
                        What did you just say?

                                 RAMONA
                        You heard me.

           His eyes go wide. At last, confirmation. Then--

                                 HARRY
                        My God... Why did...why did you lie to 
                        them? For God’s sake...

                                 RAMONA
                        Someone steal your kid? She’s better off 
                        without you.

           He SNAPS. Grabs her again, PUSHES her head against the 
           wall, raises his FIST, bubbling over with fury for what 
           she’s done--

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Go on! Go on!
                                 (then, clenched teeth)
                        Whatever you do, I’ve had worse.

           The fist frozen in mid-air...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        What is it? What are you waiting for? 
                        Join the club.

           Beat. He withdraws. They stare at one another. A moment.

           Harry steps back. Picks up the telephone. Plugs the wire 
           back in the wall, plops the telephone down on the table 
           in front of Ramona. His moves are quick, decisive. He 
           seems all at once more sure of himself. 

                                 HARRY
                        Tell them the truth.

                                 RAMONA
                        Now you want me to call the cops?

                                 HARRY
                        You don’t understand, do you?
           He stops. Reaches into his pocket. Pulls out his photo of 
           Sophie. Lays it down.

                                 RAMONA
                        I know what she looks like, thank you. 
                        You left me with her for six fucking 
                        months.

           The hatred in her words sends chills down Harry’s spine.

                                 HARRY
                        Is that it?

                                 RAMONA
                        You have no idea what you put me through--

                                 HARRY
                        I was in prison. I couldn’t see my own 
                        child, had no idea if she was even ok, by 
                        the time I got out she didn’t even 
                        recognize me. What -- you think that was 
                        by choice??

                                 RAMONA
                        And now you’re separated from her again? 
                        I’d think she’d be used to it by now.

           He’s speechless for a moment. No comeback.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        She’s better off without you. 

                                 HARRY
                        This from the woman who abandoned both of 
                        us--

           Shrieking, years of pain boiling to the surface--

                                 RAMONA
                        You abandoned me!!

           Beat. A moment passes. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I was good to you... I did things for you 
                        you don’t even know...

           Harry can see the anguish in her eyes, the hurt. And he 
           knows -- the memories coming back to him now, unfettered, 
           untainted by doubt -- that he’s contributed to it.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You blamed her. Your whole life going to 
                        shit -- you blamed it all on me and her. 
           The words hit Harry. He doesn’t know what to say. But 
           deep inside, he knows she might be right.

           Teetering, wishing he had done it all differently when he 
           had the chance--

                                 HARRY
                        I’m sorry for the things I’ve done... I 
                        know I’m a fuck-up. I’m a fuck-up and I 
                        was a bad father, but I am her father and 
                        they won’t believe me...

           Beat. He breathes in, collects himself. Ramona looks at 
           him, wavering now. Is he getting to her...?

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Please... You’re all I’ve got. Tell the 
                        police the truth. Tell them she’s my 
                        daughter.

           Ramona is silent. Shakes her head -- then stops. 

           Holds still. Looks at Harry again. Then eyes the phone... 

           She hesitates. Still wavering... And then, finally, she 
           picks it up.

           Harry breathes out, as Ramona dials...

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        9-1-1, state your emergency.

                                 RAMONA
                        This is Ramona Mendez at 114 Lafayette. 
                        The kidnapper Harry Novak is in my 
                        apartment. He’s armed.

           She HANGS UP. Harry can only look at her. Crestfallen, 
           betrayed. 

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        She’s better off without you.

           Beat. 

           Harry staggers back. Then runs out...

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Grabbing his coat, shouting to fellow COPS--

                                 VARGAS
                        We got the cocksucker. 114 Lafayette.
           He’s red-faced, like a hunter hungry for a kill.

                                 WALTERS
                        Stay here. Man the phones.

                                 VARGAS
                        What??

                                 WALTERS
                        You heard me.

           Can’t believe it. Following Walters as he heads for the 
           door--

                                 VARGAS
                        This is about to slip through our fingers 
                        ‘cause you wouldn’t put a fucking car 
                        outside her place.

                                 WALTERS
                        Our priority is the missing girl.

                                 VARGAS
                        You still believe him! It’s incredible. 
                        Too many years counseling, you forgot how 
                        to be a cop.

                                 WALTERS
                        It’s the same job, Rick. It’s helping 
                        people. You got other ideas, join a lynch 
                        mob. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Walters jumps in his car. Civilian vehicle, fishing gear 
           and papers in the back. Other cops race into other cars.

           Sirens blaze, tires smack asphalt, and they’re off -- as 
           Vargas watches, pissed, from his window...

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - DAY

           CLOSE on Harry’s cell. It BLINKS. It’s a “LOW BATTERY” 
           signal.

           He’s driving, the phone lying on the passenger seat next 
           to him. He reaches over, turns the phone off. 

           He gazes up at passing street signs. Slows down. Sees the 
           signs he’s looking for. 3rd Street and Nebraska Avenue.
           FLASH IMAGE: An earlier scene... Harry on the phone in 
           his apartment, scrawling down notes while Sophie stands 
           at the doorway... “1:30. Nebraska and 3rd.”

           Harry pulls over. Steps out. His expression says it all: 
           He suspects that phone call was a set-up, and he’s here 
           to confirm it...

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           A quiet road. Dilapidated house-fronts, withered trees, 
           and garbage on the sidewalks. There’s nothing in the way 
           of a movers’ business office or station here.

           What there is is a PHONE BOOTH. Harry feels in his 
           pocket. A few quarters. He heads to the booth, steps in, 
           and dials. 

                                 RECORDING
                        4-1-1 and more...

           A short jingle. Then--

                                 RECORDING (CONT’D)
                        City and state, please.

                                 HARRY
                        Los Angeles. California...

           Then--

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Thank you, what listing in Los Angeles?

                                 HARRY
                        R&P... R&P Auto...

           Beat. Sirens. Harry DUCKS. 

           A single cop car shoots by. Not one of Walters’ squad. 
           Harry slowly rises back up...

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        I have no listing for R&P Auto.

           Beat. Harry hangs up. Thinks. Dials a new number. Stops, 
           tries to remember the number -- then continues dialing.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Jefferson Auto Body Shop.
                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, I’m trying to find a...a...
                                 (remembering the name)
                        Cardullo... Anthony Cardullo... He called 
                        your shop... Maybe...a few days ago...

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        One sec.

           Harry waits. Looks around. On the watch for any other cop 
           cars...

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Nah, no calls from a Cardullo. Different 
                        name, maybe?

                                 HARRY
                        No, I don’t think so... Have you...have 
                        you ever heard of R&P Auto?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Nope.

           Harry nods. Just as expected.

                                 HARRY
                        Thank you very much...

           He hangs up.

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Cops make their way around, inspecting. Walters and a 
           couple of rookies, Reilly among them.

           We linger on Ramona, standing in the corner, watching the 
           police move about... Her thoughts drift, as do her 
           eyes...

           She thinks... Seems uneasy...

           Then -- she sees Reilly notice the photo of Sophie, the 
           one Harry left, face-up on the nearest table. 

           Beat. Reilly moves on, and Ramona discretely reaches for 
           the photo and slides it into her back pocket.

           Then--

                                 WALTERS
                        All right, ma’am...
           Motioning his partners toward the door, turning back to 
           Ramona, handing her a card--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        You see him or hear anything from him 
                        again, you call me on this number. That’s 
                        a direct line.

           She nods, takes the card. Her uneasiness seems to be 
           building... Something is eating at her...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a cell?

           She looks up at him. Nods. Walters whips out a pen, 
           writes on the back of his card--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        This is the number he might still be 
                        using. Watch out for it.

           Ramona takes the card. Looks at it. Harry’s number. Looks 
           back at Walters. Seems about to say something...

           But she holds back. Walters steps out. The door closes 
           shut. Beat.

           Ramona stays still for a moment. Wavering, uncertain... 
           She inches toward a window. Gazes out. The cops are 
           returning to their cars. A few drive off...

           Beat. Ramona lingers. She looks back at Walters’ card. 
           Then slides it into her pocket... 

           Feels something... Something in that same pocket... She 
           pulls out Sophie’s PHOTO...

           Looks at it. Thinks... 

           Starts to tremble. The image overwhelms her...

           She reaches back into her pocket... Pulls the card back 
           out... Walters’ number... 

           And, on the flip side of the card, Harry’s...

           Beat.

           Ramona hurries across the room, TEARS into a pile of 
           trash on the counter-top... 

           A battered CELL PHONE slides out. She dials...
           Holds the phone to her ear... Waits, her heart beating 
           furiously...

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Harry... Driving... We PAN OVER to the cell phone on the 
           passenger seat... Turned off...

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ramona... Her phone still to her ear... Waiting...

           The call goes to voicemail... She hesitates, then starts--

                                 RAMONA
                        Harry... It’s me...

           About to continue, she chokes. Stops. Hangs up.

           Terrified... Shaking... She can’t take it... Tears 
           welling up... She types out a TEXT MESSAGE: “I’m so 
           sorry. I want to help. I need to meet you. Ramona.”

           Beat. She presses SEND. Waits. Looks down at Walters’ 
           card again...

           The number stares back at her... She takes a deep breath. 
           Takes the plunge--

           INT. WALTERS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Walters’ CELL goes off. He grabs it, driving.

                                 WALTERS
                        Walters.

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        Harry Novak’s telling you the truth.

           Beat.

           EXT. WALTERS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The CAR comes to a SCREECHING STOP.

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Walters bursts in. Out of breath, harried, doesn’t want 
           to be fucked with--
                                 WALTERS
                        Are you screwing with me?

                                 RAMONA
                        No...

                                 WALTERS
                        Be straight. The girl who’s missing -- 
                        Sophie, Wren, whatever the fuck her name 
                        is -- are you her mother?

                                 RAMONA
                        I am Sophie Novak’s mother.

           Beat. She starts to cry. Walters hangs back.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I’m her mother... I don’t deserve to say 
                        that, but I am...

           Walters watches her tears... 

           And, suddenly, he seems to regret having cursed at her. 
           Seems to feel a pang of pity. She’s a sorry sight...

                                 WALTERS
                        Ok... It’s ok...

           His WALKIE-TALKIE crackles. He switches it off.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Take a moment.

           Then, softly, it’s ok--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Do you want something? Some water?

           Ramona breathes out, wipes her tears away...

                                 RAMONA
                        Coffee...

                                 WALTERS
                        Coffee. I’ll make you some coffee.

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ramona sits at her kitchen table. Walters approaches, cup 
           of coffee in hand. He sets the cup down in front of her, 
           takes a seat.
           He sees a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH leaning on a shelf. Looks at 
           it. A young girl with a bicycle. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Is that you?

           Ramona nods. Eyes red from the tears.

           Walters looks at the photo some more... Takes note of the 
           girl’s face. Things are making more sense.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        You look like Sophie...

           Ramona nods again. Tears coming back, slowly...

           Then--

                                 RAMONA
                        My mom bought me that bike.

           Beat.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        She didn’t know about Sophie. No one 
                        did... I was so young... I didn’t want 
                        anyone to know...

           And then, the words pouring out...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t understand it... You’re holding 
                        this child, who thinks wonderful things 
                        are on the way...

           She stops. Holds back her tears.

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        I tried to make Harry happy... He has no 
                        idea how hard I tried...

           And then the tears come. Streaming down again...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        My sweet Sophie... I’m so sorry...

           Walters reaches out to her. Takes her hand. He seems a 
           different man. Genuinely concerned...

                                 WALTERS
                        We all make mistakes. I spent five years 
                        talking to parents with missing children. 
                        They all had regrets. Skeletons.
                                 RAMONA
                        Were the children found...?

           Beat. Walters hesitates before answering. It pains him...

                                 WALTERS
                        Never.

           He sees the effect the word has on Ramona. Softly, almost 
           tenderly, as though reaching within himself and opening--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        We want to protect our children. 
                        But...protecting them in a world like 
                        this is... It’s more complicated than you 
                        think... It requires compromise...

           Beat. A moment of silence. He lets the words hang. Then--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Could you testify that Harry Novak is 
                        Sophie’s father?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes...

                                 WALTERS
                        Will you testify that Harry Novak is 
                        Sophie’s father?

                                 RAMONA
                        Yes...

           Beat. Walters nods.

                                 WALTERS
                        Ok.

           And then, like a bolt of lightning, he WHIPS out his GUN 
           and FIRES a single round into Ramona’s forehead.

           The bullet TEARS through her skull, blood spurting out. 
           Her eyes curl back as she FALLS FACE-FORWARD against the 
           table.

           A thin cloud of smoke wafts up. Then -- silence, and the 
           stench of blood...

           Walters, poker-faced, unperturbed, rises to his feet. 
           Walks over to Ramona. Looks down at her. Her eyes are 
           frozen wide, her cheek against the table, blood dripping 
           from the hole in her forehead...

           She’s dead.
           Walters looks around. Peeks into the hallway. Makes sure 
           no one is coming. Gazes out the window. Coast is clear.

           He reaches into his pocket. Procures a LATEX GLOVE. 
           Slides it on with the same care and delicacy we saw when 
           he covered his hand after slicing fish.

           He heads back to the kitchen. Grabs a cloth. Wipes down 
           the coffee-maker, the pantries, the cup by Ramona’s head. 
           Then stops. Sees the photo of Sophie. It’s fallen out of 
           Ramona’s pocket, with Walters’ card. 

           He picks the photo up. Wipes it with the cloth as well, 
           sets it down on the table. Takes the card.

           He’s heading toward the door, ready to leave, when--

           A BUZZ. He turns. On the couch, just a few feet away, is 
           Ramona’s cell phone, illuminated.

           Walters’ eyebrow rises. Who could that be...?

           He slowly makes his way over. Looks down.

           A new text message has come in. He recognizes the 
           NUMBER...

           He procures his card, looks at Harry’s number. It’s the 
           SAME ONE...

           Suddenly excited, he picks up Ramona’s phone. Opens the 
           message.

           It reads: “When?”

           Befuddled, Walters scrolls back to the main menu. Clicks 
           on the OUTBOX. Reads the latest sent message: 

           “I’m so sorry. I want to help. I need to meet you. 
           Ramona.”

           Walters’ thoughts are churning. He can see his 
           opportunity...

           He types out a new message to Harry:

           “Tonight. 8pm. La Placita. 535 N Main St.”

           EXT. HARRY’S CAR - DAY

           Harry, sitting by his car, at the same spot as before, 
           hunched over his phone -- which is turned on now, but 
           blinking constantly...
           Beat. He waits. Types back...

           INT. RAMONA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Harry’s response comes in: “I’ll be there.” Walters 
           breathes out. Pockets Ramona’s phone. Takes out his own. 
           Dials.

           Beat. Then, nervous, dead-serious--

                                 WALTERS
                        Veille... Listen... We just had a bit of 
                        a brush-up... We have to take care of 
                        Novak before it gets out of hand...
                                 (pause)
                        La Placita at Olvera. The church. 8pm. 
                        Take Frear’s car.
                                 (about to hang up, then,)
                        And don’t miss.

           EXT. LOT - DAY

           Harry pockets his phone. Heads for his car, determined...

           INT. HARRY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Gets in, gazes to his side... Re-reads the message...

           “La Placita”...

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

           The skyline. Clusters of homes crouched by the crests of 
           hills, the downtown towers shooting through the smog 
           beyond. Black clouds hang overhead. 

           A rumble of thunder...

           EXT. OLVERA STREET - DUSK

           The dark before a rainstorm. Harry’s car pulls up.

           Across the street is a modest white-stone church, old 
           Spanish style. La Placita.

           He turns, pulls up, parks. Steps out, passing a row of 
           taquerias and bead shops. A TV is playing in the back of 
           a burrito stand. Audio buzzing, flies circling the 
           antenna.
           And then the voice of an ANCHOR...

                                 ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        ...one of the biggest storms Los Angeles 
                        has seen in years, which threatens to 
                        severely impede the ongoing search for 
                        Wren Hollander...

           Harry stops. Turns. There on the screen is an image he 
           recognizes well: the PHOTO of Sophie...

           Jake Hollander appears next. It’s the footage of him and 
           his wife, facing reporters outside the Beverly Hills 
           Plaza Hotel.

                                 JAKE
                        ...might still be wearing her tie-dyed 
                        shirt... She has earrings... She’s 
                        missing one of them... Brown hair... The 
                        posters have the most recent image we 
                        have of her...

           And next, a photo of Harry. The Anchor continues...

                                 ANCHOR
                        ...any information regarding Harold 
                        Novak’s whereabouts...

           Harry keeps moving, heads into the church -- just as the 
           first PELLETS OF RAIN hit...

           INT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           The church is empty. Cold, a few flickering candles, a 
           Virgin Mary statuette at the altar.

           Harry looks around.

           Checks his phone. 7:59pm.

           Moves forward. Takes a seat toward the front. 

           EXT. LA PLACITA - MOMENTS LATER

           The rain builds... Soon it’s a downpour...

           INT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           Harry sits. Looks behind. No one in sight. 

           Silence... Just the drumming of the rain outside... 
           He checks his phone again. The battery is blinking, on 
           its last legs. He revisits the earlier text:

           “La Placita”...

           He looks around again... Then back at his phone... Clicks 
           on the text... 

           OPTIONS... CALL BACK...

           Beat. He presses. The call goes out. He holds the phone 
           to his ear... Hears the RING TONE...

           INT. WALTERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Walters sits at his desk. Fishing medallions cluttered 
           with police documents. A PHONE GOES OFF. Loud ringing. He 
           feels it in his pocket. Reaches in. 

           It’s RAMONA’S CELL. He eyes it. Thinks.

           Suddenly -- the DOOR SWINGS OPEN.

                                 VARGAS (O.S.)
                        You hear what happened?

           Walters spins around, startled. Reaches for the cell. 
           Presses SILENT.

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sorry... I... Was that call...?

                                 WALTERS
                        No, no, it’s fine... It’s nothing...

           Swiftly, discretely, he TURNS THE PHONE OFF, sticks it in 
           his pocket. 

           INT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           On Harry. Hears the RING-TONE stop. The call goes to 
           VOICEMAIL:

                                 RAMONA (O.S.)
                        This is Ramona Mendez... Leave a 
                        message...

           Harry lowers the phone. Then--

           He hears SOMETHING ELSE. Footsteps, right outside the 
           church... He turns around... Looks at the doors...
           He can tell someone is there... The footsteps are growing 
           louder...

           INT./EXT. WALTERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Back to Walters and Vargas.

                                 VARGAS
                        It’s just... Ramona Mendez was shot this 
                        afternoon. A few hours after we saw her. 
                        And ballistics is already saying it’s one 
                        of our bullets.

           Walters looks at him.

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        So... Guess what that means.

                                 WALTERS
                        Well, Novak ran off with one of our 
                        weapons...

                                 VARGAS
                        Exactly.
                                 (then,)
                        So you still think you were right about 
                        the car? 

                                 WALTERS
                        What, outside her place? No, fine... No, 
                        you were...you were right, there should 
                        have been one...

           Vargas smiles. Vindicated. 

           Then, lightening the mood, while still trying to dig it 
           in--

                                 VARGAS
                        Very big of you. I mean why wouldn’t you 
                        want one, right? 

           Walters nods.

                                 WALTERS
                        Right...

           Vargas smiles again. Nods back, steps out, closes the 
           door.

           Then -- he stops. 

           Something has just come to him. He thinks for a moment.
           Looks back at Walters. 

           Then he moves on...

           BACK TO WALTERS. Sees that Vargas has left. Breathes. 

           WE DRIFT DOWN TO HIS POCKET... CLOSE ON RAMONA’S PHONE... 
           NOW SWITCHED OFF...

           INT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           Harry dials his phone again. His eyes on the doors, he 
           puts in a second call to RAMONA...

           The footsteps stop. Whoever it is is standing by the 
           door, just outside...

           Harry raises the phone to his ear. But this time -- NO 
           RING TONE. The call goes immediately to VOICEMAIL.

           Beat. Harry knows something is not right... 

           He locks on the doors... Ever so slowly lowers his 
           phone...

           A silent moment passes...

           WE MOVE TO THE DOORS... CLOSER... CLOSER...

           THEY BURST OPEN. A MAN IN A SKI MASK marches in, a .45 
           AUTOMATIC raised, ready to kill. 

           But no one’s here. The pews are empty.

           And then -- the BARREL of a gun grazes the MAN’s MASK.

                                 HARRY
                        Drop it.

           Harry has cornered him. He’s standing to the Man’s left 
           side, the gun he stole from Litvak pointed straight at 
           the Man’s temple. But the Man doesn’t move.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Drop it.

           The Man stays still. His eyes slowly turn, fix on 
           Harry...

           Harry keeps the gun pointed... But we can tell he’s never 
           aimed one before in his life...
           The Man SWINGS around, WHIPS his gun back against Harry -- 
           the butt of it STRIKING Harry’s face as...

           ...Harry’s own gun GOES OFF. 

           The bullet whizzes through the air, hits the wall... The 
           Man TACKLES Harry to the floor, as BOTH GUNS GO FLYING... 

           Harry KNEES the Man’s ribs, SWINGS his arm against him... 
           The Man FALLS off... Scrambles to his feet... Harry 
           retrieves his gun, AIMS again... 

           The Man RUNS... Heading for the back door...

           Harry FIRES... The bullet HITS a window... The Man ducks 
           from the glass shards, keeps running, out the door...

           EXT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           ...into the torrential rain...

           INT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           Harry RACES after his assailant, gun in hand, dashing out 
           the same exit...

           EXT. LA PLACITA - CONTINUOUS

           ...into the rain as well. A parking lot dotted with trash 
           cans. Harry RUNS as fast as he can...

           THE MAN runs ahead... Turns a corner... Hits Olvera 
           Street...

           EXT. OLVERA STREET - CONTINUOUS

           An old-fashioned market, historic Spanish-style homes... 
           HARRY runs after... Almost slipping in the rain... 
           Visibility is low... The storefront awnings are up, and 
           drenched... This is a city that doesn’t much know what to 
           do with the rain...

           THE MASKED MAN keeps running... COLLIDES into a market 
           STALL... Fruits and vegetables go flying... The few 
           PEOPLE there reel back...

           HARRY slips on the FRUIT... Comes down hard... Cuts his 
           palm on the pavement... Gets back up, keeps moving...
           THE MAN turns another corner... Dashes past another 
           church... Toward a busier street... The HONKING of cars 
           whooshing past... THE MAN dives into the road, speeds 
           across it... HARRY falling behind...

           A CAR nearly HITS THE MAN... He darts out of the way, 
           skims against more oncoming traffic, keeps going... 

           HARRY reaches the road... Runs out... More HONKING... The 
           screeching of tires... A VAN almost knocks him back...

           The MAN disappears into an ALLEY...

           HARRY runs after him...

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Potholes, knee-deep puddles, rotting trash... THE MAN 
           knocks against a garbage can... It topples over...

           HARRY turns into the ALLEY... Sees the MAN...

           ON THE MAN. Running... Spots a CHAIN-LINK fence up 
           ahead...

           ON HARRY. Panting... Drenched in rain and sweat...

           ON THE MAN. Reaching the fence... Climbing...

           ON HARRY. Getting closer...

           ON THE MAN. Nearing the top of the fence...

           ON HARRY. Reaching the fence... Jumping up...

           THE MAN pivots over the top... HARRY climbs, reaches his 
           arm out, pulls himself upward until he...

           GRABS the MAN... TACKLES him...

           The two FALL from the top of the fence, LANDING on the 
           pavement below. Objects go scattering from their 
           pockets...

           One of those objects is a SWISS ARMY KNIFE...

           The MAN, dazed, gropes for the knife, GRABS it, flips out 
           the BLADE, SWINGS it toward Harry...

           Harry BLOCKS the MAN’s arm...

           The BLADE comes back toward Harry, SURGING UP again, but 
           Harry just manages to PIN it, PUSH it away...
           The BLADE CATCHES the MAN’s throat. DIGS INTO IT.

           Harry reels back -- but it’s too late. The knife is deep 
           into the MAN’s jugular. He’s coughing up blood...

           Harry immediately pulls out the knife... Grabs the MAN’s 
           head... Eyes burning--

                                 HARRY
                        Where is she? Where’s Sophie??

           But the Man doesn’t answer. His mouth hangs open, his 
           body in convulsions, his eyes circling, going blank...

           Frantic, Harry TEARS off the mask, tries to give the Man 
           room to breathe... Stops as soon as he can see the Man’s 
           face.

           It’s the KID from the highway. The KID with the stalled 
           car.

           And the Swiss Army knife? It’s the same one Harry used to 
           fix the Kid’s car.

           A pool of blood spreads out underneath the Kid. Harry 
           realizes he’s seconds from death. He leans in closer... 

           Softer, trying to get through to him--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where is she...?

           The Kid shakes a few more times... Then goes still.

           Harry lingers. Looks both ways. No one in sight. The rain 
           continues to pound. 

           He reaches into the Kid’s right pocket. Pulls out a pack 
           of tissues. Chewing gum. No phone. No wallet. No ID.

           Harry looks around the corpse, to see what fell out of 
           the pocket. Picks up a KEY RING. On it a house key, a car 
           ignition key, and an electronic key fob. That’s it.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry, bleeding, soaked, but grimly determined, crosses 
           the street. 

           Sees a car. Press the fob. Nothing. Sees another. Ditto.
           EXT. LA PLACITA - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry retracing his footsteps. Searching...

           Every car in the area is a possibility...

           His hand on the keys, he circles the church. Then spots, 
           across the road, a PARKING LOT...

           INT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dim lighting, damp air. Harry wanders about the lower 
           level, the keys raised. He presses. Listens. Moves. 
           Presses again. Listens.

           Makes his way up to the next level...

           There he does the same. Passes one car after another, 
           aiming the electronic fob at each one. No success.

           Suddenly -- a trio of PEOPLE pass by. One WOMAN and two 
           MEN. 

           Immediately aware he looks suspicious, Harry averts his 
           gaze, turns his cheek...

           But he’s already been spotted.

                                 WOMAN
                                 (smiling)
                        I can never remember where I park either.

           Harry looks at her. Nods. Smiles back. Keeps most of his 
           face turned away.

           The WOMAN and her companions move on. Harry walks to 
           another row of vehicles, trying to gain distance...

           And then he stops. 

           He’s seen something.

           There, right in front of him, is a WHITE MINI-VAN with a 
           SMILEY-FACE STICKER on the back window. 

           Harry recognizes it. The van on the 405...

           Beat. Harry looks back at the fob. Raises it.

           A BEEP. The van UNLOCKS.
           INT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Harry enters. Looks around. Nothing inside at first 
           glance. No suspicious objects, no traces of anything.

           He opens the glove compartment. Registration papers. He 
           unfolds them. The listed name: CALVIN FREAR.

           He searches some more... Above the audio player... A 
           screen...

           He turns the car on. The screen flickers to life. GPS.

           Seizing on the opportunity, Harry taps “PREVIOUS 
           DESTINATIONS”.

           The first one listed: 435 Alameda Drive, Marina del Rey.

           Harry shifts the car into reverse and backs out.

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

           A NEWS ANCHOR addresses the camera:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        A woman was shot to death this morning in 
                        Torrance. 26-year-old Ramona Mendez was 
                        found by police after neighbors reported 
                        sounds of gunfire...

           A PHOTO OF RAMONA fills the screen behind the Anchor...

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        Reports are inconclusive at the moment, 
                        but it appears police have reason to 
                        suspect alleged kidnapper Harold Novak of 
                        the crime...

           And, once again, the MUG SHOT OF HARRY...

           EXT. ALAMEDA DRIVE - DAY

           A street sign: “ALAMEDA DRIVE”. The rain continues...

           The MINI-VAN pulls up. Harry gets out. Looks both ways. 
           Approaches the door of a house. 435...

           Looks at the KEY RING. Pulls out the HOUSE KEY, tries it 
           on the door. It doesn’t fit.

           Keeping his eyes peeled, he slowly moves around back. 
           Spots a window. Peers through. It’s dark inside...
           He props himself, tries pulling the window up. It’s 
           opened.

           Carefully, he CRAWLS IN...

           INT. 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE - DAY

           He moves slowly... Feels by his waist... Pulls out the 
           GUN...

           The place is dank, dust-filled. He switches on a light. A 
           dim, orange glow. 

           Keeps moving. Passes a KITCHEN. Crusted oven, old boxes 
           of cereal opened, bag of dog food. Moves to another ROOM. 
           A small fish tank. A few pictures on the wall. He eyes 
           them. The same MIDDLE-AGED MAN in a few of them. No one 
           Harry recognizes...

           And no one seems to be home...

           INT. WALTERS’ OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Walters... Holding his cell... Waiting for a call...

           INT. 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry tears through every drawer he can find, pulse 
           quickened, eyes darting to and fro...

           He finds a few stray photos. Some bills. Nothing else. 
           Heads to another drawer. Just clothes.

           Moves into what seems to be a BEDROOM. A desk. Cards, 
           unopened envelopes. The name CALVIN FREAR everywhere. 

           Pulls open the nearest desk drawer. There, staring back 
           at him, are TWO ID-STYLE PHOTOS.

           One of him. One of Sophie. Both taken about half a year 
           ago.

           The photos are attached by paperclip to a Xeroxed 
           document. It’s a photocopy of Harry’s DRIVER’S LICENSE. 
           Next to it, a filled-out form. Harry’s handwriting 
           scrawled all over.

           Slots for name, age, occupation, children, dependents, 
           insurance... A heading at the top: SANTA MONICA POLICE 
           DEPARTMENT. Next to that: WORK ELIGIBLE. The date: 
           DECEMBER 17, 2009.
           Harry stares down at the documents, eyes welling, rage 
           poking through... 

           They’re the WORK FORMS he filed at the police department, 
           the ones he mentioned to Walters...

           He turns. Heads out the room. Sees a HOUSE PHONE. Picks 
           it up out of its holder. It’s a touch-tone. He inspects 
           it, thinking...

           Presses MENU. Text flashes: CALL RECORDS. He selects, and 
           a list appears: MISSED CALLS, INCOMING CALLS, OUTGOING 
           CALLS. Presses the latter. A series of phone numbers pops 
           up.

           At the top of the series, the following: 3104471025.

           He presses CALL. The number is dialed, and he waits. A 
           voice comes on the other end--

                                 VOICE
                        Tucci’s. Pick up or delivery?

           Harry hangs up. Scrolls down. The next number down in the 
           series: 3102217010. He calls it.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Blockbuster Video, how may I help you?

           Hangs up again. Calls the third number down: 3104751388.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Los Angeles Police Department S.I.U., 
                        this is Hollis Walters’ office.

           Harry takes it in. Almost breaks into a smile. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m sorry. Wrong number.

           He hangs up. Heads back to the bedroom desk. Flips 
           through the papers. Finds a new stack. The heading: “T-
           MOBILE RED PLAN.” 

           Familiar words. He looks, thinks. Remembers... 

           Picks the phone back up and dials.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, hi, this is Calvin Frear, I’m on 
                        your Red Plan...
           Waits. Hesitant, unsure of what he’s doing now...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Well, I... I wondered if...

           Thinks for a second. It comes to him.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You see, I have some bills in the mail 
                        for...for payments you’re saying are 
                        overdue... But I don’t think they’re 
                        right, and I...I need a copy of my phone 
                        records for this month... Do you have an 
                        office where I could pick that up? 

           EXT. 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE - DAY

           Harry races out. Dives into the mini-van. Speeds away...

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - EVENING

           Dusk. The storm is ushering in the night sooner than 
           usual. A hush falls over the city as the rain grows 
           lighter, winds echoing through the downtown corridors...

           INT. BEVERLY PLAZA HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT

           Jake and Ellen Hollander sit side by side in their hotel 
           suite... Silent, withered with stress... Cast gazes out 
           the window, to the storm outside...

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Walters EXITS his office, still waiting for that call. 
           Raincoat on, ready to head out, hand on his cell, tapping 
           nervously...

           He calls back to his SECRETARY--

                                 WALTERS
                        See you tomorrow, Nancy...

           Passes by Reilly, Vargas, and a few other COPS milling 
           about, wiling away the last office hours with chit-chat--

                                 REILLY
                        I hear it’s only getting worse. Hurricane 
                        Molly or something. And people here can’t 
                        drive for shit in the rain. 
                                 COP
                        Christ, I moved here to get away from the 
                        weather.
                                 (sees Walters)
                        Hollis! Going fishing?

           Walters turns. Manages a thin chuckle--

                                 WALTERS
                        Ha... Right...

           But he’s visibly distracted. Uneasy.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        See you guys tomorrow...

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           It’s pitch black outside now. Walters crosses the lot, 
           finds his car, slips in, sticks the key in the ignition. 
           Eyes his phone again. Checks for messages. None.

           Then he spots something... Up ahead, across the lot, a 
           car he recognizes... It’s the WHITE MINI-VAN.

           At that instant, the COCKING OF A GUN. The barrel pressed 
           to the back of Walters’ neck--

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Drive.

           EXT. FREEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The rain has surged back up. The city is at a standstill.

           Slowly, Walters’ vehicle crawls along. We HEAR A VOICE--

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Pull off here.

           INT. WALTERS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Walters takes a turn. Pulls off onto a deserted stretch 
           of road. Crouched houses, garbage rotting. We’re close to 
           gangland...

                                 HARRY
                        Stop the car.

           Walters does as told. He’s terrified. 
           Harry’s seated directly behind him, his gun still on 
           Walters’ neck. He turns around, makes sure no cars are in 
           sight. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Don’t kill me... Please... 

                                 HARRY
                        Shut the fuck up. 

           He slides his door open, swings out and back through the 
           front. Now he’s next to Walters, the two face to face.

           He bends his finger around the trigger. Ready to fire...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me where she is or I spray the car 
                        with your brains. 

                                 WALTERS
                        You don’t understand...

           Harry grabs Walters’ hair, SMASHES his head against the 
           dashboard. He’s not going to waste any time.

                                 HARRY
                        Tell me where she is!

           Walters is shaking, bleeding, teeth clattering... But he 
           seems almost as scared of talking... Harry digs the gun 
           into his forehead...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna count to three, you--

                                 WALTERS
                        You don’t want to know...

                                 HARRY
                        Tell me, you fucking--

                                 WALTERS
                        She’s dead!!!

           Beat. The words hit Harry in the stomach.

                                 HARRY
                        No...

           He regains his senses. Finger still on the trigger.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Bullshit. You wouldn’t go through all 
                        this to kill her...
                                 WALTERS
                        We weren’t going to kill her, you dumb 
                        fuck! Where the hell do you think you 
                        are, in a fucking spy movie? What did you 
                        think this was -- some grand conspiracy??

           Harry freezes. Walters goes on, spitting out the words...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        A little extra dough, that’s all this was 
                        for. Happens everyday. San Fran yuppies 
                        thinking it was their kid -- you think I 
                        had something to do with that??

           Beat. On Harry... Is it true?

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        But you just had to start running, didn’t 
                        you? Why couldn’t you have listened to 
                        me? I begged you not to run, Harry...  

           Harry starts to shake, the gun going loose in his hand...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Remember? But you ran. Christ, how many 
                        people did that kill?? Ramona, Sophie--

                                 HARRY
                        You’re lying, Sophie’s alive...

                                 WALTERS
                        They stuck her head in a bathtub, Harry!

           Harry breaks down. Vomit coursing through his throat. Dry 
           heaves. Walters locks his eyes on the gun...

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        They panicked, I tried to stop them... 
                        But she wouldn’t stop crying...

           Tears streaming out--

                                 HARRY
                        How...how could you do that to my 
                        girl...?

           He’s overtaken... His gun is shaking, about to drop, 
           when...

           Walters seizes the chance and LUNGES FORWARD.

           He PINS Harry’s arm back, WHIPS out his own firearm...    
           BLAM! The gun GOES OFF, misses Harry... Glass SHATTERS, 
           shards dig into both men’s cheeks... 

           Harry PUSHES Walters forward, against the door, which 
           SWINGS open...

           The men TUMBLE OUT of the car and into the middle of the 
           road just as...

           EXT. WALTERS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           HEADLIGHTS slash through the black...

           A BLINDING white light, Harry barely has a second to 
           register...

           TIRES SCREECHING, a CAR’s brakes going haywire in the 
           water, just before...

           CRASH! The car HITS HARRY. 

           His body SNAPS back against the windshield, FLIES up the 
           roof like a piece of cardboard, LANDS on the asphalt in a 
           splash of rain, blood, glass, and chipped teeth.

           Walters is left standing. Luck by a matter of inches.

           The car SWERVES back, hydroplaning, the brakes digging 
           in... Finally comes to a stop at the end of the block...

           All goes silent.

           ON HARRY... Unconscious. Lips to the road, face awash in 
           blood. 

           ON WALTERS... Gasping for breath. Trying to get a handle 
           on the situation. Turns to his right. The car that hit 
           Harry. The driver is wheeling back...

           Panicky again, Walters dives down, grabs his gun from the 
           ground. FIRES into the air.

           The car heaves to a stop. Its wheels spin back -- reverse 
           switching to drive -- and it SPEEDS AWAY...

           Walters breathes out. Looks back at Harry. 

           ON HARRY... Eyes closed. No movement. 

           ON WALTERS... Thinking fast. Leans back down, starts 
           scouring the asphalt. Looking for something... 

           ON HARRY... Slowly, one eye opens. 
           He’s still motionless, the breath knocked out of him, his 
           body lined with cuts and bruises, the rain pounding 
           down... 

           Then he sees something... Lying on the road, just inches 
           from his arm...

           His wallet, fallen from his pocket. And, a few more 
           inches away -- SOPHIE’S EARRING...

           A moment -- and then it hits him. 

           The earring...

           ON WALTERS... Back turned. Spots what he’s looking for. 
           Harry’s gun. 

           ON HARRY... Sees, out of the corner of his eye, that 
           Walters isn’t looking. So, carefully, he nudges his hand 
           forward -- and GRABS the earring.

           ON WALTERS... Picks up the gun, tosses it into his car, 
           turns back to Harry.

           Looks both ways, then walks over to the body. Harry’s 
           eyes are closed again. No movement. 

           His hand, however, is now IN A DIFFERENT POSITION -- and 
           we can just glimpse his wallet peeking out of his pocket. 

           Walters rolls Harry over. Blood and dirt everywhere. He 
           grabs Harry’s head. Limp. He’s not breathing.  

                                 WALTERS
                        Ok...

           He takes a moment. Thinks. Looks both ways again, then 
           GRABS Harry’s legs and DRAGS him to the car. POPS the 
           trunk.

           Walters speeds through the rain, dabbing at his own cuts. 
           Whips out his cell. Dials.

                                 WALTERS
                        He’s dead... He’s in my trunk... Because 
                        I couldn’t fucking leave the body out, 
                        it’s got my blood all over it... I’ll 
                        explain later, point is we’re good to go 
                        now. Will you be ready in the morning?... 
                        I’ll dump him, then pack up. Ten hours.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALTERS (CONT'D)
                                 (then,)
                        Ok. Be ready.

           He hangs up, floors the gas, as we catch a glimpse of a 
           sign: PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY...

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The freeway, speckled with headlights. Just off to the 
           side, the rain-spattered surf...

           EXT. PIER - TOPANGA BEACH - NIGHT

           Walters’ car pulls into a lot... Still speeding...

           Up ahead is an electrical dock. Lights off, no one in 
           sight. A few FISHING BOATS rocking back and forth in the 
           waves by the pier. Walters’ fishing haunt...

           Walters PARKS next to his boat. A Montauk whaler, two-man 
           size, covered cockpit, walkway. The name “DELILAH” 
           imprinted on the side. Below it, in smaller lettering: 
           “SAN FRANCISCO”.

           He steps out. Opens his trunk. Looks around him, makes 
           sure the coast is clear. Then bends down and PULLS out 
           Harry’s body...

           EXT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Walters untying the ropes... Starting the boat... 

           Harry lies face-down on the walkway, within Walters’ 
           sight...

           EXT. BOAT - LATER

           The boat speeds along the surface, spewing froth. The 
           lights of the Pacific Coast Highway fade in the distance.

           EXT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           Walters PULLS the throttle back. The boat SHAKES, then 
           comes to a stop. Darkness all around. 

           Walters turns, heads toward Harry. We get a quick VIEW of 
           the surroundings. Fishing rods deck the cockpit, as do a 
           few photos of Walters with catch. Also strewn about are 
           water bottles -- one with its label PARTLY SCRATCHED-OFF.
           Walters grabs a WEIGHT. Coils a rope through it, ties it 
           around Harry’s leg. Lifts up the weight with a groan... 
           Tips it over the bow...

           Looks at Harry again. Eyes still closed. Face and body 
           still blood-drenched. 

                                 WALTERS
                        Sorry...

           He lets the weight DROP. A heavy SPLASH, as Harry’s body 
           is DRAGGED down with it... Into the cold, black water...

           In a matter of seconds, Harry’s body is subsumed by the 
           waves. Walters watches, then waits. Nothing resurfaces. 

           He breathes out. It’s done. 

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Underwater... Only slivers of light... We can make out a 
           rope, a leg... 

           Then -- HANDS grasping at the rope. Undoing it. The leg 
           breaking free...

           EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           Walters STARTS the boat up again... Turns the wheel...

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           The water’s surface. Foam spraying out from the boat’s 
           wake, just as...

           Harry EMERGES. Gasping for air. He keeps low, as the boat 
           hurtles away...

           He takes a deep breath. Calms himself. Then STARTS 
           SWIMMING...

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Walters’ car pulls in, engine roaring... Walters parks, 
           races out of his car -- and to the WHITE MINI-VAN... 

           Jumps in and drives the van away...
           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Rain plummeting down like pellets... Harry struggles 
           forward, summoning all his strength, the old swimmer in 
           him... Ahead, barely visible, are the lights of the 
           city...

           He stops... Claws for a breath... Floats on his back, 
           trying desperately to regain his force...

           INT. 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE - NIGHT

           Walters bursts through the front door. Sweating, 
           frenzied. He’s on a clock.

           Beelines toward the nearest set of drawers. Starts 
           rummaging, gathering things. Papers float to the floor. 
           Photos. The work form. Call records.

           Searches cabinets. Finds LIGHTER FLUID. Douses the 
           papers. Lights a match.

           Moves on to another room... Searching for more 
           evidence... Anything incriminating...

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Harry still floating... Exhausted, aching, trembling... 

           He knows he can’t stop. He gazes ahead. The lights are 
           closer now. He has to keep going. 

           Taking another deep breath, gathering all the energy he 
           has left, he starts swimming again... 

           EXT. 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE - NIGHT

           Walters hurries out, down the street, phone to his ear...

                                 WALTERS
                        Did you get me the cab?... No, I got 
                        access to the phone records -- and the 
                        DNA test’ll be easy, no different than 
                        the hospital records... Fuck’s sake, calm 
                        down. Is the cab coming?... Good.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           Harry... Arms aching, vision growing blurry... He’s 
           almost there...
           He stops... Breathes... Keeps going... Waves growing 
           stronger... 

           He stops again... Lets one of the waves pick him up... 
           Lets it carry him...to FIRM GROUND.

           His feet catch the SAND... He crawls to dry land, near 
           collapse... Sinks to the ground... Can’t move...

           He’s panting, throbbing, spent. But he’s made it.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - MORNING

           A stretch of dilapidated storefronts, tucked away in 
           Torrance. The rain has stopped. The morning sun is faint, 
           glimmering out from deep puddles in the sidewalk. 

           A car pulls up. It’s Walters’. He steps out. Across the 
           street is a crumbling HOUSE. Boarded windows, rotting 
           wood.

           A PIZZERIA is on the opposite corner. TUCCI’S PIZZA.

           INT. TUCCI’S - CONTINUOUS

           Walters pokes his head inside. A lone EMPLOYEE is 
           sweeping the floor, readying the place for opening.

                                 WALTERS
                                 (flashing his badge)
                        LAPD. That house across the street. You 
                        seen anyone entering or exiting it since 
                        you got here?

                                 EMPLOYEE
                                 (thick Mexican accent)
                        No...

           Walters nods.

                                 WALTERS
                        Stay inside, there’s going to be trouble.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Walters heads for the house... Takes out his walkie-
           talkie... Looks around...   
           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Heads around back... Sees the BASEMENT ENTRANCE... The 
           door is creaked open...

           Pulling out his gun, Walters slowly, cautiously enters...

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Flickering red lights, cockroaches scurrying over old 
           Chinese food. Walters keeps moving, gun raised. Turns a 
           corner. Pushes open a door.

           There, sitting on a couch, watching cartoons, is a man we 
           recognize from the photos at 435 ALAMEDA DRIVE... 

           CALVIN FREAR. Heavy-set, sweat-stained wife-beater.

           Frear sees Walters with his gun, jumps--

                                 FREAR
                        Jesus Christ... How long you been 
                        standing there?

           We recognize Frear’s VOICE as well...

                                 WALTERS
                        Not long...

                                 FREAR
                        All right, so he’s dead -- that mean 
                        we’re done now? ‘Cause the car, the 
                        calls, the whole Cardullo shit -- it was 
                        more than you said it would be.

           His mind elsewhere, thinking out his next move--

                                 WALTERS
                        I’m sorry... Where’s the girl?

                                 FREAR
                        Down the hall to your left. Last door 
                        down.

           Walters nods. Starts heading off.

                                 FREAR (CONT’D)
                        And the money??

                                 WALTERS
                        Right... Sorry...
           He raises his gun and FIRES ONE ROUND into Frear’s chest. 
           Frear falls back, gasps, shakes. Goes still a moment 
           later.

           Walters turns, FIRES two more rounds into the wall. Heads 
           down the hall, to the last door down. KICKS IT OPEN.

           Sophie is crouched in the corner, hand-cuffed to a table, 
           duct-tape over her mouth, a bandage over her ear.

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God...

           He runs to her. Pulls off the tape. Turns on his walkie-
           talkie--

                                 WALTERS (CONT’D)
                        This is Walters, request immediate back-
                        up, 217 Tresdale.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           A half-hour has passed. A host of cop cars are now parked 
           across from the house, an ambulance as well. 

           A new car screeches to a stop. Out run Jake and Ellen 
           Hollander, an officer escorting them...

           Another OFFICER meets them by the corner--

                                 OFFICER
                        This way...

           The Hollanders race toward the house -- as a cop exits, 
           carrying Sophie in his arms, Walters by his side.

           Ellen CRIES OUT, reaches out for Sophie, takes her in her 
           ams. Overflowing with emotion, tears streaming out--

                                 ELLEN
                        Wren... My baby...

           She squeezes Sophie tight -- who is too dazed to react...

           Jake, standing a few feet away, watches. His own eyes 
           welling with tears. He glances toward Walters -- cut, 
           bruised, battered.  

           Smiles. Nods to him.

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you...
           Walters nods. Smiles back.

                                 WALTERS
                        Just doing my job, Mr. Hollander.

           And, to the side, Vargas stands and watches. He’s uneasy. 

           Senses something is not quite right...

           WE MOVE OVER...to a TV NEWS CREW by the road...

                                 REPORTER
                        ...has been found today here in Los 
                        Angeles. I’m standing outside the house 
                        where police discovered Wren this morning 
                        in a stunning turn of events...

                                                              WE CUT TO:

           A TELEVISION SCREEN. SHERIFF THOMAS CRISCO speaking to 
           the press-- 

                                 CRISCO
                        ...records of calls to and from Calvin 
                        Frear on Novak’s apartment phone the day 
                        Novak reported Wren missing, suggesting 
                        the two men may have worked together...

           ANOTHER TV SCREEN. A NEWS ANCHOR...

                                 ANCHOR
                        ...Frear, like Novak an ex-con with a 
                        host of offenses to his record...

           ANOTHER TV SCREEN. Another ANCHOR...

                                 ANCHOR #2
                        ...Novak still missing, and with Frear 
                        dead and Wren as yet unable to give 
                        testimony, it may be some time before we 
                        know the whole truth...

           EXT. DOCK - TOPANGA BEACH - DAY

           A PUBLIC BATHROOM. Slowly, his eyes peeled, Harry creeps 
           out. He’s cold, shaking -- but alive and determined...

           His clothes have dried. He reaches into his pants pocket, 
           pulls out his WALLET. It’s shriveled, coated in sand. He 
           opens it up. Torn dollar bills and, sure enough, still 
           couched inside -- SOPHIE’S EARRING. 
           EXT. LOT - TOPANGA BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry moves from one car to another. Stops by a beat-down 
           compact. Peers through the window. Whips back his ELBOW, 
           bracing for impact -- and SHATTERS the glass.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

           Early evening, purple sky. The Transamerica Pyramid 
           scrapes scattered clouds.

           Then -- SCREAMING...

                                 SOPHIE (V.O.)
                        Daddy!!

           INT. BEDROOM - THE HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sophie -- new pajamas, eyes caked with sleep -- SHOOTS up 
           out of bed. Shaking, pale with fright--

                                 SOPHIE
                        Daddy!! Daddy!!

           A DOOR BURSTS OPEN. Ellen Hollander, dressed in dinner 
           attire, rushes into the room, frightened--

                                 ELLEN
                        What is it, sweetie?

                                 SOPHIE
                        I want my Daddy!

                                 ELLEN
                                 (calling)
                        Jake!

           She takes Sophie in her arms.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Shhh... Daddy’s coming, sweetheart...

           Jake arrives. Also spiffily dressed. Also worried.

                                 JAKE
                        Wren...?

           Sophie sees him. Shakes her head, screams out again--

                                 SOPHIE
                        No, I want Daddy!!
           She starts crying. Ellen holds her tight, caresses her, 
           unsure what to do...

                                 ELLEN
                        Shhh... Daddy’s here... Daddy’s here...

           Ellen turns around. Catches Jake’s look. He seems heart-
           stricken.

                                 JAKE
                        They said it’d be like this...

           Ellen reaches out to him. Holds his hand. For the first 
           time, we see real love for him in her eyes... Real 
           empathy...

           She turns back to the still-weeping Sophie. Holds her 
           against her chest.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellen gently brushes Sophie’s hair. The kind of motherly 
           thing she has yearned to do for so long now...

                                 ELLEN
                        It’s ok, sweetie.

           Sophie faces the mirror, Ellen behind her. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I want to go home...

                                 ELLEN
                        You are home, sweetie.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I want my Daddy...

           Ellen stops. Comes around to face Sophie.

                                 ELLEN
                        Wren... I know how hard this is... When 
                        you were little -- so little you can’t 
                        remember -- the man you thought was your 
                        Daddy took you away from us...

                                 SOPHIE
                        I want to go home...

                                 ELLEN
                        This is home... I’m your Mommy... You 
                        can’t remember right now...
                                 SOPHIE
                        He said my Mommy was dead...

                                 ELLEN
                                 (almost crying)
                        No, sweetie... I’m right here... 

           Beat. Sophie looks into Ellen’s eyes. Still scared, but 
           brimming suddenly with hope--

                                 SOPHIE
                        Mommy...?

           Ellen starts to weep, holds Sophie in her arms.

                                 ELLEN
                        My baby...

           She rocks her back and forth, squeezes her as tight as 
           she can...

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellen enters. Time has passed but her eyes are still 
           sore. She’s holding a mound of clothes. She dumps them 
           into the hamper.

           She stops. Sees something... Sticking out of one of the 
           pants pockets... She reaches in and pulls it out. 

           It’s a PHOTOGRAPH OF RAMONA MENDEZ AND A BABY. We haven’t 
           seen it before -- but perhaps it’s the picture Sophie 
           found in Harry’s bedroom. The one she described to him...

           Ellen looks at it. Bewildered.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake is setting the DINING TABLE, cell cradled--

                                 JAKE
                        Close it... Tell Dunnelly the trial will 
                        have to wait ‘til November... Fine... 
                        Night.

           He hangs up.

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Did you see this?

           Jake turns, startled. Ellen is standing a few yards off, 
           holding up the photograph. 
                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        This was in Wren’s pocket.

           Beat. Jake looks. Doesn’t know what she’s getting at...

                                 JAKE
                        Ok...?

                                 ELLEN
                        I’ve seen her before... This woman...

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah. She was on the news. She was with 
                        Novak. He probably gave Wren the photo.

                                 ELLEN
                        No... Earlier than that...

           Beat. Jake stops what’s he doing. Approaches Ellen. She’s 
           uneasy. Suspicious. Knows something is not right...

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s been so long... What if we were 
                        wrong...? What if it’s not Wren...?

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen. DNA will prove it. The doctor said 
                        she would be this way. That she wouldn’t 
                        believe we’re her parents, that she 
                        wouldn’t remember. You’re letting it get 
                        to your head.

           Ellen shakes her head. Jake steps closer. Softly--

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s hard. In time, she’ll come 
                        around. She’ll understand what happened 
                        to her. What happened to us...

           Ellen looks at him. Still uncertain.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I know how close you were. You thought I 
                        didn’t know but I did. Those pills of 
                        yours... You blamed me -- and you know 
                        what? You were right to. I let you down. 
                        What you don’t know is I went to get help 
                        every day from that day on. I tried so 
                        hard to make you happy...

           He reaches out to her, takes her shoulders.
                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I hadn’t just lost Wren, Ellen. I’d lost 
                        you.

           He looks into her eyes. She looks away... The emotions 
           bubbling up...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let these things cloud your mind. 
                        Not now. Wren’s back with us. She’s back.

           Beat. He takes her hands. The photograph DROPS...

           Finally--

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Come back to me, Ellen... Please... Come 
                        back...

           She looks at him. A moment passes. She opens her mouth, 
           perhaps about to respond, when -- the DOORBELL RINGS.

           Beat. Jake presses his eyes shut. A moment...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                                 (like a sigh)
                        They’re early.

           INT. FOYER - HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jake and Ellen open the FRONT DOOR, revealing a well-
           dressed COUPLE. GEORGE NORTON, 38, and wife WENDY, 39.

                                 ELLEN
                        Hi...

                                 WENDY
                        Ellen my dear--!

           She wraps her arms around Ellen, kisses her cheek.

                                 WENDY (CONT’D)
                        Have you slept? How are you holding up?

           George steps in, bottle of wine in hand. 

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you so much for coming... 

           He takes the wine. George holds out a WRAPPED GIFT. 

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t have...
                                 GEORGE
                        It’s time for a celebration. Is Wren...?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, I’ll get--

           Cutting in--

                                 ELLEN
                        She’s upstairs. She needs her rest.

           Beat. Jake nods. A moment. George makes to lock the door--

                                 JAKE
                        Leave it.

           EXT. THE HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           A few hours have passed. WE SEE THE HOLLANDERS’ HOME, 
           perched like a castle on a hill. Giant, sleek, imposing.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Nortons and Hollanders dine. 

           The oak wood table is candle-lit, topped with roasted 
           duck, risotto, and bottles of Cabernet. 

           Friendly chit-chat, but Ellen remains aloof, thinking... 
           Weighing the photo in her mind...

           Jake speaks out--

                                 JAKE
                        I just...want to say something...

           The others quiet down, turn to him.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Wendy... George... We’ve been friends for 
                        years. You were there when Wren was born. 
                        But there’s a reason why we wanted you 
                        here tonight. And that’s because you 
                        stuck with us. When months had passed and 
                        Wren was still gone, and people told us 
                        we were crazy to keep hoping -- you stuck 
                        with us. You believed -- as Ellen and I 
                        did -- that she was alive...and that one 
                        day we’d find her... That our prayers 
                        would be answered...

           He raises his glass.
                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Well, that day has come... And I thank 
                        you from the bottom of my heart for being 
                        there for us... Thank you...

           George and Wendy light up, lift their glasses in turn.

                                 GEORGE
                        To Wren...

           The three others chime in--

                                 ALL
                        To Wren...

           Beat. 

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        To Wren.

           Wendy’s glass DROPS to the table, CRACKS. Everyone is 
           shocked, horrified.

           There, standing across the room, close to the opened 
           front door, IS HARRY.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh my God--

                                 JAKE
                        Stay calm...

           But he looks like he’s seen a ghost.

                                 HARRY
                        You’d do anything to get her back.

           Jake realizes Harry is speaking directly to him. Slowly, 
           Harry approaches the table. He’s not carrying anything, 
           but he’s full of menace...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Even if it meant casting someone else as 
                        her.

           Ellen turns to Jake. What does this mean...?

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        A child is missing for three days. You 
                        know the odds of her being found alive 
                        after the third day? 96 to 4.

           Jake, seething, reaches under, pulls out his cell. 
                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                                 (still approaching)
                        You knew that because he told you. I’m 
                        guessing no one else knew you were seeing 
                        him on your own time....

           Jake dials...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell anyone about your 
                        meetings with him. All those months of 
                        grief, and he became the one guy you told 
                        everything...

           Jake holds the phone to his ear...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Your counselor, L.A. by way of San 
                        Francisco -- Hollis Walters.

                                 JAKE
                                 (on the phone)
                        9-1-1, this is Jake Hollander at 52 
                        Blithedale, Harold Novak has broken into 
                        my home.

           He hangs up. Stares Harry down.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Seeing as you’re a wanted kidnapper and 
                        murderer, I’d suggest you get the hell 
                        out of my house.

                                 HARRY
                        You knew the odds were you’d never see 
                        Wren again. You blamed yourself for that. 
                        You told Walters. A year later, he 
                        returns to police work in L.A. But you 
                        two keep in touch. E-mails, phone calls.
                        A boat ride or two...

           Ellen turns to Jake. Her look says everything: this is 
           all news to her. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        So one day Walters -- he’s so taken by 
                        your case, he’s so eager to protect 
                        parents like you -- he’s working at the 
                        Santa Monica police station and he sees a 
                        work form and a pair of photos...
                                 (a pause, then,)
                        Those photos were of Sophie and me. A 
                        girl who looked enough like Wren, and a 
                        father who was disposable. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe Walters even thought Sophie was 
                        Wren at first. But a couple of hospital 
                        records ruled that out. So that’s when 
                        the two of you saw it. Fuck the records, 
                        Walters could do away with them. This was 
                        your chance to make things right -- and 
                        steal back the daughter you’d lost...

           Pounding his fist, rising up, feeling Ellen’s stare--

                                 JAKE
                        Get the fuck out, you monster--

           Harry, totally calm, drops SOPHIE’S EARRING on the table.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s funny the things parents forget to 
                        do. The mistakes we make. See, I never 
                        reported finding Sophie’s earring. I 
                        forgot to.

           Jake looks at the earring, then back at Harry. His heart 
           rising to his throat. Harry smiles. Knows he’s got him. 
           Knows he’s won.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        But somehow you knew that an earring had 
                        been pulled from her ear when she was 
                        taken.
                                 (then,)
                        That means, not only was this done for 
                        you, but that you kept tabs on it every 
                        step of the way. Every step of the 
                        fucking way -- through every murder and 
                        every lie, every ex-con Walters brought 
                        in--
                                 (so full of clenched rage, as 
                                 though he’s about to cry)
                        --they all answered to you. 

           Beat. Ellen looks again at Jake. No longer wondering... 
           Too shocked to speak... 

           A moment passes. And then -- Jake LAUGHS. A light 
           chuckle, pulled out with difficulty. Playing it off, as 
           though it’s all too ridiculous to take seriously--

                                 JAKE
                        They told me you were deranged but, I’m 
                        sorry, I had no idea the extent.

                                 HARRY
                        What about the DNA? You needed Walters 
                        for that, too. Police lab access helps.
           Jake LAUGHS harder -- but feels his wife’s gaze. She 
           doesn’t seem to find this funny...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where is she?

           Jake collects himself. Motions to his wife, his guests.

                                 JAKE
                        Look... Whatever that head of yours has 
                        cooked up about me, it concerns me and no 
                        one else. So, could we first...?

           Beat. Harry looks at the guests. Nods.

                                 WENDY
                        Jake--

                                 JAKE
                        It’s ok. The police are on their way.
                                 (turns to his wife)
                        Ellen, would you...?

           Beat. She rises. Takes Wendy’s arm. George rises as well. 
           Eyes Harry. Wonders if he should do something...

           The three of them make their way to the door... Jake and 
           Harry stay put, eyes glued on one another.

           The door closes. Jake and Harry are alone now.

           Jake rises and heads to his right, toward the KITCHEN...

                                 HARRY
                        You needed her picture in the news... 
                        Couldn’t just take her from me... Had to 
                        be able to explain how you’d found her...

           He keeps his eyes on Jake, as the latter opens a drawer 
           under the sink, his back turned...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        And once I fled the cops you waited ‘til 
                        you thought I was dead...

           The sound of tires on gravel. Jake looks through the 
           nearest window. George and Wendy’s car speeding away...

           His back still turned--

                                 JAKE
                        You are dead.

           He SPINS AROUND and FIRES AT HARRY. 
           A BULLET TEARS through Harry’s side. He FALLS BACK 
           against the table. Cutlery goes flying, plates break all 
           around him.

           Jake looms overhead, a gun in his trembling hand. It’s 
           the first time he’s ever fired one.

           He starts walking to Harry, who clutches his shoulder, 
           blood bubbling out, broken plate shards by his head... 

           Stammering, losing it, rage in his eyes--

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        How dare you?

           He reaches Harry. RAISES his foot and BRINGS IT DOWN on 
           Harry’s wound with all his force. Harry SCREAMS in pain.

           Jake leans down. Sticks the gun in Harry’s MOUTH. Slides 
           the barrel in, his finger gripping the trigger...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        You say you were disposable? You’re damn 
                        right you were. You spent a quarter of 
                        your kid’s life in jail. If Wren was 
                        disposable, my beautiful baby girl some 
                        fucker’s prey, some sick animal’s idea of 
                        a joke--
                                 (edging to pull the trigger, 
                                 as Harry reaches for 
                                 something,)
                        --then who the hell are you?

           At that instant -- Harry THROWS his arm forward. He’s 
           clutching one of the plate SHARDS. It SLICES across 
           Jake’s face, spraying blood. Jake LETS GO of his gun, 
           grasps his face in pain...

           Harry REACHES up, TACKLES Jake back. They COLLIDE against 
           a row of shelves. Books and statuary tumble...

           Harry PULLS back Jake’s head, PUSHES it against the wall. 
           SWINGS his fist against his jaw...

           Jake staggers back, grabs a CHAIR... VOLLEYS it against 
           Harry’s back... The wood SPLINTERS, and Harry COLLAPSES.

           Jake -- bloodied, heart racing -- seizes his chance. 
           PROPS Harry up against the tabletop, a MEAT KNIFE only 
           inches away. Harry sees the knife. Catches Jake’s leg, 
           grasps his head, SMASHES it against the table...

           Reaches for the KNIFE and is about to carry it down--
                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Freeze!

           Standing on the other side of the table, holding Jake’s 
           GUN and aiming it right at Harry, is Ellen.

           Harry looks at her. Slowly backs off. Drops the knife.

           Jake gasps, breathes out, rises...

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen...

           She AIMS THE GUN AT HIM. 

           He stops. Dumbfounded.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Ellen...?

           She doesn’t respond. Keeps the gun on her husband. Her 
           finger clutching the trigger...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Ellen... What are you doing?

                                 ELLEN
                        How could you?

           Her teeth are clenched, her eyes swelling. 

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Is it true...?

           The words hit Jake. Ellen is asking, but it’s clear she 
           already knows. The photo of Ramona, Sophie’s behavior -- 
           they planted the seed that has now blossomed. 

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen...
                                 (then, knows he can’t deny 
                                 it)
                        I did it for you...

           She stares at him, hatred in her eyes. Her finger 
           tightens around the trigger...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Put the gun down. We can love that girl 
                        like our own. Be honest with yourself, 
                        Ellen... You knew it wasn’t Wren... 

           Ellen shakes her head. Harry stays back. Watches...
                                 ELLEN
                        No...

           And then -- the SOUND OF SIRENS. Just outside. Cars 
           approaching...

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen... Does it even matter?... You, me  
                        -- we can have our life back...

           The words bring tears to Ellen’s eyes. But she doesn’t 
           answer. Her eyes drift to Harry -- who looks back at her. 
           Silent...

           EXT. HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A swarm of COP CARS invades the driveway... Officers rush 
           out...

           INT. HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The sound of the COPS RUNNING...

           Jake looks into Ellen’s eyes. His final plea.

                                 JAKE
                        Ellen... Put the gun down...
                                 (then,)
                        You know what to say to them...

           She stays put... Her eyes lock back on her husband... 

           EXT. HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           COPS racing to the door...

           INT. HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The DOOR BURSTS open... Cops rushing in...

           Just in time to remain out of sight, Ellen drops the gun. 

           The cops surround Ellen, Jake, and Harry, their weapons 
           raised. Jake backs off, addresses them, panting, putting 
           on his act--

                                 JAKE
                        Thank God...
           Without a word, two officers PIN HARRY back down. Even if 
           they don’t recognize him, he’s clearly the odd man out. 

           They notice his wound, blood soaking his shirt...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        He came at me with a knife.

           The cops nod. Pull out their cuffs.

                                 ELLEN
                        He’s lying.

           Beat. The cops stop. Turn to Ellen -- as does Jake, in 
           disbelief.

                                 OFFICER
                                 (to Harry)
                        Are you Harold Novak?

           Before he can even answer--

                                 ELLEN
                        He came for his daughter.
                                 (a beat, then,)
                        Sophie Novak.

           Harry looks at her. Jake starts laughing. Shakes his  
           head--

                                 JAKE
                        My wife... She’s confused... She’s had a--

                                 ELLEN
                        My husband is a kidnapper.

           Jake looks at her in shock. She keeps her eyes away.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        And I can prove it.

           Beat. The cops trade confused looks. Ellen breathes out -- 
           then stares back at Jake. 

           You can see it in her eyes. No more wavering. She’s 
           refusing to back down -- and is for once completely sure 
           of herself, and of what she has done...

           INT. BEDROOM - HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens. Sophie is asleep in bed. An OFFICER and a 
           ROOKIE step in, head to the bedside. One turns to the 
           other--
                                 OFFICER
                        Is that...?
                                 (then, perplexed,)
                        Fuck. Call Handale. Call L.A. We gotta 
                        take ‘em all in.

           INT. FOYER - HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           We’re DOWNSTAIRS again, by the staircase and the front 
           door. The Officer descends, carrying a half-awake Sophie.

           Harry’s back is turned. He’s being motioned out the door, 
           IN HANDCUFFS, toward an AMBULANCE. He doesn’t see Sophie.

           Just beyond, outside in the driveway, are Jake and more 
           cops. Ellen off to the side...

           CLOSE ON SOPHIE: Her drifting eyes seizing on something. 
           Her vision focusing... And, all at once, she seems to 
           snap awake--

                                 SOPHIE
                        Daddy...?

           Harry HEARS this. Halfway through the door, he turns 
           around. Sees her. Goes weak at the knees, his heart 
           racing, his eyes pleading--

                                 HARRY
                        Sophie...

           Sophie kicks at the Officer, struggles to break free... 
           He lets her down and she races toward her father... 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Daddy!!

           Harry kneels down to meet her embrace. She WRAPS her arms 
           around him. But he can’t reciprocate...

           The POLICEMAN by his side looks up at the Officer.

           Neither is sure what to do. 

           A moment passes. The Officer eyes Harry’s handcuffs. 
           Looks back at the Policeman. Gives him a nod.

           The Policeman bends down, unlocks the cuffs.

           Without even looking back, Harry spreads his freed arms 
           and WRAPS them around Sophie. 
           Holds her like he’s never held her before. Can’t even 
           feel his wound. He’s overwhelmed.

                                 HARRY
                        Sophie... I missed you so much... 

           The cops trade more uncertain looks. Harry -- wanted 
           kidnapper and killer -- looks right now like nothing so 
           much as a loving father...

                                 SOPHIE
                        I wanna go home, Daddy...

                                 HARRY
                        I know...

           He kisses her hair, hugs her again...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going home...

           INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Walters is heading past cubicles, on his way out. A few 
           fellow COPS address him--

                                 COP #1
                        Mazel tov, Hollis...

                                 COP #2
                        Nice work, Walters...

           Walters nods, keeps moving -- when he’s stopped by 
           Vargas.

                                 VARGAS
                        Hollis.

           He’s curt, and blocking Walters’ way. Confused--

                                 WALTERS
                        What is it...?

           Vargas holds up a PRINT-OUT. It’s a list of numbers. A 
           name at the top: “CALVIN FREAR”.

                                 VARGAS
                        Recognize this?

           Walters is perplexed. The document’s heading reads “RED 
           PLAN”.
                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        We found Novak. He was kind enough to 
                        give us a copy. 
                                 (pointing to a number)
                        That your cell?

           Walters looks at the records, then back at Vargas. He’s 
           scared, but hiding it...

                                 WALTERS
                        No...

           Brushes past Vargas, flustered. Continues on... Sheriff 
           Thomas Crisco steps in next. Blocks Walters’ way.

                                 CRISCO
                        How about this number, Hollis?

           Walters stops. Crisco has his own print-out.

                                 CRISCO (CONT’D)
                        Dialed back in May. You recognize it?

           Walters looks at him. Trying to keep his cool--

                                 WALTERS
                        No... Should I?

           Crisco pulls out a cell phone. Dials the number. Waits, 
           looking Walters in the eye. Walters knows what’s 
           coming...

           RINGING. Just a few doors down. And then, oblivious, her 
           voice audible from the office--

                                 SECRETARY
                        Los Angeles Police Department S.I.U., 
                        this is Hollis Walters’ office.

           Walters closes his eyes. Takes it all in... Then--

                                 VARGAS
                        What was it, Hollis?

           Walters turns back to him. Vargas wears the look of a man 
           betrayed.

                                 VARGAS (CONT’D)
                        The kind of paycheck a man like Hollander 
                        could write... Was that it? Was it just 
                        money?

           Walters glares back at him. Incensed, wounded, and, at 
           last, opening up completely--
                                 WALTERS
                        Just money? You don’t understand. You 
                        want Sophie to become another Harry 
                        Novak? Some strung-up junkie by 18? I got 
                        paid to give a kid a chance at a better 
                        life.
                                 (beat)
                        Think. Why did we become cops, Rick? You 
                        ever been given that chance here? 

           Vargas takes a moment. And then, with a renewed 
           confidence, as though only now realizing why he’s a cop--

                                 VARGAS
                        Yeah. Today.

           He motions to Crisco -- who takes Walters’ arm... Slowly 
           ushers him away...

           INT. BUS - DAY

           The kid in question, seated next to Harry...

           EXT. HARRY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Harry walks from the curb, Sophie in his arms. Strung 
           over his shoulder is a grocery bag.

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Harry steps in. Turns on the lights. Home with his 
           daughter at last... 

           He lays the grocery bag on the nearest chair. Apples, 
           bananas, pasta, tomatoes, orange juice. And, slipped in 
           alongside, TWO BOOKS: Dr. Seuss’s “How the Grinch Stole 
           Christmas” and “The Cat in the Hat.”

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry gently lays Sophie to bed. Tucks her in. Places a 
           few STUFFED ANIMALS by her side. Kisses her forehead.

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           He pours himself a glass of water, sits down at the 
           kitchen table. Takes a sip. Closes his eyes.

           He can finally breathe.
           He reaches into his jacket pocket. Pulls out a clear ZIP-
           LOCK BAG. Attached is a POST-IT NOTE, scribbled with red 
           marker: “Some of what he took from your place. Rick 
           Vargas.”

           The bag is filled with PHOTOS. Twenty or so...

           Harry opens it, rifles through. Images of a younger 
           Sophie -- two months old, eight months old, one year old.

           Harry stares at the pictures. Looks back at the walls and 
           fridge where they used to hang. He smiles. So grateful to 
           finally have Sophie back...

           A few of the photos feature Ramona. Harry lingers on her, 
           lets it sit. Picks up one photo. He and Ramona are 
           seated, wrapped in one another’s arms, a six month-old 
           Sophie on their laps. All grins. A true family.

           Harry lets his memories drift. He finishes his water. And 
           then his eyes seem to catch something...

           Something about the image...

           Harry raises the photo, brings it up to the light. Leans 
           in closer, studies it. Something is missing. Something 
           Harry has never noticed until now... 

           On the left side of Sophie’s neck, there is no birthmark 
           visible.

           Beat. A moment passes. Harry shuffles through the other 
           photos, confused. Finds one of Sophie as a baby, only 
           weeks out of the womb, the left side of her neck again 
           exposed. Once again, no birthmark.

           He finds another baby photo. Same thing.

           He rifles some more. Most of the pictures are taken from 
           too great a distance to tell one way or the other, but 
           all of those that clearly show the left side of Sophie’s 
           neck SHOW NO BIRTHMARK. 

           Neither does a photo Harry pulls out of his pocket -- of 
           Sophie with Ramona, the photo Ellen found. Slowly, 
           Harry’s expression starts to change... Confusion giving 
           way... His complexion gradually going cold...

           His breathing heavy now, he empties the zip-lock. Picks 
           up another photo we’ve seen before. It’s the picture of a 
           FOUR YEAR-OLD SOPHIE, the one Harry gave to the cops, the 
           one they plastered on posters. 
           There, sure enough, just barely visible on her neck, IS 
           THE TELL-TALE BIRTHMARK.

           Harry reels back. It can’t be...

           FLASH IMAGE: The police station... Vargas grilling 
           Harry...

                                 VARGAS (V.O.)
                        You served hard time. January to May 
                        2008... If you already had a kid, where 
                        was she while you were inside?

                                 HARRY (V.O.)
                        She was with Ramona...

           Back to Harry... He eyes the photos again... Harry, 
           Sophie -- and RAMONA...

           FLASH IMAGE: Ramona at her doorway, confronted by Harry 
           and the police... The look on her face... Fear in her 
           eyes... As though she’s about to be caught...

           On Harry. He remembers her look... Remembers wondering: 
           Why didn’t she help me? Why did she lie?

           He takes a moment. Thinks... Ramona... Ramona...

           FLASH IMAGE: Ramona’s apartment... Ramona yelling back at 
           Harry...

                                 RAMONA
                        You left me with her for six fucking 
                        months...

           Harry snapping back--

                                 HARRY
                        I couldn’t see my own child, had no idea 
                        if she was even ok...

           Back to the present. Harry’s mind is churning. It’s 
           impossible... He GETS UP... Hurries to Sophie’s 
           BEDROOM... 

           She’s sleeping... He leans over her, gazes at her neck... 
           Her BIRTHMARK... 

           And suddenly sees her for who she is...

                                 HARRY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        By the time I got out she didn’t even 
                        recognize me...
           He staggers back toward the doorway... The most recent 
           memories of his daughter rushing past...

           Running into his arms... Sitting in the car, inspecting 
           her birthmark... Harry watching her do so... The fact 
           never registering...

                                 RAMONA (V.O.)
                        There are things I will never tell you...

           Back to Harry. Imagining what must have happened...

           FLASH IMAGE: Ramona, two years younger... She’s in a one-
           story duplex... She enters a bathroom... Lying in the 
           bathtub, her face under water, is ONE-AND-A-HALF-YEAR-OLD 
           SOPHIE... Ramona goes PALE...

                                 RAMONA
                        Oh my God... No...!

           She pulls Sophie out, shakes her, tries to get her to 
           breathe... But Sophie is blue, cold, and absolutely 
           still... 

           We catch a glimpse of Sophie’s neck... No birthmark...

           And then, Ramona’s line, remembered--

                                 RAMONA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My sweet Sophie... I’m so sorry...

           Back to Harry. Beads of sweat building. His eyes welling, 
           his thoughts racing. 

                                 VARGAS (V.O.)
                        What are the chances?... We got ‘em both 
                        in San Francisco, the girls look 
                        identical...

           FLASH IMAGE: Ramona, huddled alone in the house, dirt on 
           her hands, a shovel by her side. Stoned, strung out, 
           terrified... Biting her nails, trembling, nauseous... 

           Her eyes drift upwards... To photos on countertops... 
           Photos of her and Harry and Sophie... The same photos 
           Harry is looking at now...

                                 RAMONA (V.O.)
                        I tried to make Harry happy...

           Back to Harry. Reconstructing it all... More voices...

                                 VARGAS (V.O.)
                        You conveniently decide to move to L.A.
                                 HARRY (V.O.)
                        Ramona wanted to leave after I got out... 

                                 VARGAS (V.O.)
                        Why? ‘Cause you’d just nabbed a kid?

           On Harry again. Placing the final piece in the puzzle...

           FLASH IMAGE: Ramona sitting in a park... Lost, bereft... 
           A woman who has lost her child, and is hiding it from the 
           world... 

           And then she sees something... Only yards away...

                                 VARGAS (V.O)
                        You were in the same city as the 
                        Hollanders, you shared the same streets, 
                        the same parks...

           A CHILD, seated in a STROLLER... It’s a girl, about 
           Sophie’s age, brown hair, green eyes, sun-kissed 
           cheeks... 

           Ramona looks closer... And, ever so slowly, her thoughts 
           seem to take shape, as it comes to her...

           We get a better glimpse of the CHILD. She looks 
           STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO ONE-AND-A-HALF YEAR-OLD SOPHIE... 

           Soon enough, ELLEN HOLLANDER appears and starts to push 
           the stroller away... Ramona follows it with her eyes...

           Ellen looks back... Sees Ramona...

                                 ELLEN (V.O.)
                        I’ve seen her before...

           Back to Harry. Sinking to the floor. It’s all clear now.

           He looks again at the photos. The picture he gave to the 
           police. The four year-old girl he thought was Sophie...

           EXT. HOLLANDERS’ HOUSE - JUNE 2008 - DAY

           WREN HOLLANDER, just shy of TWO YEARS, is out on her 
           front yard with her father...

           Across the street is a car we recognize... Harry’s beat-
           up grey Pontiac... Idling... Waiting... Ramona at the 
           wheel...

           Jake Hollander’s cell RINGS... He answers it... It’s 
           work... Harried, he checks his pockets... 
           Needs something he doesn’t have on him... Runs inside for 
           a moment, leaving Wren alone by the side of the road... 
           The Pontiac pulls up...

                                 VARGAS (V.O.)
                        Report said Hollander saw a grey 
                        Pontiac... Harry drives a grey Pontiac...

           Ramona steps out of the Pontiac, gently takes Wren’s 
           arm... Leading her off... Into the car...

                                 RAMONA (V.O.)
                        I didn’t want anyone to know... I did 
                        things for you you don’t even know...

           We’re INSIDE the house now... Jake Hollander peering 
           through the window... Sees the Pontiac speeding away... 
           Runs out in a panic...

                                 HARRY (V.O.)
                        ...you saw your chance to make things 
                        right -- and steal back the daughter 
                        you’d lost...

           And now we’re IN THE CAR... Ramona driving, Wren by her 
           side... The child gazing out the window, calm, has no 
           idea what’s happening, too young for it to register... We 
           linger on Wren... Her face... Like a slightly older 
           version of the dead Sophie...

                                 WALTERS (V.O.)
                        Kids that young, even parents can mistake 
                        them... 

           Ramona addresses her--

                                 RAMONA
                        Sophie... Your real name is Sophie... I’m 
                        your real Mommy...and in a couple of 
                        days, you’re going to meet your real 
                        Daddy... Ok?

           Ramona runs her free hand through Wren’s hair...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        He was away for a few months, but he just 
                        got out... He might not recognize you at 
                        first, you might not recognize him... But 
                        he’s your real Daddy...
                                 (then,)
                        See, Mommy did something bad...and you’re 
                        going to help her make up for it... Do 
                        you understand?
           And we can see, in Ramona’s eyes, fixed on the girl she 
           just kidnapped, that she won’t be able to live with what 
           she’s done for long...

           Wren looks back out the window... We can see the 
           BIRTHMARK on her neck...

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look back... That man will find his 
                        real daughter soon...

           Then, softly--

                                 RAMONA (CONT’D)
                        You’re home now.

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           RINGING. Harry jumps. Startled back to the present.

           He turns. Someone’s calling the landline. He gets up, 
           peers at the phone. It goes to voicemail.

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Mr. Novak... It’s Ellen Hollander... I 
                        just... I don’t know why I’m calling 
                        except...I’m sorry... I’m so sorry for 
                        how I treated you... For everything...

           The words hit Harry hard. It’s almost too much to take.

                                 ELLEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to pick up the pieces here... 
                        If there’s anything I can do to help you 
                        get on your feet again... I want the best 
                        for you and your daughter...
                                 (finally,)
                        You have a beautiful girl...

           The message ends. Harry’s hand springs out, as though on 
           autopilot. He presses CALL BACK. Holds the phone.

                                 AUTOMATIC VOICE
                        Dialing 4-1-5-3-3-1-2-7-8-5. Please wait.

           Beat. Harry’s eyes drift ahead...to the nearest BEDROOM 
           DOOR. It’s open a crack.

           He hears the RING-TONE. Slowly approaches the bedroom, 
           phone still to his ear. Peers in.

           Sees the girl -- Wren, but we will still call her Sophie  
           -- asleep on the bed. 
           His eyes fill with love -- and, all of a sudden, 
           uncertainty...

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           He freezes. Doesn’t answer. Deciding against what he was 
           about to do...

           He HANGS UP. 

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        Daddy...?

           Harry glances back toward the BEDROOM. Sophie seems to 
           have noticed him. He steps in...

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sophie is awake now. Harry looks at her with new eyes. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I can’t sleep...

           Harry replies tenderly, like a true parent... 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s all right, sweetheart...

           He approaches her bed. Sits down by her side. Runs his 
           hand through her hair.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m scared...

                                 HARRY
                        There’s nothing to be scared of...

           He looks at her. All the love in the world in that look.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I will never let anything happen to you 
                        again...

           Beat. Sophie calms down, grows sleepy again. He leans 
           closer to her. Whispers into her ear... 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Things are going to be better now...
                                 (then,)
                        Do you... Do you remember...seeing me... 
                        after I’d been away for a few months?
                                 SOPHIE
                        You were away, Daddy?

           Harry takes it in. His suspicions are confirmed. It’s all 
           a blur at her age.

                                 HARRY
                        I was once. But from now on I’m...

           He hesitates. His voice growing thin...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to do the right things for 
                        you... You’re the most beautiful, 
                        wonderful daughter a father could ever 
                        hope to have. And I’m going to take care 
                        of you the way a father should. 

           Sophie smiles. Closes her eyes. Drifting ever so slowly 
           to sleep... 

           Beat. Harry’s eyes tremble, stray tears welling up...

           He leans in some more and kisses Sophie’s cheek. All too 
           aware of the choice he has made.

           Then, almost more to himself than to her it seems--

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You see, there’s nothing to be scared of 
                        anymore. You’re home now.

           With that, he rises. Quietly heads for the door. Looks 
           back at Sophie one last time before stepping out...

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He eases the door closed. Returns to the phone. 

           Takes a moment. Breathes out. 

           Then, steadily but surely, he reaches back for the 
           ANSWERING MACHINE, Ellen Hollander’s call record still 
           illuminated...

           He presses a single button:

           “CALL BACK”.

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
