                        Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your 
                        seat belts.

                                                                 FADE IN:

           EXT. SUBURBAN CHICAGO HIGHWAY - MORNING

           Speeding cars.  Heavy traffic.  In the middle lane, a 
           RUSTY VOLVO STATION WAGON drives ridiculously slow.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        We begin our journey at a low 
                        cruising rate of twenty-five miles 
                        per hour. 

           INT. THE VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           HENRY TRIPP (45) tightly wound and always nervous, 
           clutches the wheel.  He wipes his forehead and glances at 
           his hand.  It’s covered in sweat. 

           Cars HONK and drivers YELL out their window as they speed 
           past.  Henry concentrates on ignoring them.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        As you can see, our captain has 
                        illuminated the “I’m a douche” 
                        sign. 

           Henry’s wife, JOYCE TRIPP (39) sits in the passenger 
           seat.  Her vacant expression suggests she’s been through 
           this a hundred times before. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        If you haven’t already done so, 
                        please stow all emotional baggage 
                        and make sure your secrets are 
                        safely put away.

           An enormous aircraft suddenly WHOOSHES directly over the 
           Volvo.  Henry white knuckles the wheel and tries not to 
           look.

           Henry’s daughter, CAROLYN TRIPP (17) cute but with a dark 
           side, slouches in the backseat.  She looks out the window 
           and watches the plane become smaller in the sky, her mind 
           somewhere else.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Unfortunately, there are no 
                        emergency exits.  Anywhere.
           Henry sees a sign: “O’HARE AIRPORT - THIS EXIT.”  

                                 JOYCE
                        Here it is, Henry.
                                (loud)
                        Henry.  
                                (louder)
                        Henry!

           It’s too late.  Henry zooms right past.  Joyce sits up.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Right here!             

           Joyce and Carolyn look out the window as the airport 
           passes.  Traffic is too thick to turn back.  

           Joyce fills with anger and glares at Henry.  A tiny blood 
           vessel in her forehead just may explode.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                         Forecast calls for dark clouds... 

           Carolyn looks at the rear view mirror and sees the fear 
           in her Dad’s eyes.  She turns away, contemptuous.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...heavy winds...

           Henry HYPERVENTILATES.  He makes a loud WHEEZING sound 
           with each breath.  

                                 HENRY
                        I’m...(WHEEZE)...sorry.  I 
                        (WHEEZE) can’t... 

           Close on Henry’s wide eyes.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        ...And lots of other fucked up 
                        shit. 

           EXT. HENRY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Modest suburb.  As the Volvo pulls into the driveway, 
           Carolyn’s door flings open.  She gets out and races 
           inside.

           INT. THE VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           Henry parks.  Joyce contemplates murder.  Or worse.  
           With an odd calm, she gets out of the car and SLAMS the 
           door in his face. 

           Henry slumps over the steering wheel, defeated, as he 
           watches Joyce stomp inside the house.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Okay, so the poor dude has this 
                        little problem.  He certainly 
                        doesn’t deserve anything that’s 
                        about to happen to him.  But 
                        then...neither do I.  

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                 JOYCE
                        Bullshit!

           Joyce tears the comforter off her and stands.  Henry sits 
           in bed wearing button down pajamas. 

                                 HENRY
                        Relax.  I’m just saying we have 
                        plenty of travel options.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t understand how you could 
                        do this to me.  And your daughter.  
                        Again!

           Henry stands. 

                                 HENRY
                        We can drive up to Door County for 
                        Fall Fudge Fest.  You guys 
                        used to love that.  

                                 JOYCE
                        By the way, if you haven’t 
                        noticed, you drive too god damned 
                        slow. 

                                 HENRY
                                (sing song)
                        Twenty’s plenty.  And I’ve never 
                        gotten a ticket in my life.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Henry, I need adventure.  I want 
                        to go somewhere exotic.  Like 
                        Cancun or the Bahamas.  
                                 HENRY
                        Why don’t we drive down to 
                        Springfield?  When was the last 
                        time you visited a state capital?  
                        Come on, historical road trip. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m sick of driving.  I want to 
                        fly, Henry.  In an airplane.  
                        Thirty thousand feet in the air.

           Henry starts to HYPERVENTILATE.  The WHEEZING returns.  
           Joyce just stares at him.  

                                 HENRY
                                (between wheezes)
                        I know a guy...at the airline...he 
                        can get us...our money back.

           Joyce is over it.  

                                 JOYCE
                        My father was right.  You really 
                        are a chicken shit. 

           She grabs the comforter and a pillow and SLAMS the door 
           behind her. 

           Henry sits on the bed, hangs his head.  And WHEEZES.

           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An artful, cluttered mess.  Comic books, markers and 
           sketch pads.  Carolyn’s deadpan drawings of teenage life 
           taped on her walls.  Clearly, she has talent. 

           A horror movie plays on TV.

                                 CAROLYN (O.S.)
                        I don’t believe she would actually 
                        go for that guy.

           Carolyn sits at the foot of her bed, watching with her 
           boyfriend ETHAN (17) artsy, over-confident.  You could 
           say a tad pretentious.

                                 ETHAN
                        He’s far superior to her. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        She’s the coolest camp counselor.  
                        And he’s cheating on her.  
                                 ETHAN
                        I’d hang with him.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Major dick. 

           Carolyn watches as Ethan begins nuzzling her neck.  She 
           likes it.  His hand slowly slips down her jeans. 

                                 ETHAN
                                (softly)
                        I’ve come equipped.

           Ethan pulls a condom from his jeans and waves it.  She 
           pulls his hand out.  Ethan is disappointed.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Please.  I’m not losing my 
                        virginity while someone gets axed 
                        with a chain saw. 

                                 ETHAN
                        So, turn it off.  You’ve seen 
                        this.

                                 CAROLYN
                        It has to be somewhat special.  

           Ethan sighs, frustrated.  He has a thought.

                                 ETHAN
                        Thanksgiving night.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Maybe.

                                 ETHAN
                        We can be thankful you didn’t go 
                        on your trip.

           She stares at the TV, unsure.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Did you miss me?

                                 ETHAN
                        You were gone five hours.

                                 CAROLYN
                        So, you didn’t.

                                 ETHAN
                                (fake)
                        I mean, yeah.  Totally.
           The sounds of a CHAIN SAW and a woman’s SCREAM on TV.  
           Carolyn can’t look away.  Ethan is disgusted. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting a Red Bull.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Get me one?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Frustrated, Joyce tries to get comfortable in her 
           makeshift bed on the sofa.  She hears a THUMP in the 
           kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan pulls out two Red Bulls from the fridge.  As he 
           turns around--

                                 ETHAN
                                (startled)
                        Joyce.

           Joyce stands in the shadows.  Tank top and pajama 
           bottoms.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Hello, Ethan.  I didn’t know you 
                        were here.

           Her sexy bedtime look is not lost on him.  

                                 ETHAN
                        I was procuring liquids.

                                 JOYCE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ETHAN
                        Just getting some drinks. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, remember to turn the lights 
                        off when you’re done.
                                (and then)
                        You know, I find it curious you 
                        always call us by our first names.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, I don’t believe in 
                        parent/child hierarchies. 
                                 JOYCE
                                (thinking it over)
                        Never thought of it that way. 

                                 ETHAN
                        My parents are both therapists.  
                        They raised me as their peer.

           She cocks her head and looks at him in a new light.  

                                 JOYCE
                        ‘Night, Ethan. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Goodnight, Joyce.

           She watches him go.

                                 JOYCE
                        Banana Republic?  No, J. Crew.

                                 ETHAN
                        Huh?

                                 JOYCE
                        Your pocket tee.

           He looks down at his T-shirt.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know...J. Crew?

                                 JOYCE
                        Thought so. 

           Ethan throws a cocky smile and goes.  

           Joyce goes to open the fridge but stops.  She stares at 
           an old photograph stuck under a magnet.  Young Carolyn 
           showing off a snowman with a smiling Joyce and Henry by 
           her side.

           They used to be happy.

           INT./EXT. THE VOLVO - MORNING

           Brilliant autumn day.  Henry drives down the street so 
           slow a line of cars pass him. 
           INT. NORTHBROOK COURT - EARLY MORNING

           Henry’s older sister GAIL and her husband BRUCE MILLER 
           (both late 40s) speed walk around the empty shopping mall 
           in matching Nike shirts and short shorts.  

           Henry follows behind them, sporting a seriously outdated 
           track suit.  

                                 GAIL
                        Henry, I’m absolutely disappointed 
                        in you.

                                 BRUCE
                        On the bright side, we’re happy 
                        you’ll be joining us for T-day, 
                        Hen. 

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s just not bring the trip up 
                        again.  Especially on 
                        Thanksgiving.

                                 GAIL
                        I want you three joining us in 
                        Hawaii in February.  It’s time you 
                        got over your...thing. 

                                 HENRY
                        My thing is not something I can 
                        just get over.  You know that. 

                                 GAIL
                        Well, your little phobias are 
                        getting worse.  Now you can barely 
                        drive down the highway?  How’d you 
                        get here?  Green Bay Road?  

                                 BRUCE
                        Don’t nag him, hon. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’m allergic to pills.  
                        Hypnotherapy never takes.  What do 
                        you want me to do?  

                                 GAIL
                        You need to get your life on 
                        track, Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        What exactly is wrong with my 
                        life?
           Henry’s ancient cell phone rings.  He slides out the 
           antenna and slows down to answer. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                                (into phone)
                        AAAA Travel.  This is Henry...Hi, 
                        Dr. Rumulu...No, no, the hotel 
                        should have you in for seven days 
                        and six nights...

                                 GAIL
                        Keep walking, Henry.

           Henry gestures for them to go ahead.

           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY - LATER

           Posters of Paris, Beijing, Sydney and a dozen other 
           cities hang on the walls.  A sign above them reads: “AAAA 
           Travel - We Travel Anywhere!” 

           A nameplate on a desk reads: HENRY TRIPP.  Next to it is 
           an older photo of Henry, Joyce and Carolyn posing in 
           denim shirts.  

           Faded post cards from around the world to Henry from 
           satisfied customers are neatly tacked on a cork board.

           Hanging on his wall is a row of “Travel Agent of the 
           Year” framed certificates.  For the last seven years.

           Henry cradles the phone to his ear, his fore fingers 
           slowly peck away at the computer.  The colorful images of 
           cities surrounding him contrast his gray cubicle.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                                (into phone)
                        Okay, Cynthia, I have you 
                        departing out of Atlanta at 5:30 
                        a.m. and arriving at your final 
                        destination of San Diego at 10:24 
                        p.m.  Did you know San Diego 
                        International Airport was built in 
                        1929 and is the 30th busiest 
                        airport in the world?

           No response.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Okay then...What type of credit 
                        card would you like me to book the 
                        flight with, Cynthia?
                                 WOMAN ON PHONE (O.S.)
                        ...I think I’m gonna look online 
                        again.

                                 HENRY
                        Cynthia, AAAA Travel can offer you 
                        much better service than anything 
                        you’re going to find on the web.  
                        Guarant...  

           She hangs up. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                                (to a dead phone)
                        Have a safe flight.

           Henry’s email BEEPS.  Excitement washes over his face as 
           he reads:  EVERYONE MEET IN THE BREAK ROOM AT 10AM TO 
           ANNOUNCE THE TRAVEL AGENT OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah right, big mystery.

           Henry’s co-worker DEBBIE (36), suburban mom, stands 
           behind Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Would you mind not reading my 
                        personal emails?

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s a mass email.  I got one too.  
                        See?

           She points her stubby finger on Henry’s computer monitor.  
           Henry wipes off the fingerprint with a tissue. 

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Still can’t get on?

                                 HENRY
                        Worst one yet.  I thought I was 
                        going to crash the car.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You didn’t even make it to the 
                        airport?

           Henry looks guilty.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you need this. 

           Debbie pulls a pamphlet from her drawer and drops it on 
           Henry’s desk.  It reads:  Freedom To Fly.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        We learned about it at last year’s 
                        expo in Vegas.

                                 HENRY
                                (reads the pamphlet)
                        I don’t need a class to help me 
                        fly.  
                                (points to his post 
                                 cards.)
                        I can travel the world right here.   

                                 DEBBIE
                        Two clients of mine did the 
                        program and now I can’t get them 
                        off a plane.  They’re my bread and 
                        butter.  Sleep on it.  

           Henry grins thanks and sets the pamphlet aside.  

           INT. LOVE’S YOGURT - DAY

           Carolyn and her best friend APRIL (18), theater geek, 
           stand at the counter.  A MALE WORKER (21) waits on them.

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’s a pussy.  I think he needs 
                        electroshock.  (to worker)  Can I 
                        try the boysenberry?

                                 APRIL
                        You didn’t exactly want to go 
                        anyway.  (to worker)  Can I try 
                        the mango?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I just don’t know how my mother 
                        deals. 

           The Worker behind the counter hands the girls two tiny 
           spoon samples.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of boys and berries, 
                        guess what Ethan wants to do on 
                        Thanksgiving?

           Carolyn slips the spoon in her mouth seductively and 
           grins.

                                 APRIL
                        Shut it down.  Finally.  You 
                        better do it. 
                                 CAROLYN
                        Undecided.

                                 APRIL
                        What?  Why are you so scared?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m not scared.  It’s just a 
                        penis.  

                                 APRIL
                        So what’s the problem?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I just want to make sure he’s the 
                        one. 

                                 APRIL 
                        You guys have been together for 
                        three whole months.  Obviously, 
                        he’s the one. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I hope so. 

                                 APRIL
                        Just hope Ethan lasts longer than 
                        Zach.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Hello.  Vomit.  

                                 WORKER
                                (annoyed)
                        Are you guys going to buy 
                        anything?

                                 CAROLYN/APRIL
                        No thanks.  We’re good. 

           INT. STATIONARY STATION - THAT MOMENT

           Rows of high end paper products and greeting cards. 

           Joyce sits behind the counter angrily filling boxes of 
           colored stationary.  

           Next to Joyce is her one employee, SOON-YI (16) who 
           speaks the way certain young girls do...in lilted 
           questions.
                                  SOON-YI
                        Alls I know is?  You and Carolyn 
                        should’ve just gone to Mexico by 
                        yourselves.  

                                 JOYCE
                        It was too late.  We couldn’t turn 
                        back.  The idiot ruined another 
                        vacation.  

                                 SOON-YI
                        No offense?  But your husband 
                        sounds like a total mess?  And 
                        probably needs help.

                                 JOYCE
                        Thank you, Soon-Yi.  Finally, 
                        someone smart who knows what I’m 
                        talking about.

                                 SOON-YI
                        If you ever need a good therapist?  
                        My older brother who’s bat shit 
                        crazy?  He goes to a really good 
                        one.

                                 JOYCE
                        I appreciate that.  And thanks for 
                        giving me a hand on your break, 
                        Soon-Yi.  It helps having 
                        girlfriends like you.  We should 
                        grab a drink sometime.  You and 
                        me.  Girls night out. 

                                 SOON-YI
                        My aunt and uncle just got 
                        divorced?  They’ve never been 
                        happier.  Also?  I’m not allowed 
                        to drink. 

           Joyce stops.  Light bulb.

                                 SOON-YI (CONT’D)
                        Technically, I’ve had wine before?  
                        But that was only at my friend 
                        Ariel’s Passover dinner?  Do you 
                        celebrate Passover, Mrs. Tripp?

           Soon-Yi looks up at Joyce.  A look of concern on Soon-Yi.

                                 SOON-YI (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Tripp?

           Joyce is frozen in thought.
           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Henry’s six CO-WORKERS, who’d rather be anywhere else, 
           routinely applaud. 

           RON, 50’s, Henry’s boss and owner of the agency, presents 
           Henry with yet another certificate of the year.  A sad 
           computer print out.

                                 RON
                        Congratulations, Henry.

           Ron pumps Henry’s hand and smiles like a politician in a 
           photo op.  BEVERLY, the receptionist (50) cuts slices of 
           soggy, store-bought coffee cake.

           As everyone starts eating.

                                 RON (CONT’D)
                        Sorry you missed your big vacation 
                        buddy, but luckily you’re on board 
                        through the Thanksgiving holiday.  
                        And for that, here’s another 
                        little token of our appreciation.

           Ron hands Henry an envelope.  He opens it.

                                 HENRY
                                (giddy)
                        Feels like Christmas.
                                (opens the envelope)
                        A twenty dollar gift card to 
                        Barnes and Nobles?  You guys!

           Everyone is too focused on their slices of cake to care.  
           Ron cuts himself a gigantic piece. 

           Henry eyes his certificate and gift card.  He beams with 
           pride.  This is the highlight of his year. 

           EXT./INT. THE VOLVO - LATER

           Henry drives, proudly admiring his paper certificate 
           propped on the dashboard.  Oblivious to the angry, 
           elderly WOMAN in the Buick passing him. 

           INT. TRIPP KITCHEN - LATER

           Henry hangs his certificate on the refrigerator with an 
           AAAA Travel magnet.  Looking for someone to share his 
           good news, he enters...
           THE LIVING ROOM.  Joyce is there, sitting on the sofa.  

                                 HENRY
                        Guess who’s the Travel Agent of 
                        the Year for only the eighth year 
                        in a row?...Guilty!

           No response.  And then...

                                 JOYCE
                                (cold)
                        The Lean Cuisines should hold you 
                        both over for at least two weeks.  
                        After that, there’s pasta.  Then 
                        you’re on your own. 

           Henry sees a large rolling suitcase next to the sofa.  He 
           senses what’s happening but covers it with a cheesy 
           salesman grin.

                                 HENRY
                        No congratulations? 

                                 JOYCE
                                (calling out)
                        Carolyn!

           She pulls out a neatly hand written letter on golden 
           yellow stationary.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                                (yelling)
                        Carolyn!  I need you to come down 
                        here right now!

                                 HENRY
                        What’s going on with you?

           Carolyn walks downstairs, sullen.

                                 CAROLYN
                        What?

           Joyce dramatically clears her throat.

                                 JOYCE
                                (reading)
                        Dear Henry and Carolyn, please 
                        forgive...

           Joyce stops.  Her hands shake.

                                 HENRY
                        Are you alright?
                                 CAROLYN
                                (evil smile)
                        Oh, this is gonna be good. 

                                 JOYCE
                                (deep breath, reads)
                        Dear Henry and Carolyn, please 
                        forgive me for what I’m about to 
                        say.  I’ve been unhappy for many 
                        years now.  Because of this, I 
                        would like to excuse myself from 
                        this family.  Carolyn, you are off 
                        to college next year and barely 
                        need me now.  Henry, your fears 
                        have ruined our lives.  At first, 
                        I was okay with the flying but now 
                        it’s the driving and who knows 
                        what next.  Unless you do 
                        something about it now, I can’t go 
                        on living with you.  Therefore, I 
                        have left my house keys on the 
                        bedroom dresser.  I will continue 
                        to make car payments on the 
                        Cherokee and take it with me.  The 
                        cable, phone and electric bills 
                        are all paid for this month.  You 
                        can keep the Pottery Barn sofa 
                        that I bought with my own money as 
                        well as the Crate & Barrel 
                        entertainment unit.  

           Joyce takes a deep breath and continues.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        You know how much I love that unit 
                        but I’m afraid there is no room 
                        for anything old in my life now.  
                        “Out with the old and in with the 
                        new.”  That is my new motto.  I 
                        will be staying with my parents 
                        until I find an apartment on my 
                        own.  I know you both will 
                        probably be upset with me but I 
                        also know that in time you will 
                        understand.  This is what I have 
                        to do and I hope you respect that.  
                        Love... 

           Joyce looks up with sad eyes.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        ...Mom slash Joyce.

           Henry is stunned silent.  Carolyn is fuming.
                                 CAROLYN
                        Is this a joke?

           Joyce bites her lip.

                                 HENRY
                                (shocked)
                        I don’t think anyone’s laughing, 
                        Carolyn. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        You can’t just excuse yourself 
                        from the family.  If I knew that 
                        was an option I would’ve done it 
                        years ago.

           Henry moves in.

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce, I don’t understand.  Let’s 
                        talk about this.  I said I was 
                        sorry about the trip.

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s not just the trip, Henry.  

           Joyce and her suitcase go.

           Henry and Carolyn are left standing there.  

           They turn and stare at each other.  For a moment it sets 
           in they are about to be left alone together and then...

                                 HENRY/CAROLYN
                        Wait!

           EXT. TRIPP HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joyce heaves her enormous suitcase into the trunk of her 
           Cherokee. 

           Henry and Carolyn run after her. 

                                 HENRY
                        Honey.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Mom.

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce, don’t do this. 
                                 JOYCE
                        Henry.  Stop.  I just explained 
                        everything.  And I used my good 
                        Martha Stewart Modern Classic 
                        stationary to do it.

           Henry tries to pull her suitcase out.

                                 CAROLYN
                        You can’t just leave your only 
                        child here alone.

           Henry looks at Carolyn, disappointed.  

                                 HENRY
                        What do you mean...alone?

                                 CAROLYN
                        You’re hardly ever here.  

           Henry ponders this.  Joyce slips into the driver’s seat. 

                                 JOYCE
                                (tears in her eyes)
                        Carolyn, it would only be worse if 
                        I stayed.  And you’re not a child 
                        anymore.

           Carolyn is stung.

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce.  Come on, now.  Look what 
                        you’re doing. 

           Joyce starts the car, trying to keep it together. 

                                 JOYCE
                                (to Carolyn)
                        You can have my subscription to 
                        People Magazine. 

           Joyce throws the car in reverse.  Henry follows.

           Joyce pulls out of the driveway, gives them one last 
           look.  And PEELS off.

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce!

           Carolyn sprints inside. 

           Henry looks across the street and sees his NEIGHBOR, 
           standing in her doorway, watching with pity. 
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                                (forced smile)
                        Everything’s fine, Mrs. T!  Good 
                        night!  

           Henry walks back to the house.  He stumbles on a crack in 
           the pathway. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        God dammit.

           He regains composure and enters the house, a lone figure.

           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Carolyn sits at the foot of her bed with her phone to her 
           ear.

                                 CAROLYN 
                                (into phone)
                        Mother...When are you coming home?  
                        You can’t do this.  Call me back. 

           A KNOCK on the door.  She hangs up and doesn’t move. 

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Carolyn, honey? 

           She waits for him to leave.

                                 HENRY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Open the door...C’mon, Care-Bear, 
                        let me in...Carolyn?...

           After a moment, he gives up and walks away.  She cradles 
           her knees.  And cries. 

           INT. HENRY’S ROOM - LATER

           Henry plays Sudoku.  He accidentally tears through the 
           paper with his pen and CHUCKS the pages against the wall.  

           He looks on his night stand and sees Joyce’s yellow 
           letter.  He picks it up and reads it. 

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Henry, disheveled in his pajamas, stares into Joyce’s 
           closet.  It’s empty except for a couple outdated jeans.  
           He cradles the phone to his ear.
                                 RON, HENRY’S BOSS (O.S.)
                        Are you sick?

                                 HENRY
                                (into phone)
                        Yeah.  I think I got that bug 
                        that’s going around. 

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        What bug?

                                 HENRY
                        There’s a bug.  That’s going 
                        around.

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        You realize, Henry, in your twenty 
                        two years of working here you 
                        haven’t missed a single day?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just...maybe it was bad milk.  

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        Well, we need you around here, 
                        buddy.  Get some rest and we’ll 
                        see you tomorrow.  

           Henry beeps off the phone.  He can’t move.

           INT. NORTHBROOK COURT - MORNING

           Gail and Bruce speed walk.  Henry trails behind.

                                 GAIL
                        We’re not doing a fake tree.

                                 BRUCE
                        Every year we buy a Christmas 
                        tree, it lasts a month, we throw 
                        it out.  Save the environment.  
                        Global warming and all that.

                                 GAIL
                        Since when do you care about the 
                        environment?

                                 BRUCE
                        I almost always recycle.

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce left me. 

           Gail and Bruce stop, turn around.  
                                 BRUCE
                        What?

                                 GAIL
                        Are you kidding?

                                 HENRY
                        Keep walking. 

           Tears spill down Bruce’s face.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t start crying.  You’ll scare 
                        people.

           An ELDERLY COUPLE passes them as Henry politely nods.

                                (wipes Bruce’s tears)
                        I knew it.  I never wanted say it 
                        but I knew this day would come. 

                                 HENRY
                        What do you mean, you knew?

                                 GAIL
                        I always thought she was too young 
                        for you.  She always wanted to 
                        live the life she never had.  And 
                        frankly I never thought she seemed 
                        like Mom material to me. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well.  Let’s just say how we 
                        really feel.

                                 GAIL
                        Henry, did you honestly think she 
                        was going to stick around and 
                        enable your little phobias?

                                 HENRY
                        Stop calling them my little 
                        phobias.  Seriously.

                                 GAIL
                        Carolyn is staying with you I 
                        hope?

                                 HENRY
                        She has to if she wants to 
                        graduate high school.
                                 GAIL
                        You can do better.  I’ve always 
                        thought that. 

                                 HENRY
                        It’s classic mid-life crisis 
                        stuff.  She’ll lease the 
                        convertible she’s always wanted or 
                        get her lower back tattooed or 
                        whatever it is that women do and 
                        she’ll be back. 

           Henry continues.  Gail looks at Bruce like, “She ain’t 
           comin’ back.” 

           EXT. HILL ABOVE TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

           Carolyn and Ethan sit overlooking railroad tracks.  They 
           both smoke cigarettes like amateurs. 

                                 CAROLYN 
                        She should win Worst Mother on the 
                        Planet Award.  I mean the way she 
                        read that letter?  It’s like she 
                        learned it from her friggin’ 
                        Danielle Steele books. 

           Carolyn waits for a response but Ethan just puffs away.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear anything I just said?  
                        This is possibly the worst day of 
                        my entire life.  My mother 
                        abandoned me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Everything is temporary. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Wouldn’t you be upset if your 
                        parents split?

                                 ETHAN
                        The only thing my parents have in 
                        common is their therapy practice.  
                        Beyond that, they barely speak.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        My parents are so different from 
                        yours.  

           Carolyn inhales too much of her cigarette and coughs.  
                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        I cannot wait for college.

           A train SOUNDS in the distance.  

           Carolyn hurls herself onto Ethan as if they were the last 
           two people on Earth.

           They wildly make out as the enormous blur of steel 
           BARRELS past.  

           INT./EXT. THE VOLVO - DAY

           Henry drives Carolyn past well manicured houses into a 
           more upscale neighborhood.  Henry does a double take 
           toward Carolyn. 

                                 HENRY
                        You’re not wearing your seat belt.

                                 CAROLYN
                        And?  

                                 HENRY
                        And do you want your head through 
                        the windshield? 

                                 CAROLYN
                                (amused)
                        Graphic visual, Henry.

           Carolyn puts on her seat belt. 

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        How long is this thing going to 
                        last?  

                                 HENRY 
                        I have no idea.  This thing is 
                        Thanksgiving dinner and we don’t 
                        rush it.

           Carolyn takes out her phone and starts typing.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Who are you emailing on that?  You 
                        know I don’t like that. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s called texting and don’t 
                        worry about it. 

           Henry’s car pulls into the driveway of...
           GAIL AND BRUCE’S HOUSE 

           A giant inflatable turkey on the front lawn sways in the 
           wind.  Dozens of Thanksgiving decorations dot the lawn:  
           pumpkins, corn, life-sized pilgrim and Indian mannequins 
           reenacting the first Thanksgiving.

           INT. THE VOLVO - THAT MOMENT

                                 HENRY
                                (excited)
                        Look at that.  It’s the Mayflower.

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s like Thanksgiving puked all 
                        over their yard.

           INT. GAIL AND BRUCE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Wall-to-wall Native American decorations.  

           Gail and Bruce sit at the dining room table with their 
           perfectly well-behaved kids HANNAH (17) and ADAM (14).  
           They’re all dressed as pilgrims.  The dog lies on the 
           floor, unhappily wearing an Indian headdress.

                                 ADAM
                        May I have the dark meat?

           Bruce passes Adam a plate of turkey. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, Dad. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Pass the creamed corn?

           Gail passes the corn. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Mom. 

           Carolyn stares at this polite exchange in disbelief.  
           Henry recognizes the absurdity of it but plays along.  

                                 HENRY
                        Please pass the yams, Carolyn.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (not having it)
                        They’re right in front of you.
           Everyone buries the awkward moment with sips of milk.

                                 ADAM
                        Who’d like some dark meat?

                                 HENRY
                        What the hell, I’ll try some dark 
                        meat.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Dangerous, Henry. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Why don’t we go around the table 
                        and say what we give thanks for. 
                        It’s Miller tradition. 

           Hannah eagerly raises her hand.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Hannah, you start.

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m thankful for the bountiful 
                        food that has found its way onto 
                        our dining room table.  And I’m 
                        thankful for my kind and generous 
                        family, including Mom, Dad and 
                        Adam.  As well as my beautiful 
                        extended family, Uncle Henry and 
                        cousin Carolyn.

           Gail and Bruce smile proudly at Hannah.  Carolyn rolls 
           her eyes and stabs a piece of turkey meat.

           INT. THE VOLVO - LATER

           Henry drives.  Carolyn sits in the passenger seat with 
           tin foil-wrapped leftovers in her lap.  

                                 HENRY
                        Wasn’t that nice?

                                 CAROLYN
                        That was beyond retarded.  

                                 HENRY
                        C’mon, now.

                                 CAROLYN
                        What?  They’re all so fake.  And 
                        those costumes...ugh...
                                 HENRY
                        So they’re a little into the 
                        holiday spirit.  They’re family.  
                        It’s nice to have all of us 
                        together. 

           This just hangs there. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Almost all of us. 

           INT. TRIPP KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Henry sits at the kitchen table eating a piece of pumpkin 
           pie, playing Sudoku.  

           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Carolyn, at her computer, scans the Smith College web 
           site.  

           Her phone BEEPS.  A text from Ethan reads:  u cumming...?

           Conflicted, she puts the phone down and goes back to her 
           computer.  

           After a few moments, she stops.  She quickly grabs a 
           candle and her iPod, stuffs them into her backpack and 
           goes.

           INT. TRIPP KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Carolyn excitedly runs downstairs and heads for the door.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Hasta.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t tell me you’re going to 
                        Ethan’s now.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Totes.

                                 HENRY
                        What?  You don’t have time to 
                        finish the word?

           Carolyn’s gone.
           EXT. ETHAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Ethan opens the door.  Carolyn has put on makeup and 
           throws him a sexy smile. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’ve come equipped. 

           Ethan grins. 

           INT. ETHAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Sade’s “No Ordinary Love” plays on an iPod speaker.  A 
           red candle lights the room.  

           Ethan lays in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Frustrated.  
           Slightly annoyed.  He shifts uncomfortably and then...

                                 ETHAN
                        C’mere. 

           Carolyn surfaces and slides next to Ethan.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I thought that’s how you liked it.

           Ethan unwraps a condom.  Puts it on.  Gets on top of her.

                                 ETHAN
                        Ready?

           Carolyn nods.  Ethan slowly shifts his weight and enters 
           her.  

           Carolyn winces from the initial pain.  A few awkward 
           thrusts.  It ends as quickly as it started.  And Ethan 
           CLIMAXES loudly.  

           He falls on the bed next to her.  Carolyn covers her 
           disappointment with a smile.  Tries to be upbeat.

                                 CAROLYN
                        That was...

           And fails.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        ...horrible. 

                                 ETHAN 
                        Yeah, that wasn’t very good.  Not 
                        what I’d imagined breaking in a 
                        virgin would be like. 
                                 CAROLYN
                        You and me both.  Was I at least 
                        better than Sarah Ambraowitz?

           Ethan shrugs. 

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        How about Ashley Willner?

           No response.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Heather Petterelli?

           He thinks.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, I’m mortified.  I 
                        wasn’t as good as Heather 
                        Petterelli?  

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t screw and tell. 

           She rolls over.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be mad.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m not mad.  I just wanted my 
                        first time to be special. 

                                 ETHAN
                        That was special.  We have a 
                        candle and everything.  By the 
                        way...Sade? 

           Ethan leans in and begins kissing her neck.  

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I still can’t believe you were a 
                        virgin before this. 

           Ethan kisses her as Carolyn stares at the ceiling.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (empty)
                        Me neither. 

           INT. TRIPP KITCHEN - DAY

           Henry drinks coffee.  Carolyn enters with her backpack.
                                 HENRY
                        I didn’t get the memo that you 
                        were spending the night with that 
                        boy.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I didn’t write a memo. 

           Henry sees Carolyn open the fridge and take out a Red 
           Bull.  He stands.   

                                 HENRY
                        Have a seat.  

                                 CAROLYN
                                (paranoid)
                        Why?

                                 HENRY
                        We’re going to have lunch.  
                        Together.  Like a family. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        What family eats lunch together?

           Carolyn pops open the Red Bull and checks her phone.  
           Henry opens the fridge and only sees stacks of Lean 
           Cuisines.  He shuts it.

                                 HENRY
                        C’mon.  I’m taking you somewhere.

           Henry puts his jacket on.  Carolyn just stares at him. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Put your coat on.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I can’t go anywhere.  Ethan and I 
                        are hanging out later.

                                 HENRY
                        You just left that kid.  Let’s go, 
                        I’m taking you to your favorite 
                        place.

           EXT. ADVENTURE ISLAND MINI GOLF AND SAFARI - LATER

           An over-the-top interpretation of an Amazon rain forest. 

           The Volvo pulls into the crowded parking lot. 
           INT. THE VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           Henry smiles fondly as he finds a parking space.  Carolyn 
           is stunned silent.

                                 CAROLYN
                        You must be joking. 

                                 HENRY
                        You love this place.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Yeah.  Then I turned seven.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re never too old to play mini-
                        golf with your Dad. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I don’t do anything with the word 
                        “mini” in front of it.

                                 HENRY
                        Technically, it’s “miniature.”

           Henry excitedly gets out of the car.  Carolyn sighs and 
           follows. 

           INT. ADVENTURE ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry and Carolyn through a lion’s mouth as a loud 
           “GRRRRR!” is heard over JUNGLE MUSIC.

           Carolyn is mortified. 

           MINI GOLF AREA

           FAMILIES play golf at various themed holes. 

           A volcano bubbles up fake lava.  Henry steps up to the 
           tee like an earnest pro-golfer, measuring the distance to 
           the hole with his putter.  

           Carolyn sits on a nearby bench, bouncing a golf ball, not 
           having it. 

           Henry hits the ball, getting close to the hole.

                                 HENRY
                        Bet you can’t beat that shot. 
           With a sudden burst of defiance, Carolyn steps up to the 
           tee.  She places her ball down and focuses.  Henry is 
           impressed. 

           Carolyn swings and hits the ball HARD.  It flies across 
           the park into a FAMILY of four. 

           Carolyn smirks.  Henry waves “sorry” to the family and 
           glares at Carolyn.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           RESTAURANT AREA

           Henry and Carolyn in a booth.  Henry eats a burger and 
           fries while Carolyn texts on her phone.  

           Henry searches for something to say.

                                 HENRY
                        Who are you texting to now?  Can’t 
                        you put that away while we eat?

           Carolyn stashes her phone, annoyed.

                                 CAROLYN
                        This food is nauseating. 

                                 HENRY 
                        You realize Mom’s just going 
                        through a phase.  This will all 
                        blow over and she’ll be back 
                        before we know it.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (not buying it)
                        I just can’t believe you brought 
                        me here. 

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, how about after this we go 
                        home and jump in a pile of leaves?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Seriously.  When are you going to 
                        realize I’m not a child?

                                 HENRY
                        While we’re waiting for Mom to 
                        come back, it wouldn’t hurt for us 
                        to...you know, do stuff.  And 
                        things.  Like that.  You know? 
                                 CAROLYN
                        You are way in denial, dude. 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s your boyfriend talking, not 
                        you. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        If it weren’t for you, Mom would 
                        still be with us.   

                                 HENRY
                        Carolyn, this is not my fault.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Of course this is your fault.  How 
                        can you say that with a straight 
                        face?!

           Henry sees a young FAMILY of four in a nearby booth, 
           laughing and eating. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well.  I have a plan.  To get her 
                        back.

                                 CAROLYN
                        She doesn’t want us back. 

                                 HENRY
                        We’re gonna get her back.  
                                (convincing himself)
                        We will.  I have a plan to get Mom 
                        back. 

           With that, Henry takes a bite out of his burger.  

                                 CAROLYN
                                (yeah, right)
                        Awesome. 

           They eat in silence.  Like two strangers.

           MONTAGE:

           - Joyce lines a bookshelf with dozens of hard copy 
           Danielle Steele books in her new apartment.  Every one 
           she’s ever written.

           - Henry tries on a “hip” track suit and running shoes at 
           Foot Locker. 

           - Joyce scrubs down the kitchen counter tops.  Lets out a 
           little too much aggression and rage on her SOS pad.
           - Henry sits in the Volvo, parked across the street from 
           Joyce’s apartment.  He watches Joyce enter with a mop and 
           cleaning supplies.

           - Joyce hangs a shower curtain and places new towels on a 
           rack. 

           - Henry jogs by Joyce’s apartment in his new track suit 
           and shoes.  Then he jogs back the other way.  Clearly 
           trying to be seen. 

           - From inside her apartment, Joyce watches Henry jog 
           past.  She rolls her eyes and shuts her blinds. 

           END MONTAGE. 

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Boiling water.  Joyce slides in a box of pasta.

           Doorbell BUZZES. 

           Joyce peers through the eye hole and opens the door.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Welcome to Single Gal Central!

           Carolyn and Ethan awkwardly stare.

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Carolyn and Ethan eat spaghetti and meatballs.  Joyce 
           sips a glass of red wine and studies her glass.  

           Uncomfortable silence between them and then...

                                 JOYCE
                        Aren’t these glasses fun?  I got 
                        them at Gracious Home Outlet in 
                        Palatine.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Since when do you drink wine?

                                 JOYCE
                        We used to drink all the time 
                        until your father decided it made 
                        him too out of control.   

                                 ETHAN
                        Beaujolais.  It’s my favorite. 
                                 JOYCE
                        You know about fine wines?

                                 ETHAN 
                        We have a wine cellar.  My parents 
                        are connoisseurs.  And by 
                        connoisseurs I mean functioning 
                        alcoholics.

                                 JOYCE
                        You two need some.

           Joyce grabs two glasses and pours.  Ethan sips and 
           swirls, deciding if he likes it.  Carolyn gulps hers 
           down.

                                 JOYCE  (CONT’D)
                        It’s young.  But I like it. 

           Joyce suddenly realizes the double meaning.  So does 
           Ethan.  They share a quick glance as Ethan smiles into 
           his sip. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        And how is your father?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Annoying.  Suffocating.  
                        Ridiculous...

                                 JOYCE
                        So nothing’s changed.

                                 CAROLYN
                        When are you coming back? 

                                 JOYCE
                                (dodging the 
                                 question)
                        Ethan, are your parents together?

                                 ETHAN
                        They live in the same house, yes, 
                        but I wouldn’t exactly call them 
                        together. 

           Joyce is impressed with his answer.  

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A loud ACTION MOVIE plays on on the DVD player.  Joyce 
           and Ethan munch on popcorn, clearly loving the movie.  
           Carolyn is visibly in disbelief at how bad it is.
                                 CAROLYN
                        Why would the French guy be there? 

           No response.

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Anyone?  Why is French guy 
                        there?  That makes no sense.

                                 ETHAN
                        He’s the hit man. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I thought he was the bodyguard.

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’s not the bodyguard or the hit 
                        man.  What movie are you two 
                        watching?  Jesus.

           Carolyn gets up and goes to the bathroom.

           Joyce and Ethan barely notice.  Ethan pours Joyce another 
           glass of wine without taking his eyes off the screen.  
           Joyce smiles, appreciative.

           INT. JOYCE’S GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Ethan, now a little drunk, tries to get on top of Carolyn 
           in the guest room’s single bed.  The small bed makes it 
           difficult. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        So not happening.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why not?

                                 CAROLYN
                        My mom’s in the next room.  It’s 
                        weird.

           Ethan gets off of Carolyn with a defeated SIGH and lays 
           next to her. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Red Bull?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m okay. 

           He quietly exits.  
           Carolyn puts her head on the pillow.  Her eyelids slowly 
           close as she falls asleep.

           INT. JOYCE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ethan shuts the refrigerator, Red Bull in hand.

           And there’s Joyce, standing there as she was earlier, 
           holding an empty wine glass. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Didn’t scare you this time.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hello, Joyce.

           Joyce stumbles slightly, a little more than tipsy. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        More Beaujolais?

           Joyce doesn’t answer.  Just grins.

                                 JOYCE
                        Exactly what I need. 

           Ethan goes into the fridge, pulls out the bottle and 
           pours the rest of it into Joyce’s glass.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        All gone. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Guess we drank a lot.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Ethan?

                                 ETHAN
                        Joyce.

                                 JOYCE
                        I have a very serious question I 
                        need to ask you.

           Ethan is ready for it. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Yes?

           And then...

                                 JOYCE
                        Are you in love with my daughter?
                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 JOYCE
                        Are you in love.  With Carolyn.

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s only been a couple months. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Is that a no?

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ve never really thought about 
                        it...

           He thinks about it.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure I believe in love.  I 
                        mean, what is it other than some 
                        false cultural phenomenon society 
                        created so we can trick ourselves 
                        into pretending we’re not alone 
                        when we die.

           Joyce is slightly confused.  Too heady.  She smiles, 
           thinking he’s being cute.

                                 JOYCE
                        You’re a doll.  

           Joyce reaches past Ethan and puts her hand on his neck.  
           She leans in and checks the tag on his t-shirt.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        J. Crew again.  You certainly are 
                        consistent. 

           She doesn’t move her hand.  Ethan doesn’t move.  They 
           lock eyes.

           She lightly brushes the back of his neck.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Um...

           She leans in farther.  Her lips in line with his. 

           And he kisses her.  A peck on the lips.  But a kiss 
           nonetheless.    

           She pulls back, stunned sober.  Realizes what just 
           happened.
                                 JOYCE
                        I think...we should go to bed.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, that’s an excellent idea. 

           Ethan goes just as quickly as Joyce flips out the lights. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ethan slips into bed with Carolyn.  Carolyn is fast 
           asleep.  Ethan stares at the ceiling.  Turned on. 

           EXT. TRIPP HOUSE - DUSK

           Sun rises.  Autumn leaves FLY through the air. 

           Henry pushes an electric leaf blower, clearing out the 
           back yard leaves. 

           INT. TRIPP HOUSE - MORNING

           Henry sits at the kitchen table, sipping coffee and 
           reading the Freedom To Fly brochure as Carolyn enters.  

                                 HENRY
                        How was Mom’s place?

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s okay.  

                                 HENRY
                        Is it nice inside?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Ish.  I guess.  It’s in a weird 
                        part of town.  

                                 HENRY 
                        I know that building.  Her rent’s 
                        not cheap. 
                                (under his breath)
                        Thanks to her father.  Didn’t do 
                        crap for us.  
                                (holds up pamphlet)
                        Anyways, guess what this is?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Single Parenting For Dum Dums?
                                 HENRY
                        It’s my new plan on how to get Mom 
                        back. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Sweet.  Let me know how that goes.

           And she heads upstairs.

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER HALLWAY - DAY

           Henry nervously walks down a generic brick hallway.  He 
           has second thoughts and turns around.  He stops.  Turns 
           back and heads in the original direction. 

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nine PEOPLE sit on folding chairs in a circle.  The 
           instructor, DAWN, relentlessly Midwestern upbeat, leads 
           the group.  

                                 DAWN
                        Okay, next.  Last one’s always a 
                        toughie.

                                 NICK
                                (pointing to each 
                                 person)
                        I’m Nick, Dawn, JoAnne...uh...

                                 MAN
                        Manuel.

                                 DAWN
                        No helping.  Everyone has to learn 
                        on their own.

                                 NICK
                        Manuel, Lilly, Waleed, 
                        Roshanda...Jeremy...

                                 GEREMY
                        It’s Geremy.  With a hard G.

                                 NICK
                        Sorry, Geremy, um...

                                 WOMAN                                       
                                (dark)
                        Rhymes with death.

                                 NICK
                        Beth.
                                 DAWN
                                (clapping)
                        Very good. 

           Henry pushes open the double doors as everyone turns 
           around.

                                 HENRY
                        Is this the uh...fear of flying 
                        class?

                                  DAWN
                        Sure is.  Don’t be scared.  The 
                        water’s warm.  Hop in! 

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry sits with the group.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m Henry (pointing)...Nick, Dawn, 
                        JoAnne, Manuel, Lilly, Waleed, 
                        Roshanda, Beth and Jeremy.

                                 GEREMY
                        Geremy.

                                 HENRY
                        Geremy.

                                 DAWN
                        Impressive.

           Henry shrugs.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           A soap opera-handsome, silver-haired AIRLINE PILOT (50) 
           walks through a commercial plane, talking to camera.  

                                 PILOT
                        Afraid to fly?  Afraid of 
                        airplanes?  Afraid that the thirty 
                        tons of steel you’re strapped into 
                        at thirty thousand feet in the air 
                        is going to break a wing and crash 
                        into the ground?  Or worse, 
                        somehow spontaneously combust into 
                        a flaming ball of fire?  

           Henry and the class watches this instructional video on a 
           flat screen TV with terrified looks on their faces. 
                                 PILOT (CONT’D)
                        If so, you’re not alone.  Almost 
                        25 million Americans would prefer 
                        not to fly on commercial aircraft.   
                        Your fear of flying is real.  
                        Flying goes against basic, deeply-
                        rooted human instincts, including 
                        fear of falling, which is the 
                        earliest and most fundamental of 
                        all fears.  Through the three E’s, 
                        empathy, education, and 
                        experience, the “Freedom to Fly” 
                        clinic offers fearful flyers the 
                        tools to cope with their phobia 
                        and their fear to fly comfortably.  
                        I should know.  I used to be 
                        afraid to fly myself.  And now I’m 
                        a commercial airline pilot.  So 
                        fasten your seat belts everyone, 
                        because it’s going to be a smooth 
                        ride. 

           A WHEEZING noise is heard as the class turns to see Henry 
           HYPERVENTILATING with his eyes closed.

                                 DAWN
                        Oh my gosh, somebody get him a 
                        Sprite!

           A couple people gather around Henry.  

           Henry opens his eyes and sees LILLY, a kind-looking 
           brunette his age, popping open a can of Sprite.

                                 LILLY
                        You okay?

           Henry nods and sips.  

           EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Henry unlocks the Volvo.  He looks over his shoulder and 
           sees Lilly unlocking her car, also a Volvo.  They share a 
           laugh. 

                                 HENRY
                        Safest car on the road.  

                                 LILLY
                        You should really look into a 
                        newer model.  Air bags for every 
                        seat.
                                 HENRY
                        Is that the one with the heated, 
                        uh...

           Lilly has already slipped into her car and drives off.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                                (to himself, watching 
                                 her go)
                        Oh, okay...Safe travels. 

           MUSIC begins.

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joyce spins on a stationary bike to a HIP HOP song.  

           Doorbell BUZZES.  

           Confusion on her face.  Who could it be?

           She turns down the music, peeks through the blinds and 
           sees Ethan standing there, fixing his hair, nervous.

           A smile twists into place.  She opens the door.

                                 JOYCE
                        Ethan.  What brings you here?

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Joyce and Ethan sit on the couch.  Joyce pours him a 
           glass of wine. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I could really use a woman’s 
                        perspective.

           Ethan takes an over-confident gulp of wine.  He regards 
           Joyce.  Sees how sexy she looks in workout clothes.  

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m a woman.  And I have 
                        perspective.  

                                 ETHAN
                                (averting his eyes)
                        Carolyn...Your daughter...My... 
                        girlfriend...

                                 JOYCE
                        All true so far.
                                 ETHAN
                        Remember when you asked me if I 
                        was in love with her?  And I said 
                        I wasn’t sure? 

                                 JOYCE
                        I think I was a little wasted that 
                        night.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, I’m not.  

                                 JOYCE
                        You’re not wasted?

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not in love.  With Carolyn.  
                        Your daughter.  And I never will 
                        be.

           Ethan feigns disappointment.  Joyce puts her hand on 
           Ethan’s knee, consoling him.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Sweetie, it’s okay.  Not everyone 
                        is meant to be in a relationship.

                                 ETHAN
                        Is that why you split up with 
                        Henry?

                                 JOYCE
                        Among other reasons. 

           Ethan looks at Joyce’s hand on his knee.  He looks back 
           at her with intense eyes.  She takes her hand away. 

           Ethan downs the rest of his wine.  Nothing left to say.  

                                 ETHAN
                        I should go. 

           Joyce stands and walks Ethan to the door. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the wise advice, Joyce.

                                 JOYCE
                        I know you’ll do what’s right.

           Ethan reaches for the door but turns back, about to say 
           something.  They lock eyes.  They know what they’re about 
           to do is wrong.  But they do it anyway. 
           And they start to kiss.  This time, it’s more than a 
           peck.  It’s messy.  Uninhibited.  

           He pulls off her tank top and they fall back onto the 
           couch together.  

           Ethan ravages Joyce like an oversexed school boy.  
           Because that’s what he is.  And she loves it.

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Ethan and Joyce lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.  

           Ethan wears a blissful smile.  Joyce’s mind has been 
           blown.

                                 JOYCE
                        Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That was 
                        just...(LAUGHS)

           And now she feels guilty.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Have you told Carolyn what you 
                        told me?

                                 ETHAN
                        I will.

                                 JOYCE
                        You should do it now.  It’s not 
                        right to lead women on.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay.

                                 JOYCE
                        But be a gentleman about it. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Right.

                                 JOYCE
                        Maybe write her a letter.   

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Carolyn stands at her locker, holding her cell phone.

           A text from Ethan.  

           It reads:  hey...we need 2 break up......
           INT. THE VOLVO - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry drives, overwhelmed. 

                                 HENRY
                        Are you...gonna be okay, sweetie?

           Carolyn, in the passenger seat, SOBBING.  

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Should I pull over?

                                 CAROLYN
                                (through sobs)
                        No!...Don’t...pull...over...

                                 HENRY
                        Well, you’re making me nervous, 
                        honey.  I can’t drive like this.

                                 CAROLYN
                        He...stole...

                                 HENRY
                        What?  He stole what?!  (to 
                        himself)  I need to pull over.  
                        Carolyn, what did that a-hole 
                        steal?  Did he shoplift?  Have you 
                        two been shoplifting?  

                                 CAROLYN
                                (huge sobs)
                        He stole my vir...gin...it...y...

           Not what Henry was expecting.  Their car swerves, almost 
           colliding with an oncoming car.  

           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Carolyn hides under the covers, still SOBBING.  Henry 
           sits by her side, trying his best to console her, holding 
           a hot mug of tea.  

                                 HENRY
                        Sweetie...

           Carolyn kicks and SCREAMS.  Henry awkwardly tries to keep 
           the tea from spilling.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just...come back. 
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

           Carolyn and April carry lunch trays and find seats near 
           the artsy/theater crowd.

                                 APRIL
                        A text message?!

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’s a total abortion. 

                                 APRIL
                        I am so sorry. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Honestly, I’m relieved.  I can’t 
                        imagine marrying the first guy I 
                        ever did it with anyway.  That’s 
                        just gross. 

                                 APRIL
                        You’re better than him, Carolyn.  
                        He’s a male slut.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I should probably get tested for 
                        chlamydia. 

                                 APRIL
                        Congratulations.  Your first 
                        boyfriend, sexual experience and 
                        breakup all within three months.  

           Carolyn looks up.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Don’t move.  Question Mark.

           April sees Soon-Yi walking towards them, carrying a lunch 
           tray.  They quickly scarf down their food. 

                                 SOON-YI
                        What’s up you guys?  Can I sit 
                        with you?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Grab wood, Soon-Yi.  We were just 
                        about to leave.

           They start to get up. 
                                 SOON-YI
                        Carolyn?  I just wanted to say?  
                        Sorry about your recent break up 
                        with Ethan?

                                 CAROLYN
                        How the hell did you know?

                                 SOON-YI
                        Word travels fast?

           Carolyn can’t believe it.

                                 APRIL
                        Is that a question or a statement?

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Heavy BREATHING.  

           Henry and his class sit cross-legged on small mats on the 
           floor.   

                                 DAWN
                        Aviaphobia.  Aeroanxiety.  Or, 
                        fear of flying.  Like any phobia, 
                        it’s extremely treatable.  These 
                        simple breathing exercises will 
                        help you relax when it comes time 
                        to treat your fear.  I’m not only 
                        a certified fear anxiety 
                        counselor, I’m also a trained 
                        yogi.  Now if you all position 
                        yourself in child’s pose...

           Dawn sits on her feet.  The group tries to follow suit 
           but none of them are very limber, which results in an 
           awkward contortion of bodies. 

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Everyone close your eyes and 
                        continue to inhale through your 
                        nose and out.  

           Everyone closes their eyes and breathes.  Henry slowly 
           opens his eyes and stares at Lilly, intrigued. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Carolyn draws in her pad at the kitchen table.  Henry 
           enters.
                                 HENRY
                        Well, hello.  Are you feeling a 
                        little better?

                                 CAROLYN
                                (defensive)
                        I’m great.  Over it.  

                                 HENRY
                                (suspicious)
                        That was fast.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I realized today I could never be 
                        into someone who wasn’t into 
                        comics. 

                                 HENRY
                        Your Mother never liked my 
                        crossword puzzles or Sudoku.  She 
                        calls them time-suckers. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        He had a sick case of buttne too. 

                                 HENRY
                        Buttne?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Butt acne.

           Henry and Carolyn share their first laugh. 

                                 HENRY
                        The sad thing is, I’m willing to 
                        forgive her. 

           Carolyn bursts out crying. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Aw, honey...

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The group sits in a circle.  JoAnne (40s) is in the 
           middle of a confession.

                                 JOANNE
                        ...And I looked around, at all the 
                        tattered luggage and burning 
                        carcasses and I realized--I was 
                        the only survivor.  

           The group GASPS.
                                 JOANNE (CONT’D)
                        A hundred and ten passengers.  I 
                        don’t know why Jesus picked me.  
                        Seems unfair.  I lost my entire 
                        rugby team that day.  State 
                        champions, three years undefeated.  

                                 DAWN
                        And how did that make you feel?

                                 JOANNE
                        Haven’t been able to get on a 
                        plane since.  Or coach rugby.

           The group politely CLAPS.

                                 DAWN
                        Thank you for sharing, JoAnne. 

           Dawn looks at Henry and smiles.  He shifts in his chair, 
           uncomfortable.

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Henry, would you like to 
                        participate in Share Circle?  No 
                        judgements. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well...my name is Henry.  And I’m 
                        a travel agent. 

           The group chuckles, confused looks. 

                                 MANUEL
                        You’re a what?

                                 DAWN
                        You never told us that.

                                 WALEED 
                        How is that technically possible?

                                 BETH
                        You’re a travel agent.  And you’re 
                        afraid to fly.

           Henry sighs.  He’s gotten this response before. 

                                 HENRY
                        Since I was a kid I was always 
                        fascinated with air travel.  I 
                        used to say the two biggest 
                        miracles in life were airplanes 
                        and babies.  But babies don’t give 
                        me panic attacks.
                                 ROSHANDA
                        That is some weird ass shit.

           He swallows.

                                 HENRY
                        When I was twelve years old, my 
                        aunt and uncle retired on the same 
                        day.  Both school teachers.  So to 
                        kick off their retirement, they 
                        booked a Mediterranean cruise.

                        What happened?

                                 HENRY
                        Their plane touched down in Miami, 
                        landed the wrong way, skidded off 
                        the runway and crashed.  They 
                        didn’t make it.  Our family was 
                        devastated.  And since then I’ve 
                        tried everything.  I even became a 
                        travel agent.  But I was never 
                        able to get on a plane.  Now it’s 
                        ruined my marriage.  And my life.

           Roshanda dabs her eyes with her sleeve.

                                (moved)
                        Thanks for sharing, Henry. 

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joyce and Ethan naked in bed.  Staring at the ceiling. 

                                 JOYCE
                        My.  God!  The way you did that 
                        thing with the thing?

                                 ETHAN
                                (bragging)
                        You’re definitely the oldest 
                        person I’ve done it with. 

           Joyce smacks Ethan with mock anger. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Fuck you very much!
                                 ETHAN
                        In a good way.

           Joyce takes the compliment.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Girls my age don’t understand sex.  
                        They don’t get me.  I’m beyond 
                        them. 

           Joyce frowns.  She has a thought. 

                                 JOYCE
                        You didn’t...I mean...

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 JOYCE
                        Never mind.  I don’t want to know.

                                 ETHAN
                        Have sex with Carolyn? 

           Joyce leaps out of bed, starts to get dressed. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, this is horrible.  I’m a 
                        horrible, horrible person!  What 
                        was I thinking?!...Did you?

           Ethan starts to answer.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t answer that!  No.  No, no, 
                        no, no.  It’s better if I don’t 
                        know.  

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s not like it matters.  We 
                        broke up.

                                 JOYCE
                        It does matter!  It means I’m an 
                        awful mother who can’t control her 
                        sexual urges.  I wanted new 
                        experiences.  I wanted to go 
                        Bungee jumping or do hot yoga.  
                        But this?  This is sick.  I’m 
                        sick!

           Ethan stands, puts on his boxers. 
                                 ETHAN
                        Okay, maybe this is not exactly 
                        the societal norm.  But basic 
                        sexual desire transforms all moral 
                        and ethical codes. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, don’t justify this with Mommy 
                        and Daddy’s psychiatry bullshit.  
                        Please.

           Ethan stares at Joyce. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why did you leave Henry?

                                 JOYCE
                        When I married him I knew he 
                        couldn’t fly.  But over the years 
                        he became afraid of practically 
                        everything.

                                 ETHAN
                        That’s a lie.

           Joyce is skeptical, but all ears. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        You left him because you wanted to 
                        live the life you gave up.  
                        Because you got married and had a 
                        kid younger than you thought you 
                        would.  

           This strikes a chord.  Joyce sits.  

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        And you ended your marriage 
                        because you wanted to know what it 
                        felt like to be free, right?  

           Joyce looks at Ethan like he can see inside her soul.  
           And it’s turning her on.  She nods.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        So be free. 

           She forms a mischievous smile. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A red sporty convertible speeds down an empty street.  
                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, once again, 
                        please make sure your seat belts 
                        are securely fastened as we are 
                        about to experience some minor 
                        turbulence...Seriously, buckle 
                        that shit up.  

           Joyce speeds behind the wheel with Ethan in the passenger 
           seat.  The top is down and she cranks up the heat.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        As we travel past the flat plains 
                        of rural Illinois, consider 
                        yourself lucky that you are so 
                        prepared for something like this. 
                        Because I certainly didn’t see any 
                        of it coming.  

           Joyce and Ethan LAUGH without a care in the world.

                                 JOYCE
                        Henry would never let me rent one 
                        of these.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hit it.

           They speed off.

           INT. APPLEBEE’S - NIGHT

           Joyce and Ethan sit in a booth, feeding each other Mile 
           High Ice Cream Pie®.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        This was going on for a couple 
                        weeks.  I guess my mother’s idea 
                        of adventure is sharing a nasty 
                        dessert with...

                                 JOYCE
                        You’re eighteen, right?

                                 ETHAN
                                (lying)
                        Yep.  Why?

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        ...a seventeen-year old. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Just checking. 
                                 ETHAN
                        You need to be eighteen to eat 
                        Oreo crusted pie?

           She stuffs more in his mouth.

                                 JOYCE
                                (laughing)
                        Shut up.

           INT. STATIONARY STATION - DAY

           Joyce rings out a customer with Soon-Yi, animatedly 
           talking. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        ...And she wouldn’t shut up about 
                        it...

                                 SOON-YI
                        You’re so lucky?  That you found 
                        someone?  It sounds so romantic?  
                        What’s his name? 

                                 JOYCE
                                (mischievous)
                        That’s my little secret, Soon-Yi. 

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The group stands around a line of folding chairs with 
           numbers on them. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, Henry didn’t have a 
                        clue anything was happening 
                        outside of his own new world...

                                 DAWN
                        It’s aircraft simulation day!  I 
                        Photoshopped mock boarding passes 
                        that you’ll each take and proceed 
                        to your “seat.” 

           Dawn laughs at her use of air quotes.  Everyone grows 
           nervous, including Henry.  

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start with Manuel...

           One by one each person gets their boarding pass and sits 
           in their assigned seats. 
           Henry and Lilly sit next to each other and smile. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        ...and was probably feeling pretty 
                        studly himself. 

           INT. IMAX MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Loud ACTION movie.  Joyce and Ethan eat popcorn, loving 
           it.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        And apparently, this is a thing.  
                        The older women with younger boys 
                        thing.  Florida being the most 
                        concentrated area of May-December 
                        romances.  

           INT. METRO CHICAGO - NIGHT

           Rock club.  An obscure emo BAND performs a love ballad on 
           stage in front of a young CROWD.

           Ethan sways to the music with his eyes closed.  Joyce 
           pretends to enjoy it, nodding her head in parts. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Or should I say, the most-
                        disgusting-thing-you-could 
                        possibly-imagine romances.  I’m 
                        allowed to judge.  She’s my 
                        mother. 

           BELL RINGS.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           Carolyn and April carry their books down the crowded 
           hallway.

                                 APRIL
                        Don’t get upset. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        That pretty much guarantees I’m 
                        about to get upset.

                                 APRIL
                        Fuck Face.  Twelve o’clock. 

           They stop.  Carolyn looks sick to her stomach.
           In the distance Ethan chats up MS. MARGOLIES, Spanish 
           teacher (20s).  She’s sexy in a way that suggests her 
           last job may have been at Hooters.  She LAUGHS at 
           everything Ethan says. 

           Soon-Yi appears behind them. 

                                 SOON-YI
                        Rumor has it?  They’re boning.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Señora Margolies?  She is so ew.

                                 APRIL
                        Supposedly fake tits.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        She’s so old.  And he’s terrible 
                        in Spanish.  I don’t believe it.

                                 SOON-YI
                        That’s what I heard?

           With that, Soon-Yi walks away. 

                                 APRIL
                        You really think they’re doing it?

                                 CAROLYN
                        That is so wrong on about a 
                        million levels.

                                 APRIL
                        It kind of makes sense.  He’s done 
                        everyone else.  

           They can’t stop staring. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I like her baby sweater.

           EXT. GAIL AND BRUCE’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Enough Christmas lights to power a small country.  
           Plastic snowmen mingle with twelve plastic reindeer on 
           the snow-covered yard.  Instead of the inflatable 
           Thanksgiving turkey there is an enormous snow globe 
           filled with a Nativity scene.  

           The Volvo pulls into the driveway.  
           INT. GAIL AND BRUCE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Christmas explosion.  Every inch of the house is 
           decorated. 

           The dog runs by wearing antlers.

           Gail, Bruce and their two kids, Adam and Hannah, sit at 
           the table in their best Christmas sweaters.  Henry and 
           Carolyn sit at the opposite end.

                                 GAIL
                        I want you to really think about 
                        joining us on our trip, you two. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Where are you going?

                                 BRUCE
                        You haven’t told her?

                                 GAIL
                        You and your father are coming 
                        with us to Hawaii in January. 

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s just wait and see.

           Gail gives Henry a look:  You WILL join us. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Carolyn, are you coming with us to 
                        midnight mass tonight?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Yeah, no. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Come on, cuz, family tradition.  
                        We used to go when we were kids, 
                        remember?

                                 HENRY
                        Come on, Care.  It’ll be a nice 
                        family outing. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I wasn’t planning on worshipping 
                        Jesus tonight. They won’t let me 
                        in dressed like this anyway. 
                                 GAIL
                        You can wear something of 
                        Hannah’s.  You girls are about the 
                        same size. 

                                 BRUCE
                        You have to come, Carolyn.  We all 
                        come home and have ice cream cake 
                        afterwards.  It’s the one night a 
                        year we break all the rules.  

           Carolyn sighs, caving in. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Mom?  Dad?  May I be excused?  
                        I’ll go prepare some outfits for 
                        Carolyn. 

                                 GAIL
                        Absolutely.  Oh, pick out 
                        something festive. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I have just the thing.  Meet me in 
                        my room in five minutes, Carolyn. 

           Hannah goes upstairs.  Carolyn mimes Hannah’s polite 
           demeanor to herself.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Carolyn walks and sees Gail and Bruce’s perfect family 
           photos taken around the world:  The London Bridge, a 
           Mayan temple, a Venetian gondola.  The family wears 
           outfits to match each city.  Carolyn fake gags.  

           She stops at the closed door at the end of the hallway 
           and knocks. 

                                 HANNAH
                                (from behind the 
                                 door)
                        Who is it?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Who do you think?

           Hannah suspiciously opens the door a crack, makes sure 
           she’s alone.

           INT. HANNAH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Carolyn enters.  Hannah locks the door, paranoid. 
                                 CAROLYN
                        Why are you being weird?

                                 HANNAH
                                (casual)
                        I’m not. 

           Carolyn walks in and looks around the pristine bedroom. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        You got rid of your princess bed.

                                 HANNAH
                        We’re not children anymore, 
                        Carolyn. 

           Carolyn looks down on the bed and sees two Christmas 
           sweaters laid out on the bed.  She slowly looks up.

                                 CAROLYN
                        What smells like...? 

           She whips around and sees--

           Hannah take a huge toke off an eight inch bong, a fan 
           blowing the smoke out an open window.

                                 HANNAH
                        Acapulco Gold.  
                                (exhaling)
                        This shit is not cheap.

           Carolyn is shocked and amused.

           INT. GAIL AND BRUCE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Henry helps Gail and Bruce clean and put dishes into the 
           dishwasher. 

                                 HENRY
                        It’s really helping me with my 
                        problem.

                                 GAIL
                        It’s not AA.

                                 BRUCE
                        Hon.

                                 GAIL
                        What?  I just don’t understand why 
                        he needs a class.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GAIL (CONT'D)
                        The only way to actually learn 
                        something is to do it, Henry.  
                        Come with us to Hawaii.  Problem 
                        solved.

                                 HENRY
                        Why can’t you be supportive of 
                        this?

                                 GAIL
                        Just seems like a waste of time.  

           INT. HANNAH’S BEDROOM

           Carolyn and Hannah both stand in matching Christmas 
           sweaters in front of a full-length mirror, GIGGLING.  

                                 CAROLYN
                                (stoned)
                        We look like elves. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Evil elves.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I can’t believe you get high. 

           Hannah goes to her drawer, pulls out a couple joints and 
           gives them to Carolyn.  

           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           A row of solemn churchgoers listen to the PRIEST speak.  

           Henry sits next to Gail, Bruce and Adam.  Behind them, 
           Hannah and Carolyn sit trying to hold in giggles.  

           Finally, Carolyn laughs out loud. 

           The entire congregation looks back.

           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Carolyn lays in bed, examining her joints, still high.  
           Henry opens the door.  Carolyn discreetly slips them 
           under the cover. 

                                 CAROLYN
                                (laughing)
                        Who’s that knockin’ at my door?

                                 HENRY
                        I just had to tell you something.
                                 CAROLYN
                        What up, chicken butt?

                                 HENRY
                                (squinting)
                        Did you have some egg nog tonight?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Yeah.  That.  Egg nog.  Mm-hm.

           Henry kneels down by her bed.

                                 HENRY
                        Anyway, I’m going on a plane.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Where to?

                                 HENRY
                        Nowhere, actually.  But my fear 
                        instructor is making us all get on 
                        an actual plane.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Fear instructor.  That’s 
                        hilarious.  I should be impressed, 
                        right?

                                 HENRY
                        Some of these people can’t even 
                        stand to look at planes let alone 
                        sit on them. 

                                 CAROLYN
                                (actually sincere)
                        I’m so proud of you, Dad. 

                                 HENRY
                        Aw, honey.  Thanks.  You should 
                        tell your mom. 

           Carolyn looks down. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Is my bed melting?

           Henry looks confused and stands.

                                 HENRY
                        You certainly had fun tonight.  
                        I’m so glad you and Hannah are 
                        chummy again.  Why don’t you get 
                        some sleep.  

           Henry looks back at her.  She’s already fallen asleep.
           INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A MARIACHI BAND serenades tables.

           Henry and Lilly sit in a booth, reading their menus.  
           Henry looks up.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m married.

                                 LILLY 
                        ...Okay.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, technically separated but 
                        it’s short term.  I just wanted 
                        you to know that before...

                                 LILLY
                        Before we have a Mexican dinner as 
                        friends?

                                 HENRY
                                (put in his place)
                        Right.  
                                (looks at menu, then)
                        How about you?  Are you...? 

                                 LILLY
                        Divorced, actually.  Three years 
                        going strong.

                                 HENRY
                        Sorry to hear that.

           Lilly shrugs.  

                                 LILLY
                        First you say “taking a break,” 
                        then you say “separated.”  Before 
                        you know it you’re signing papers 
                        and it’s legal. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, I’m pretty sure it’s not 
                        going to end like that for me. 

           A busboy places a basket of chips and two kinds of salsa 
           on the table.  They start munching.  

                                 LILLY
                        So, travel agent.
                                 HENRY
                                (proud)
                        Assistant manager at AAAA Travel.  
                        Twenty two years and counting.

                                 LILLY
                        And afraid to fly.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s me.
                                (eating the salsa)
                        Whoa.  Have the brown one.

           Lilly tastes.

                                 LILLY
                        That is really incredible. 

                                 HENRY
                        A little spicy but I like it.

                                 LILLY
                        No, I mean you being a travel 
                        agent. 

                                 HENRY
                        I’ve heard that...What do you do?

                                 LILLY
                        Real estate.  I sell all those big 
                        houses on the lake.  Although, not 
                        lately.  

           The mariachi band suddenly appears at their table, 
           SERENADING them.  Henry enjoys it but Lilly is clearly 
           uncomfortable.  Henry politely waves them off.

                                 HENRY
                        You okay?

                                 LILLY
                        Just not a big fan of Mariachi 
                        bands. 

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, they were kind of out of 
                        key.

                                 LILLY
                        I’m afraid of them, Henry.  

                                 HENRY
                        I thought you were afraid of 
                        flying.
                                 LILLY
                        I am.  But also Mariachi bands.  
                        And wax museums.

                                 HENRY
                        Wax museums I can see.  But 
                        mariachi bands? 

                                 LILLY
                        I’m also afraid of heights.  And  
                        elevators and escalators.  And 
                        snakes.  And microwaves.  And 
                        pickles.  I cannot go near a 
                        pickle. 

                                 HENRY
                        I guess I’m not a fan of 
                        microwaves either.  But what has a 
                        pickle ever done to scare you? 

                                 LILLY
                        I also can’t watch any movie with 
                        Liam Neeson. 

                                 HENRY
                        You’re afraid of Liam Neeson?

                                 LILLY
                        If I met him in real life I’d 
                        probably do that hyperventilating 
                        thing you do.  Even his name 
                        scares me.  Liam.  Neeson.

           Lilly shudders.  Henry is fascinated. 

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Joyce spins on her stationary bike as Carolyn watches TV. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Aunt Gail wants us to go to Hawaii 
                        with them.

                                 JOYCE
                        Last time I checked, you can’t 
                        drive to Hawaii. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I guess he’s taking some flying 
                        class.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Like getting his pilot’s license? 
                                 CAROLYN
                        No, they beat the fear out of you.  
                        It’s like AA for freaky people. 

                                 JOYCE
                        That doesn’t sound like your 
                        father at all. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I know.  I think he might even 
                        have a lady friend. 

           Joyce peddles faster, avoids the topic, getting jealous.

                                 JOYCE
                        Any plans for New Years?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I don’t know.  Hang out. 

           MUSIC begins.

           INT. APRIL’S CAR - NIGHT

           April drives Carolyn, MUSIC playing.  They are more made 
           up than usual and dressed for a big night out.  Carolyn 
           wears all black.  

                                 APRIL
                        Soon-Yi said she saw his car at 
                        Strike ‘n Spare last night.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Sexing up Spanish teacher, no 
                        doubt. 

                                 APRIL
                        It’s New Years.  Don’t let him 
                        upset you.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m not.  I have better things to 
                        do.  Next. 

                                 APRIL
                        Maybe you’ll make out with a 
                        hottie tonight.

           Carolyn shrugs. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        I just can’t believe your parents 
                        let you go to college parties.
                                 APRIL
                        They want me to go to 
                        Northwestern.  I’m going to 
                        Northwestern. 

           They laugh and turn up the radio.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I cannot wait for freedom!  

                                 APRIL
                        Are all your applications in?

                                 CAROLYN
                        University of Chicago, U of I, 
                        Northwestern, Art Institute, and 
                        Smith.

                                 APRIL
                        Smith?  Isn’t that a little 
                        lesbian?

                                 CAROLYN
                        They have a great art program.  
                        And I just need the complete 
                        opposite of here.  

                                 APRIL
                        I worship this song.

           April BLASTS the music and they speed off. 

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           COLLEGE KIDS drink and play beer-pong.  April leads 
           Carolyn through the crowd as they step up to the bar.

                                 APRIL
                        What do we want?

           Carolyn seems overwhelmed by the options of booze and 
           then...

                                 CAROLYN
                        Shot of Jager.  Makers Mark 
                        chaser.  Neat. 

                                 APRIL
                                (laughing)
                        Okay then.

           They each do a shot and Carolyn remembers something.  She 
           reaches into her pocket and waves a joint.  April grins.
           INT. ETHAN’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Joyce looks around:  A Rothko painting, a grand piano, a 
           wall of first edition, classic, leather-bound books. 

           Joyce sips her wine, impressed.

           A hand holding two small pills interrupts Joyce’s tour. 
           Ethan stands there with his hand extended and a big grin 
           on his face.  

           Joyce looks up.

                                 ETHAN
                        Xanax.

                                 JOYCE
                        Drugs?

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s a muscle relaxant.  You want 
                        to try something else?  There’s a 
                        Walgreens in my mother’s bathroom.

           Joyce seems unsure.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on...adventure.

           Convinced, Joyce pops the pills, washing them down with 
           wine and a smile. 

                                 JOYCE
                        This house is unbelievable.  

                                 ETHAN
                        I cannot wait to get my own 
                        apartment.  I want to live in 
                        North Korea.

                                 JOYCE
                        North Korea?  Why the hell would 
                        you want to live there?

                                 ETHAN
                        It just seems like the weirdest 
                        place to go. 

                                 JOYCE
                        And where did you say your parents 
                        were?
                                 ETHAN
                        Santa Barbara.  They go every year 
                        until mid-January.

                                 JOYCE
                        I thought we can take a little 
                        trip somewhere.  I’m thinking 
                        snowboarding? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t snowboard. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I thought every kid did 
                        snowboarding. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m not a kid. 

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s not what I meant.  Anyway, 
                        we can learn together.  Plus, I 
                        bought a really cute outfit.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don’t know.  Seems pedestrian. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Kahlua and cream.  Cozy nights by 
                        the fire...

           Joyce feels the effects of the pills and wine.  She moves 
           in for a kiss.  Ethan, of course likes it. 

           INT. HENRY’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           On TV, Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin chat and wait 
           for the ball drop. 

           Henry sits on the couch, lost in a game of Sudoku. 

           INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - LATER

           The New Years COUNTDOWN is heard from outside the door 
           followed by CHEERS and NOISEMAKERS.

           Carolyn takes another hit off their joint and passes it 
           to April.  Uncontrollable GIGGLING as they blow smoke out 
           a crack in the window.  
           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Streamers and confetti cover the floor. The crowd has 
           thinned.  A COUPLE makes out on a love seat.  

           Carolyn and April sit across from them, stoned and 
           staring intensely.

                                 APRIL
                        Why is everything zig zag?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Acapulco Gold.  Quality shit.  

                                 APRIL
                        I am so thoroughly impressed you 
                        scored this.  You beat me in the 
                        drugs department but I’m still one 
                        up on you in the sex department.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Zach is kinda good for you.

                                 APRIL
                        P.S. We’re off again.  Turns out 
                        being chemistry partners wasn’t 
                        the best chemistry.

                                 CAROLYN
                        You didn’t tell me that. 

                                 APRIL
                        So not a big deal.

           They focus on the making out couple. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Are we forever going to be single?

                                 APRIL
                        PDA’s are not my thing, but that’s 
                        actually kinda hot. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        The guy or the girl?

           April contemplates this.

                                 APRIL
                        Both, actually. 

           The girl wraps her leg around the guy.
                                 CAROLYN
                        How does one even bend like that?

           As a joke, April mimics the leg action on Carolyn.  
           Carolyn plays along and dramatically rubs April’s hair.  
           April caresses Carolyn’s cheek intensely.  They both 
           crack up.  

           As the couple continues, so do the girls.  April tilts 
           her head and opens her mouth as if to kiss Carolyn.  But 
           Carolyn actually goes in for the kiss.  

           And they start to kiss.

           They laugh at first, but for Carolyn, it’s real.  April 
           pulls away.  She BURSTS out laughing.  Carolyn sits back, 
           dejected.

                                 APRIL
                                (fake laugh)
                        Wait, was that...?  You know we 
                        were just kidding, right?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Yeah.  No.  It was funny.

           It’s uncomfortable.  Carolyn gets up and leaves.

                                 APRIL
                                (to herself)
                        Fuck. 

           INT. TRIPP HOUSE - MORNING

           Sun rise.  Snow FLIES through the air. 

           Henry walks into frame, clearing the white driveway with 
           his snowblower. 

           He stops, looks around the neighborhood.  The quiet is 
           deafening.  Being alone on New Years feels empty.  

           And then...

           April’s car in the distance.  Henry waves as she pulls 
           into the driveway.  Carolyn gets out and hurries to the 
           house without acknowledging Henry.  

                                 HENRY
                        Happy New Years, sweetie!

           Carolyn speaks without looking or breaking stride. 
                                 CAROLYN
                        Is it?

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, it’s a new year!  That means 
                        I’m not going to be mad you came 
                        home past your curfew. 

           Carolyn doesn’t respond.  Henry quickly makes a snowball 
           and lovingly tosses it at her.  His aim is off and it 
           hits her square in the face.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Ow!  What the fuck, dude?!

                                 HENRY
                        Oh my gosh, I’m sorry, honey!  I 
                        didn’t mean to throw it at your...

           Carolyn goes inside and SLAMS the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Henry slowly opens the door to Carolyn’s room.  She’s 
           fast asleep.  He sees a can of Red Bull on her night 
           stand and grabs it. 

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Henry sits on his bed and reads Joyce’s goodbye letter.  

           He sips the Red Bull without thinking.  He actually likes 
           it.  He sips more. 

           EXT. THE VOLVO - LATER

           A line of slow moving cars.  Speeding up behind them is 
           Henry, moving faster than he ever has before.  He HONKS, 
           making them swerve out of his way. 

           INT. THE VOLVO - THAT MOMENT

           Henry gulps down another can of The Bull. 

                                 HENRY
                                (mock commercial)
                        Red Bull!  It’s like a teeny tiny 
                        cherry explosion in your mouth 
                        area!

           Henry finishes his Red Bull and cracks open another one. 
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Woooohoooooo!

           EXT. THE VOLVO 

           Henry’s swerves and speeds past a minivan full of kids.  
           The minivan HONKS. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Henry does donuts with the Volvo around the snow. 

           INT. THE VOLVO 

           Henry’s giddy.  Out of breath.  Alive. 

           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY - MORNING

           Henry enters and takes off his jacket.  

           Ron stands there, slurping down a Cup O’ Noodles.

                                 RON
                        Listen, Henry I need you to step 
                        in for me at the expo this year 
                        while I hold down the fort. 

                                 HENRY
                                (nervous)
                        Vegas again?  I’m not exactly 
                        ready...Flying isn’t...

           Ron drops a pamphlet on his desk that reads Travel Agent 
           Convention & Expo - Madison, Wisconsin.

                                 RON
                        No worries, buddy.  It’s up north.  
                        You can drive. 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh.  Good deal.  Is Debbie going?

                                (serious)
                        Henry...

           Henry reads the look on Ron’s face, sits back in his 
           chair.

                                 HENRY
                        Yes?
                                 RON
                        You should know that this may be 
                        our last trip to the expo.  
                        Internet business is just kicking 
                        our ass.  

                                 HENRY
                                (in denial)
                        You can have the world wide web,

                        service.

                        I’m afraid that business model is 
                        a thing of the past. 

                                 HENRY
                        So what’s the plan?

                                 RON
                        Cut backs.  We may even have to 
                        let one or two people go.  Most 
                        likely four.  No more than seven.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s...almost everybody.

           Ron goes back to his office, slurping the last noodle in 
           his cup.

           Debbie enters from the break room. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        You heard about the blood bath?

                                 HENRY
                        Ron just told me.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I don’t know what I’m going to do.  
                        Larry was laid off last Spring and 
                        my kids aren’t old enough to work. 

                                 HENRY
                        You’ll be fine.  
                                (covering)
                        I think it’ll be mostly support 
                        staff.

           Henry logs onto his computer, avoiding the conversation.
           INT. THE VOLVO - DAY

           Henry drives with Lilly in the passenger seat.  

                                 LILLY
                        Thanks for inviting me.

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t have a fear of 
                        convention centers with lots of 
                        people do you?

                                 LILLY
                        Strangely, I’m okay with that. 

                                 HENRY
                        That makes one of us.  

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER - LATER

           A group of DANCERS dressed in traditional African garb 
           stage an elaborately choreographed dance.  Behind them a 
           huge display reads “Kenya Airways.”

           Lilly walks past carrying two Starbucks coffees.  She 
           passes well designed booths from every possible company 
           connected to the travel industry.  Airlines, air travel 
           web sites, insurance companies, etc. 

           Henry’s booth is the smallest in a far corner.  He sits 
           on a chair, holding flyers, in front of a dated plastic 
           sign that reads “AAAA Travel - We travel anywhere!”

           Lilly approaches, hands him a coffee.

                                 LILLY
                        Any customers yet?

                                 HENRY
                        Only thing anyone’s interested in 
                        is all that internet gunk.  Lots 
                        of new booths this year that I’ve 
                        never heard of.  Like that one 
                        over there.  I can’t even 
                        pronounce it. 

           They both sip their coffees and look across the room.

                                 LILLY
                        “Snicker doodle dot com. The

                                 HENRY
                        What does that even mean?  

           Two WOMEN approach Henry.  Henry stands and gives them a 
           hearty welcome.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                                (handing them flyers)
                        Hello, gals.  Can I interest you

                                 HENRY
                                (forced cheer)
                        Bathrooms are right out that exit 
                        door. 

           Henry watches them go and sees them throw the flyers into 
           a garbage can. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Another satisfied customer.

           Lilly feels bad. 

           INT. RUBY TUESDAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Henry and Lilly sit in a booth, drink strawberry 
           daiquiris and enjoy each other’s company. 

                                 HENRY
                        She decided she needed to figure a 
                        few things out.  Mid-life crisis 
                        stuff.  But once I get on a plane 
                        I’m pretty certain everything’s 
                        going to be fine. 

                                 LILLY
                        Have you discussed that with her?

                                 HENRY
                        Not yet.  
                                (off Lilly’s look)
                        I know she’s thinking the same 
                        thing.  
                                (back pedaling)
                        I’m giving her some space to 
                        figure it out. 

           Henry downs his drink.  Lilly sips, not sure if even 
           Henry believes what he’s saying.   
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m ready for another one.  Not 
                        driving tonight.  Woo! 

                                 LILLY
                        I could do another one. 

                                 HENRY
                                (looking around)
                        Where’s our waitress?  I’ll be 
                        back.

           Henry gets up, tipsy, and walks through the restaurant, 
           looking for their waitress.  He spots her on the opposite 
           end of the restaurant taking another woman’s order.  

           It’s Joyce.  

           She’s wearing a fur ski vest and matching ski boots.  The 
           waitress blocks Henry’s view of Joyce’s companion and 
           after a moment, the waitress leaves.  

           But Joyce is alone. 

           Henry ducks behind an ATM machine and watches her.  His 
           curiosity morphs into nostalgia.  He misses her. 

           He looks back at Lilly.  Paranoia sets in.  He doesn’t 
           want Joyce to see him. 

           Keeping his head low, Henry hurries back to his booth.

                                 LILLY
                                (confused)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 HENRY
                        Nothing!  I’m having a great time. 

                                 LILLY
                        Did you find our waitress?

                                 HENRY
                        She quit.  Um, tell you what...

           Henry throws down a couple bills onto the table.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I am seriously pooped.  And I 
                        thought we’d head back tonight.

           Lilly recognizes something is up.

                                 LILLY
                        Tonight?  What’s going on?
                                 HENRY
                                (uneasy)
                        Ahahaha.  That’s funny.  You’re 
                        funny.

           Henry puts Lilly’s jacket on her and shuffles her out. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Ethan returns to Joyce’s booth.  Joyce spots Henry 
           walking Lilly out.  She quickly slouches down in her 
           seat.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you doing?

           Joyce covers her face with the salt and pepper shakers 
           and slides down in the booth until they leave.

           She sits back up as if nothing happened. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Shall we have a night cap?

           Ethan eyes her strangely. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Anyway, I have never seen so many 
                        unattractive people in my life...

           As Ethan speaks, Joyce watches Lilly get into the Volvo, 
           unnerved.  Then she sees Henry.  And smiles to herself.

           INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY - LATER

           Vaulted ceiling.  A glass elevator rises to the top.  

           Henry lounges in a chair with his head back, looking up 
           at the elevator, lost in thought.  His AAAA Travel sign 
           and luggage are by his side.

           Lilly arrives, wheeling in her suitcase. 

                                 LILLY
                        All set?

           Henry doesn’t move.  

                                 LILLY (CONT’D)
                        Henry?...Are you alright?

           Henry slowly snaps out of it and stares at Lilly.
           INT. THE VOLVO - LATER

           Henry pulls up to Lilly’s apartment complex.  

                                 HENRY
                        See you in class?

           Henry flashes a non-committal salesman smile.  Lilly 
           searches his face, wanting more.  But he’s not giving it. 

                                 LILLY
                        See you in class, Henry. 

           Disappointed, Lilly pats him on the shoulder and slips 
           out.  Lilly looks back but Henry quickly drives away. 

           EXT./INT. THE VOLVO - NIGHT 

           Henry drives along the expressway, heading home.  
           Frustrated, Henry hits the steering wheel with his fist, 
           CURSING himself.  

           Henry flips on the radio, trying to find something to 
           calm his nerves.  He lands on George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody 
           in Blue,” AKA the United Airlines song.  

           Suddenly, he looks up and sees a sign: “O’HARE AIRPORT - 
           1/2 MILE.” Henry looks at the radio, and back to the 
           sign.  

           Henry turns up the radio volume and, with all his 
           strength, exits toward the airport.  He starts to sweat 
           but holds the wheel firmly, pushing through. 

           Suddenly, he sees a plane coming directly towards him, 
           growing larger and larger.  He panics, sweats harder and 
           can barely breathe, HYPERVENTIALTING.  WHEEZING.  

           The plane looks as if it’s about to hit his car when it 
           suddenly WHOOSHES directly over him. 

           He loses control of the Volvo, swerves in and out of his 
           lane and CRASHES into car next to him.  

                                                      FADE TO BLACK. 

           FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry lays in bed with his wrist in a brace.  He plays 
           Sudoku and eats Jello. 
           A NURSE leads Carolyn in. 

                                 NURSE
                        Is this yours?

                                 HENRY
                        Hi, sweetie.

           Nurse exits.  Henry offers some Jello to Carolyn.

                                 CAROLYN
                        No blood?  No broken bones? 

                                 HENRY
                        Some minor sprains and bruises.  
                        I’m fine.  The Volvo on the other 
                        hand...

                                 CAROLYN
                        What the hell were you thinking?

                                 HENRY
                        I was thinking I wanted to fly.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Just like that, you thought you 
                        could get on a plane?

                                 HENRY
                        If that’s what it takes to get Mom 
                        back.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (frustrated)
                        We’re not getting Mom back.  Stop 
                        being delusional.  She put you in 
                        a hospital bed.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, maybe this would not have 
                        happened if we had been more of a 
                        family. 

           Carolyn is floored.

                                 CAROLYN
                        So now you’re blaming me?!

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just saying we could’ve all 
                        made a little more effort. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Ugh.  I cannot believe what a wuss 
                        you are!
           Carolyn throws up her hands and leaves. 

                                 HENRY
                        Carolyn. 

           Henry struggles to get up and hurts his wrist.  He lies 
           there, defeated and alone. 

           INT. LOVE’S YOGURT - NIGHT

           Joyce and Ethan sit in a corner booth.  Ethan wolfs down 
           a large yogurt.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Can I finish?

                                 JOYCE
                        Just hurry.  You could not have 
                        picked a more obvious place.  The 
                        whole world comes here. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Why are you so paranoid all of a 
                        sudden?  No one’s going to see us.

                                 SOON-YI (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Tripp?

           Soon-Yi and her parents stand in front of them, holding 
           yogurts.  

           Joyce is caught.  She puts on a happy face.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Soon-Yi!  Nice to see you.  

           Ethan continues to eat, uncaring. 

                                 SOON-YI
                        This is my Mom?  And this is my 
                        Dad?

                                 JOYCE
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Ling.  I’ve heard so much about 
                        you. 

           The Lings smile and nod hello.  

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I am a huge fan of your daughter.  
                        She’s my hardest worker.  
                        Actually, she’s my only worker. 
           Soon-Yi and Ethan share a look. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        You know Ethan, Soon-Yi.

           Ethan throws Soon-Yi a flirtatious nod and smile.  She 
           melts. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Well, this has been a real treat.  
                        Nice to see you, Soon-Yi.  And 
                        nice meeting you, Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Ling. 

                                 SOON-YI
                        See you Thursday Mrs. Tripp? 

           The Lings head for the door.  Soon-Yi looks back at 
           Joyce.  She’s onto her.  And exits.

                                 JOYCE
                        Thank you very much.  How the hell 
                        am I going to explain that?

           Ethan scoops the rest of his yogurt, making an irritating 
           scraping noise against the cup.

                                 ETHAN
                        Why hide our love?

           Joyce looks at him in disbelief. 

                                 JOYCE
                        What did you say?

           Ethan finished his yogurt and slides it across the table.  

                                 ETHAN
                        Remember when you asked me if I 
                        was in love with your daughter?  
                        And I said I wasn’t sure what love 
                        even was?  Well, now I’m sure.  

           A look of worried confusion on Joyce’s face.  Realization 
           washes over her:  He’s just a kid. 

           He grabs her hands. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I am one hundred percent, 
                        completely and totally in love 
                        with you, Joyce Tripp.  

           Joyce is frozen.  This is not happening. 
           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joyce soaks in a bubble bath, drinking wine and holding  
           a photo. 

           It’s the picture of her and Henry with Carolyn and the 
           snowman. 

           Joyce’s hardened shell cracks.  She smiles at the fond 
           memory.  Then finally--

           She starts to cry.  Uncontrollably.

           INT. MCCORMICK HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dawn leads Henry and the group inside the massive hangar.  
           Their faces go white as they look up and see--   

           A gigantic airplane.  Scary.  Larger than life.  From a 
           distance, the group is dwarfed by the huge jet.  

           They stop.  A few class members start their breathing 
           exercises, a couple look down.  

           Henry powers on, takes the lead of the group.  

           Dawn dabs a tear of joy, knowing her work has paid off. 
           Waleed trails behind.  And throws up.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dawn stands at the back of the plane as the group files 
           into their seats. 

                                 DAWN
                        Gang, just think of this as 
                        another vehicle like your car or 
                        the bus or a train.  

                                 ROSHANDA
                        I hate trains too.

                                 DAWN
                        Just a vessel to get you from 
                        point A to point B. 

           Henry sits in an aisle seat next to Roshanda.
                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, once you’re all seated, then 
                        Rachel, our flight attendant for 
                        today will take you through the 
                        procedure. 

           A male FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands in the front. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Welcome, passengers.  The captain 
                        has turned on the seat belts 
                        fastened sign.  So if you could 
                        all buckle up, I can begin. 

           We hear the group jostling and fastening.  

                                 ROSHANDA
                        Oh, Lord.

                                 BETH
                        What do we need those for?  

                                 WALEED
                        I thought we were just having 
                        dinner.

                                 BETH
                        Are we actually flying?

                                 DAWN
                        Don’t be alarmed.  We’re just 
                        going through the procedure.  

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        If you’ll all reach into the seat 
                        pockets in front of you and pull 
                        out the safety instruction card.

           Henry pulls out a laminated card.  Except it’s not a 
           safety card.  It’s a graduation certificate.  One by one, 
           everyone reads their cards.  Faces light up. 

                                 DAWN
                        Congratulations, everyone!  You 
                        are now official graduates of

           CHEERS.

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Of course, now it’s up to you to 
                        actually fly.  So go home tonight 
                        and book a flight with Henry!

                        everybody!

                                 ROSHANDA
                        Yeah, I’ll get right on that. 

           Congratulates all around.  Dawn passes out plastic 
           glasses of sparkling wine.

           Henry tries to get Lilly’s attention but she turns a 
           blind eye and chats with others.

           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY - MORNING

           Henry enters.  His face falls.  Debbie’s desk is cleared 
           out.  In fact, all the desks are totally empty.  Without 
           taking his off his jacket, he rushes into...

           RON’S OFFICE

           Ron is talking to Beverly who is in tears.  Henry enters 
           and Beverly quickly leaves.  

           Ron tears into a Filet O’Fish sandwich.

                                 HENRY
                        What’s going on?

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t want to sit.  Tell me 
                        what’s going on. 

                                 RON
                        Beverly’s been with me for almost 
                        thirty years.  But we just can’t 
                        keep her on any more.

                                 HENRY
                        And Debbie?

           Ron finishes his sandwich, opens another one and gravely 
           nods. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Am I...?

                                 RON
                        You’re safe, pal.  I need you to 
                        keep the day to day.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RON (CONT'D)
                        It’s quite possibly going to be 
                        just me and you for a while. 

           The front door DINGS.  Henry looks up and sees...

           Joyce.  

           She enters, looking around the empty room.  

           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY - BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry and Joyce sit at a small table as Joyce reads a new 
           letter.

                                 JOYCE
                                (reading)
                        Dearest Henry...In my two months 
                        away from you and Carolyn I have 
                        grown and matured and learned a 
                        thing or two.  I’ve learned that 
                        starting a new life, playing the 
                        dating field and having your own 
                        apartment in a weird part of town 
                        is not all that it’s cracked up to 
                        be.  I’ve also learned from 
                        Carolyn that you are taking a 
                        flying class, which shows you 
                        really care about me.  Therefore, 
                        I propose you give me a second 
                        chance to make things right and to 
                        come live with you and Carolyn 
                        again and remain the family that 
                        we once were.  Love always, Joyce 
                        slash the love of your life. 

           Joyce looks up at Henry, hopeful.  

           Henry stares back at Joyce with no expression.  

           After a moment, his eyes fill with tears.  

                                 HENRY
                        I knew you’d come back. 

           He stands and hugs her.  

           INT. NORTHBROOK COURT - MORNING 

           Henry speed walks faster than we’ve ever seen with a Red 
           Bull in hand, wearing his new track suit.  Bruce is by 
           his side.  Gail tries to keep up.

                                 GAIL
                        Can we slow down please?
                                 HENRY
                        It’s called speed walking for a 
                        reason.

                                 GAIL
                        It’s race walking.  And please 
                        stop racing. 

           They pass the speedy older couple.

                                 HENRY
                        Mornin’, good afternoon and good 
                        night!

                                 GAIL
                        Henry, we have to talk about 
                        Hawaii.  

                                 HENRY
                        Already booked. 

                                 GAIL
                        Shut up. 

                                 HENRY
                        Leaving on the 14th.  Returning on 
                        the 19th.  United Airlines.  Three 
                        round trip tickets.

                                 BRUCE
                        Nice job, man!

                                 GAIL
                        Wait--three tickets?

           Gail hurries to catch up with Henry.  Henry has the 
           biggest smile we’ve seen.  

           Gail and Bruce look at each other as Henry speeds ahead. 

                                 HENRY
                        Keep walking. 

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Joyce places her Danielle Steeles in a box.  Ethan is 
           frustrated, pacing around her. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Could you just stop and talk about 
                        this for one second?
                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t how many different ways I 
                        can say it!

                                 ETHAN
                        You can’t just make this decision 
                        unilaterally.  You’re clearly 
                        heavily in denial and obviously 
                        experiencing extreme counter-
                        transference. 

           Joyce stops and looks at him. 

                                 JOYCE
                        You know, sometimes I don’t even 
                        think you understand what the 
                        hell’s falling out of your mouth. 

                                 ETHAN
                        What, you’re just going to go back 
                        to your pointless little life with 
                        your retarded husband and lesbo 
                        daughter?!

                                 JOYCE
                        My daughter is not a lesbian.  And 
                        even if she were I would be one 
                        hundred percent accepting of that.  

                                 ETHAN
                        I thought you wanted adventure!  
                        You wanted to give your life some 
                        meaning!  

                                 JOYCE
                        I do want my life to have meaning.

                                 ETHAN
                        Then marry me and let’s move to 
                        North Korea. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Not that kind of meaning.

                                 ETHAN
                        Joyce.

                                 JOYCE
                        Too many people know about us now.  
                        And I don’t want it getting 
                        around.

                                 ETHAN
                        What, one little Chinese girl sees 
                        us and that’s it?
                                 JOYCE
                        Ethan.  Don’t be racist.  

           He’s beside himself.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Honey.  Go to college.  Join a 
                        fraternity.  Start a rock group.  
                        I guarantee you will completely 
                        forget about me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Marry me. 

                                 JOYCE
                                (yeah, right)
                        I’m not going to marry you, Ethan.  
                        I’m already married. 

                                 ETHAN
                        Me and you.  In North Korea.

                                 JOYCE
                        You have to leave now, Ethan.  
                        This is upsetting both of us. 

           Joyce starts to lead Ethan towards the door.

                                 ETHAN
                        You’re making a big mistake, 
                        Joyce.  Huge!

                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t think so. 

           Joyce opens the door, physically pushing Ethan out. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I’ve never loved anyone before 
                        you!  I love you, Joyce Tripp!  

                                 JOYCE
                        Just...go. 

           Joyce shuts the door on him. 

           EXT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT

           Ethan stands in the freezing cold, staring at the door.  
           No one treats him like this.  He leaves.
           INT. TRIPP HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Henry, Joyce and Carolyn sit at the dinner table.  Henry 
           has a huge smile on his face.  Joyce is relaxed with a 
           glass of wine.  Carolyn picks at her food, unsure of what 
           to make of this. 

                                 HENRY
                        Would you like more wine, honey?

           Joyce smiles and extends her glass. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Thank you. 

                                 HENRY
                        You guys excited for the big trip?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m ready to just get on that 
                        beach and do nothing. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Don’t either of you find this 
                        remotely creepy?

                                 JOYCE
                        Carolyn, I know you don’t approve 
                        of me leaving but I needed to go 
                        through some changes.  Now we’ve 
                        all been together for seventeen 
                        years minus two months and I don’t 
                        see why we can’t just pick up 
                        where we left off.

                                 CAROLYN
                        How do we know you’re not just 
                        going to pick up and leave again?

                                 HENRY
                        Your mother and I have made some 
                        decisions and we are going to 
                        stick it out.  

           A cell phone RINGS. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Not mine.

           Joyce gets up and goes to the kitchen.  She picks up her 
           phone and reads:  E.
           EXT. TRIPP PATIO - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce steps outside, making sure Henry and Carolyn are 
           not watching. 

                                 JOYCE
                                (into phone)
                        Why are you calling me?  

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Joyce, it’s Ethan. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I know.  I can’t talk now.

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Joyce, just listen to me.  

                                 JOYCE
                        Fine.  Go.

           Silence.

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Do you miss me?

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, for god sakes, is that why you 
                        called me?  Ethan, go back to your 
                        own life. 

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        I want us to be together.  Like 
                        before. 

                                 JOYCE
                        We were only together for a couple 
                        months.  Jesus, we only slept 
                        together maybe fifteen times.  And 
                        it was just sex, Ethan.  Not love.  
                        When you get older you realize 
                        there’s a difference. 

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)    
                        Have you ever been with anyone 
                        else?

                                 JOYCE  
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Kids.  Like me?  Anyone else my 
                        age?
                                 JOYCE 
                        You are sick, you know that?  Of 
                        course not.  You were the only 
                        one.  Sure, I’ve had Justin 
                        Timberlake fantasies like anyone--
                        wait--are you trying to 
                        psychoanalyze me again?  That crap 
                        will not work on me.  I have to 
                        go.  We’re leaving tomorrow 
                        morning for Hawaii and I don’t 
                        want you calling me anymore. 
                        Goodbye, Ethan. 

           INT. TRIPP HOUSE 

           Joyce beeps off her phone and enters, shivering from the 
           cold.  She takes a deep breath.  Regains her composure 
           and enters the dining room. 

                                 JOYCE
                        It is cold out there tonight.  
                        Just think we’ll be on a beach in 
                        less than twenty four hours!

                                 CAROLYN
                        Who was that?

                                 JOYCE
                        Who was who?

                                 CAROLYN
                        On the phone.  Just now. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, work stuff.  Paper supply 
                        company screwing me over again.

           Joyce looks at Henry and Carolyn, happy to be back. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  To both of you.

           They smile back.

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Henry and Joyce have their bags opened on their bed, 
           packing in unison.  They look up at each other and smile.  
           This could actually work. 
           INT. CAROLYN’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Carolyn places two of her joints into a sock and buries 
           it among her clothes. 

           She sits at her desk and resumes drawing. 

           EXT./INT. THE VOLVO - MORNING

           The damaged Volvo speeds along the highway.  Henry is 
           behind the wheel, drinking Red Bull.  Joyce hangs on 
           tight.  Carolyn puts her seat belt on in the backseat.

                                 JOYCE
                        I am liking the new you. 

                                 HENRY
                        See what you’ve been missing?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Take it easy on the Bull.  We 
                        don’t want you having a heart 
                        attack before you get on the 
                        plane. 

                                 HENRY
                        You see that?  You said ‘plane’ 
                        and ‘heart attack’ in the same 
                        sentence and nothing happened.  
                        Totally fine!

                                 CAROLYN
                        You know cops can track your 
                        speeding now without you even 
                        knowing.  Cameras are everywhere. 

                                 HENRY
                        I think the cops will agree I’m 
                        making up for loss time. 

           EXT. O’HARE AIRPORT - DAY

           Joyce and Carolyn roll their suitcases through the 
           sliding doors.  They look back.  Henry stands outside, 
           frozen.  Joyce grabs his hand and pulls him inside. 

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL

           Chaos.  PEOPLE everywhere.  
           Henry, Joyce and Carolyn descend a long escalator into 
           the United Airlines Terminal.  Henry looks straight ahead 
           into the vast space before him, concentrating on his 
           breathing.  No hyperventilating.  No wheezing. 

                                 HENRY
                        O’Hare airport.  Second busiest 
                        airport in the world after 
                        Atlanta.  972,246 aircraft 
                        operations with an average of 
                        2,663 per day.

                                 JOYCE
                        And you haven’t been on a single 
                        one of those ever. 

           The faint sounds of George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” 
           can be heard.  

                                 HENRY
                        It’s The Song.

           They reach the bottom of the escalator, bathed in a sea 
           of colored neon light.  Henry is in awe. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        The famous Terminal One.  Built by 
                        Helmut Jahn in 1987.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Are you going to do this the whole 
                        time?

           Henry, Joyce and Carolyn step onto the moving walkway.  
           Henry spins around and looks in every direction like a 
           little kid.  Carolyn and Joyce are amused.

           Under the Gershwin, we hear a electronic female voice. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Keep walking...keep walking...keep 
                        walking...

           Henry laughs to himself.

           Joyce looks at her boarding pass.  She grabs Henry’s 
           wrist and checks his watch. 

                                 JOYCE
                        We’re supposed to board in five 
                        minutes!

           They all look at each other and take off down the 
           walkway.
           Henry runs after them but takes a moment to look back at 
           the magical colored walkway behind them. 

           INT. O’HARE - MAIN GATE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry, Joyce and Carolyn arrive at their empty gate, out 
           of breath and sweating.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (to attendant)
                        Flight 832!

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                                (attitude)
                        You have about one minute to 
                        spare. 

           Joyce hands over boarding passes.  Flight Attendant 
           processes them. 

           Gail, Bruce, Hannah and Adam appear.  All wearing 
           Hawaiian shirts.

                                 BRUCE
                        You made it!

                                 GAIL
                        We thought maybe you had a panic 
                        attack and died.  We didn’t want 
                        to get on without you. 

           Everyone turns to see a commotion as people part ways for 
           a team of POLICE OFFICERS and AIRPORT SECURITY.  They’re 
           clearly on a mission and headed straight for...

           The Tripp family. 

           Carolyn starts to sweat.  

                                 CAROLYN
                                (caught)
                        Balls. 

           She and Hannah share a knowing look.  

                                 HANNAH
                        You didn’t...?

           Everyone looks at Carolyn.

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s just a couple joints.  I’ll 
                        say I have glaucoma.
                                 GAIL
                        What?!

                                 JOYCE
                        You brought marijuana through 
                        airport security?  She’s doing 
                        marijuana now, Henry!?

           Henry is just as nervous. 

                                 HENRY
                        They’re not coming after her.  
                        They saw me speeding.  
                                (defiant)
                        And if I have to get my first ever 
                        speeding ticket, then so be it.

           But the police pass right by Henry and Carolyn.  Their 
           relief turns to confusion as they...

           Handcuff Joyce. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Ow!  You’re hurting me!  What the 
                        hell?!

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Ma’am, please cooperate and 
                        everything will be just fine.  

           Everyone watches, in shock.

                                 JOYCE
                        Excuse me, but you are not allowed 
                        to treat people this way. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER #2
                        Please, ma’am.  We do not want to 
                        have to tase you. 

                                 HENRY
                        Tase her?  Sir, can you tell us 
                        what’s going on?

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Are you related to this woman?

                                 HENRY
                        She’s my wife.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        We’re placing your wife under 
                        arrest.  Ma’am, you have the right 
                        to remain silent.

                        used against you in a court of 
                        law... 

                                 HENRY
                        Why?!

                                 JOYCE
                        What is this for?

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1

           Joyce, Henry and Carolyn are confused.  

           FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. ETHAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ethan is on the phone.  A tape recording device sits next 
           to him.  

                                 ETHAN 
                                (into phone)
                        I want us to be together.  Like 
                        before. 

                                 JOYCE (O.S.)
                        We were only together for a couple 
                        months.  Jesus, we only slept 
                        together maybe fifteen times.  And 
                        it was just sex, Ethan.  Not love.  
                        When you get older you realize 
                        there’s a difference. 

           Ethan looks back at his PARENTS who listen to the call in 
           shock and disgust.  Next to them are two DETECTIVES who 
           nod approvingly.  

           END FLASHBACK.

                                 HENRY
                                (to Joyce)
                        Is that true?  I mean, I know that 
                        can’t be true.  But...is it?
                                 JOYCE
                                (through gritted 
                                 teeth)
                        Henry, do something!

                                 CAROLYN
                        Sex?  With a minor?

                                 HENRY
                                (in disbelief)
                        Who the hell were you sleeping 
                        with?!

                                 JOYCE
                        No one.  It didn’t mean anything!  
                        Ethan’s eighteen anyway!

           A house lands on Carolyn.

                                 CAROLYN
                                (serious)
                        What?

                                 GAIL
                        What is she talking about?  Henry, 
                        what is she saying?

                                 CAROLYN
                        You had sex with Ethan?  My ex-
                        boyfriend?  Who I lost my 
                        virginity to?

                                 GAIL
                        Oh my god. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER #2
                        Jesus, lady. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Sweetie, he didn’t love you.  And 
                        I certainly didn’t love him. 

                                 HENRY
                        Joyce, is this true?

                                 GAIL
                        She’s a criminal, Henry.  Period.  
                        Now we’re getting on that plane.  
                        I suggest you do the same. 

           Gail boards the plane.  

                                 BRUCE
                                (to Henry)
                        I’m...sorry, buddy.
           Bruce, Hannah and Adam reluctantly follow Gail’s lead.

                                 JOYCE
                        I didn’t want to hurt you, 
                        Carolyn. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        You know what?  You are seriously 
                        lucky I like chicks.  By the way, 
                        I like chicks.

           Joyce takes a moment to process this.

                                 JOYCE
                                (forced)
                        And I’m...one hundred percent 
                        accepting of that! 

           Carolyn walks away, boarding the plane. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Carolyn!

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir, final boarding.  We’re going 
                        to have to close the gate.  Are 
                        you boarding the plane or not?

                                 JOYCE
                        Henry!  Help me!  It was just a 
                        fling.  I got it out of my system.  
                        Don’t let them take me!

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Okay, guy.  We gotta bring her to 
                        the station.  

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir...?

                                 HENRY
                                (perplexed)
                        Joyce, I’m not sure how this 
                        happened.  But--

                                 JOYCE
                                (pleading)
                        I saw you.  With that woman, 
                        Henry.  In Alpine Valley.  You 
                        cheated on me too!  It’s okay.

           Henry turns cold.
                                 HENRY
                                (disgusted)
                        I didn’t cheat on you.  

           He finally comes to his senses.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        In fact, I would never cheat on 
                        you.  That’s the difference 
                        between you and me, Joyce.  
                                (confident)
                        And guess what?  I’m not missing 
                        this plane if your life depended 
                        on it. 

           Henry turns and starts to board.

                                 JOYCE
                        Wait!  

           Henry disappears onto the plane. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry and Carolyn sit silently.  Shell-shocked.  They 
           barely notice the plane taking off. 

                                 HENRY
                                (to Carolyn)
                        So.  How long have you known that 
                        you like girls?

           They turn to each other and smile.  After everything that 
           just happened, somehow they’re both calm.  And connected.  
           Henry reaches over and grabs Carolyn’s hand. 

           The plane ascends as fluffy clouds drift past at an 
           accelerated rate.  

           They pass through the clouds and burst into a 
           dramatically blue sky.  

           For a moment, Henry tries to enjoy it.  

           FADE TO WHITE.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, as we begin 
                        our descent, I would like to take 
                        this time to say we were all 
                        pretty fuckin’ freaked out. 
           EXT. MAUI BEACH - DAY

           Clear blue skies.  Ocean waves. 

           Henry sits under an umbrella, generously applying sun 
           screen all over his face and legs.  Carolyn holds her 
           note pad and draws under a large floppy hat.  Hannah 
           listens to her iPod while Gail and Bruce play cards. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        You know what’s really barfy?  Now 
                        every time I hear that George 
                        Gerswhin United Airlines song, I 
                        can’t help but think of my mother 
                        boning my ex-boyfriend.

                                 BRUCE
                        Who’s going in?

           Bruce, Gail and Hannah stand and head to the water.  
           Carolyn follows.  

           Henry stays behind and watches them have fun. 

           Henry looks as if he’s finally stepped into one of his 
           travel agent posters.  He takes a deep breath and 
           exhales.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Carolyn walks through the hallway carrying her books.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        I knew it was only a matter of 
                        time that the truth would get out 
                        when we got back.  

           She passes Soon-Yi who avoids eye contact. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Luckily, I only had to endure the 
                        evil hell they call high school 
                        for just a couple more months. 

           Carolyn sees April standing at her locker.  She stops to 
           chat but clearly the friendship isn’t the same. 

           INT. JOYCE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A Lean Cuisine spins around and around.  Joyce stares 
           blankly at it.
                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        My mother, which is putting it 
                        nicely, moved back into her 
                        apartment in that weird part of 
                        town. 

           Joyce unwraps her freshly nuked meal and sits in front of 
           her laptop.  She takes a bite and flinches as she burns 
           her tongue.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        After the trial, she was sentenced 
                        to one year of house arrest and 
                        another year of community service.

           Frustrated, Joyce slides her dinner away from her, falls 
           back into the couch and puts her feet on the coffee 
           table.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        She so desperately wanted to fly 
                        the coop.  Now she’s no longer 
                        allowed to freely move about the 
                        cabin. 

           Her right ankle is now shackled to a cumbersome, highly 
           unattractive electronic ankle bracelet. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t feel bad for her.  That May-
                        December romance she wanted?  
                        Well, she finally got it.

           She opens her laptop and smiles as she opens a new 
           message on e-cupid.com

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Just not the way she expected.

           In the message window is a smiling, silver-haired, much 
           older GENTLEMAN. 

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Henry digs into his side table drawer and takes out 
           Joyce’s goodbye letter.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        They say if you love someone, set 
                        them free.  If they come back, 
                        they’re yours.

           He folds the letter in half, over and over, until it 
           forms a paper airplane. 
           And lets it fly.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Whoever said that should be 
                        stabbed.  

           EXT. THE NEW VOLVO - DAY

           Henry steps out of his brand new Volvo and heads into--

           INT. AAAA TRAVEL AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           He enters the empty office. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        My dad’s boss Ron was in the 
                        middle of all you can eat seafood 
                        buffet when he had a massive heart 
                        attack.  So he retired and left 
                        the business to his best employee.

           He passes his old desk and enters the boss’s office.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He got Debbie her job back and for 
                        the first time in seven years, he 
                        wasn’t the Travel Agent of The 
                        Year. 

           Henry hands Debbie a framed certificate.  She jumps up 
           and down like a contestant on “The Price Is Right.”

           INT. BARNES AND NOBLE BOOK STORE - DAY

           Henry stands at the check-out counter buying several new 
           Sudoku books.  He hands the cashier the gift card he 
           received from work.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        He even started to date. 

           As Henry heads for the exit he sees...

           Lilly.  Browsing the fiction section.  Henry smiles to 
           himself then taps Lilly on the shoulder.  She’s excited 
           to see him.  They hug. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        She’s legal age so it’s cool.
           INT. HENRY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A stack of Liam Neeson DVDs sit on the table.  Taken.  
           Kinsey.  Batman Begins. 

           Henry and Lilly sit on the sofa watching a movie.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        And now he’s even helping others 
                        overcome their own fears.  

           Lian Neeson comes on screen.  Henry holds Lilly’s hand as 
           she fights her way through her phobia.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        They’re so adorable I could puke. 

           EXT. FORREST - DUSK

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        Thank God I never saw Fuck Face 
                        again.  

           Ethan, now bearded and dirty, walks with a large backpack 
           along the base of a mountain. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I heard he skipped college and 
                        went to live in the woods like the 
                        kid in that Sean Penn movie. 

           He passes a sign that reads:  North Dakota State Park 
           Camping Grounds.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Not exactly North Korea. 

           EXT. ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO - DAY

           Carolyn, now urban chic and looking slightly happier, 
           walks the streets of Chicago. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        I totally got into Smith you guys, 
                        but I decided it wasn’t nearly as 
                        cool as The Art Institute of 
                        Chicago where I’m now a proud 
                        freshman.  
           INT. ART CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

           Carolyn draws at a drawing table.  Images of Henry, Joyce 
           and Carolyn, with narration and dialogue bubbles.  It’s 
           an impressive graphic novel telling the family’s story. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        It’s got everything Smith has to 
                        offer...

           She spots a CUTE GIRL with purple hair staring at her 
           from across the room.  Cute girl flashes a flirtatious 
           smile. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...yep, everything.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Fortune cookies are placed on the table.  Henry and Lilly 
           take one.  Carolyn and Cute Girl sit across from them and 
           each take one.  

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.)
                        And as we approach our final 
                        destination, forecast calls for 
                        clear blue skies.  With a ten 
                        percent chance of rain.  Just to 
                        keep things interesting.  

           They read their fortunes to each other, laughing 
           together.  Like a family. 

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We realize you have a choice in 
                        seriously fucked-up family stories 
                        and we’d like to thank you for 
                        choosing ours.  You can turn your 
                        cell phones back on now, bitches. 

           HARD CUT TO BLACK.

                                 CAROLYN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Buh-bye.
