                        ...The date is August 10th, 1973. 
                        We are conducting a debriefing...with
                        Commander Christopher Korver of the
                        Ceres 3 Lunar Module-- regarding his
                        mission to the lunar surface....... 
                        Now.  Going back, before the launch;
                        You were... you were killed in January
                        of '72? 

                                 KORVER
                        That's correct.

                        You died in a-- in a plane crash.  
                        Testing Air Force jet R-X34.  

                                 KORVER
                        Correct-- that was the cover--

                        Kimberly.

                                 KORVER
                        Correct.

                        Do they know you're still alive?

                        Before you launched, did you contact 
                        friends or family in any way?

                                 KORVER
                        No.
                                 [NAME REDACTED]
                        You understand that you cannot go 
                        back to your former life?

                                 KORVER
                        ...I do.

                        launch...I wondered-- what those
                        last few moments-- those last few
                        seconds were like for the astronauts

           --now I know.   We were 42 seconds into our launch and our 
           rocket was gonna explode--  

           Everything was shaking.  Brutally.  Violently.

           Rich was strapped to my right--  Cale to my left--  Alarms 
           were ringing all over the module.  It was shaking so bad I 
           could barely read my monitor--

                        I knew when that fuel hit the launch 
                        exhaust, we would explode.

           through us it was shaking so much.

                        out--

                        Booster separation was everything--  
                        It could get rid of the problem-- or 
                        it could ignite an explosion--

           FIRE FLARED OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS-- 

           EVERYTHING TURNED ORANGE--

           THE SHAKING WAS PAINFUL-- 

           BIT MY LIP-- BLOOD SPLASHED MY HELMET GLASS--

           One final jolt, and then everything got real quiet...

           Our heads snapped back into the chairs as the acceleration 
           kicked back in.  Out the window blue sky was changing over 
           to black.

                        in a rocket that wasn't supposed to
                        exist.  On a mission to the Moon no
                        one was supposed to know about.  So
                        secret, we had to fake our deaths.

                        indescribable.  

           The ship rolled, angling the window so I could see Earth.  God 
           it was beautiful.  We were so high up the clouds were far away.

           Then it happened.

           WEIGHTLESSNESS.

           This was only my second time.  My eyes filled with wonder,

           counterclockwise.

                        The Apollo astronauts found anomalies

                        We knew the equipment, the technology,

           We were out of our suits now, in our jumpers.  Floating, 
           facing random directions.  No telling what's up, what's down 
           in space.

           Brennin and Cale were eating dinner.  Occasionally I'd see a 
           flake of mash potato or a sphere of water drift into my sight 
           line.  

           Miles Davis, Surrey With the Fringe On Top played in the 
           background.  My choice.

           I was at the aft window.  Quietly.  Staring at the Earth.  
           It was small now.  About the size of my fist.  The blackness 
           surrounding it was overwhelming.

                        had.  A fragile home.

           I looked down; in my hand was a pen and yellow pad of paper.  
           I was one word into a letter.

                        It was to my wife.  I knew she'd 
                        never get it.  Could never get it. 
                        But I needed this, as a-- as a kinda 
                        therapy.  

           My pen hovered over that one word.

                        "Erika,"  

           I blinked--

           Saw her in my memory:  

           Her smooth skin.  Bright eyes.  Genuine smile.  Musical laugh.

           Ocean spray drizzled over her, we were at the beach----
           I blinked again-- 

           Came back to reality.  After a moment I wrote:

                                 CALE
                        Got a problem with radar.

           I looked back, the guys were no longer eating.  They were 
           huddled over the radar monitor.

           I floated in over their shoulders.

                                 KORVER
                        What kinda problem.

                                 CALE
                        It's giving a false contact.

           The contact light was on, but the screen was blank.  Only 
           the radar arm could be seen, sweeping around.

                                 KORVER
                        Reboot the console.

                                 CALE
                        Did.  Twice.

                        Disconnect and reconnect the contact 
                        light.

           Cale moved to do so-- but before he did--

           BEEP.

           SOMETHING GLITCHED ON RADAR-- too fast for me to see.  But 
           Cale saw it.  Now his face didn't look right.

           Something popped on and off the monitor.  Just a split second--  
           but I saw it: It was too big to fit on screen.  It EXTENDED 
           BEYOND THE RADAR.  

           I glanced at Korver and Brennin.

                                 CALE (V.O.)
                        They knew very little about what was 
                        going to transpire on this journey.  
                        This would be their first taste.

           BEEP

           It happened again.  But this time the contact stayed.

                                 BRENNIN
                        What is it...?

           Solid green filled the entire bottom half of the screen.  It 
           went off the ends.  It was many times larger than our module.

           I floated over to the port window-- looked out.  Saw ink 
           black.  Brennin moved next to me.

                                 BRENNIN
                        No visual.

                        But where're the stars?

           I craned my head further to the right.  Then left.  Nothing.  
           Blackness.

                                 CALE
                        It's that big.

                                 KORVER
                        What...?

                                 CALE
                        That's how big it is.  It's blocking 
                        the stars out.

           My eyes had to have been huge.  

           I pushed off toward the aft window.  Looked out.  Saw the 
           Earth.  But not all of it.  
           A corner of it was missing.  And then that corner grew, and 
           the EARTH WAS DISAPPEARING RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES.  It was as 
           if someone were dropping a black curtain over it.  

                                 BRENNIN
                        It's-- the sun is-- is that an eclipse--

                                 CALE
                        Not that fast-- something is 
                        obstructing our view.

                        This thing can't be that big.

                                 BRENNIN
                        Is it-- surrounding us-- ?

           THEN THE EARTH WAS GONE.

           No one said a word at this point.  I mean, what is there to 
           say?

           THE ENTIRE MODULE RATTLED.  

           Food, instruments, items not velcroed down FLEW INTO ME AND 
           THE WALL AROUND ME-- it was the side closest to the anomaly.

           The guys held onto support bars, but their legs stretched

           --it all returned to normal.  Everything began floating again.

           My face was pressed against the fore window.  Breath was 
           starting to fog it.  

           I was waiting for something big.  But at that moment I could 
           only see stars.  Korver pushed his way beside me.  Cale hung 
           back.

           Beep-- Beep.  I looked down at my stop watch.  It had counted 
           to zero.

                                 BRENNIN
                        Should be now.

           We couldn't see anything happening.

                                 KORVER
                        Timing's off.

           Still only stars out there.

           Then a total EXPLOSION of LIGHT made me flinch as a vertical 
           sliver of silver that stretched for miles dominated our view.

           THIS WAS THE MOON.  

           And it was the first time our eyes looked at it.

                                 BRENNIN
                        That's...  it's... unbelievable...

           The moon crescent grew wider as our orbit curled around it.  
           We could see its damaged skin.  Billions of craters.  So many 
           it looked like an ancient war zone preserved indefinitely.

           I wiped fog off the glass and snapped a couple pictures.  I 
           turned to Cale.

                        Events were accelerating faster than 
                        anticipated.  We had already 
                        encountered our first irregularity.  

           I looked from Brennin to Korver.

           I pushed off-- floating through a hatch into the second part 
           of the vessel: 

           The Vulcan Lander. 

           It had two chairs and its own navigation system.  This was

           I nudged the stick to the side-- firing the thrusters ever 
           so slightly, slowing the spin.

           The turbulence cut out, we were flying smooth as glass-- but 
           still spinning--

           Sunlight flashed in.  Lander spun around again-- surface was

           I could hear panic in his voice.  I didn't care.

           I tilted the stick forward.  We dropped altitude.  Could feel 
           it; closer we got to the Moon the more we felt its gravity.

                                 KORVER
                        We're 400 feet out-- I need you to 
                        read off--

           I looked at the fuel gauge--  EMPTY.  I estimated no more than 
           30 secs of thrust left--

                        175.  145 feet-- 20 sec--

           Then I nudged the stick right, slowing the spin further-- 
           but burning more fuel.  Still we were spinning too fast--

           --and I was diving too fast-- I had to pull out-- I yanked 
           back and to the right--

           The rockets screamed.  Vulcan shook.  Groaned.  G-forces 
           sunk me in my chair.

           Through the bottom window I saw the surface spinning as Moon 
           sand blew away-- we were still coming in too fast.

           Over radio I heard the crash, metal snapping, screams.  Then 
           the com link went dark.  Got chills in my stomach.

           I floated over to radar.  Saw tiny dots, one of which could 
           be them.  But it was just impossible to tell for sure.

           I opened my eyes.  We were alive.  I let out a breath.

           A side panel had flown off, hit me in the forehead.  I was 
           bruised but ok.  I pushed it off of me.  Looked around.

           Lander was crooked.  At an angle.  

           The Lander shuddered.  

           Not good.  Maybe we were on a ledge.  Lights were out.

           I looked to my right at Cale.  He was already looking at me.  
           Trying to murder me with his eyes.  
                                 KORVER
                        ...we landed.

           Cale struggled with his seat belt, unfastened it.

           I did the same, moved out of my seat.  It was strange having 
           gravity back-- and only 1/6th of it.      

           I clicked the radio buttons.  It was dead.  All the buttons 
           were.

           Cale didn't respond.  I stepped over to a window and looked 
           out to see the surface of the Moon.

                        My eyes saw the impossible.  We were
                        on another planet.  On a celestial
                        body only 12 other human beings had
                        set foot on.  237,000 miles from

                        what he saw.  Contrarian words that 
                        illustrated the Moon to perfection.

           Craters.  Jagged rocks.  Impossibly tall mountains.  All of 
           it grey.  Yet somehow bright.  And confoundingly beneath a 
           sky that was unimaginably black.

           It looked like the gods of war had chosen the Moon as the 
           terminus for Armageddon.

           Lander creaked, shuddered-- seemed to slip down a bit-- my 
           head snapped over at Cale--

                                 CALE
                        We might be hanging over a crater--  
                        over the edge--

           I moved gingerly across the lander next to him.  Peered out 
           his window.  You could see the ground slope away into a 
           crater...

                        could be broken.
           I silently agreed.

                        We should move carefully-- till we

           We hit buttons, flipped switches, turned everything to off.  
           I moved carefully over to the main breaker, opened it.  Hit 
           reset.  Nothing happened.

           Lander trembled a bit as I grabbed a tool kit.  Pulled out a 
           screwdriver-- and began unscrewing the breaker panel.  

                                 CALE

           Took me a sec to figure out what he meant, I could feel the 
           tension in his voice.

                                 KORVER
                        I took over and landed the bird.

           I removed the breaker panel.  Found wires.  Started sifting 
           through, looking for the 'L'.  I glanced over at him.

                        together.

           I stared at him.  Soaked it in.  Then turned back to the 
           breaker.  I found the 'L' wire.  Its end had come out of the

           understatement.

           I dug further into the box.  Found two more wires unconnected.

           Cale hurriedly lowered the helmet onto my head.  Curved glass 
           temporarily distorted my vision of his helmeted face. 

                                 KORVER (V.O.)
                        We had 72 hours of oxygen, 
                        electricity, water--  And had ten
                        days worth of tests to do on the
                        anomaly.  We needed to do more than
                        rush.

           He fastened my helmet into place and the mechanical sounds 
           of the Lander hushed to a murmur.   

           I checked my pressure gauges.  He checked his.  Mine were

           I turned to the airlock.  Reached my hand out, pulled the 
           lever to depressurize.  Air whistled out of the Lander into 
           the vacuum.  I watched the PSI dial go down to zero.

           I opened the door.

           Silence rushed in.  The kind that makes you feel deaf.  No

           I stepped out into the

           I turned my back to it and worked my way down the ladder.  

           I looked down, my foot was one rung above the surface of the 
           moon.  

           I was tense.  With excitement.

           I hopped down.

           Landed on lunar soil.

                        worth it...  The problems, the sorrow
                        I had with my wife.  Not having kids. 
                        Living a secret life and leaving the
                        other behind.

           The Lander was on a slope, leading down into a shallow crater.

           We undid 8 latches.

           It would have been 1.5 tons on Earth, but here it was approx. 
           100 pounds.  

           We unfolded it revealing what it was:

           The Lunar Rover.

           It looked like the chasis of a car minus the body and doors.  

           We loaded it with what looked like an oversized vacuum cleaner--

           I nodded.  Turned the wheel.  Hit the pedal and propelled us 
           forward.

           This thing was faster than it looked and handled like a jeep.  
           We darted across the black and white desert, two aliens in a

                                 BRENNIN
                        What kind of something.

           ...no answer from me.  I looked up at Cale-- who was    
           already looking at me.  Odd.

           I reached over, hit a switch that muted Mission Control.

                        Control.

                                 BRENNIN
                        They've gotta know more than they're
                        telling us.

                                 CALE
                        They always do.

           We were quiet, thinking about how right he was.

                        We only got a couple hours-- let's

                        some of that rock-- hopefully we'll
                        get some answers.

                                 CALE
                        Yes sir.

           I grabbed my pen and yellow pad.  Climbed up into one of two
           hammocks and lied down.  Yawned.  

                                 BRENNIN
                        Alright--  Stay warm.  Ceres out.

                        Vulcan out.

           END INTERCUT

           Cale climbed into his hammock below me.

           I flipped through my pad until I got to the unfinished letter
           to my wife.  Smoothed out the page.

                                 KORVER (V.O.)
                            (I sighed)
                        "I know that...you're in a better
                        place now than you were with me. 
                        But that doesn't change...what we
                        had.  It doesn't make it any less
                        special.

           I continued writing--

           I trailed off...I was dosing...

           I SAW HER FACE.

           Smiling at me.  She was so beautiful she was glowing.  

           My hand caressed her cheek.  

           She leaned towards me.  Kissed me.

                                 ERIKA
                        Baby...

           Even though I was living my dream on the Moon, this was a
           dream I didn't want to end. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           I sat there.  Looking at the radio.  Then reached into my
           bag and pulled out three photos, of three kids.  Mine.

                                 BRENNIN (V.O.)
                        It was hard.  To travel 240,000
                        miles...  To look at-- with my own
                        eyes what-- what billions of people
                        never will.  To be this close, and
                        never set foot on that world.

           I floated into my hammock, pictures still in my hand.

                        these guys fulfill my dreams.  

           I let go of the pictures, they floated in place.

           LOCATION: VULCAN LANDER 
           REF: 450, Pg.55

           I woke up.  Heard something.  Looked down through my hammock
           web at Cale.

                                 CALE
                        I heard it.

                        Yeah.  Or the lander's settling.

           I laid back down.  Looked up at the ceiling.  It was quiet
           in here.  Quieter than the command module.  Less machinery.

           Tap.  Tap.  Tap.

           I looked at the door.  That's where the sound came from.

           We both sat up.  Slowly.  Those taps, they were perfectly
           measured.  In perfect intervals.

           I slid out of my hammock to the floor.  I spoke quietly.

                        Negative.  Clear skies.  You getting
                        rain?

           I didn't answer.  My eyes were glued to that door.

           I crept towards it.  Focused on the small 1 foot window carved
           into it.  I could only see the black sky from this angle.  

           I crept closer.

           No more knocks yet.  Everything was quiet.  

           I reached the door.  Touched it with my hand.  And slowly
           brought my eyes towards the window...
           ...and peered out.

           I saw the lunar surface.  I saw the rover........  

           My eyes strained, looking for something else.  My breath
           fogged the glass.  I reached up to wipe it--

           BOOOOM.

           The door was hit-- I flinched back-- 

           I looked at that door as if it were alive.

           BOOOOOOM.

           That one was louder-- harder--

           The door began shaking-- looked like something was trying to
           pull it off its hinges--

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.

           THE WHOLE LANDER STARTED SHAKING--

           We lost our footing-- fell down--

                        Shit--

           Cale helped me up-- we scrambled to our suits--

           THE LANDER TILTED MORE-- equipment alarms rang crazily--

           The lander groaned-- metal twisted-- as if it were being
           squeezed to death--  it was fucking insane-- 

                                 BRENNIN (on radio)

                        there's another one surrounding--

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.

           Cale fell as he got his second leg in his suit-- stumbled up
           as he put his arm in--

                                 MISSION CONTROL
                        Lander is reaching critical--

           Air was shrieking violently out the airlock-- 

           I couldn't find my helmet-- or my gloves-- or--

           BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.

           Again knocked off my feet-- shaking was too much-- I couldn't
           get up-- Was convinced this was it for me.

           Everything silenced.  Went still.   

           I thought time had frozen.  But no, whatever was attacking
           had stopped.

           I let out a breath, the Lander echoed it back.
           Looked over at Cale.  He was hyperventilating.  It was hard
           to breathe.  Air was still whistling out.

           I turned on my air-- oxygen hissed in-- I took a deep breath--
           was refreshing--

           Tap.  Tap.  Tap.

           Panic.  I looked over at the door.

           Tap.

           This time the tap came to the left of the door, on the wall--

           Tap.

           Further to the left.  And further....

           Tap...  Tap...  Tap... Tap...

           The tapping worked its way around to the opposite side of
           the lander-- the final tap was a little bit louder.  Then it
           stopped.

           Cale and I looked that direction, at the wall waiting for it
           to continue.

           It didn't.  But something else did.

           RIIIIIIIIIIIPPPP-----  WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHHH-----

           THE LANDER WALL DETONATED OUTWARDS-- BACKFIRED TOWARDS THE
           LUNAR SURFACE-- THE SUDDEN VACUUM SUCKED EVERYTHING WITH IT--
           I slid across the floor-- helmet slammed into something--
           chest hit something else-- I tumbled-- everything was total
           chaos-- then I flew out of the Lander-- was flying--

           Hit the ground-- tumbled-- rotated-- spun-- grey dirt flew--
           didn't know up from down-- then finally came to a stop.

           Was on my back like a turtle.  Waddled.  

           Tried to get up.  Finally did.  

           Looked around frantically.  Couldn't see what was doing this.  

           I gulped down oxygen.  Saw Cale.  

           Moved to him.  He was beneath metal carnage.  I lifted it
           off.  Helped him to his feet.

           We looked around.  Couldn't believe it.  Couldn't comprehend

           Debris was everywhere.  It extended several yards away. 
           Looked like the Lander had been turned inside out.  As if it
           had vomited its innards.

           The wreckage led back to a 5 foot gash in the Landers hull. 
           It was tilted dramatically towards the ground, one of its
           landing gear legs had snapped.

                        it, our way back.

           Something yellow caught my eye.  I stepped over, reached

           looked back to the front.  At the rover.  IT WAS MOVING.

           Ever so slightly.  Subtly.  It was inching towards the crater.  

           What was pushing it?

           THEN THE ROVER WAS SHOVED-- it tipped over, careened down
           the crater wall, rolled down its height into oblivion...

           But whatever was pushing it, did not come around the boulder. 
           I couldn't see it.  But something had to be there.  Just out
           of sight.  Had to be.

           bolted into Cale-- who then slammed into me--

           Knocked me off my feet-- over the edge-- INTO THE CRATER...

           how long I had been out.

           Could only hear breathing.  My breathing.  Was hollow in the

           LIGHT BLINDED ME.

           I couldn't see-- Something was shaking me-- jostling me where
           I knelt.  I blinked-- blinked-- started to see the outline
           of something.

           I blinked again-- saw a crack in my outer helmet glass.  Saw
           the sun.  Then in front of that I saw CALE.  Saw his mouth
           moving.  But I couldn't hear him.  My mic and headphones
           were dead.  

           My mouth opened.  Struggled with the carbon dioxide.  I still
           couldn't breathe.  My vision was going grey.  

           He turned knobs and buttons on my chest.  Then on my back. 
           OXYGEN FLOWED into my helmet.

           I took a deep breath.  Then another.  Started to stabilize. 
           He hit more buttons that had gotten pushed in the fall. 
           Suddenly I could hear him--

                        --glad to hear that.

           I took in a couple more breaths.  Looked up.  Saw the insanely
           high crater wall I fell from.

                                 CALE
                        I hit it, with the drill.  I fell
                        before I saw what happened-- but it
                        hasn't come back.

                        Control, Vulcan-- if you could
                        describe what you saw.

                        Yeah-- well, that thing-- it wasn't
                        a Russian satellite.  

                                 CALE
                        No, it had these multiple metal cubic
                        parts that rotated-- 4 of them.  All
                        together it was about 15 feet long.

                                 KORVER
                        Are you sure?  I saw circular--
                        metallic but circular-- concentric
                        rings--

                                 CALE
                        No, it was definitely cubic.  I hit
                        one of them with my drill.  

           I stumbled to my feet.  Looked at my suit.  It had
           lacerations.  Luckily none of them too deep.

                                 KORVER
                        The-- the GPR took different images--
                        from different angles.  Rectangles
                        and circles.
                            (paused)
                        And you-- we-- saw a different craft. 
                        You saw one that was square-- maybe
                        it was rectangular?  I saw one that
                        was circular.  There's a strange
                        consistency here.

                                 CALE
                        Excellent point.

                                 KORVER
                        Whatever it is-- it's sophisticated-- 
                        technologically advanced--  

                                 BRENNIN (on radio)
                        --and non-human.

           That thought didn't take long to sink in.  We've all been
           thinking it.

                                 BRENNIN (CONT'D)
                        You made contact.  With something
                        that doesn't want you there.

                                 KORVER
                        Control?  Got any insight here?
                                 MISSION CONTROL
                        Negative.  Analysis is scrubbing
                        tape-- detail is difficult to make
                        out.  Got medical here-- they're
                        suggesting you check O2.   

           I sighed.  Breathed in some oxygen.  Looked down at my gauges.

                                 KORVER
                        We're low.  What-- 35 minutes?  Max?

                                 CALE
                        Correct.  But the battery's at 7
                        minutes.  The air-conditioner is
                        killing it.  

                                 KORVER
                        Let's head back to the LM, grab oxygen--

                                 CALE
                        --I checked, they were all torn apart.

                                 KORVER
                        --we need to double check.

                                 CALE
                        You saw it-- the LM is destroyed-- 
                        nothing's left.  Everything we have
                        is right here...

           I looked around-- saw my drill.  Saw the rover, it was propped
           up on its side.

                                 KORVER
                        Then this is it.

           Cale didn't respond.  Nor did Mission Control.  Or Brennin. 
           There was no reason to.

                                 KORVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We were fucked.  With no backup
                        oxygen, no additional batteries...no
                        LM...it was only a matter of time. 
                        I'd uh...I'd be lying if I didn't
                        admit I was terrified.  But I didn't
                        want to die in a crater.

           I walked towards the rover.

                        Shut off the AC-- save battery--
                        we'll get cover from the sun.

           I shut off my AC.  Could feel it start to heat up immediately.

                        I'm not ready to throw in the towel. 
                        Direct us to the nearest cave.  We
                        gotta get out of here before that

           I opened the map.  Slid my fingers hurriedly across.  Stopped
           at a mountainous area not too far away:

                        It's got the flatter path, less

           --Korver was looking up at the crater wall.  I pointed to
           the opposite side.

                                 CALE
                        That side's not as high as this one. 
                        Looks like we could drive out.

                            (he nodded)
                        Yeah-- copy that.

           He grunted-- rolled the rover off its side-- it THUDDED down
           onto all fours wheels.  Next to it were items that had fallen
           off the rover into the soil.  

           He grabbed something out of the dirt, the sub-air explosive--

           I flipped the switch and sat back in my chair.  Looked out
           the window...  saw my reflection.  I could use a shave but
           had no motivation to do it.  

           Beyond my reflection I saw the Moon, and the termination

           out at the opposite crater wall.  It did look like we could
           climb it.

                        Alright--

           I gunned it.  We tore across the crater floor.  As we
           approached the wall we started to slope upwards.  

           I steered a bit right, so we'd ascend at an angle.  But it
           was still getting a bit steep.  
           Kinda felt like we could tip over-- but the 1/6 gravity was
           on our side-- I hoped.  

                                 CALE
                        --steeper than I thought.

                        Yeah--

           The rover started to slowdown-- and 

           STARTED TO TIP OVER-- 

           The wheels on my side CAME OFF THE GROUND-- we were gonna
           tumble back into the crater--

           I stuck my left leg out-- Cale leaned towards me-- but we
           kept tilting--

           THEN WE CRESTED THE CRATER RIM-- took flight for a split
           second--  Landed-- hard-- rough-- but stayed on our wheels.

           I let out a breath.  

                                 CALE
                        --maybe I should drive?

           The front fender was broken.  Dirt would spit into our face
           plates.  Always felt like it would hit my eyes.

                        In a heartbeat.  

           I smiled.

           We were sweating hard.  It was 130 degrees hot.  Problem
           with helmets is you can't wipe it out of your eyes.  Forced
           to blink it away.

                        Armstrong rock-- right there. 

           I pointed at a moon boulder-- slowed the rover.

                        over. 

           No response.  I stopped the rover.  Looked out.  There was
           nothing here.  No tracks.  No footsteps.  No flag.  It was
           pristine.  Untouched.

                        NASA did not divulge Apollo's true

                        We needed to explore anomalies in
                        that region.  At the time Russia was
                        on our heels, we didn't want them in
                        our neighborhood, over.

                        Nothing.  Search came back negative.

           I looked at Cale, he shook his head.  Tapped his gauge.

           I sighed.  Saddened by reality.  Started the rover moving
           again.  Rode in silence for a bit.

                                 KORVER

                        If they knew it was actually 22 hours,
                        maybe they'd demand to see the rest

           I trailed off because of what I saw.  My foot must have
           slipped off the throttle cause we came to a stop.

           A LUNAR LANDER.

           Just sitting there.  In the distance.  Alone.

           Arrived at the Lander and stopped.  I got out of the rover. 
           Walked towards it.  Looked up at it, 30 feet tall.  
           It looked exactly like our lander, except for one glaring
           difference:

           On its side was written CERES 2.  One less than our mission,
           CERES 3.

           I reached the ladder, looked up at the door.  Could only see
           the ceiling.  I slung the drill over my back.  

           I climbed.  Hand over hand.  Rung by rung.  Reached the top.  

           I peered in...

           ...no movement inside.  But there were allot of shadows.  It
           was getting harder to breathe.  Oxygen was running out. 
           Looked at gauge.  11 MINUTES.

           Looked over at Cale.  He wasn't looking this direction.  He
           was looking to the horizon.  Odd.

           They did.  

           It was a pigsty.  Dried rations everywhere.  Equipment laid

           SOMETHING EXPLODED

           I ducked-- protected my helmet as something BANGED BACK AND
           FORTH VIOLENTLY IN THE MODULE.   

           Then it stopped.  Went still.  

           I looked up to see a ruptured OXYGEN TANK.  I had hit it

           the opposites chest.  Their mirrored sun visors stared at me
           ominously.

           I kneeled next to the nearest one.  Reached my hand towards

           SNAPPED IT UPWARDS-- 

           I flinched-- looked back-- saw GIGANTIC EYEBALLS PRESSED
           AGAINST THE GLASS.  

           They were swollen-- Decomposed-- Bacteria filled-- but had

                        Yeah.  The one on the left is

                            (pointed to the other)
                        --he's Captain Kilbarger.  I heard
                        it on the radio--  Kilbarger was
                        trying to take off Rawlings' helmet.

           Cale shook his head.  Remembering.

                        He was convinced that was the way to
                        save them.  Lost his mind.

           Now I looked at them in a new light.  They weren't just
           holding each other.  They were in the middle of a fight.

           Kilbarger wasn't holding Rawlings' head, he was trying to
           remove his helmet.  And Rawlings had disconnected Kilbarger's
           oxygen pipe.  

           It was an eerie snapshot in time.

                                 KORVER
                        I knew Kilbarger.  We did flight
                        school together.  Thought he died in
                        a boating accident.

                        He probably thought you died too.

           of footprints leading about 10 yards away...  to something
           drawn in the sand.  I couldn't make it out from here.

           I walked...  followed the prints to where they led.  Looked
           at it.  One of them had written something in the regolith,
           in large oversized letters.  

           It read:

           Looked back.  Could barely see Cale through the dust--
           withering on the ground.  Something else got my attention. 
           On the horizon.

           Saw some kind of ship.  Or vessel.  But what was stunning,
           is that it stretched over 1/3rd of the horizon.  And it was
           approaching us.

           I looked at Cale--  Back at the oxygen tank--  Then at Cale--  

           I sighed-- and went for the oxygen-- Grabbed it.  Hurled it
           further in the cave-- turned back towards Cale.

                                 KORVER
                        Coming for you.

           Heard a breathless reply in response.

           I saw something on the ship flash...flash got bigger-- closer--
           fast--  I had a feeling it wouldn't miss this time.

           I couldn't talk-- couldn't respond to Korver--  I sucked in
           a ragged breath--

           I rolled over-- tried to stand, stumbled towards the cave a
           couple feet-- went down--

           My own breathing was getting quieter.  Not enough air to
           carry sound.

           Hit my helmet glass-- still wouldn't move-- I was too weak
           to try again.

           I saw another light in the distance-- coming right for me-- in
           my current state it looked like a messenger from the other
           side.

           Hands grabbed me.  Korver's-- he yanked me up--

           He couldn't really walk.  But he was only 60 pounds-- I pretty

           Something was approaching me, up here, in orbit.

           I looked out the window.  Couldn't see anything.  Looked
           back at the radar.  It was getting closer, faster, what could

           I came to lying on a bed of ruble.  Rocks were on my legs
           and torso.  I shoved them off.

           It was dark.  But I could see rocks everywhere.  The cave
           entrance had collapsed.  

           My Co2 was too high-- I was close to blacking out.  I could
           feel I was hypoxic.

           Saw Cale further in.  I got up-- unsteadily.  Went to him. 
           Grabbed the oxygen tank on the way.

           Got to Cale-- he was blue-- barely breathing.  His helmet
           was cracked.  I tried to shut its secondary layer, it was
           stuck.

           I unhooked his oxygen hose-- attached it to the O2 tank. 
           His tube trembled with air.  I was forcing oxygen into his
           helmet.  Even though it was escaping from the leak.

           I saw him stir a bit.  I grabbed a rock.

           I inched up into a sitting position.  And slowly turned my
           head...

           Saw more of the wall...

           Then saw the length of it...

           Until finally I could see further down the tunnel...

           Then my eyes adjusted--  

           SOMETHING WAS STANDING AT THE FAR END OF THE TUNNEL.

           It was in shadow.  I couldn't get a good read on its form,
           its physique...but it was about 7 feet tall.

                                 CALE
                        It's been watching us.  For about 25
                        minutes.

           My eyes looked for my drill...it was lying by the wall. 
           Cale had his in hand.

                        it's-- it's about ten feet closer
                        now than before.

           It stood there mysterious.  Enigmatic.

           Then I felt it, a soft boooooom reverberating throughout the
           cave...  And then another...similar to a small earthquake.

                                 KORVER

           My drill was rattling on the floor-- I grabbed it-- 

           Saw Cale hit the ground and bounce up-- hit the ceiling--

           I lunged towards the thing-- drill first-- and it sunk in
           deep-- then proceeded to do what drills do, and bored in--

           ELECTRONIC AUDIO WAVES assaulted my ears as my drill pulled
           itself deeper into this things metal insides-- 

           It thrashed-- WHIPPING ME AROUND--

           AND THEN FINALLY WENT DOWN-- AND WENT DOWN HARD.

           I rolled off of it-- fought to catch my breath.  It was still. 
           Wasn't moving.

           Cale gave me a hand.  Helped me up.  But he wouldn't let go.

                        This close to his face I could see
                        his eyes.  The genuine gratitude in
                        them.  I was touched.

           I stared down at this thing.  Arcs of light continued to
           flash within it.  

           It's hard to describe what it looked like.  It was as an odd
           collection of coal black, cylindrical and spherical geometric
           elements.  
           Together they formed a-- a-- seven foot form-- that-- that had
           a strange, metallic tail like appendage on its end that was
           about three feet long, and had these odd metal scales on it.

                        or something.  This one had to attack
                        us-- with it's bare hands so to speak.

           I looked at the thing again.  It's elements were clearly
           spherical.

           From where I was standing, it was definitely cubic.  No
           question.  It looked like a metallic rubik's cube, in a rough
           rectangular form-- and that odd tail.

           I kneeled.  Inspected the floor.  It was smoother than the
           walls.  Worn.

                        I saw a pillar built into the cave
                        entrance-- looked like part of an
                        archway.

           A spec of color caught my eye.  On the wall.  I walked over
           to it.  I thought I could see something, behind the dirt.  

           I put my hand on the wall.  Rubbed back and forth.  Millions
           of years of dust drifted away...

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        Look at that...
           I couldn't see it so close.  I backed up next to Korv and
           took it all in: 

           It was a faded drawing-- or painting.  Of a blue Earth.  And
           a silver Moon.  But the Moon looked different.  Didn't have
           any of the craters that it has now.  It looked smooth.

           Even though they were etched into the stone, the Moon and
           Earth actually switched places as one moved by them.  A
           strange optical illusion similar to that machine.

           I looked further down the hallway.  And could see the tell
           tale signs that--

                                 CALE

                        That relationship-- must have been

                            (he pointed at machine)
                        --it was caring, or-- maintaining
                        something in here-- down the tunnel. 
                        That's why it didn't have any weapons.

                        It's more of a caretaker.

           I looked further down the tunnel.  It faded away.  Into
           darkness.  

           BOOOOOOOMMM....

           A boulder was cleared from the top of the cave opening--
           letting some of the sun in--

           We grabbed our drills.  Hurried towards the dark.  

           BOOOOOMMMMM....

           More light lanced into the tunnel.  

           The ground started to slope downwards.  Became steeper.  And
           it curved to the left. 
           We loped down it.  Then full on daylight burst into the tunnel
           behind us--

           I turned back around-- ran right into something huge--
           ricocheted back--  hit the ground.  Looked up at it:  

           It was a BLACK RECTANGULAR structure that stretched from
           floor to ceiling.  Made of obsidian metal that was machine
           smoothed.  I could see myself in its reflection.

           At its front was a rectangular portal.  A human could easily
           step inside of it.  By its dimensions, it looked made for
           something twice our height.

           Behind it the tunnel dead ended.  I looked towards the cave
           opening-- could see shadows coming in.  Blotting out the
           light.  

           I looked back at the portal.  AND WALKED INSIDE.

           Now I counted fifteen.  

           Fifteen goddamn ships that had surrounded mine.  

           They were these spherical sometimes cubic monstrosities. 
           Made of black metal that appeared to be mashed together in
           no coherent pattern or reason.  

           One curious consistency; each of them seemed to have a
           metallic TAIL like appendage made of the same metallic
           materials.

           It was like my kids had made these things in arts and crafts.  

           Except I knew these were deadly.

           And they were huge.  

           Each one was five to ten times larger than the command module. 
           And they constantly spun.  Some clockwise, others counter-
           clockwise.  It was fucking bizarre.

           I video taped them with my camera.  Documenting what I could.

           Was zoomed into one when I noticed it stop spinning.
           I looked up with the naked eye.  All of them had stopped.

           And then I could feel that excruciating pain all over again. 
           But this time it was happening from the inside out.  As if
           someone had put these blender blades in my intestines.

           I dropped 2 feet, collapsed on the ground-- tried to catch

           I rolled over.  Looked around.  I was in the same fucking

           I got up, staggered out-- saw Cale-- but

           THE CAVE WAS GONE.

           Somehow we were standing in the middle of a barren desert.

                                 KORVER
                        I think-- that's-- Pegasus...and
                        Aquarius... 

                                 CALE
                        ...which would mean--

                        No-- that's three thousand miles--
                        that's not possible.  I mean-- we
                        just got in that thing.

                                 CALE
                        It-- I think it's-- it deconstructed
                        us, transmitted us here, and then
                        reconstructed us again--

                                 KORVER
                        What-- ?  We were teleported-- ?
                                 CALE
                        Yes.

           I looked back at it.  Sitting there ominously in the soil.

                                 KORVER
                        That means they can follow us here.

           Cale pointed towards mountains.  They silhouetted against
           the star sky.

                                 CALE
                        I think those are mountains.  Don't
                        know how far they are-- but they
                        give us the best cover.

                                 KORVER
                        Agreed.

           We moon ran, bounding over the terrain.  Weren't as many
           craters on the dark side of the moon.  Odd.  My voice shook
           with each step:

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        Ceres, this is Korver, do you read...?
                            (nothing)
                        Ceres, Brennin, this is Korver, you
                        up there?

                        Control, Cale.  Come back.

           He shook his head.

           I looked back at the cylinder.  No activity yet.  We were
           putting good distance from it fast.

                                 KORVER
                        Nothing at the cylinder.

                                 CALE
                        Good--  

           Cale pointed to our left.  A soft white glow could be seen
           on the moon horizon.

                                 CALE (CONT'D)
                        The termination line's approaching--

                        Never thought I'd see a sunrise on
                        the moon.

                        Never thought I'd see allot of things
                        I'm seeing.

           I chuckled.

           I tripped.  Almost fell on a couple jagged rocks.

           The mountains were closer than we thought.  In fact.  We
           were there.

           Boulders and rocks jutted out at haphazard angles.  We had
           to slow down a touch.  Navigated with more care.

                                 KORVER
                        This terrain's very different-- from
                        the rest of the moon.

                                 CALE
                        It's almost organized-- organized

                        --yeah, perfect description.

                                 CALE
                        We should slow down.  Preserve O2.

           I scanned the horizon behind us.  Didn't see a thing.  If we
           didn't die by one thing, we'd die by another.

                                 KORVER
                        Alright.

           We slowed to a walk.  In this area, it became much flatter
           than normal.  Less regolith.  Ground felt hard.

           I pulled out my letter, to my wife.  I could still see it's
           yellow color in the dim light.  Liked holding it.

                                 CALE
                        Whose the letter to?

                        send it.

                        I didn't-- she's dead.

           I heard a sigh.
                                 CALE
                        They put us together so fast-- we
                        barely got to know each other.

                                 KORVER

                        She didn't think there was room for
                        both.  We got in a fight about it. 
                        She took a drive to cool off....got
                        hit head on by a-- drunk driver going

           LOCATION: DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
           REF: 452, Pg.201

           The celestial termination line swept over us.  Turning night
           to day, and 

           REVEALING WHAT ACTUALLY LOOMED OVERHEAD.

           I grabbed my drill-- Korver same--

           THREE MASSIVE REPTILIAN FACES LOOKED DOWN ON US.
           EACH FACE WAS 50 FEET LONG OF STONE STATUE, REPLETE WITH SCALES
           AND ATTACHED TO A SWEEPING REPTILIAN BODY WHOSE POSITIONING
           BORE A TERRIFYING RESEMBLANCE TO THE EGYPTIAN SPHINX. 

           WE STARED UP AT THE LIZARDS IN AWE.  THEY STOOD IN A ROW,
           AND TOWERED OVER US LIKE THE ANTS WE WERE. 

           BEHIND THE SPHINXES, THEIR TAILS LED TO A PYRAMID FOUR TIMES
           THE SIZE OF THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA.  ITS TIP REACHED INTO
           THE BLACK SKY.  SO HIGH IT SEEMED LIKE IT TOUCHED ORBIT.

           I looked around.

           WE WEREN'T IN THE MIDDLE OF A LUNAR DESERT;  

           WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LUNAR CITY.  

           Our jaws hung open as we soaked it all in.

                                 KORVER
                        This is-- this is-- beyond-- it's...

           The city was in ruin, everything was decayed and decrepit. 
           It felt more like a Vietnam war zone, than a lunar cityscape.

           Whereas Egypt was shades of browns, all the structures here
           were shades of lunar grey.  All, that is, except for the
           sphinxes which were a subtle green.

                                 CALE
                        It's-- this is... impossible...

           The city stretched on forever.  In all directions.

                        This was built by-- I mean-- there
                        was a population of things-- that
                        actually lived here...

           We looked back the direction we had come.  The uneven terrain
           we had traversed were not craters and boulders.  They were
           collapsed buildings.  Dilapidated architecture.  

                                 CALE
                        It's...architecturally Egyptian, but
                        it's different-- it's--

                        Egyptian-- ?  But what would that
                        mean-- ?  

           Each building was pyramidal in structure.  Four sides meeting
           up at a tip.  The doors had minature reptilian Sphinx's on
           both sides of them facing the door, and anyone who would enter.
           And I should mention:  All doors were 11 feet tall, denoting
           the size of the race that built them.

           I pointed to the top of the pyramid.

                                 CALE
                        Look at that--

           Black support beams seemed to crisscross at the pyramid's
           apex.

                        that central pyramid.  At it's foot.  

           We walked down what was left of a road.  It ran adjacent to
           one of the sphinxes.

                        Egyptians-- they-- repeated history
                        in multiple locations.  We just have
                        to-- find a building with

                        tell us allot. 

           We arrived at what might have been an INTERSECTION.  But it
           was too dilapidated to tell.  What was of interest was the
           aged BUILDING in the center of it:

           Enormous Moon and Earth drawings decorated the outside.  And
           it was the one building, that was not pyramidal.  

           It had a domed ceiling.  Turrets.  A gate entryway.  This
           was not Egyptian architecture...

           I was in awe.

                        Greek architecture.

           It was one large chamber.  Rubble laid everywhere.  It was
           totally devastated.  But there was still plenty to see.

           The ceiling vaulted over head.  The size and scope reminded
           of the Roman Pantheon.

           And there were drawings everywhere.  Over every inch.

           The drawings were like the cave art, but a little brighter. 
           And more-- more 3 dimensional.  They popped off the wall by
           several feet.  And moved as we drifted about the room.

                                 CALE
                        It's genius.  Brilliance.

           It was almost as if the drawings were treated like structures
           or architecture.  Most of the art was celestial in content.  

           We moved towards the center of the chamber.  And once we
           arrived there, we knew we had hit the sweet spot.

           From this location, the multifaceted drawings all came
           together as one.  
           It was so beautiful.  To see these 20 foot art pieces
           suspended in midair... seemingly animated.  

           However, the content of the art was probably better at
           bringing tears:

           The two most prominent pieces of dimensionalized art, were
           the Earth and the Moon.

           They spun on there respective axis...

           Next to the Earth, serpentine, artwork of UPRIGHT LIZARDS
           were detailed.

           While on the Moon side, the same sort of serpentine art work
           was represented.

           It was impossible to tell the difference between these two
           'peoples'.

                                 KORVER
                        They look exactly alike--

                                 CALE
                        It's either their gods, or it's what
                        they-- what they actually look like--

                                 KORVER
                        This is fucking surreal.

           Over and over, the art would show hundreds of little dart
           sized projectiles -- which I realized were a type of missile --
           launch from the Moon to hit Earth.  

           Then they would launch from Earth to hit the Moon.

           Each time they hit Earth, the planet would wobble on it's
           axis.  

           Each time they hit the Moon-- craters would appear-- the
           craters we thought were caused by asteroids, WERE CAUSED BY
           AN ALIEN WAR.

                        you look at history-- look at the
                        landmarks and buildings that are
                        somehow the same across oceans-- ?

           I looked hard at the Moon.  At the Earth.  As the missiles
           hit them both.

           RAYS OF MOONLIGHT PENETRATED THE ART, 

           disturbing my view of it.  They lanced out from holes created
           by huge blocks of rock that fell from one of the walls, and 

           POUNDED TO THE GROUND. 

           THEN THE ENTIRE MASS of the WALL WOBBLED, AND TILTED -- IT
           WAS ABOUT TO COME DOWN ON TOP OF OUR HEADS.

           We scrambled-- ran-- the opposite direction-- 

           I followed Cale-- he was heading for a hole on the opposite
           wall-- 

           I glanced back-- the wall behind us was on its way down--
           instants from hitting--
           Cale stepped into the hole-- and the wall 

           SLAMMED DOWN AS I DOVE 

           through the hole, skidded onto the ground outside...as debris
           cannonaded out of the cavity--

           I got up-- to see tens of GREY ALIEN CRAFT PROWLING IN THE
           SKY.

           Cale ran.  I followed.  THEY PURSUED.

           FLAAAAASH--

           A rock grazed my foot-- tripped me-- I kept my footing-- a

           Brother, this was it for me.  But I kept fighting.

           I grabbed the joystick-- moved it left-- sunlight lanced in--

           I WAS ON FIRE.
           I smacked my clothing-- tried to put it out-- 

           Zero gravity fire doesn't have gravity to hold it down-- it
           can actually spread into the air-- wherever the oxygen is--

           The fires on me ballooned, grew larger and LARGER--

           Then I realized that I wasn't the only THING on fire. 
           Everything else cloth based was lit up too.

           Seats-- carry bags-- ALL OF IT WAS ON FIRE--

           The pyramids were perfectly lined up, and went on as far as

           THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MODULE.  AND AIR WAS STILL LEAKING OUT--

           I flailed towards the extinguisher.  Grabbed it.  Blasted
           the nozzle at myself.  Put myself out.  
           Turned it on the module.  Shot that thing everywhere.  Put
           half the fires out.  But the rest were still going.

           But now I didn't care.

           I sat down at the controls.  They were hot to the touch.

           I was hit again.  I heard something sheer off.  It spun me
           into a tailspin.  I fired the thrusters to stabilize.  

           Then flipped a big red switch.  Something inside the module
           rumbled to life.  Even now I loved the way it felt.  It was
           the main engine.

           I throttled forward.  My head kicked back to respect the
           G's.  

           I could feel the heat on my back.  The fires were heating up
           again.  But I knew at this point, it didn't matter.

           I looked out the window as I steered towards one of the crafts--
           and closed on it fast.  

           I wanted to take one of these things down with me.  I wasn't
           gonna die alone.

           I stared hard at this thing as I got closer, and closer, and

           LIKE THE MALE FACE OF A HUMAN BEING.

           Just like the optical illusions of the GROUND RADAR-- the
           ALIEN CRAFTS-- the CAVE DRAWINGS, and ART WORKS, this great
           SERPENTINE SPHINX had another face. 

           Looked at in this way, from this angle, the FACE OF THE SPHINX
           STOPPED LOOKING ALIEN, AND STARTED LOOKING HUMAN.

           IT WAS HUMAN

           The craft were closer than ever now-- saw multiple flashes
           growing brighter--

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        stop-- STOP--

           I pounded my helmet-- hit it hard-- tried to get their
           attention--

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        We're human-- we're human-- 

           I took a breath-- UNBUCKLED MY HELMET.  TOOK IT OFF-- 

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        WE'RE HUMAN -- !  WE'RE HUMAN-- !

           I took a breath-- sucked AIR IN.  COUGHED IT OUT, SUCKED
           ANOTHER DEEP BREATH--  COUGHED HARDER-- BUT I COULD BREATHE--

           THINGS STARTED GETTING BRIGHTER-- I GRABBED, CALE, TRIED TO
           TAKE HIS HIS HELMET OFF-- HE FOUGHT ME--

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        HUMAN-- HUMAN-- WE'RE HUMAN-- DON'T
                        KILL US-- STOP--

           I RIPPED CALE'S HELMET OFF-- HE KICKED ME IN THE CHEST--
           KNOCKING ME SEVERAL FEET BACK TO THE GROUND.

           I got my bearings...looked at the crafts...their weapon lights
           were still hot...but they were holding their fire.

           Cale looked at me with wonder as he choked in air.  I pointed
           to the fire.  Then up at the sky at the beams we had seen.  

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        It's a dome--  oxygen-- inside the
                        city--  

           A shadow fell over me, I turned to see a SPHERICAL CRAFT
           descending to the ground.  It landed ten or fifteen feet
           away.
           Its smorgasbords of black metallic surfaces opened up.  And
           a smaller ENTITY emerged.  Floated out.  Similar to the one
           we saw in the cave.

           It's 'tail' dragged on the ground, and it rotated in place. 

                                 KORVER (CONT'D)
                        ...My name is Commander Christopher
                        Korver, of the U.S. Air Force...

           But I didn't say that.  That came from the ENTITY.  And this
           time it wasn't over the radio.  It came from a speaker within
           it that we could hear.  It continued emitting its recordings:

                                 BRENNIN (UNKNOWN ENTITY)
                        Control, Brennin, our friends have
                        stopped spinning.

                                 CALE
                        What's it doing-- ?

                                 GEN. SHAW (UNKNOWN ENTITY)
                        Captain.  Your intentions are
                        honorable.  Nevertheless I am ordering
                        you home.

                                 KORVER
                        I don't kno-- 

                                 MISSION CONTROL (UNKNOWN ENTITY)
                        --affirmed.  It's important to us,
                        that you understand we didn't want
                        it to come out this way.

                                 KORVER (UNKNOWN ENTITY)
                        WE'RE HUMAN--  WE'RE HUMAN--

           Then it fell silent.  

           I could hear a hum coming from it.  

           Then it spoke.  With stolen words.  Each word was a word I
           had spoken; or Cale; or Brennin; at one point or another.  

           It used these words to construct a sentence, causing the
           entities voice to rise and fall in a Frankenstein cadence.  

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY
                        you.  Are.  Human.

           I looked at it.  Unsure if it wanted a response.  I said--

                                 KORVER
                        Yes.

                        HUMANKIND.  Created.  Us.

           It paused again.  Continued to rotate in place.  Discordant
           voice--

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY (CONT'D)
                        HUMANKIND.  Created.  Us.  to.

                                 KORVER
                        Defend against who?

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY
                        Against.  HUMANKIND.  HUMANKIND.
                            (it paused)

                        we.  are.  WHAT'S.  left.  on.  Moon.

           I felt an unsettling fear while I looked at this thing--

                                 KORVER
                        Then where did--

           I pointed at Cale and I--

                        --we come from?

                                 KORVER
                        ...thank you.  For sparing us-- 
                            (pointed at Cale)
                        --our lives.

                        IT.  was.  Not.  our.  DECISION.

           I glanced at Cale.

                                 KORVER
                        Whose decision was it?
                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY
                        no.

           It fell silent.

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY (CONT'D)
                        they.  are.  on.  DIFFERENT.  Planet.

                        Will they return?

           It paused.  Maybe was receiving information.  

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY
                        yes.  SOON.

                        What is the criteria for 'ready'.

                                 KORVER
                        Are we too violent?  Or too
                        aggressive?

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY

                        has.  MULTIPLIED.  

           It took me a moment to understand that answer.  To comprehend
           what it meant.  I rocked back on my heels.  The gravity of
           its last words sinking in.

           The ENTITY retreated.  Floated back into its craft.

                                 UNKNOWN ENTITY (CONT'D)
                        We.  will.  repair.  your.  ships.

           I stared after this thing.  My legs felt weak.  I stumbled,
           bumped into Cale.  We held each other up.

           A final shudder shook the module...  

           And I was amazed, I mean, dumbfounded, as I watched through
           the windows as the spheres departed...

           The broken glass had been replaced.  The structural cracks
           were no more.  All damage had been repaired.  By them...

           I looked at it all and just shook my head.  The module looked
           better than new...

           POUND.  POUND.  POUND...

           I floated to the air lock.  Opened it.  KORVER AND CALE were
           on the other side grinning from ear to ear...

           We smothered each other with hugs.  Laughed.  There were
           probably some tears there too...

           --we splashed down into the Atlantic.  Our heads bobbled at
           impact.  We looked out.  Could see the familiar ocean waters
           lapping against the glass.

           I watched as the round containment door was banged shut,
           sealing the three of us inside.

           I turned to my locker.  Opened it.  Pulled out a beat up
           manilla envelope.  Inside of it were twenty or so yellow
           letters to Erika.  

           I reached in my chest pocket and took out my newest one.  It
           was torn, ripped and moon-soiled.  I smoothed it out, and
           slid it gently on top of the others.   

           I looked up at the guys.

                                 KORVER (V.O.)
                        We should have been happy-- to be
                        back home.  But just looking at the
                        guys faces I could tell that-- that
                        for some reason, we weren't.

                        to touch down.  I mean, the UFO's--
                        they were amazing.  But I wish I was
