           DARKNESS.  Then, a CRASHING sound.

           INT. DAPHNE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We find DAPHNE (28) and COLIN (28), both attractive and both 
           drunk.  Daphne is fiery “I’m the greatest” drunk, and Colin 
           is woozy “if I’m not getting sex then I’m passing out” drunk.

           Who is drunker?  Impossible to tell.

           Colin sits/leans on the bed, dodging the small items (make-
           up, picture frames, etc.) that Daphne is THROWING at him.

                                 COLIN 
                        You’re breaking your own stuff!

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don’t give a SHIT!

           She FLINGS a candle at him, CLEANING OUT her bedside table.

                                 COLIN
                        Listen...
                             (takes him a second)
                        ...Daphne, I said from the very 
                        beginning that you’re too good for 
                        me, that you deserve better...

                                 DAPHNE
                        Better than misspelled texts at 3 AM 
                        asking me if my PUDDY is wet!?  
                        Believe me, I know that!  I KNOW!

                                 COLIN
                        Well...then...I dunno.

           Long pause.  Daphne stares at him.  SIGHS.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Jesus you’re pathetic.
                             (takes off her shirt)
                        You’re so unbelievably lucky that I’m 
                        as horny as I am.

           Colin grins.  Sex confirmed.

           She SLAPS him across the face.  HARD.

                                 COLIN
                        OW!

                                 DAPHNE
                             (shoves him onto the bed)
                        Don’t you DARE smile at me!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DAPHNE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Loud, fast-paced, sloppy, drunken SEX.  At least, Daphne and 
           Colin seem to agree on one thing.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Daphne STUMBLES into the bathroom, CLOSES the door.

           She lifts the toilet seat like she’s about to puke...but 
           nothing comes.  A few DRY HEAVES.

           She gives up, slumps back against the wall.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Daphne is asleep against the wall.  Looks uncomfortable.

           She SHAKES awake.  Looks around, confused.

           INT. DAPHNE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daphne, now in her bathrobe, stares daggers at Colin, who is 
           sleeping peacefully spread across her entire bed.

           She pokes him with her foot.  Nothing.  She leans in close to 
           him like she’s going to whisper...but WOLF-WHISTLES instead.

           Colin JOLTS UP, awake and immediately hung over.

                                 DAPHNE
                        C’mon.  Out.

                                 COLIN
                        Wha...it’s like 5:30...
                             (Daphne says nothing)
                        How am I supposed to get home?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Same way you got here: I don’t care.

           INT. RANDOM GIRL’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Two sleeping bodies entangled in bedsheets.  One is HENRY 
           (28), a perfect balance between rugged & pretty, handsome & 
           average, muscular & skinny, and so on.  The other is RANDOM 
           GIRL (28), pretty in a delicate sort of way.

           Henry STIRS awake.  Winces.  He’s also hung over.

           His movement wakes her up.  He smiles at her.
                                 HENRY
                        Good morning.

           She stares at him for a few seconds, big wide eyes, and then 
           begins to CRY softly.  Henry looks concerned.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        What’s the matter?

           She rolls over, now facing away from him, as her soft CRYING 
           escalates to average volume CRYING.

           Henry is lost.  He reaches over to comfort her.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Are you okay...?

           She SLAPS his hand away, and the tone of her CRYING morphs 
           into that of defensive anger.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Is it something I did?

           Her defensive angry CRYING shifts to hopeless, lonely CRYING.

           Henry has no idea what to do, so he does what any guy would 
           do: he gets up and begins getting dressed.

           Her CRYING climaxes in an all-encompassing woe-is-me mood.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Okay, so...I’m...gonna go.

           He’s halfway out the door when-

                                 RANDOM GIRL
                             (through tears)
                        Wait.
                             (he turns)
                        Don’t you want to get breakfast?

           Henry’s face.

           INT. THE APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Still in her bathrobe, Daphne is sprawled across the couch in 
           an awkward, tangled, ass-up sleeping position.  

           The apartment is sparkling clean.  Like, immaculate.

           Henry STAGGERS through the door.  He sees Daphne.  CHUCKLES.

           Henry leaves the living room, opens a door to:
           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A similar layout to Daphne’s bedroom, except with a more 
           masculine design scheme.  

           If it wasn’t clear before, these two are roommates.

           Henry strips off his shirt, tosses it.  He picks up a new 
           shirt, smells it, and then puts it on before returning to-

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Henry approaches the couch where Daphne remains asleep.

           He sees that she left the vacuum cleaner out and plugged in.

           So Henry picks up the vacuum wand, places it next to Daphne’s 
           cheek, before POWERING UP the vacuum cleaner.

           Daphne wakes the fuck up, her cheek stuck in the wand like a 
           fish on a fishing hook.  She quickly KNOCKS it away.

           Henry SHUTS OFF the vacuum, smirking at Daphne’s scowl.

                                 HENRY
                        C’mon, up.  I left my credit card at 
                        the bar.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Why didn’t you pick it up on the way 
                        home?

                                 HENRY
                        Saturday.  Brunch.  I’m paying.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Fine.

           Daphne gets up, heads into her bedroom.  Henry waits.

                                 HENRY
                        Place looks great.  Tell-tale sign of 
                        a physically satisfying yet 
                        emotionally destructive orgasm.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        It’s cheaper than hiring a maid.

                                 HENRY
                        Someone new or one of the alternates?

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        Colin.

                                 HENRY
                        Colin!?  Wow, nine lives on that guy.
                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, what about you?  You have a 
                        nice night with Angela?

                                 HENRY
                        I did, thank you very much.  Angela’s 
                        very sweet, I’ll probably be seeing 
                        her again this week.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        Wait, so you’re saying that this 
                        Angela has serious potential?

                                 HENRY
                        I think Angela is jam-packed with 
                        serious girlfriend potential.

           Daphne returns to the living room, now wearing a cute and 
           casual outfit and carrying her purse.

                                 DAPHNE 
                        I’m so happy for you.  Also, her name 
                        was Meredith.

                                 HENRY
                        ...Really?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nice try, though.   Valiant effort.

           Henry heads to the front door.  Daphne makes a quick detour 
           to the kitchen and opens the freezer.

                                 HENRY
                        Amazing.  I can’t meet a girl worth 
                        remembering, and you can’t get rid of 
                        a guy that you would rather forget.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Mmm-hmmm.  

           She pulls a handful of ice out of the freezer and CRAMS IT 
           down the back of his pants.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        For the vacuum.

           Henry YELPS, does a little jig, trying to shake out the ice.

                                 HENRY
                        Damn skinny jeans!
           INT. GOAL ON MELROSE - NOONISH

           A cool sports bar with booths on each side and tables in the 
           middle.  The walls are lined with massive flat screen TVs, 
           covering literally every possible sight-line in the bar.

           Every single TV is playing the USC football game.

           Henry and Daphne sit at a table, finishing up brunch.

           RINGTONE.  Daphne checks her iphone.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nice, I got out of having to go to 
                        Santa Fe!

                                 HENRY
                        What’s in Santa Fe?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Convention for work.

                                 HENRY
                        Some pro-active regional expansion?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Lots of low-hanging fruit out there.

                                 HENRY
                        Now you’re thinking outside the box.

           [note: Henry and Daphne only speak about their jobs in 
           cliched or ludicrous business jargon.  It’s their thing.]

                                 DAPHNE
                        Doing my best to manage expectations, 
                        but I think I can really spearhead a 
                        sustainable competitive advantage.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s definitely in your wheelhouse, 
                        just run it up the flagpole and see 
                        where the pushback is.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (sighs)
                        Only 347 paychecks away from retiring 
                        to my beachside post-modern stilt 
                        house in Bali.  

                                 HENRY
                        That’s the dream.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I have to pee just thinking about all 
                        the mojitos I’m going to drink.
           Daphne gets up, head to the bathroom.

           Henry wipes the last of his eggs up with some bread.  Checks 
           out a girl walking by.  Chews.  Then-

           -something catches his eye.  Something on every TV set...

           EVERY TV:  A commercial for Charm.com, a dating website.  It 
           is structured like the eHarmony ads where a happy couple 
           gives a testimonial about their personal success story.

           EVERY TV:  DREW & STACY (both 28) clutch each other and smile 
           offensively into the camera.

                                 DREW (V.O.)
                        The first time I saw Stacy, it was 
                        like a volcano.  An eruption of love 
                        in my heart, and I knew right away.

           Henry’s eyes BUG OUT.  He COUGHS on his un-swallowed food.

           EVERY TV:  Drew & Stacy continue their sales pitch.

                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        I was hesitant about online dating, 
                        but my friends convinced me to try 
                        Charm’s five free matches program.  
                        Drew was my very first match.  He 
                        called me, and we talked on the phone 
                        until like four in the morning.

                                 DREW (V.O.)
                             (mushy GIGGLING)
                        I remember that, we were both late 
                        for work the next day!

           Henry springs into action, charging towards the bathrooms in 
           the back.  He jostles his way through people.

           EVERY TV:  The FOUNDER (50s) of Charm.com takes center stage. 

                                 FOUNDER (V.O.)
                        At Charm.com, our “Perfect Match” 
                        system epitomizes the reliability of 
                        compatibility.  Sign up now and view 
                        your first five matches for free!

           Henry breaks through the crowd.  Arriving at the entrances 
           for the bathrooms, he finds-

           -Daphne staring at the TVs.  White as a ghost.

           EVERY TV:  Drew & Stacy return for one last endorsement.  
           Stacy holds up her left hand to flaunt an engagement ring.

                                 DREW & STACY (V.O.)
                        Charm.com!  Find your forever!
           Daphne continues to stare at the TVs as one commercial fades 
           into another.  Eventually, her gaze finds-

           -Henry.  His look says a lot of things: I’m sorry, don’t 
           freak out, it’ll be okay, stuff like that.

           They hold eye contact for a beat, and then-

           -Daphne SCREAMS at the top of her lungs.

           Total silence in the bar as everyone is now looking at them.

           INT. HENRY’S CAR - DAY

           Henry drives.  Daphne stresses out next to him.  Pause.

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe you should-

                                 DAPHNE
                        Do NOT tell me to do anything except 
                        be completely outraged right now!

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just saying, that-

                                 DAPHNE
                        Henry, that was Drew!  MY Drew!  The 
                        guy that wrote me sonnets and told me 
                        that we’d have beautiful children, 
                        all while somehow managing to bang 
                        eight skanks behind my back...and now 
                        he thinks he’s getting MARRIED!?

           Pause.  Henry mulls it over.  Daphne whips out her iphone.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, let’s not jump to conclusions.  
                        Drew was always an opportunist, I 
                        wouldn’t put it past him to take a 
                        paycheck in exchange for posing as 
                        some dating site success story.
                             (pause)
                        You can always stalk him on facebook.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (already there)
                        Status engaged!

           As Henry stops for a red light, Daphne shoves her iphone into 
           his face, showing him a photo of Drew and his new fiance. 

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        TO THAT BITCH FROM THE COMMERCIAL!
                                 HENRY
                        They look happy.

                                 DAPHNE
                        HENRY!!  How is this possible!?

                                 HENRY
                        Charm.com?

                                 DAPHNE
                        And this poor girl!

                                 HENRY
                        You mean the bitch?

                                 DAPHNE
                        This poor clueless girl that he’s 
                        conned into thinking that he is 
                        worthy of being a husband.

                                 HENRY
                        She’s in for a rude awakening.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’ve got to save her.

                                 HENRY
                             (pause)
                        You mean you’ve got to ruin him?

           Daphne starts to protest.   Instead:

                                 DAPHNE
                        The two aren’t mutually exclusive.

                                 HENRY
                             (points to her iphone)
                        And look who’s having his bachelor 
                        party tonight at Crazy Girls.

           The car behind Henry honks, annoyed.   Light’s been green.

           EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           An establishing shot of a very nice house in Eagle Rock.

                                 MARCY (V.O.)
                        So it’s settled...

           INT. EVAN’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME

           EVAN (28) and MARCY (28) sit at the kitchen table, surrounded 
           by an array of wedding gifts.  They are newly-weds, but Marcy 
           appears to be more comfortable than Evan with this transition 
           into adulthood.
                                 MARCY
                        ...we’ll exchange the six-slice 
                        toaster oven.

           Evan mopes.  He was attached to that six-slice toaster oven.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        Next up...

           She puts another gift on the table.  It is:

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        ...the banana hammock.  I don’t think 
                        there’s much of an argument here.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh, no question.  Keep it.

                                 MARCY
                             (rubs temples)
                        Evan...

                                 EVAN
                        Baby, where am I supposed to put my 
                        bananas!?

                                 MARCY
                        You don’t even like bananas!

                                 EVAN
                        Surely you jest!  

                                 MARCY
                        You buy a bunch of like eight 
                        bananas, eat one, and then let the 
                        rest rot for three weeks before I 
                        finally throw them out!

                                 EVAN
                             (seriously debating here)
                        It’s not just for bananas, it can be 
                        any kind of fruit hammock!  I can put 
                        my grapes in it, if I want.

                                 MARCY
                        Stop being immature.

                                 EVAN
                             (sits back, aghast)
                        I am trying to keep us ahead of the 
                        fruit storage curve here, Marcy, and 
                        personally I think that you noting 
                        the grapes in the banana hammock 
                        innuendo makes YOU immature.

           RINGTONE.  A preposterous pop song that any person over 14 
           years old should be ashamed to have on his phone.
           Evan’s cheeks go red as Marcy twists her face into a scowl.

           Evan answers his phone, speaks in whispers.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        Hey...I can’t right now.  It doesn’t 
                        matter what I’m doing, I just can’t.  
                        Like, “emergency emergency” or 
                        “toilet-clogged emergency?”  Really? 
                             (looks at Marcy)
                        Fine, I’ll meet you.  What do you 
                        mean you’re here?

           A car horn HONKS outside the house.

           Evan sheepishly ends the call, looks to Marcy.

                                 MARCY
                        What are your jagoff friends making 
                        you do now?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HENRY’S CAR - EVENING

           Henry drives.  Daphne’s in shotgun.  Evan’s in back.

                                 EVAN
                        Drew?  The same Drew that yelled out 
                        “Oh Daphne” during sex, and then 
                        apologized thinking that he’d called 
                        out the wrong name?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (sour)
                        Yes.  That Drew.

           Henry holds up a small digital video camera.

                                 HENRY
                        So now we’re going to crash his 
                        bachelor party and obtain evidence of 
                        what an adulterous muffhound he is.

                                 EVAN
                        Why?

                                 DAPHNE
                        To save the poor bride-to-be from 
                        making the worst mistake of her life.

                                 EVAN
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh.
                                 HENRY
                        To ruin Drew’s life.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes!  Life-ruining’s the best.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Why must you two focus on the 
                        malicious side of this?  

                                 HENRY
                        Punishing evil is just way sexier 
                        than rescuing the virtuous.

                                 EVAN
                        I agree with that, and I understand 
                        why this is an emergency, but I don’t 
                        see why you needed to bring me along.

           Daphne and Henry exchange a look.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’re part of the team.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, just because you got married 
                        doesn’t mean you’re free from your 
                        obligations to the team.

                                 EVAN
                        Fine.  But you two owe me a banana 
                        hammock.  And Williams Sonoma too, 
                        not some bogus CB2 shit.

           INT. CRAZY GIRLS - NIGHT

           Men of all ages gather to watch women of one specific age 
           group dance semi-nude.  Neon lights, poles, and the general 
           sense that everything has a thin layer of filth on it.

           Daphne, Henry, & Evan enter.  A stripper walks by.

                                 STRIPPER
                        Hi Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Hi Jonine.

           Looks from Daphne and Evan.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Friend of a friend.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh my God.  There he is!
           ATTENTION ON: A roped off area where a group of young men are 
           partying most hearty.

           In the center is Drew, the ex-boyfriend/target. 

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Don’t let him see us!

           They slink over to an empty table with an angle on the 
           bachelor party.  Henry covertly pulls out the camera.

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s get some footage.

           Henry points the camera at the bachelor party.

           CAMERA POV: Strippers entertain Drew’s posse.  The posse 
           urges the strippers to pay more attention to Drew, but Drew 
           politely declines.  Not ideal blackmail footage.

           Daphne, Henry, & Evan watch this.

                                 EVAN
                        Does Drew have a twin brother?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, he’s not acting very scummy.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe he needs a little nudge.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s an idea.

           Henry whips out his wallet and retrieves a surprisingly large 
           wad of cash.

                                 DAPHNE 
                        Are you about to do what I think 
                        you’re about to do?

                                 HENRY
                        Do you think I’m about to buy Drew at 
                        least a handjob in the back room?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’re such a good friend.  Really, I 
                        mean that.  From the heart.  

                                 HENRY
                        How does Drew feel about Asians?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Two of the eight girls that he 
                        cheated on me with were Asian.

           Henry flags down SUKI (21), an Asian stripper.
                                 HENRY 
                        Hi.  Our friend is over there, and we 
                        wanted to comp him for the “deluxe 
                        package.”  How about one thousand, 
                        including tip?

           Suki looks to Drew, back to Henry.

                                 SUKI
                        No problem, sweetie.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s a surprise, so just don’t let 
                        him know we paid for it.

           Suki shoots him a wink, tucks the cash, and walks away.

           Henry re-aims the video camera, while Daphne & Evan lean 
           forward, enthralled.

           CAMERA POV: Suki parts Drew’s posse like the red sea, 
           dripping sex the entire way.

           CAMERA POV: She puts one leg over Drew’s lap and runs her 
           hands behind his neck.  She whispers something in his ear.

           Daphne, Henry, & Evan are on the edge of their seats.

           CAMERA POV: Drew gently removes Suki’s hands from his neck, 
           smiles and shakes his head.  She tugs at his shirt, really 
           pressing the issue.  He doesn’t give in, and instead urges 
           her to sit down next to him.

           Daphne, Henry, & Evan now just look confused.

           CAMERA POV: Drew speaks to Suki.  It looks like he’s having a 
           heart-to-heart with her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What the hell is going on!?

           Suki hugs Drew.  Stands up and walks away.

           She approaches their table with fire in her eyes.

           WHACK!  She SLAPS Henry across the face.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Whoa!

                                 SUKI
                        You want one too!?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No no, no thank you.
                                 SUKI
                        You people are sick!  Telling me to 
                        go deluxe on that wonderful man who’s 
                        a week away from marrying his true 
                        love!  You should be ashamed!

           Suki storms off.  As she does we barely hear her say:

                                 SUKI (cont’d)
                        I’m joining Charm.com!

           The shock of the moment slowly wears off.  As it does, Henry 
           and Evan look to Daphne: what else can we do?

           Fed-up, Daphne stands up and stomps across the club.

           She BULLS her way through Drew’s posse and gets in his face.  
           Hoping for a good zinger, all she manages is:

                                 DAPHNE
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!

                                 DREW
                        Daphne!?

                                 DAPHNE
                        A year ago I was waiting for you to 
                        propose, and then I wake up from my 
                        appendectomy to find you screwing the 
                        anesthesiologist in recovery room!

                                 DREW
                        I’m sorry!  She said you were going 
                        to be under for another half hour!

                                 DAPHNE
                        You were cocky enough to think you 
                        could get away with it while I was in 
                        the same room, and now you’re turning 
                        down free Asian HJs in a strip club!? 

                                 DREW
                        Also, what are you doing here?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You born again!?  Scientologist!?  
                        Her dad give you a job!?  Green card?  
                        What’s different!?  TELL ME!!

           Daphne looks insane.  Drew looks...sympathetic.

                                 DREW
                        Nothing’s different, Daph.  I just 
                        met the right girl.

                                 DAPHNE
                        On a God damn dating site!?
                                 DREW
                        Kinda lame, but yeah.  Initially I 
                        signed up to get tail, but my first 
                        match was Stacy.   She’s the one.
                             (pause)
                        I don’t know how else to say it.  I 
                        just couldn’t be happier.

           Daphne softens.  The pettiness of her master plan washes over 
           her, mostly because it didn’t go the way she intended.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Wow.   

                                 YOUNG COP (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, ma’am.

           Daphne turns to see a YOUNG COP behind her.

                                 YOUNG COP (cont’d)
                        You’re under arrest for soliciting 
                        prostitution.

           He SLAPS some handcuffs on her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What!?

           Daphne looks over the Young Cop’s shoulder.

           Henry & Evan are also handcuffed.  Behind them a very 
           satisfied Suki looks on.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        How did you get here so fast?

           ATTENTION ON: A group of older COPS enjoying some special 
           treatment in a booth across the club.  Looks like they “got 
           here” a long time ago.

                                 OLDER COP
                        Have fun at the station, Rook!

           Clearly annoyed, Young Cop ushers Daphne away.

                                 DREW
                        Daphne!
                             (she turns)
                        I’m sorry for everything I did.  You 
                        deserve much better than what I was.

           Daphne doesn’t know whether to cry or scream.
           INT. POLICE STATION/OVERNIGHT CELL - NIGHT

           Daphne sits on a bench next to a HOOKER (30s) that appears to 
           be made up of cigarette butts, gristle, and horse hair.

           Daphne does everything she can to avoid eye contact, but the 
           Hooker is staring a hole through the side of her head.

                                 HOOKER
                        What they’d get you for, cupcake?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Soliciting prostitution.  You?

                                 HOOKER
                        Prostitution.
                             (pause)
                        We should get coffee sometime.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That sounds great.

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Stewart, Daphne!  You made bail!

                                 DAPHNE
                             (jumps up)
                        OhthankGod.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry, Daphne, and Evan exit the station.

           Marcy waits in her car.  Her face expresses a comedic amount 
           of discontent.  Evan gets into the passenger seat.

                                 EVAN
                        Hi hon.

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks so much, Marcy.  And don’t 
                        worry, I’ll pay you back for bail...

           Henry is trying to open the back door.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        ...think your child locks are on.
                             (nothing.)
                        Could you hit your child locks?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Henry and Daphne sit on the bench.  Pause.
           A bus pulls up.  The entire side of the bus displays an 
           advertisement for Charm.com.  “Find Your Forever!”

           INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Henry and Daphne enter, flip on the lights.

           Daphne mopes towards her bedroom.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey.

           She stops, turns.  Henry walks over and embraces her.

           She hugs back.  These two really care about each other.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        You want to play the “Some Kind of 
                        Wonderful” drinking game?

           Face buried in his shoulder, Daphne shakes her head “no.”

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        You want to go throw water balloons 
                        filled with cheap cologne at people 
                        waiting to get into the VIP clubs?

           Again, she shakes her head “no.”

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        You want to get a milkshake, maybe go 
                        to war?

           With her head still buried in his chest, she nods yes.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                             (patting her back)
                        Alright.

           INT. CAFE 50’S - NIGHT

           Henry and Daphne sit at a booth in this retro diner.  The 
           walls are plastered with old timey Americana.

           Each drinking a specialty milkshake, Henry and Daphne are in 
           the middle of playing the military board game Stratego.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (makes her move)
                        Attack.

                                 HENRY
                        Colonel.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Beats my Lieutenant.

           Daphne removes her piece from the board.  Pause.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Have you considered online dating?

                                 HENRY
                             (SCOFFS)
                        Online dating’s for losers.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Drew just found the love of his life 
                        on a dating website.   

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, and Drew’s a loser.  Attack.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Bomb.

                                 HENRY
                        Miner.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nice one.

           She removes her piece from the board.

                                 HENRY
                        Safe to assume that you’re 
                        considering online dating.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I need to try something different.

                                 HENRY
                        Why?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Henry, we’re not traveling in the 
                        best social circles when it comes to 
                        finding anyone serious.  All those 
                        meat market bars, come on.  Attack.

                                 HENRY
                        Marshall.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Spy.

                                 HENRY
                        God...DAMN you.

           He removes his piece from the board.
                                 DAPHNE
                        I mean, do you think that your dating 
                        life is “healthy?”

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe not healthy, but at least 
                        functional.  Entertaining.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That’s being generous.

                                 HENRY
                        And those sites are just a quick-fix 
                        for people that are scared of being 
                        alone.  Attack.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Scout.
                             (removes piece from board)
                        You know, the more you argue against 
                        this the more I think it could work. 
                        Being alone sucks.  If there really 
                        is some compatibility system that can 
                        match you with the best people from a 
                        big database, then why not take 
                        advantage of it? 

                                 HENRY
                        Daphne, it’s paying for the 
                        opportunity to date someone. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        That Charm.com commercial said the 
                        first five matches were free. 

                                 HENRY
                             (not convinced)
                        Still seems like loser shit to me.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, I’m going to do it.

                                 HENRY
                        Good luck with that.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’re going to do it with me.

                                 HENRY
                        Not a chance.

                                 DAPHNE
                        For the team!
                                 HENRY
                        I reserve my right to abstain from 
                        participating in anything that I feel 
                        will hinder the team in the long run.

           Daphne frowns.  Henry doesn’t back down.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Friendly wager?

                                 HENRY
                             (intrigued)
                        I do love a friendly wager, friend.

                                 DAPHNE
                        How about this: we go out tomorrow 
                        night.  If you can’t meet one girl 
                        that you want to take out on a date, 
                        like a REAL date, then you back me up 
                        on this online dating experiment.

                                 HENRY
                        And if I do meet a worthy girl?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Designated driver for a month.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, then.  You’re on.

           They shake hands.  Daphne makes her move in the game.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Attack.  Your flag is mine!

           Henry looks down at the board, dumbfounded.

                                 HENRY
                        Sonofabitch!  Every time!

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A decently large and fairly hip watering hole.  The place is 
           80% packed with young twenty-somethings ranging from passable 
           to pretty damn attractive.

           Moving through the crowd, past the meatheads chugging pints, 
           past the group of hot girls with the one fat friend, past the 
           hipsters playing “who has the lowest V-neck?” we find-

           -Daphne and Henry arriving at the bar.  They are both dressed 
           up, but not overdoing it. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        So we’re clear on the rules, right?
                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, simple.  Find a girl that I’m 
                        willing to go on a real date with.  

                                 DAPHNE
                        On the honor system!  No masquerading 
                        some airhead as a real contender.

                                 HENRY
                        I always adhere to the honor system.

           Daphne looks Henry over, full up and down.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’m surprised you wore that outfit 
                        with so much on the line.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s a dirty play, trying to 
                        undercut my confidence!  In fact, get 
                        out of here!  Can’t expect me work my 
                        magic with you hanging off my cuff.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Break a leg, Mindfreak.

           Daphne disappears into the fray.  As Henry surveys the scene 
           he bumps into-

           -RICK (27), a decent guy for a total douchebag.  He’ll buy 
           you a drink, but make you listen to him brag about “chowing 
           box” while you drink it.  An acquaintance that isn’t quite 
           worth the effort to break up with.

                                 RICK
                        Henry!  “Ahn-ree!”  Mon petite cheri!

           Rick gives him a pound, then an one-stiff-back-slap hug.

                                 HENRY
                        Rick.   How’s it going, man?

                                 RICK
                        Chillin’ homie, you know, doing my 
                        thing.  Good to see you out, it’s 
                        been a minute.  What’s the occasion?

                                 HENRY
                        Nothing really.

                                 RICK
                        Celebratin’?  Soul-matin’?
                             (jiggles eyebrows)
                        Procreatin’?

                                 HENRY
                        All of the above?
           Rick checks his cell phone for no reason.

                                 RICK
                        Right on.  C’mon, shots, I’m buying.

           Rick throws two fingers towards the bartender.

                                 Rick (cont’d)
                        Did I see Daphne here with you?
                             (Henry nods)
                        You gotta hook me up, man, that girl 
                        is fiiiiiiiiiine.

                                 HENRY
                        Not happening.

                                 RICK
                             (good-natured)
                        Don’t be like that, baby, I’m not 
                        asking for much.  I’ll just pop in 
                        when you guys are talking, ask to be 
                        introduced, you give me your vouch, 
                        and I’ll do the rest.

                                 HENRY
                        Sorry, man.  I’m not going to help 
                        you run a pick-up routine on Daphne.

                                 RICK
                        Henry.  C’mon, bros before hos.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, but Daphne’s the bro here.

                                 RICK
                        You’re saying I’m the ho!?

                                 HENRY
                        You’re the ho.

                                 RICK
                        That’s cold.

           The bartender brings over the two shots.

                                 HENRY
                        Sorry, bro.

           Henry pounds the shot without waiting for Rick.

           A HOT GIRL appears from the depths of the party, eyes Henry.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Hey Rick.  You going to introduce me 
                        to your friend?

           Henry gives Rick a smile, wink, and pat on the shoulder.
                                 HENRY
                        I can introduce myself.

           ACROSS THE ROOM:

           Daphne gets her drink from the bar and turns directly into- 

           -BETHANY (28).  She is Daphne’s friend....?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Bethany!

                                 BETHANY
                             (nervous)
                        Daphne.

           Daphne then notices:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Kelly...Agata...Sandra.

           Three other maybe friends sit in a booth behind Bethany.

                                 BETHANY
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’m here with my room mate Henry, 
                        what about you guys?

                                 KELLY
                             (the dumb one)
                        Just having a girls night out.

           Ouch.  Daphne wasn’t invited.

                                 BETHANY
                        We would’ve called you, but we didn’t 
                        think you’d be into it.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You didn’t think I’d be into drinking 
                        at this bar I’m at?

                                 BETHANY
                        You understand, right?

           Off Daphne - a little wounded.

           EXT. BAR - MUCH LATER

           Daphne stands by the valet.  She is looking at-

           -Henry making out with Rick’s friend.  The valet pulls up 
           with the girl’s car, and they stop kissing.
           Henry tells her to wait one minute, and walks over to Daphne.

                                 HENRY
                        I do love a friendly wager.

                                 DAPHNE
                        She really has potential, huh?

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know if she’s “the one” or 
                        anything, but there’s definitely some 
                        more investigating to be done.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (aggravated in defeat)
                        Fine.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, you know who I saw inside?  Your 
                        friend Bethany from work.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I saw her, too.  She was having a 
                        “girl’s night out.”

                                 HENRY
                        Ouch.  Maybe you should have joined 
                        that Cardio Barre class with them.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I fart in the general direction of 
                        their cardio barre.

                                 HENRY
                        Chin up, Daph.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Piss off.

           Henry gets into Rick’s friend’s car.  They pull away.

           Daphne’s left alone.  SIGH.  The valet pulls up with her car.

           INT. DAPHNE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne gets in.  She readjusts the seat and fastens her 
           seatbelt.  She’s about to put the car in drive when-

           -the passenger door OPENS.  Henry gets in.

           Long pause as Daphne stares an explanation out of him.

                                 HENRY
                             (ashamed)
                        She was playing the Black Eyed Peas 
                        in her car.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh man...repugnant.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s more of a deterrent than HPV.
                             (fastens seatbelt)
                        Well.  Sign me up, I guess.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

           Evan sits at the kitchen table, grinning his ass off.

                                 EVAN
                        Online dating?  Both of you?

           Sitting across the table, Henry & Daphne nod.  Evan LAUGHS.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        What a couple of losers!

           Henry looks to Daphne, like “see!?”

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        So what do you need me for?

                                 DAPHNE
                        To monitor the application process.

                                 HENRY
                        Daphne thinks I’m going to 
                        purposefully sabotage my own profile 
                        to ruin the entire experiment.

                                 EVAN
                        That sounds like something you’d do.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Just keep us honest.  For the team.

                                 EVAN
                        No problem.  Let’s do this.

           BEGIN “APPLICATION” MONTAGE:

           The camera remains stationary, displaying the P.O.V. of a 
           laptop placed on the kitchen table.  We cut in between Evan & 
           Henry, and Evan & Daphne filling out Charm.com’s application.

           DAPHNE & EVAN: Daphne types.  Evan clearly disagrees.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        Oh get serious.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What?
                                 EVAN
                        When was the last time you “enjoyed a 
                        candlelit dinner?”

           Daphne sulks, then deletes.

           HENRY & EVAN: Henry types.  Evan looks on.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        The last book you read was “Eat, 
                        Pray, Love?”

                                 HENRY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 EVAN
                        Have you experienced vaginal dryness 
                        since menopause kicked in?

           DAPHNE & EVAN: Daphne types.  Evan makes a noise. 

                                 DAPHNE 
                        You don’t think that my body type is 
                        athletic!?

                                 EVAN
                        I think I’d say voluptuous.  

                                 DAPHNE
                        Gross, don’t look at my 
                        voluptuousness.

           HENRY & EVAN: Henry types.  Evan stops him.

                                 EVAN
                        You don’t make that much money.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah I do.

                                 EVAN
                        No you don’t.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.  I do.

           DAPHNE & EVAN: Daphne and Evan continue to argue.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well maybe I don’t want to attract a 
                        guy that’s into “voluptuous.”

                                 EVAN 
                        You mean like every guy in the world?

           Daphne glares at him.  
           HENRY & EVAN: Evan examines Henry’s 2009 tax returns.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        Wow...WOW!
                             (looks to Henry)
                        Why do you live like this?

                                 HENRY
                        Quality of life.
                             (then:)
                        Don’t mention it to Daphne, though.

           DAPHNE & EVAN: Well...no one at the moment.  The chairs are 
           empty and all we hear is heavy BREATHING/GRUNTING.

           After a few beats, Evan stands up into frame, sweaty and out 
           of breath.  Daphne follows him a second later.

                                 EVAN
                        Just because you can do more push-ups 
                        than me doesn’t mean...

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’M PUTTING ATHLETIC!

           HENRY & EVAN:  Henry types.  Evan shakes his head, “no.”

                                 HENRY
                        But I kinda like Michael Buble.

           Evan shakes his head.  Definitive “No.”

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        Thanks guys.  This has been really 
                        reaffirming to my marriage.

           ...and he’s gone.  Henry and Daphne are left alone with their 
           laptops open, waiting for them to take the next step.

                                 DAPHNE
                        We should probably establish some 
                        ground rules for this experiment. 

                                 HENRY
                        What do you have in mind?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, I think we should go on dates 
                        simultaneously.  Moral support.

                                 HENRY
                        And then designate a rendezvous point 
                        after the dates disappoint us.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don’t like your attitude.  But I 
                        like the idea of a rendezvous point.

                                 HENRY
                        So we’ll go one date at a time all 
                        the way through the five matches.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Unless one of those matches is an 
                        actual match.

                                 HENRY
                        But if that actual match later turns 
                        out to be a dud, then we just pick up 
                        where we left off?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’re so negative.  But correct.
                             (pause)
                        Also, I think...no sex with anyone 
                        outside the experiment until we’ve 
                        exhausted all five matches.
                                 HENRY 
                        That makes sense.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (surprised)
                        Wow.  I expected you to put up more 
                        of a fight on that one.

                                 HENRY
                        Psssh, I’m a sexual camel, you’ll be 
                        clawing at the walls way before I do.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah, I’m sure.

           Pause.  They look at the laptops.

                                 HENRY
                        We should probably get started.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’m scared.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m happy to bail out.

                                 DAPHNE
                        No no, let’s do this thing.

           They each sit down at their respective laptops.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Match number one.

                                 HENRY
                        Hit it.

           They type.  Look.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Mark.

                                 HENRY
                        Jennifer.

           They continue looking.  They each concede a little.

                          DAPHNE
                                                          HENRY
           He’s kinda cute.
                                              Not bad.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - EVENING

           A city block with a decent amount of pedestrian traffic.  
           There is a new-wave Asian restaurant and a classic Italian 
           restaurant on one side of the street, and a dark, cool-
           looking piano bar across the street.

           A cab pulls up.  Henry and Daphne get out, both wearing “date 
           clothes.”  Henry pays the cabbie, who drives off.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Okay.  So you’re meeting Jennifer in 
                        new-wave Asia, and I’m meeting Mark 
                        in Italian.

                                 HENRY
                        And if everything sucks, then we meet 
                        at Piano bar afterwards.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That’s the plan.

           Pause.

                                 HENRY
                        Have I already mentioned how stupid 
                        and illogical it is for this website 
                        to promote five perfect matches when 
                        the word “perfect” blatantly implies 
                        a singularity?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You hadn’t, but I was counting down 
                        the seconds until you did.

                                 HENRY
                        Right.  See ya.

           Henry walks into the new-wave Asian restaurant.

           Daphne pulls out a pocket mirror, checks her make-up.

           Suddenly, Henry walks back out.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Jennifer must be at Italian because 
                        Mark is waiting for you in there.

           INT. NEW-WAVE ASIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           MARK (29.9) SPEAKS into his blackberry.  His hair exhibits 
           rock solid architecture and his suit exudes power.

           Daphne approaches with an open mind and a smile.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hi, Mark?

           Mark holds up his finger: “gimme a sec.”
           Daphne’s mind-door closes a little bit.

           After BARKING into his blackberry for a few more beats, Mark 
           finally hangs up.

                                 MARK
                        Sorry about that.

           He gives Daphne an unearned kiss on the cheek.

                                 MARK (cont’d)
                        Work stuff.

                                 DAPHNE
                        It’s okay.  You’re in banking, right?

                                 MARK
                        Corporate finance.  I do mergers and 
                        acquisitions.
                             (leans in, cool)
                        There was 40 million dollars hanging 
                        in the balance on that phone call.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (tries a joke)
                        40 million, that’s it?  What, is like 
                        a bait shop absorbing a worm farm?

           Mark is taken aback, and then CHUCKLES.

                                 MARK
                        Wow.  You have a lot to learn about 
                        the financial shark tank.  Don’t 
                        worry, babe, I’ll give you a little 
                        crash course over dinner.

           Daphne’s face drops.  She went searching for a sense of humor 
           and found a condescending lecture on corporate finance.

           The Host arrives with menus.

                                 HOST
                        Follow me.

           The Host leads them through the restaurant.  Daphne is 
           already checking her peripheral vision, as though she’ll find 
           some hidden escape route.

           The Host brings them to a small table in the back.

                                 MARK
                        Nope.  No, this won’t do.

                                 HOST
                        Won’t...do?
                                 MARK
                        This table.  Sticking us way in the 
                        back here?  Come on, we’re the type 
                        of clientele you want to show off.
                             (looks around)
                        What about that table?

                                 HOST
                        ...Other customers are already dining 
                        there, sir.

           Mark leans in, whispers to the Host.

                                 HOST (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry, sir.  I can’t do that.

                                 MARK
                             (exasperated SIGH)
                        Fine.  At least give us that booth.

           Host nods, leads them over to the booth.  He hands them their 
           menus and gets the hell out of there.

           Mark looks uncomfortable.  Self-conscious.

                                 MARK (cont’d)
                        This booth alright with you?
                             (Daphne shrugs)
                        Yeah, me neither.  It’s bullshit.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Totally.
                             (looks around)
                        Oh, I see a much better table opening 
                        up towards the front.

                                 MARK
                        Really?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Here, you stay put.  I’ll go take 
                        care of the host.

           Daphne stands.  She walks to the front of the restaurant...

           ...and right out the door.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A warm, cozy atmosphere with candles and everything.

           Henry sits with JENNIFER (25).  She is certainly pretty, but 
           not very opinionated and a tad stuck up.

           Henry smiles.  Jennifer sort of smiles.
                                 JENNIFER
                        So what do you do?

                                 HENRY
                        All kinds of stuff.  I play football 
                        with my friends every Saturday, I’m 
                        learning to play the banjo...

                                 JENNIFER
                        No no, I meant for work.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh.  I don’t really like to talk 
                        about work when I’m not at work.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You don’t have a job?

                                 HENRY
                        No, I have a job.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, what is it?

                                 HENRY
                        Does it matter?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Wow, you must really hate your job.

                                 HENRY
                        No I like it alright, but I spend 40-
                        50 hours a week talking about work 
                        stuff.   Let’s talk about you.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Okay.

           She says nothing.   Henry comes up blank.

                                 HENRY
                        So, what do you do for work?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh, I don’t work.

                                 HENRY
                        At all?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Nope.

                                 HENRY
                        Then...how do you make money?

                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s what you’re for.
           Henry’s face.  The waiter arrives to take their orders.

                                 WAITER
                        So, have we decided yet?

           INT. PIANO BAR - NIGHT

           Daphne sits at the bar, two sips left in her cocktail.

           She checks her iPhone for the time.  Looks around the bar.

           Daphne drains the rest of her cocktail.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Daphne wanders into the restaurant.  

           She slinks down to the dining floor, scanning the tables for:

           Henry and Jennifer, sitting off to the side.  Henry sits 
           facing Daphne while Jennifer faces the other direction.  

           They have just begun to eat when Henry looks up to find 
           Daphne in his field of vision.  Tries not to overreact.

           Daphne gives Henry a hand signal: “How’s it going?”

           Henry scratches the side of his head, miming a pistol: “Want 
           to kill self.”

           Daphne motions to herself: “Want my help?”

           Henry keeps his eyes on Jennifer, but nods emphatically.

           Daphne takes a moment to formulate a game plan, then-

           -walks right up to their table.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, but I 
                        think your car is being towed.

                                 HENRY
                             (stands up)
                        Oh my God!

                                 JENNIFER
                        Didn’t you take a cab here?

                                 HENRY
                        Oh...yeah, you’re right.  Silly me.

           Henry sits again, shooting Daphne a “You blew it!” look.
                                 JENNIFER
                             (re: her drink)
                        While you’re here, can I get another 
                        one of these?  Maybe with some 
                        alcohol in it this time?

           Daphne stares, then looks around.  Her black skirt, leggings, 
           and white top are similar to the waiters’ uniforms.

                                 DAPHNE
                        ...sure.  

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s a Manhattan.  That’s whiskey, 
                        sweet vermouth, and bitters.

                                 DAPHNE
                        ...I’ll tell the bartender.

           Daphne takes the empty drink, walks off.  Henry is loving it.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The service here is terrible.

                                 HENRY
                             (ideas brewing)
                        Yeah, it really is.

           MEANWHILE: Daphne is on her way to the bar when bald 
           restaurant patron grabs her arm.  Kind of uncool.

                                 BALD PATRON
                             (total prick)
                        I asked for a refill on water.

           Daphne stares at him.  Bald Patron’s FUGLY DATE seems 
           impressed by his assholery.

           So Daphne picks up Fugly Date’s glass of water and DUMPS it 
           into Bald Patron’s empty glass.  Fugly and Bald are stunned.

           Daphne shoots them a wink and continues to the bar.

           The bartender sees her, walks over.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I need a Manhattan for a bitch.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Say no more.

           MOMENTS LATER: Daphne returns to Henry’s table with 
           Jennifer’s Manhattan. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Here’s your drink, Miss.
                             (to Henry)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAPHNE (cont'd)
                        And if there’s nothing else, I’ll 
                        leave you two...

           Henry’s face:  If I have to be on this date, you do too.

                                 HENRY
                        Actually, and I hate to do this, but 
                        the risotto is REALLY salty and 
                        REALLY bland.  I think I’m going to 
                        have to send this back.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (pause, daring him)
                        Are you sure you want to do that?

                                 HENRY
                             (grinning)
                        Oh yeah.

           Daphne holds eyes contact with him, then picks up the dish.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Very well.  I’ll be right back.

           As Daphne moves towards the kitchen she sees:

           Bald Patron complaining to the MANAGER.

           Not wanting to get busted, Daphne ducks into-

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Steam, SIZZLING, and cooks shouting at each other. 

           Daphne makes herself small and sneaks over to the spice rack.

           After a few beats, she grabs a jar of fennel, proceeds to 
           dump a SHIT-TON into Henry’s risotto and then stirs it up.

           A line cook notices her. 

                                 LINE COOK
                        Hey, are you new?   You’re not 
                        supposed to be back here.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh, sorry, I didn’t know...

           She begins backing towards the dining room, turning just in 
           time to see The Manager heading towards the kitchen!

           Daphne’s eyes go big, and she quickly ducks out of sight.

           The Manager walks in, and she slips out behind him.
           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne, risotto in hand, returns to the table.  She places 
           the risotto in front of Henry.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Here you go, and please don’t 
                        hesitate to let me know if you need 
                        anything else.

                                 HENRY
                             (loving the role play)
                        Thanks so much.

           As Daphne departs, she spots the Manager exiting the kitchen.

           Thinking quick, Daphne scurries over to another table full of 
           diners and sits down in an empty seat.

           The diners stare at her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        How ya doin’?

           MEANWHILE:  Henry and Jennifer start to eat.

                                 HENRY
                        You were saying?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, then I thought I’d get into 
                        hand modeling because I have very 
                        sexy hands.

                                 HENRY
                             (chewing)
                        I can see...that...you...
                             (SWALLOWS)
                        ...huh.

           ON JENNIFER: Noticing his change in tone.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Everything okay?

           ON HENRY: Liquid snot is running from his nose.

                                 HENRY
                        My food tastes a little...off.

           ON JENNIFER: Noticing his snot.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Uh, you have a little...uh.

           ON HENRY: The liquid snot has now been joined by watery eyes 
           and heavy perspiration.
                                 HENRY
                        A little what?

           ON JENNIFER: Totally repulsed.

                                 JENNIFER
                        A little everything.

           ON HENRY: An instant wreck.

           AC-CHOO!  Henry SNEEZES in Jennifer’s face, extinguishing the 
           charming candles on the table.  Jennifer SQUEALS.

                                 HENRY
                             (call out)
                        MISS!  EXCUSE ME!  MISS!

           MEANWHILE: back at Daphne’s table:

                                 DAPHNE
                             (rushing)
                        ...long story short, I’m technically 
                        a priest in New Jersey.  Nice meeting 
                        you guys!

           With an eye on the manager, Daphne jumps up and saunters over 
           to Henry’s table.  He SNEEZES.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Problem?

                                 HENRY
                        Is there fennel in this?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Why yes sir, there is.

           Daphne gives Henry a non-verbal signal: “Get goin’, Hoss.”

           Henry wipes his sopping wet brow and stands up.

                                 HENRY
                        Jennifer, I’m so sorry to do this, 
                        but I have to get to a hospital in 
                        the next hour.  I’ll call...AC-CHOO!

           Henry pulls out his wallet, throws down some cash for the 
           bill, and then STUMBLES towards the exit.

           Jennifer and Daphne are left alone.  Pause.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Thank God, that guy was SUCH a loser.

           Daphne glares at Jennifer, then looks to the cash.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Cheap too.  He’s $20 short, not to 
                        mention gratuity.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Uck.  Figures.

           Jennifer reaches into her purse, pulls out a twenty dollar 
           bill and a ten dollar bill.

                                 JENNIFER (cont’d)
                        Can I get change for the ten?

           Daphne notices the Manager approaching her.  Pissed.

           Daphne SNATCHES Jennifer’s money and bolts.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nope, sorry!

           Daphne JUKES another server and escapes unscathed.

           INT. PIANO BAR - NIGHT

           Henry sits at a booth, squirting medicine up his nose.

           Daphne enters and joins him.  Shit-eating grin.

                                 HENRY
                        Really, dude?  Fennel?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Really dude, “My risotto is too bland 
                        AND too salty?”
                             (Henry SNEEZES)
                        You gonna be alright?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, another half hour maybe.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (pulls out some cash)
                        First round’s on Jennifer.

           INT. PIANO BAR - LATER

           Fingers dance across the ebonies and ivories, PLAYING a slow, 
           soft melody that sounds kind of familiar.

           PULL BACK to reveal that Henry is the pianist.  He is tipsy, 
           but playing with an enchanting drunken passion.

           Henry only knows how to play one song on the piano, but he 
           sure loves to play it.
           He sways a little, continuing to play.  What IS that song 
           he’s playing?  The melody is familiar, but the tempo is 
           slowed down.  An upbeat tune played as a ballad.  Then-

           -Daphne leans into frame.  She is sitting on the piano bench 
           next to Henry, also tipsy.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (singing soft and slow)
                        I won’t let you doooooooown.  I will 
                        not give you uuuuuuuuuup.  Gotta have 
                        some faith in the sooooooound.  It’s 
                        the one good thing that I’ve...

                                 HENRY
                        Got.

           Daphne picks up the pace and Henry follows on the keys.

           As the tempo picks up, it becomes clear that they are giving 
           us a heartfelt rendition of George Michael’s “Freedom.”

                                 DAPHNE
                        I won’t let you dooooooooown.  So 
                        please don’t give me uuuuuuuuuup.  
                        Because I would really, really 
                        love...to stick around!

                                 HENRY
                        OH YEAH!

           Henry and Daphne SPRING UP from their seats as Henry KICKS 
           the piano bench over backwards.  He POUNDS the piano keys, 
           finally playing George Michael’s “Freedom” at it’s proper 
           tempo as Daphne dances.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PIANO BAR - LATER

           A street performer stands on the corner, PLAYING “Freedom” on 
           his guitar.  The guitar case is open, accepting donations.

           Henry and Daphne bolt out of the bar, running into and then 
           out of the frame, past the street performer.  They can’t walk 
           a straight line, let alone run one.

           Pause.  Henry and Daphne rush back into frame, drop a few 
           bills into the guitar case, and quickly turn around.

           This time we follow them down the street, where a Kogi Truck 
           (suped up Korean BBQ truck) is pulling away from the curb.

                           HENRY
                                                         DAPHNE
           Wait!  WAIT!  STOP!
                                              Hold on!  DON’T GO!
           The truck doesn’t wait for them, so they stop running, hands 
           on their knees gasping for breath.

                                 HENRY
                        Damn it!  I want those sliders!

           Daphne whips out her iphone.  Does some research.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Abbott Kinney in forty five minutes.

                                 HENRY
                        Think we can make it?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (super serious)
                        I don’t think we can, Henry...I know 
                        we can.

           Henry nods, confidence growing.  They hail a cab.  “Freedom” 
           continues to PLAY, its source is now the cab’s radio.

           EXT. ABBOTT KINNEY - LATER

           The Kogi Truck has parked and is opening for business.

           The cab SCREECHES around the corner, GUNS IT for the truck.

           INT. CAB (PARKED) - LATER

           “Freedom” is still BLASTING on the radio.

           Henry and Daphne are in the back seat, and JORGE (50s), the 
           cab driver, is in the front seat.

                                 HENRY
                        GO GO GO GO GO GO!  

           Daphne and Jorge are going head to head in a BBQ slider-
           eating competition.  Just knockin’ ‘em back.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        C’MON DAPH, PICK UP THE PACE!

           Jorge CRAMS the last slider into his mouth, CHUGS his entire 
           soda, and SLAMS the cup down in victory.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        OOOH!  Pathetic.  Horrible showing.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (gasping)
                        Shut up, I could take you any day.
                                 JORGE
                        ARGH!  Brain freeze!

                                 HENRY
                        You’re the man, Jorge!

           INT. DAPHNE AND HENRY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           ON TV: Daphne and Henry’s ROCKBAND Avatars “Daphne and the 
           Henrys” are being booed off the stage as the final chords of 
           “Freedom” eek out of the game.

           Reveal: Daphne and Henry themselves are passed out on the 
           couch, holding an XBOX mic and a guitar respectively.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - MORNING

           Daphne is up, making coffee.  Henry staggers in.  Both are 
           dressed business casual for work.

                                 DAPHNE
                        How you feeling?

                                 HENRY
                        Rough.  You?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Same.  And I have to get on the phone 
                        with my boss and like five potential 
                        advertisers in an hour.

                                 HENRY
                        Make sure you consolidate the 
                        collective synergy.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Don’t worry, I’ve got some pre-
                        buttals ready in case they try to 
                        macro-manage my cost containment.

                                 HENRY
                        You can always give ‘em the ol turkey 
                        trot.  And if you think you’re gonna 
                        ralph, just try to visualize your 
                        post-modern beachside stilt house.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Only 344 paychecks to go.

           A few hung over CHUCKLES as they each pour coffee.  Drink.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                             (casual)
                        Know what’s funny?  You tried to make 
                        out with me last night.
           Henry almost spit-takes.  More of a drool/dribble-take.

                                 HENRY
                        No way!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Scout’s honor.

                                 HENRY
                        You’re flattering yourself!

                                 DAPHNE
                        In the bathroom line.  You gave me 
                        “the look” and then hit me with full-
                        blown “man voice.”

                                 HENRY
                             (horrified)
                        There was NO “man voice!”

           Daphne shifts into her VERY accurate impression of a man 
           trying to sound sexy, but actually sounding skeevy and weird.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You know Daph, I think that you’re a 
                        stone-cold stunner in that skirt... 

                                 HENRY
                             (nails on a chalkboard)
                        Stop!  Stop it!  You win!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Assume the position.

                                 HENRY
                        Aw man, really?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I took the punishment when I tried to 
                        make out with you at my birthday, no 
                        chance you’re getting away clean.

                                 HENRY
                             (relents)
                        Fine.

           Daphne OPENS the refrigerator and retrieves an egg. 

           Henry winces.  Waits.

           SPLAT!  Daphne SMASHES the egg onto Henry’s forehead.

           Henry stands there as yolk and shell drip down his face.

           Grinning, Daphne pulls out her iphone.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Say it.

                                 HENRY
                        Egg on my face.

           CLICK.  Daphne takes a picture.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Fantastic.

           Henry goes to the sink, washes off his face.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        So, I did a little thinking about 
                        this experiment.

                                 HENRY
                        Are we giving up?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Stop asking that.  We’re not giving 
                        up, this is going to happen to the 
                        bitter end.  I’m finding what Drew 
                        found, so help me God!

                                 HENRY
                        Sheesh.  Fine.  

                                 DAPHNE
                        But I was thinking, maybe our first 
                        date approach was too orthodox.

                                 HENRY
                        A dinner date is about as bland as it 
                        can get.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Exactly.  So much pressure to be 
                        liked and like the other person, it’s 
                        damn near impossible to be yourself.

                                 HENRY
                        So you’re thinking of going for an 
                        activity date?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (nodding)
                        An Activi-date.

                                 HENRY
                        Even if you dislike the person 
                        there’s something else to do.

                                 DAPHNE
                        The question is, what kind of 
                        activity would be best?
                                 HENRY
                        Firing guns.

                                 DAPHNE
                        No.  Well, yes, but no.  I was 
                        thinking more like surfing lessons.

                                 HENRY
                        I picture myself becoming exhausted 
                        and pissed off.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Miniature Golf?

                                 HENRY
                        Lame, but getting warmer.

           Daphne notices the light blinking on their home phone’s 
           answering machine.  She presses play.

                                 EVAN (V.O.)
                        Yo.  Marcy and I are checking out the 
                        Orange County fair next weekend, 
                        thought you’d want in.  Three words: 
                        World’s Largest Horse.

           BEEP!  Henry and Daphne look at each other.

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/HORSE TENT - DAY

           A big horse in a tragically small pen.  

           Reverse angle, Henry and Daphne stare at it.  Pause.

                                 HENRY
                        I mean, it’s pretty big.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I guess.  But world’s largest?

                                 HENRY
                        Not a chance.

                                 DAPHNE
                        They should really have a government 
                        agency that investigates “World’s 
                        Largest” claims.

                                 HENRY
                        They just go around the world, 
                        measuring horses?
                                 DAPHNE
                        I guarantee that the real World’s 
                        Largest horse is wandering the hills 
                        of Scotland or something.  Not even 
                        aware that he’s in the competition.

                                 HENRY
                        Sure.  The dark horse.

           Ba dum bum ching.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne and Henry exit the horse tent.

           The fair is everything you’d expect: rides, clowns, games, 
           fried treats, carnies, livestock, BBQ, and tons of people.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Where you meeting Alexis?

                                 HENRY
                        By the Zipper.  What about Todd?

                                 DAPHNE
                        At the Gravitron.  

                                 HENRY
                        Our rendezvous point is the Pirate 
                        Ship, right?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yup.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright.  Let’s fall in love.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/GRAVITRON - MOMENTS LATER

           Daphne searches the crowd until she spots-

           -TODD (27).  Todd is kind of a beefcake.  Good looking, but a 
           bit too aware of how his shirt sleeves show off his biceps.

                                 TODD
                        Daphne!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hi!  Todd, nice to meet you.

                                 TODD
                        Nice to meet you, too.

           They shake hands, polite.  Tiny awkward pause, then-
                                 TODD (cont’d)
                             (re: the Gravitron)
                        I say we get right to it.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hell yeah!

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/ZIPPER - SAME

           Henry finds ALEXIS (26) in the crowd.  She is attractive with 
           soft, girly features.  It’s almost a surprise that there 
           isn’t a tiny dog poking out of her purse.

                                 HENRY
                        Alexis.  Hi, how are you?

                                 ALEXIS
                        I’m good, nice to meet you.

                                 HENRY
                             (the up and down)
                        You look very pretty.

                                 ALEXIS
                             (manufactured bashfulness)
                        Oh...migosh, thank you.  So sweet.

                                 HENRY
                        What do you want to do first?  I’m 
                        obviously partial to the Zipper.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Oh no.  No no no, way too scary.

                                 HENRY
                        C’moooon, I’ll hold your hand.

                                 ALEXIS
                             (ends it)
                        No.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, what about the roller coaster?

                                 ALEXIS
                        That’s scary too!  Plus it’ll make my 
                        hair look like bride of Frankenstein.
                        Let’s go on the Ferris Wheel.

           INT. THE GRAVITRON - DAY

           Daphne and Todd are being whirled around at vomit-inducing 
           speeds.  They both SCREAM in delight.
           INT. THE FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

           Henry and Alexis sit in their seats as the hydraulics slowly 
           lift them up above the fair.

           Sounds of people SQUEALING and CHEERING rise from below, 
           reminding Henry of better rides.  The Ferris Wheel sucks.

           After a long, long, loooooong pause:

                                 HENRY
                        Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

           INT. THE ZIPPER - DAY

           Daphne and Todd are now strapped into that claustrophobic 
           cage being tossed up in the air while also being spun around 
           individually.  They are having a total fucking blast.

           INT. THE FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

           Henry and Alexis continue their slow ride.

                                 ALEXIS
                        So, you live with a girl...but you 
                        guys aren’t dating?

                                 HENRY
                             (suppressing a yawn)
                        Yeah, that’s right.

           INT. THE ZIPPER - DAY

           The ride has stopped, and Daphne and Todd are waiting their 
           turn to be let out of the cage.

                                 TODD
                        Isn’t that kinda weird?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Not at all.  At least, not for us.  
                        Henry’s a great roommate.

           INT. THE FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

           Alexis is now somewhat annoyed.  Suspicious.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Is she pretty?

                                 HENRY
                        Daphne?  Sure, I guess.
                                 ALEXIS
                        So, does she, like, walk around in 
                        her underwear?

           INT. THE ZIPPER - DAY

           Daphne and Todd continue their conversation. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        I once walked in on him jerking off, 
                        but it was more funny than 
                        uncomfortable.  He was watching this 
                        Shakespearean porno.

                                 TODD
                        “A Midsummer Night’s Cream?”

                                 DAPHNE
                        “MacBreast,” actually.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

           Henry and Alexis exit the Ferris Wheel.

                                 ALEXIS
                        That was FUN!

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, it was.

                                 ALEXIS
                        And scary, right?

                                 HENRY
                             (pause)
                        Right.  What next?  Teacups?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Those are too intense.

                                 HENRY
                        The teacups are too intense!?
                             (sighs)
                        Well, let’s get some food.  I saw a 
                        deep-fried Oreo stand over there.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Oh no, that stuff is so fattening!

                                 HENRY
                        Deep-fried Snickers?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Is that a joke?
                                 HENRY
                        Well, if you don’t want to go on any 
                        rides and you don’t want any 
                        delicious carnival food...?

           Alexis stops, spotting one of those caricature artists that 
           draws a huge head version of you on roller skates or playing 
           football or something corny like that.  She SQUEALS.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Oooo, I want a caricature!

           Henry deflates.  Soooooooooooooo boring.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/THE ZIPPER - DAY

           Daphne & Todd exit the ride.  Daphne’s hair looks a little 
           like bride of Frankenstein.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Okay, I need a short break.

                                 TODD
                        Me too, stomach’s churning.  You want 
                        to go see the World’s Largest horse?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Save your dollar.  Let’s get some 
                        fried junk to eat.

                                 TODD
                        All those empty calories?  Can’t let 
                        you do it.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (...waitaminute)
                        ...What are you saying, Todd?

                                 TODD
                        Daphne, your body is a temple.   Are 
                        you going to let it crumble with age?

           Daphne doesn’t know where to begin being offended.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Alright, Adonis.  Let’s see who’s 
                        worshipping at your altar.

           Daphne points to The High Striker (that thing where you use a 
           giant hammer to ring the bell on top).

                                 TODD
                        Oh, it’s on.

           They walk over to The High Striker where a Carnie SHOUTS OUT 
           his sales pitch.
                                 CARNIE
                        Step on up, you got one shot to be 
                        top notch!  Give it a rise, you just 
                        may win a prize!  Top ten feet gets 
                        you a taste, ring the bell and you 
                        get the whole meal! 

           Daphne notices a huge stuffed gorilla.  “The whole meal.”

                                 DAPHNE
                        That monkey’s kinda great.

                                 TODD
                             (trying to sound heroic)
                        Say no more, babe.

           Todd pulls out some money, pays the Carnie.

                                 CARNIE
                        Alright, sir.  You’re our next 
                        slammer, so pick up the hammer. 

           Todd picks up the hammer, gauges its weight.

           He steps up to the target.  Deep breath.  He SWINGS and-

           -BOINK!  The puck rises up, but not nearly far enough.  It 
           doesn’t even reach the top ten feet.

                                 CARNIE (cont’d)
                        So VERY close, sir.  Care to give it 
                        another whirl?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Don’t waste your money, these things 
                        are all rigged.

                                 TODD
                        No, I’m going to win you that monkey.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I really don’t need that monkey.

                                 TODD
                             (adamant)
                        I-am-going-to-win-you-that-monkey!

           Daphne doesn’t like where this is going.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/CARICATURE ARTIST - SAME

           Alexis sits perfectly still as the artist continually looks 
           from her back to his easel back to her.

           Henry stands behind the artist.  Watching.  Bored.
                                 ALEXIS
                        Isn’t this fun?

                                 HENRY
                        Mmm-hm.

                                 CARICATURE ARTIST
                        Please don’t talk.  And sit still.

           Henry SIGHS.  Looks around.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, I’m going to grab a bite to eat.  
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Okay.

                                 CARICATURE ARTIST
                        What did I just tell you!?

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/HIGH STRIKER - SAME

           Todd, now sweaty, SWINGS again and-

           -BOINK!  Another failure.  He is infuriated.

                                 TODD
                        DAMN IT!

           Daphne stands behind him, arms crossed.  She’s tired of this.

                                 TODD (cont’d)
                        One more time.

                                 DAPHNE
                        It’s REALLY okay...

                                 TODD
                        No no, I got this.  Just need to warm 
                        up, get the blood pumping.

           Todd drops and fires off twenty push-ups.  He then SHAKES OUT 
           his arms and neck before paying the Carnie for another go.

                                 TODD (cont’d)
                        See, I’ve got the strength, but the 
                        problem was I didn’t have enough 
                        momentum behind my swing.
                             (picks up the hammer)
                        I need to get all Olympian on this.

           Todd begins SWINGING the hammer in circles, like the hammer 
           throw in the Olympics except on a vertical axis.

           Daphne steps back.  This looks dangerous.
           With SERIOUS momentum going, Todd steps forward to bring the 
           hammer down on the target.  Just as he does we hear:

           C-CRACK!

           Todd releases the giant hammer mid-swing and crumples to the 
           ground in an unnaturally twisted angle.  He’s in pain.

                                 TODD (cont’d)
                        AH!  MY BACK!

           FOLLOW: The giant hammer.  It soars throw the air above the 
           carnival.  Time slows down.

           The giant hammer begins its descent from flight, spinning end 
           over end until-

           -CRUNCH!  The hammer head DEMOLISHES a padlock that’s holding 
           a black metal gate shut.  

           PULLING BACK we find:

           A carnival-style painting of the “World’s Largest Horse.”    

           CREEEEEEEAK.  The back gate of the horse cage has swung open! 

           The World’s Largest Horse pokes its head out of the cage, 
           intrigued by this path to freedom.

           The TRAINER rushes up with a nasty looking whip, blocking the 
           path to freedom.

                                 TRAINER
                        Hey!  Stay there!  Stay!

           HORSE-VISION:  His captor.  The man who locked him up in that 
           tiny cage for months on end.

           Nostrils FLARE.

           The horse WHINNIES and BOLTS out of the cage-

           -KNOCKING the Trainer on his ass and possibly unconscious.

           One ton of equine fury CHARGES into the carnival!

           Total mayhem.  People run in every direction as the hulking 
           horse-beast TEARS through the fairgrounds.

           Henry stands at the deep-fried Snickers stand, paying for the 
           treat that he’s been craving so much.

           He hears the sounds of chaos around him.  Turns to see-

           -The World’s Largest Horse BARRELING towards him!
           Henry’s eyes are like dinner plates.

           Thinking as quick as he can, Henry vaults over the counter 
           and into the deep-fried Snickers stand.

           An instant later, the horse THUNDERS past the stand.

           Further down the road, we find Alexis.  She is still sitting 
           perfectly still as the artist touches up her caricature.

           At the moment, she is totally unaware that the horse is 
           GALLOPING right towards her.

           The artist sees it, drops his pen, and runs like hell.

                                 ALEXIS
                             (perfectly still)
                        Does this mean your done?

           The horse closes the distance.

           Alexis finally turns around, just as the horse is about to 
           leap over her.  Before Alexis can scream we:

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. AMBULANCE - LATER

           Todd lies on a stretcher, strapped in for a back injury.  Now 
           he’s the one being perfectly still.

           An EMT helps Alexis into the ambulance.  The front of her 
           shirt is covered in blood and she’s holding a humongous ice 
           pack against her nose.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Oh my God, my face!

           Todd tilts his neck to see her.  Interest piqued.

                                 TODD
                        Hey.

           Alexis turns to him, keeping the ice pack up.

                                 TODD (cont’d)
                        It’ll be okay.

           He extends his hand as much as he can.  She takes it.
           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY FAIR/PARKING LOT - LATER

           Henry and Daphne eat a deep-fried Snickers and a deep-fried 
           Oreo respectively, watching as two EMTs close the rear doors 
           to the ambulance. 

           Behind them, several carnies carrying lassos and restraint 
           poles spread out, searching for the escaped horse.

           Henry and Daphne just stand there, chewing.  Long pause.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I dunno.  She seemed really sweet and 
                        understanding when they were 
                        resetting her nose.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, she did actually.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Sure there’s no potential there?

                                 HENRY
                        She just got Marcia-Bradyed by the 
                        world’s largest horse penis.  I’m not 
                        a superficial guy, but it’s hard to 
                        imagine French-kissing her now.

           Evan and Marcy skip into the scene, super happy.  Evan is 
           holding the elusive giant stuffed gorilla.

                                 EVAN
                        Hold this, would ya?

           Evan shoves the gorilla into Henry’s hand.

                                 MARCY
                        We’ll be back after a third go-round 
                        on the Zipper.

           Marcy hangs her purse over Daphne’s neck.  Disrespect.

           Henry and Daphne stare daggers at Evan.  He winks.

                                 EVAN
                        C’mon, for the team.

           Evan and Marcy rush off to the Zipper, leaving Henry and 
           Daphne looking sour and dissatisfied.

                                 HENRY
                        He can be a real shitty teammate.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Practically useless.
           INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Daphne and Henry laze out on the couch watching TV after a 
           long day of carnivaling.  Daphne appears fidgety.

                                 HENRY
                        You okay dude?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh my god, I need to stop thinking 
                        about sex.  Like right now.

                                 HENRY
                        I knew you’d break before I did.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Near death experiences always get me 
                        in the mood.

                                 HENRY
                        I was the one who had to take cover 
                        behind the fried snickers, so it was 
                        really MY near death experience.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Fine, it was more of a near-near 
                        death experience.

                                 HENRY
                        No, you were just near my near death 
                        experience.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Whatever, I’m horny.

                                 HENRY 
                             (shrugs)
                        Go take care of yourself.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah, probably later.
                             (turns to him)
                        By the way, male gender, it’s 
                        pathetic how long it takes you to 
                        coax an orgasm compared to how long 
                        it takes us to do it ourselves.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s your fault, female gender.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Our fault!?

           Henry acts out the following speech with specific, almost 
           “too real” hand gestures.
                                 HENRY
                        My experience has been that you reach 
                        down there and prep the area with 
                        some general coverage.  Then you find 
                        the spot and establish a rhythm, 
                        responding to both positive and 
                        negative reinforcement.  I think that 
                        you can agree, “rhythm is paramount.”

                                 DAPHNE
                        I can, but you need to stop with the 
                        hands.  You’re skeeving me out.

           Henry presses on, hands and all.

                                 HENRY
                        Now the problem arises once that 
                        rhythm has been found.  Because I’ll 
                        be working my rhythm, and as I draw 
                        closer to accomplishing the mutual 
                        goal, you, female gender, move. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Move?

           Henry bucks his hips up into the air.

                                 HENRY
                        Move!  You flail suddenly, hurling me 
                        right off of the spot and demolishing 
                        any sense of rhythm!  So I once again 
                        have to locate the spot, re-establish 
                        rhythm, and start all over again.

                                 DAPHNE
                        So it’s our fault because we move?

                                 HENRY
                        In comparison to you doing it 
                        yourself, you can anticipate all the 
                        oncoming lurches of passion.  So 
                        yeah, it’s definitely your fault.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, what about all of your spastic 
                        movements, male gender, that come 
                        when I’m returning the favor?

                                 HENRY
                        Those’re insignificant.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What!?  
                                 HENRY
                        Daph, when a girl is working on me, 
                        she’s not responsible for keeping 
                        track of an erogenous zone that’s 
                        this big!

           Henry holds up his fingers to display the size of your 
           average clitoris.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (relishes the chance for:)
                        That’s not what I heard.

           Henry is annoyed that she nailed him with that easy zinger.

                                 HENRY
                        Walked right into that one, huh?

           INT. THE APARTMENT - LATER

           Henry walks towards his room past Daphne’s closed door.  He 
           stops when her hears-

           -the distinct WHIRRING of a “vibrating device” in action. 

           Henry smirks.  Then:

                                 HENRY
                             (calling out)
                        Get a new electric toothbrush, D!?

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        STOP LISTENING!!!!

           Henry CRACKS UP and moves on.  Pause.

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        GOD DAMN IT, YOU RUINED THE ILLUSION!

           INT. CAFE 50’S - NIGHT

           Henry and Daphne are engaged in another game of Stratego, 
           each of them with their own specialty milkshake.

                                 HENRY
                             (makes his move)
                        Attack.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Major.

                                 HENRY
                        Colonel.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Shit.

           She removes her piece from the board.

                                 HENRY
                        I was thinking about what you said 
                        last night.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What, that I shouldn’t move when I’m 
                        having an orgasm?

                                 HENRY
                        No.  And I never said that.  I was 
                        referring to you wanting to get laid.  
                        Truth be told, I could go for a 
                        little comfort myself.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Camel needs a hump, huh?

                                 HENRY
                        Well, we agreed not to sleep with 
                        anyone outside of the experiment, so 
                        I was thinking...for our next match, 
                        why don’t we make it our objective to 
                        have sex on the first date?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Doesn’t that go against what we’re 
                        trying to do here?  Attack.

                                 HENRY
                        Scout.
                             (removes his piece)
                        There is that argument, but going 
                        into a first date trying to determine 
                        whether or not that person is “the 
                        one” is really stressful.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That’s true.

                                 HENRY
                        And sexual chemistry is an important 
                        part of any relationship.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (starting to buy in)
                        It’s not like we haven’t each had sex 
                        on a first date before.

                                 HENRY
                        Exactly.  We try a new approach, and 
                        at the very worst we get to satisfy 
                        an urge or two.
                                 DAPHNE
                             (too loud)
                        We should totally have sex with them!

           A hush falls over the restaurant.  A few partons turn an eye 
           towards Henry and Daphne.

                                 HENRY
                        Want to repeat that?  I don’t think 
                        those people in the back heard you.

           Daphne stands up, walks over to “those people in the back.”

           They look up at her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I said, “We should totally have sex 
                        with them.”

           She returns to her booth where Henry is LAUGHING.  HIGH-FIVE.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Henry and his date ERICA (28) SLAM against the wall.  They 
           are MAKING OUT hardcore.  It is frenzied.

           They make out, and make out some more.  Suddenly, Erica pulls 
           away, DEEP BREATH.

                                 ERICA
                        Wait wait wait...

           Pause.  She presses the button for her floor.

           DING.  They begin tongue fighting again.

           INT. MORGAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door SWINGS open, revealing Daphne and her date MORGAN 
           (29) similarly locked at the lips.

           Morgan KICKS the door closed and they move, as a unit, 
           towards his bedroom.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Henry and Erica are having sex.  Erica is responding as 
           though God himself were fucking her.

                                 ERICA
                        OHMIGOD, YES!  YES!  OH, MORE!  
                        HARDER!  FASTER!  YES!  YOU’RE 
                        INCREDIBLE, OHMIGOD!  AHHHHH!  
                        YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
           Henry is getting a little freaked out by this overwhelming 
           positive reinforcement.

           INT. MORGAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Daphne and Morgan are having sex, Daphne on top.

           In stark contrast to Erica’s bedroom, this one is ABSOLUTELY 
           QUIET, save for a few bedsprings SQUEAKING.

           Morgan lies beneath Daphne, perfectly still.  His facial 
           expression appears to be blank.  Daphne is unnerved.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Are...you okay?

                                 MORGAN
                        Amazing.

           Weird.  The utter lack of movement from Morgan inspires:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Can we switch positions?

                                 MORGAN
                        I’d LOVE to.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Henry and Erica continue to have sex, and Erica continues to 
           belt it out to the back row.

                                 ERICA
                        YES!  OHMIGOD YOU’RE SO GOOD, YOU’RE 
                        SO HOT, MORE MORE MORE!!

           Henry decides to try something.  He stops.  Does nothing.

                                 ERICA (cont’d)
                        OHMIGOD YEEEEESSSS!  SPANK ME!

           Henry rolls his eyes.  Gives her a half-hearted SPANK.

                                 ERICA (cont’d)
                        OH HENRY!  OH HENRY!  OH HENRY!

                                 HENRY
                             (timidly)
                        Erica?

                                 ERICA
                        OH HENRY!

                                 HENRY
                        Erica?  Excuse me!?
           Suddenly she stops everything she’s doing.

                                 ERICA
                        What?

                                 HENRY
                        Please don’t say my name like that.  
                        All I can think of is the candy bar.

                                 ERICA
                        Shut up and spank me, candy boy!

           INT. MORGAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They’ve switched positions, and Daphne’s now on the bottom.

           Remarkably, Morgan is just as mummified on the top.  He goes 
           about his business in a manner that is rigid and silent.

           Daphne appears pretty bored on the bottom.  She looks left, 
           looks right, semi-successfully hides a yawn.

           Suddenly Morgan dismounts and lies down next to her.

           It takes Daphne a second, but then she realizes:

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’re finished?

                                 MORGAN
                        Baby...that might be the best sex of 
                        my entire life.

           Daphne’s face: Really?

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Henry and Daphne are at the Nautilus machines.  Daphne is 
           doing leg presses.  Henry is doing curls with the barbell 
           that’s attached via cable to the weights.

                                 DAPHNE
                        So she was faking?

                                 HENRY
                        No, no she was not faking!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Sounds like she was faking, pal.

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe she was, but how am I supposed 
                        to tell what’s real and what’s fake 
                        when she’s performing a God damn 
                        Broadway musical on my Johnson?
                                 DAPHNE
                        I thought guys liked all that noise.

                                 HENRY
                        We do, but there’s a limit.  Nothing 
                        in the world would make me as 
                        animated as she was.  Winning the 
                        lottery on my birthday wouldn’t make 
                        me bug out like that.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You’d appreciate a little subtlety?

                                 HENRY
                        Something below porn star on PCP 
                        would be nice.  I mean, I think I’m 
                        good, but I’m not THAT good.

                                 DAPHNE
                        She called you “Oh Henry” didn’t she?

                                 HENRY
                             (sours)
                        Yeah yeah.

           Daphne finishes her leg presses, dismounts the machine, and 
           waits for Henry to finish his reps.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, I would have gladly switched 
                        with you.  My guy was a dead fish.

                                 HENRY
                        Ah...the elusive male dead fish.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Totally silent.  AND managed to stay 
                        relatively motionless even when he 
                        was leading the dance.

                                 HENRY
                        Are you 100% sure that his lack of 
                        exertion wasn’t because of you?
                             (Daphne looks at him)
                        Maybe feeling underwhelmed by what 
                        you were bringing to the table?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Uh, well, he did say it was the best 
                        sex of his entire life, asshole.

                                 HENRY
                        First time for everything.

           Irritated, Daphne pulls the pin out of Henry’s Nautilus.   
           With no weight on the bar, Henry overcompensates and KNOCKS 
           himself in the face with the bar.   He DROPS out of frame.

           INT. GYM LOBBY - LATER

           Henry, nose full of wadded up tissue, waits for Daphne 
           outside of the locker rooms.

           Rick, drenched in sweat, walks towards the men’s locker room, 
           but changes trajectory when he spots Henry.  

                                 RICK
                        Yo!  What’s up, David Thoreau!?

                                 HENRY
                        Hey Rick.

                                 RICK
                        Woah - what happened to your grill?

                                 HENRY
                        You should see the other guy.

                                 RICK
                             (ridiculously transparent)
                        So...who ya here with?

                                 HENRY
                        Not gonna happen, man.

                                 RICK
                        Oh c’mon!  I saw Daphne on the 
                        treadmill, that girl jiggles in all 
                        the right places.

                                 HENRY
                        You have got a one track mind, buddy.

                                 RICK
                        “Simplicity simplicity simplicity!  I 
                        say, let your affairs be as two or 
                        three, and not a hundred or a 
                        thousand.  Instead of a million count 
                        half a dozen, and keep your accounts 
                        on your thumbnail.”

           Henry realizes that he’s quoting Thoreau.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay, that was pretty impressive.
                             (Rick grins)
                        But it still ain’t happening.

           Daphne exits the women’s locker room, walks right up to them.
                                 DAPHNE
                             (to Henry)
                        You ready?

           Long...excruciating...pause.  Then:

                                 HENRY
                        Daph, this is Rick.  Rick, this is my 
                        roommate Daphne.

                                 RICK
                        I’d shake your hand, but I feel like 
                        I’m drenched in sweat right now.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I can’t tell you how much I 
                        appreciate that.

                                 RICK
                        I’ve been training pretty hard for 
                        this triathlon next month.

           Henry rolls his eyes.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh yeah?  What’s that, running, 
                        biking, and swimming?

                                 RICK
                        Normally that’s right, but this one 
                        is running, biking, and then two 
                        miles of tequila shots.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (amused)
                        Sounds like my kind of race.

                                 RICK
                        Well, if you ever want to help me 
                        train for the tequila leg...

           Rick produces a business card, hands it to Daphne.

                                 RICK (cont’d)
                        ...give me a call.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe I will.

                                 RICK
                        A pleasure meeting you, Daphne.
                             (to Henry)
                        Winkler.

           Henry gives Rick a bitter “yeah yeah” nod as he walks to the 
           locker room.  Henry and Daphne head for the exit.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Nice guy.  Is he really a triathlete?

                                 HENRY
                        More of a triath-hole.

           EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Evan, in his pajamas, opens the door to find-

           -Henry and Daphne decked out in all military cammo gear.

                           HENRY
                                                         DAPHNE
           HAPPY BIR-!
                                              HAPPY BIR-!

                                 EVAN
                        SHH!  SHHHHHHHH!
                             (they shut up)
                        Marcy’s still asleep.

                           HENRY
                 (whisper quiet)
                                                         DAPHNE
                                                (whisper quiet)
           Happy birthday.
                                              Happy birthday.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        What are you guys doing here?

                                 HENRY
                        It’s your birthday, so we thought 
                        we’d surprise you with:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Paintbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!

                                 EVAN
                        Oh man, that’s awesome.  But you know 
                        Marcy planned that birthday brunch.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s why we’re here now.  We go get 
                        a few hours in and make it back here 
                        with plenty of time for the brunch.

                                 EVAN
                        You think we can do it?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (nodding)
                        Paintbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!

           Evan looks around, paranoid like a kid trying to steal ice 
           cream right before dinner time.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, I’ll go change.
                                 HENRY
                        We got fatigues in the car for you, 
                        let’s go go go.

           The three of them start scurrying down the front walk when-

           -THWACK!  THWACK!  Evan YELPS.

           He drops to the ground, hit in the calf and the back.

           Henry and Daphne look at him, and then up to-

           -the upstairs window, where Marcy is aiming a pimped out 
           paintball sniper rifle at them.

                                 MARCY
                        Happy birthday Evan.

                                 EVAN
                             (in pain/psyched)
                        ...You got me a paintball gun?

                                 MARCY
                        I sure did, sweetheart, but I’ll be 
                        damned if I let you sneak off now and 
                        then miss this brunch because you 
                        “lost track of time.”

                                 EVAN
                        I love you, baby.

                                 MARCY
                        Right back at ya.  And you two!

           Marcy FIRES a few rounds at Henry and Daphne’s feet, making 
           them do a little jig.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        You just signed up to help me cook.

           INT. EVAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Daphne, Henry, Evan, and Marcy sit at the dining room table 
           with TWO MARRIED COUPLES (early 30s).  Daphne and Henry look 
           hilariously out of place in full military gear.

           Everyone is enjoying a delicious brunch of eggs, bacon, 
           glazed french toast, fresh fruit, coffee, and so on.

                                 EVAN
                        Thank you again, honey, everything is 
                        just fantastic.   This toast almost 
                        tastes like it came out of a six 
                        slice toaster.
                                 WIFE 1
                        Seriously Marce.  It’s perfect.

                                 HUSBAND 1
                        I’m so glad we could find a sitter, I 
                        would’ve hated to have missed this.

                                 WIFE 2
                        We know how that is!

                                 HUSBAND 2
                        I’d refer you to our’s, but we need 
                        her available every chance we get!

           Obnoxious LAUGHTER around the table.  Henry and Daphne 
           exchange a look.

                                 WIFE 2
                        When do you think you two will start 
                        trying for kids?

                                 DAPHNE
                        As soon as Evan’s shipment of extra-
                        strength Cialis shows up!
                             (looking for laughs)
                        Am I right?

           Arctic, frigid, judgmental silence around the table.

           UNDER THE TABLE: Henry gives Daphne an on-the-sly high-five.

           With the focus now on Henry and Daphne:

                                 WIFE 1
                        So...how long have you two been an 
                        item?

                                 HENRY
                        Oh, gosh.   What’s it been?   Married 
                        seventeen years now.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (nodding)
                        Three kids.

                                 HENRY
                        And two full-grown adults, one Samoan-
                        American.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Tautolu.  Named after his grandpa.

                                 MARCY
                        They’re not together.  Just holding 
                        each other back.

           Henry flicks a grape at Daphne’s head.  BOINK!
           Daphne responds by SLAPPING the end of her fork, which 
           catapults a bite of egg onto Henry’s face.  SPLAT.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                             (starting to boil)
                        Children...

                           HENRY
                                                         DAPHNE
           Sorry Marcy.
                                              Sorry Marcy.

                                 HUSBAND 1
                        How’s the dating scene these days?

                                 WIFE 2
                        You know, I used to love setting 
                        people up, but now I feel like 
                        everyone that I know is married.

                                 WIFE 1
                        I know, right?

                           HENRY
                                                         DAPHNE
           We’re fine.  Really.
                                              Yeah, you don’t have to...

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t worry about these two, they’re 
                        knee deep in online dating right now.

           Henry and Daphne scowl at Evan, who is loving this exchange.

                                 HUSBAND 1
                        Oh neat!  My brother met his wife 
                        through charm.com.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s what they’re doing, the whole 
                        five free matches thing.

                                 HUSBAND 2
                        How’s that working out for you?

                                 HENRY
                        A couple of real winners out there.

                                 HUSBAND 1
                        So you’ve met some good matches?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, Henry was referring to us.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, Daph and I are the “couple of 
                        winners.”  All the people we’ve met 
                        have been...

                                 DAPHNE
                        ...inadmissable.
                                 HUSBAND 1
                        Ah.  That’s too bad.

           A glum aura overtakes the table.

                                 WIFE 1
                             (super cheery)
                        Well, keep at it!  I’m sure you’ll 
                        both find the right person before 
                        it’s too late.

           Henry and Daphne stare.  Then Daphne wipes her mouth, stands.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Excuse me, need to use the little 
                        girl’s room.

           As Daphne exits the dining room.

                                 MARCY
                             (whispers to her)
                        I hid the gun.

           Daphne’s face: DAMN IT!  Once she’s gone:

                                 WIFE 2
                        Are you sure you two never...?

                                 HENRY
                        Me and Daph?  No, no way.

                                 WIFE 1
                        That’s really strange because you two 
                        have such great chemistry.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s impossible.
                             (leans forward, hushed)
                        I’ve heard her fart.

           Wife 2 WHISPERS something to her husband.  He CHUCKLES and 
           nods in agreement.  Fucking secrets.

           Henry narrows his eyes at them.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

           Henry walks out of his bathroom after taking a shower.

           In his bedroom, he pulls on an old tee shirt and walks to-
           INT. THE APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne lays on the couch watching TV.  The strange thing is 
           that she’s wearing a really sexy lace top, like lingerie 
           style, and a pretty absurd pair of hot pants with a sassy 
           adjective on the butt.

           Also, she’s elbow deep in a family sized bag of Ruffles.

                                 HENRY
                        Uhhhhh...

                                 DAPHNE
                             (sneers at him)
                        Laundry day.

                                 HENRY
                        Bump into anyone in the laundry room?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, thank God.  I don’t think anyone 
                        could resist...
                             (refers to self)
                        ...all this.

                                 HENRY
                        You’d have to be inhuman.

           Henry sits down on the couch next to her.

           Daphne MUNCHES away on the chips, totally focused on the TV.

           Henry, however, has lost control of his eyes.

           They wander to Daphne’s legs, which look damn good.

           They wander to her boobs, which, though sporting a few potato 
           chip crumbs, also look damn good.

           They wander to her face.  She is really pretty.

           Daphne notices Henry looking at her.  She offers him some of 
           the chips.  He takes a handful.

           They MUNCH together for a few beats, then:

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Hey...you ever wonder why we never 
                        hooked up?

           Daphne’s MUNCHING ceases.  Immediately.  Shit just got real.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                             (backpeddling quick)
                        I mean, I’m not trying to be weird.
                                 DAPHNE
                             (helping him backpeddle)
                        No, no.  I know.  It’s just that...

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, I know.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Totally.

                                 HENRY
                        Right.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Like, I have, sure.  But not, like...

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, just like, random thinking.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Right.

                                 HENRY
                        Totally.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What about you?

                                 HENRY
                        Oh.  Well, like, lots of reasons.  I 
                        mean, don’t get me wrong, you’re hot.  
                        Totally hot girl.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Obviously.

                                 HENRY
                        And I like to think that I’m fairly 
                        easy on the eyes.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (more guarded)
                        Sure.

                                 HENRY
                        So, physical attraction isn’t the 
                        issue here.
                             (whoa)
                        But I’m not saying you’re like 
                        irresistible either.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well neither are you.

                                 HENRY
                        But push came to shove, we’d probably 
                        knock it out the park, sex-wise.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                             (gulp)
                        Anyway, the point is that you’re my 
                        best friend.  And when two people 
                        like us start...you know...it throws 
                        everything off.  Because you and I 
                        are awesome, and if we ever did, it’d 
                        probably be awesome, but then it 
                        would...not be...anymore.  It just 
                        seems to me that the risk is 
                        like...risky, you know?

           Henry’s normally cool and collected demeanor has vanished, 
           leaving in its wake a stammering, flustered disaster.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        I mean, that’s why, right?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Sure.  Yeah.  I...
                             (thinks)
                        ...well, also because when we first 
                        met I was dating Drew.

                                 HENRY
                        Right.  Drew.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Drew.

           Was stupid Drew the only reason they never hooked up?

           Henry and Daphne sit in silence, experiencing what might be 
           the first ever awkward moment between them.  Then:

                      DAPHNE (cont’d)
                 (jumps up)
                                                          HENRY
                                                (answers his cell phone)
           I gotta go change my laundry.
                                              Hello?  Oh hey what’s up?

           Daphne’s out the door.

           Henry hangs up on his fake call.  Deep EXHALE.  Fuck.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Daphne walks in, checks the two washing machines.

           Fifteen minutes left on each.

           She sits down.  Waits.  Stares.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - LATER

           Henry walks towards his room past Daphne’s closed door.  He 
           stops when her hears-
           -that distinct WHIRRING of a “vibrating device” again. 

           However, this time Henry’s reaction isn’t comical.

           He is stone-faced.  Reluctantly aroused.

           Henry leans closer to the door.  

           Dry mouth.  SWALLOWS.  A bead of sweat.  Forgets to breathe.

           Suddenly the door SWINGS OPEN revealing-

           -Daphne brushing her teeth with an electric toothbrush.

           Henry jumps back, startled.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (mouth full of fluoride)
                        What are you doing?

                                 HENRY
                             (super quick response)
                        Going to bed, nothing.

           Henry disappears into his bedroom.  Daphne closes her door.

           INT. BEDROOMS - SPLIT SCREEN - NIGHT

           Daphne and Henry lie in their respective beds, wide awake.

           They lie still.  They toss.  They turn.

           Nothing is working.

           Henry leans over to his bedside table and retrieves a hidden 
           bottle of Nyquil.  Takes a slug.

           Simultaneously, Daphne retrieves a hidden bottle of Advil PM 
           from her bedside table.  Shakes out four, downs them.

           They lie back down.  Wide awake.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - MORNING

           Daphne exits her bedroom, ready for work.  She hears NOISE.

           Henry’s in the kitchen, wearing a suit and rinsing out his 
           coffee cup.  He picks up a portfolio bag, turns around, and 
           almost bumps into her, hoping to make a quick exit.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hey.
                                 HENRY
                        Hey.  I made coffee.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Thanks.  You look spiffy.

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks.  
                             (re: portfolio)
                        I, uh, have some face time with big 
                        enchiladas, gotta give it the full 
                        court press. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Don’t forget to get down to brass 
                        tacks.

           They share a little smile.  For a second it’s not awkward.

                                 HENRY
                        We still doing number four tonight?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yup.  Steve.

                                 HENRY
                        Christina.  Meet up at Piano Bar once 
                        it all goes to hell?

                                 DAPHNE
                        That’s the plan.

                                 HENRY
                        Cool.  Have a good day.

           He’s halfway out the door when:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Good luck today.

                                 HENRY
                        Nose to the grindstone.

           INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Henry approaches CHRISTINA (28) sitting at a table.  She’s 
           pretty.  Looks normal.  Henry remains wary.

                                 HENRY
                        Christina?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Hi Henry, nice to meet you.

           They shake hands.
                                 HENRY
                        Nice to meet you, too.

           He sits, notices that there’s a drink in front of him.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Oh, I thought it’d be fun to try to 
                        guess your favorite drink.

                                 HENRY
                        I see.

           Henry picks up the drink, gives it a whiff.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Smells like a gin and tonic, which 
                        would be my go-to favorite, but 
                        there’s a cucumber in it.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        It’s Hendrick’s gin.  Good quality.   
                        On the label they suggest you put a 
                        cucumber in it instead of a lime.  
                        Supposed to bring out the flavor.

           Henry takes a sip.  Pause.  Takes another sip.

                                 HENRY
                        This may be my new favorite drink!

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Hooray!

           The waiter arrives.

                                 CHRISTINA (cont’d)
                        Now you can try to guess mine.

           The waiter looks at Henry.  On the spot.

                                 HENRY
                        Uh...well, the lady will be having a 
                        Jack and Diet Coke...?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Psssh!  Not even close!
                             (to waiter)
                        I’ll have a Grey Goose martini with 
                        lemon AND olives.

           The waiter leaves.

                                 CHRISTINA (cont’d)
                        Jack and Diet!?  What am I, a 
                        sorority girl stripping her way 
                        through college?
           They share a LAUGH at this.

           Henry’s guard appears to be coming down...which suddenly 
           makes him somewhat self-conscious.  Desperate to fill the 
           silence, he can’t stop himself from saying:

                                 HENRY
                        So what do you do?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Uck.  I hate talking about work when 
                        I’m not at work.

           Henry’s face brightens.

                                 CHRISTINA (cont’d)
                        What?

                                 HENRY
                        That may be the single sexiest thing 
                        I’ve ever heard anyone say in my 
                        entire life.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Wow.  Wait until you hear how much I 
                        hate talking about church and family!

           Henry LAUGHS.  The waiter returns with her martini.

                                 CHRISTINA (cont’d)
                        Here’s to never talking about work 
                        when we don’t have to.

                                 HENRY
                        Done.

           They CLINK glasses.  Drink.  

           Henry is smiling.  Really smiling.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           We pick up on Daphne at the end of her date with STEVE (28), 
           a good-looking gent with some fashion sense.

           Dinner is over, and only scraps remain on their plates.

                                 STEVE
                        I guess...if I had to choose, I’d go 
                        with fugitive-on-the-run sex.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Really!?  Over behind-enemy-lines war 
                        sex!?  Where’s your sense of heroism?
                                 STEVE
                        Well, that’s just it.  For a war hero 
                        risking his life, expectations in the 
                        sack are set pretty high.  If I’m an 
                        escaped prisoner then I’m just some 
                        dirtbag, no performance anxiety.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Huh.  You make a valid point. 

                                 STEVE
                        Thank you.

           Smiles.  Seems like it’s going well.  The waiter approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        How are we doing here?

                                 STEVE
                        Great, could I get this to go?

           Steve holds up his plate, which has 1/9 of a steak and one 
           green bean on it.  Daphne raises an eyebrow.

                                 WAITER
                        Of course.  And you ma’am?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (re: her plate)
                        No thank you, I’m good.

                                 STEVE
                        Just throw her’s in with mine.

                                 WAITER
                        ...No problem, sir.

           The Waiter picks up the two plates.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, one second.

           Steve picks up all of the remaining pieces of bread from the 
           free bread basket and piles them onto his plate.

           Daphne’s face: Really?

           INT. RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve and Daphne walk towards the exit.

           As they pass the host stand, Steve looks around, sees that 
           the coast is clear, and-

           -GRABS a fistful of free dinner mints, shoving them into his 
           doggie bag.  Steve winks at Daphne.
           This act of weirdness is the last straw for Daphne.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne and Steve exit.  Stop.  Awkward pause.

                                 STEVE
                        Walk you to your car?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, it’s okay.  I’m right there.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh.  Alright.
                             (pause)
                        Well, I had a lot of fun, Daphne.  
                        I’d love to do this again.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (definitely not)
                        ...Yyyyyeah, that sounds great.   I 
                        have your email.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh...okay.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (backing away)
                        It was nice meeting you.

                                 STEVE
                             (glum)
                        Uh, yeah.  You too.  Take care.

           We follow Daphne down the street until she ducks into-

           INT. PIANO BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne walks in.  Does a lap.  No Henry.  Hmmm.

           She sits down at the bar, the bartender immediately sets a 
           beer in front of her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Thanks.

           A guy two stools away from her starts staring, waiting to 
           make eye contact.

           Daphne notices him.  He raises his eyebrow: Invitation?

           Daphne stares back, not in the mood.  Then-

           -picks her nose.  Deep.  
           The guy gets the hint.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Daphne, a little tipsy, paints her toenails while Def 
           Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me” BLASTS in the background.

           Finishing up her baby toe, Daphne waddles into the kitchen.

           She mixes diced strawberries into a cup of vanilla yogurt.

           Pours some sugar on it.

           The door OPENS.  Henry walks in.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hey.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey.

           Henry looks like he’s trying to hold back a big smile.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Where have you been?

                                 HENRY
                        With Christina.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You sexed number four?  That wasn’t 
                        the plan.

                                 HENRY
                        No, no.  We were just making out and 
                        talking, you know?

           Daphne’s face falls.

                                 DAPHNE
                        She’s a winner?

                                 HENRY
                             (reserved optimism)
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I think she might be.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (jealous)
                        That’s...great.  I’m happy for you.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t be like that.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (no filter)
                        It’s totally not fair!

                        This was my idea, you were just 
                        supposed to be my crutch until I 
                        found a winner!

                                 HENRY
                        Ah, it all comes out.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh please, act like you didn’t know.

                                 HENRY
                        What about your guy?  Steve, right?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I mean, he seemed cool, but then he 
                        did this really weird thing ordering 
                        two doggie bags.  For like the tiny, 
                        TINY bit of food on my plate AND all 
                        of the free bread.  AND the free 
                        mints at the hostess stand!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RESTAURANT - FLASHBACK

           Daphne walks away, leaving Steve alone with his sad sack 
           expression and his two doggie bags.

           Once she’s gone, Steve turns and ambles down the street to-

           -a homeless man huddled under a blanket in a nearby alley.  
           Steve gives him the food.

                                 STEVE
                        Here you go, man.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        God bless you, brother.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 HENRY
                        What an asshole!

           Daphne pouts.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Chin up, Daph.  You still have one 
                        more match waiting for you.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Ugh, I don’t want to do that alone.
                                 HENRY
                        Whoa whoa whoa, are you trying to 
                        bail right now?

                                 DAPHNE
                        So what if I am?

                                 HENRY
                        So I’ve been trying to bail this 
                        whole Goddamn time, and you wouldn’t 
                        let me!  You think I’m going to let 
                        you give up now?
                             (Daphne scowls at him)
                        You made your bed.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I hate this bed, it’s lumpy and awful 
                        and the sheets smell like failure.

                                 HENRY
                             (smiles)
                        Get your computer, I’m taking a piss.

           Daphne drags ass to her bedroom to retrieve her laptop while 
           Henry goes to the bathroom, door open.

           Daphne sets up her laptop in the living room.  TYPES.

           Something on the screen makes Daphne roll her eyes.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (calling out)
                        Get this: “We’ve saved the best for 
                        last.  Your fifth match represents 
                        the peak of compatibility for your 
                        personal profile.”

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        What a sham.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (to herself)
                        Easy for you to say, you’re 
                        practically engaged now.

           Daphne CLICKS on the fifth match profile and-

           -Henry pops up!  Smiling back at Daphne from the picture that 
           she was cropped out of.

           Daphne stares at Henry.  Eyes wide.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                             (God...damn it)
                        My...perfect match.

           FLUSH.  Henry walks out of the bathroom.
           Daphne quickly SHUTS the laptop.

                                 HENRY 
                        So what’s his name?

                                 DAPHNE
                             (thinking “quick”)
                        ...Jamarcus.

                                 HENRY
                        He’s black?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No.

                                 HENRY
                        A white guy named Jamarcus?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Henry.  That’s racist.

                                 HENRY
                        I really don’t think it is.
                             (pause, reconsiders)
                        Wait a minute, is it racist?  Now I 
                        feel self-conscious.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah, I think it might be racist.

                                 HENRY
                        I hate it when I’m accidentally 
                        racist.  Such a fine line to walk.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I wouldn’t know, I’m color blind.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah yeah.  Let’s see a picture.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (thinking quicker)
                        Sorry, his general hotness sapped all 
                        the battery power from my laptop.

                                 HENRY
                        Well, I can...

           RINGTONE.  Henry’s phone.  A text message.

           He checks it.  Geeks out a bit.  Clearly from Christina.

           Daphne stares daggers at him as he finishes texting back.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Sorry.  Anyway, what?
                                 DAPHNE
                        I’m going to bed.

           She grabs her laptop, retreats to her bedroom.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                             (as she passes)
                        If you say “chin up” again, I’m gonna 
                        fuckin’ clock you.

           INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Henry sleeps like a baby.  

           INT. DAPHNE’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Daphne is awake.  Her laptop is in bed with her.

           She’s staring at Henry’s charm.com profile.

           She brings up the original picture with both of them in it, 
           laughing on the couch.  They do look right together.

           Off Daphne’s frustration...

           INT. DAPHNE AND HENRY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Henry exits his room, bleary eyed, heading for the bathroom.   
           Notices that Daphne is gone.

           EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE - CRACK OF DAWN

           Daphne tosses pebbles at the window.  No answer.  She tosses 
           more pebbles.

           A light goes on, and a second later a really fucking 
           irritated Marcy opens the window.  

                                 MARCY
                        ARE YOU SERIOUS?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hey Marcy.  Sorry.   
                             (then:)
                        Is Evan here?  I need to talk to him 
                        and his cell keeps going straight to 
                        voicemail.

           Marcy almost immediately assesses that Daphne’s not in the 
           best state of mind.
                                 MARCY
                        He had to fly to Seattle for work, 
                        but he’ll be back tomorrow.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (distraught)
                        Oh.  Okay.

           Daphne starts to leave.   Before she gets to her car, the 
           front door opens behind her.   Marcy’s standing there.

                                 MARCY
                        Come in.
                             (Daphne turns, confused)
                        You’re obviously upset and need 
                        someone to talk to, so come in.

                                 DAPHNE
                        But...I thought you kinda hated me?

                                 MARCY
                        Why would you think that?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I dunno.  You’re always yelling at 
                        Evan for hanging out with Henry and 
                        I, glaring down at us like some 
                        frosty ice queen.

                                 MARCY
                        Well, you and Henry are always 
                        dragging Evan off to do strange and 
                        reckless things that sometimes get 
                        him arrested.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (thrust)
                        I mean...I can see how an uptight and 
                        rigid wet blanket-type might see me 
                        as a somewhat thoughtless and self-
                        centered troublemaker.

                                 MARCY
                             (parry)
                        And vice versa.

           The two ladies stare each other down and then-

           -smile simultaneously.  Daphne and Marcy just became BFFs.

           Daphne walks into the house.

                                 DAPHNE
                        We should talk more often.

                                 MARCY
                        I was thinking the same thing.
           INT. EVAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Daphne and Marcy sit in the dining room with two cups of tea.

                                 DAPHNE
                        It’s this whole online dating thing.  
                        I burned through the first four 
                        chumps, and then come to find out 
                        that my fifth, final, and allegedly 
                        best match is Henry.

                                 MARCY
                        So you had your crossover moment?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Crossover moment?

                                 MARCY
                        That moment when you realize that 
                        someone that you never saw as a 
                        romantic prospect might actually be 
                        the best candidate.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (total loss)
                        How could I have missed this?

                                 MARCY
                        When I first met Evan, I was dating 
                        this very forgettable stooge, and he 
                        was letting some golddigging whorebag 
                        spend all of his money.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh right, Gillian.

                                 MARCY
                        Don’t even get me started.
                             (then)
                        The point is, we were just work 
                        friends.  Then I switched jobs, and 
                        we started doing those weekly lunches 
                        to keep in touch.  We got to know 
                        each other so well.  Then one day I 
                        noticed that Evan was looking at me 
                        differently.  One week later he was 
                        professing his undying love for me.  

                                 DAPHNE
                        And you blew him off. 

                                 MARCY
                        I let him down easy because I didn’t 
                        have those feelings for him.  And it 
                        messed everything up.  We tried to 
                        stay friends, but started arguing all 
                        the time.

                        Suddenly all of our exchanges were 
                        loaded with subtext and 
                        miscommunication, and someone always 
                        left with hurt feelings.  It sucked.  
                        A lot.

           Marcy spaces out, smiling.  Lost in her own happy memory.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        Then I was dating this guy, totally 
                        decent guy.  He sent me gourmet 
                        chocolates at work on Valentine’s day 
                        and we were supposed to see a show 
                        that night.  I ran home to change, 
                        and this fresh fruit floral 
                        arrangement was waiting outside my 
                        door.  Evan knew that I don’t really 
                        like chocolate, that I’m more of a 
                        fruit person.  Then, boom, it hit me.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Crossover moment.

                                 MARCY
                        I started crying, holding a box of 
                        chocolates that I was never going to 
                        eat.  All I could think about was how 
                        lunch with Evan was always the best 
                        part of my week.  How much I missed 
                        it.  Missed him.
                             (sips her tea)
                        Thirty minutes later I was at his 
                        front door.  Thirty days later we 
                        were engaged.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I guess I just...Henry and I...I 
                        thought it would have happened by now 
                        if it was supposed to, you know?

                                 MARCY
                        Daphne, I once spent ten minutes 
                        looking for my sunglasses when they 
                        were on my face. 

           Daphne ponders that logic for a second.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        The real question is whether Henry’s 
                        had his crossover with you?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You know, the other night there was 
                        this weird moment on the couch.  It 
                        was like...awkward and uncomfortable 
                        and unfamiliar and...
                                 MARCY
                        ...sexually charged?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.  Kinda.

                                 MARCY
                        Well that’s great!

                                 DAPHNE
                        I think I blew it, though.
                             (Marcy’s confused)
                        Between now and then he went out on a 
                        date with this girl Christina.  I 
                        think he really likes her.

           Marcy CHUCKLES.  In a condescending kind of way.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        What!?

                                 MARCY 
                        What is Henry’s favorite ice cream?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Haagen Daz Vanilla Swiss Almond with 
                        Hershey’s syrup.

                                 MARCY
                        Favorite movie?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Easy Rider when he wants to sound 
                        smart, but really it’s Home Alone.

                                 MARCY
                        And can you tell when he’s upset?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah, he tries to distract you with 
                        bad jokes, but gets really sensitive 
                        if you don’t laugh at them.

                                 MARCY
                        This new girl?  You can take her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.
                             (thinks about it)
                        Yeah!

           Daphne stands up.  Immediately sits down.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        You think I should do it?
                                 MARCY
                        I’ve known you and Henry for a while 
                        now, and, to me, it was never an “if” 
                        it was a “when.”

           Daphne stands up again.  Confidence building.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Thank you.

           Marcy just nods.  Daphne makes it to the door, then:

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        What about the sex?

                                 MARCY
                        Funny you say that, the sex is what I 
                        worried most about in the whole 
                        friend to boyfriend transition.  
                             (dreamy voice)
                        But I’ve never EVER been with someone 
                        who is so intensely grateful to be 
                        inside me.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Gross.

                                 MARCY
                             (glowing)
                        Yeah.  Gross.

           INT. DAPHNE AND HENRY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Daphne bursts into the apartment.   Henry’s not there.

           EXT. DAPHNE AND HENRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne whips out her phone as she hustles down the walk.

           TEXT MESSAGE: To Henry: “Where you at?”

           Daphne hits send.

           She gets into her car.  STARTS the engine.

           RINGTONE.  A text response.

           TEXT MESSAGE: From Henry: “Cafe 50’s.’

           Daphne PEELS OUT.
           INT. CAFE 50’S - MORNING

           Daphne enters.  Looks around.  Checks the back seating area.

           There’s Henry, sitting in the back corner booth.

           He’s with Christina.  They’re having a nice breakfast...and 
           they’re playing Stratego!

           Daphne is frozen.  Just as she decides to duck out-

           -Henry spots her.  Waves.

                                 HENRY
                        Daph!

           Busted, Daphne has to walk over to their booth.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        What’s up, dude?  Glad you’re here, I 
                        want you to meet Christina.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Hi!  I’ve heard a lot about you.

           Christina extends her hand.  Daphne has to shake it.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Wow, I love your belt.  Where’d you 
                        get it?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh.  Thank you.  Um, I think it was 
                        Urban Outfitters.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Ugh, I’m sorry.  I hate admitting 
                        that I shop there.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (considers this, then:)
                        Yeah, me too.

                                 HENRY
                        Sit down, join us.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nah, I don’t want to impose.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        No imposition.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Really I should be going.  Just 
                        wanted to talk to Henry about 
                        something, but it can wait.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Before you go, he told me that you 
                        want to learn how to surf?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, I’ve always been interested.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I’d love to teach you.  I was a 
                        certified instructor in college.  
                        Maybe you guys can come up to the 
                        house in Malibu some weekend.

                                 DAPHNE
                        ...You have a house in Malibu?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Ha!  I wish.  My boss is a prick, so 
                        whenever he’s out of town I steal the 
                        key and make myself at home.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (reluctantly impressed)
                        That’s...really cool of you.

           Despite trying her absolute hardest, Daphne is having a lot 
           of difficulty hating Christina.

           Even worse, when she looks at Henry, he seems very happy to 
           be with her.  Daphne wilts a little.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        Yeah, I should get going.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        It was great meeting you.

           Daphne looks at Christina, then at the Stratego board.

           Daphne leans in, whispers in Christina’s ear.

                                 DAPHNE 
                        He always puts his flag behind one of 
                        the lakes in a cluster of bombs.

           Christina grins.  Daphne nods and splits.

           Henry is left out of the inner circle.   Fucking secrets.

                                 HENRY
                        What was that all about?
                                 CHRISTINA
                        I think she approves of me.
                             (makes her move)
                        Attack.

           EXT. CAFE 50’S - CONTINUOUS

           Daphne bursts through the door, a ball of frustration and 
           anxiety with no outlet for any of it.

           She pulls out her iphone, dials.  Waits.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Marcy, it’s me.  I...

                                 MARCY (V.O.)
                        Try again, Daphne.  Harder.

           CLICK.  Marcy hung up.

           Daphne looks at her phone.  Huh.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Daphne sits on the couch, deep in thought.  She is CHEWING 
           gum.  Aggressively.  A nervous habit.

           She pulls the piece of gum out, tosses it into the trash, 
           which is littered with other well-chewed pieces.

           She unwraps a fresh piece.  CHEWS.  Thinks.

           The door OPENS.  Daphne jolts, startled.  Henry hustles in.

                                 HENRY
                        Heygottapiss.

           He scoots towards the bathroom, CLOSES door.

           Daphne is frozen for a second, then springs into action.

           She SPITS OUT her gum and moves to the kitchen.

           She retrieves a bottle of vodka from the freezer.  She takes 
           a gulp, but doesn’t swallow.  She SWISHES it like mouthwash.

           Daphne SPITS OUT the vodka in the sink and then dabs a few 
           drops on her neck like perfume.  She’s faking drunk.  

           FLUSH.  Henry emerges from the bathroom, checking his phone.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        So, what’d you want to talk to me 
                        about earlier?
           Daphne takes a DEEP BREATH.  Approaches him.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                             (catches a whiff)
                        Have you been drinking?

           Daphne goes in to kiss him!  A hard charge!

           Henry stops her about an inch from contact.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Whoa, what are you doing?

           She’s still in his personal space.  Idling.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                             (stammering, unsure)
                        I...I’m...but, Christina.

           Now she backs off.  Hurt.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I thought we should...

                                 HENRY
                             (long pause)
                        Should what?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Nothing.  Never mind, stupid me. 

           She walks into the kitchen, frustrated and showing it.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        C’mon, let’s do it.

           Henry is still lost in the moment that just passed.

                                 HENRY
                        Wait...slow down here, do what?

           Daphne grabs an egg from the refrigerator.  Impatient.

           She SPLATS it on her own forehead and stares at Henry.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Egg on my face.  Take a picture.

                                 HENRY
                             (worried and confused)
                        Daphne...

           Daphne grabs a paper towel and exits the apartment.

           Henry is left alone.  Bewildered.
           INT. LAX BAGGAGE CLAIM - MORNING

           Evan waits for his luggae with passengers from the early 
           flight.  He sees his bag, goes to grab it, but- 

           -another guy grabs it first.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey!  That’s my bag.

                                 ANOTHER GUY
                        Nope.  This is mine.

           Evan quickly OPENS the top flap and yanks out a pair of zebra-
           print briefs.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh yeah!?  Are these yours!?

           Everyone’s looking.  Evan turns the undies inside out.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                        So you’re saying these are your skid 
                        marks!?  Huh!?  These are your’s!?

           Embarrassed by proxy, Guy surrenders and hastily walks away.

                                 EVAN (cont’d)
                             (strangely proud)
                        Yeah.  I didn’t THINK so.

           INT. HENRY’S CAR - MORNING

           Dressed for work, Henry is parked outside of LAX.  Evan 
           tosses his bag in the backseat and gets in shotgun. 

                                 EVAN
                        Thanks for scooping me so early.  

                                 HENRY
                             (preoccupied)
                        No problem.

           Henry begins driving.  Moment of silence, then:

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, does jerking off count for the 
                        mile-high club?  Normally I’d say no,  
                        but after this flight I’m not so 
                        sure.  I mean, adrenaline was running 
                        high, you know?  
                             (no response)
                        Maybe it’s like a junior mile high 
                        club, like the cub scouts instead of 
                        the boy scouts.  What do you think?
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVAN (cont'd)
                             (no response)
                        What’s wrong?  Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        Hm?  Oh, nothing.

                                 EVAN
                        Everything okay with Christina?  We 
                        still going bowling tonight?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, that’s all good.  
                             (pause)
                        It’s Daphne.

                                 EVAN
                        What about her?

                                 HENRY
                        She didn’t come home last night.

           Long pause.  Evan delivers his next line totally deadpan.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh...my God.  We should call the 
                        authorities immediately.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t be a dick.

                                 EVAN
                        I mean, c’mon man, Daphne’s spent the 
                        night elsewhere before, she knows how 
                        to handle herself.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, but she’s not answering my 
                        calls and...we had a fight yesterday.

                                 EVAN
                        What’d you two fight about?

                                 HENRY
                        Well, it wasn’t really a fight, it 
                        was more of a heated discussion.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay, what’d you two discuss?

                                 HENRY
                        Nothing.  It wasn’t like that.

                                 EVAN
                        Henry.  What happened?
                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know!  But something 
                        happened, I do know that!

           EXT. SHITTY MOTEL - MORNING

           Daphne exits a first floor room with a travel toothbrush 
           sticking out of her mouth.  She’s wearing the wrinkled 
           “emergency work clothes” that she keeps in her car.

           She shleps into the parking lot.  Reaches her car.  Then:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Daphne?

           The toothbrush DROPS.  Daphne closes her eyes.  Makes a wish.

           She turns.  It doesn’t come true.  There’s Drew.

                                 DREW
                        I thought that was you!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Drew.

                                 DREW
                        It’s so good to see you.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.  I must look great.

                                 DREW
                        You do!  How are you?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’ve been better, Drew.

                                 DREW
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Fumigation in the apartment.

                                 DREW
                        Bummer.  Is Henry around too?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No.
                             (realizes)
                        Wait, what are you doing here?

                                 DREW
                        I, uh, I’m staying here.

                                 DAPHNE 
                        Troubles at home?  
                                 DREW
                        You could say that.  Stacy served me 
                        with divorce papers.

           Daphne does a double take.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I beg your pardon.

                                 DREW
                        You heard right.  Turns out that she 
                        was a rich girl con artist.  Her 
                        father was old money, old fashioned, 
                        old everything.  He restructured his 
                        will so that she wouldn’t get any 
                        inheritance if she hadn’t found a 
                        husband before she turned 29.  I was 
                        the loophole.
                             (tough to admit)
                        We were married for one month.

           Daphne processes all this information.  Huge smile.

                                 DAPHNE
                        So...it’s a sham?

                                 DREW
                        My marriage?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No, online dating!  It’s a sham!

                                 DREW
                        I guess.  I definitely got shammed.

           Overjoyed, Daphne jumps into Drew’s arms.  Big hug.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh my God, you don’t even know how 
                        happy I am to hear that!  This is the 
                        best possible news, seriously!

           Drew’s a little confused, but he digs the affection.

                                 DREW
                        Glad to help.

           Daphne pulls away, still holding his arms.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (sincere)
                        Thank you Drew.

                                 DREW
                        Of course, babe.
                             (Cheshire smile)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DREW (cont'd)
                        So, I mean, my divorce isn’t 
                        finalized or anything, but you want 
                        to maybe grab a drink later?

           Daphne lets go of Drew’s arms.  LAUGHS.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh no.  No no no.  You misunderstood 
                        my delight.  I am thoroughly 
                        disgusted by you.

                                 DREW
                        Oh.

                                 DAPHNE
                        But hey...

           A playful but slightly too-hard punch to Drew’s chin.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        ...chin up, huh?

           Daphne walks away, a little more spring in her step.

           INT. DGS ARCHITECTURE - DAY

           SIGN: DGS ARCHITECTURE.

           We move away from the company’s logo, down the halls that 
           boast a mild hustle and bustle.

           Why are we here?  It becomes clear when we reach:

           INT. HENRY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry sits behind a desk in the middle of a spacious office, 
           staring bleary-eyed at his computer.

           He TAPS his finger on the desk, barely paying any attention 
           to the skeleton layout of an office building on his computer 
           screen (in the Autocad design software).

           Distracted, his eyes drift to-

           -the one old school 3D model in his office.  Sitting on a 
           piece of model beachfront property is a stilt house with a 
           hilariously out of place postmodern design.

           Planted on the beach is a miniature sign: “Daph’s Place.”

           After a beat, Henry closes Autocad and brings up his ichat 
           buddy list.  Scans the names...

           ...Daphne is offline.
           INT. DAPHNE’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Daphne’s ichat window.  She is offline.  

           PULL BACK to find Daphne sitting at her cubicle in the 
           brightly lit open air loft that serves as the headquarters 
           for MODERN WEDDING Magazine.

           The place is organized confusion.  Tear sheets & taffeta 
           abound, copy editors scurry around, and images of brides in 
           unexpected locales line the walls.

           Daphne is spacing out.  In her own world.  After thinking 
           about whatever she’s thinking about for a moment...

           ...she reaches for her Rolodex, starts FLIPPING through it.

           She’s interrupted by the arrival of:

                                 BETHANY
                        Hey Daphne, just wanted to say those 
                        new layouts look fantastic.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (distant)
                        Thanks.

           Bethany’s about to leave when Daphne shifts gears:

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        You know, I’ve been thinking about 
                        it, and I decided that I want to give 
                        that cardio barre class a try.

                                 BETHANY
                        OhmiGod, you totally should!  We’ve 
                        got a class after work tonight.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Ah, damn.  Maybe next week then.

           Daphne SNATCHES a card out of her Rolodex.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                        I’ve got plans tonight.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

           Henry enters.  Tosses his keys.

                                 HENRY
                        You home?

                                 DAPHNE (O.S.)
                        In here!
           Henry walks to the Daphne’s bedroom door.

                                 HENRY
                        Where the hell were you last ni-?

           He stops short when he sees Daphne in a super hot outfit, 
           applying some foundation.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Whoa.  You look great.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Thanks.  Yeah, sorry about the 
                        disappearing act.  Just needed to 
                        clear my head, lost track of time.

                                 HENRY
                        I was worried about you.

                                 DAPHNE
                        That’s sweet, but I’m fine.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay.
                             (pause)
                        So why the fancy get-up?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Got a date.

                                 HENRY 
                        Jamarcus the cracker?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No...no, I already met up with him, 
                        we had coffee.

                                 HENRY
                        What!?  When did this happen, I 
                        thought we were supposed to be, you 
                        know, looping each other in?

                                 DAPHNE
                        You were out with Christina, didn’t 
                        seem like a good time to bug you.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh.  So it didn’t go well?

                                 DAPHNE
                        It was fine.  He’s cool, but...
                             (looks at Henry, hard)
                        ...he was just a friend.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, Daph.
                                 DAPHNE
                        You know, I’ve been doing a lot of 
                        thinking, and I decided that I’m okay 
                        with it.

                                 HENRY
                        Okay with what?

           Daphne closes her foundation kit, walks right up to Henry, 
           and hammers her point home.

                                 DAPHNE
                        With being alone.  I mean, not 
                        everyone in the world can find that 
                        perfect person, right?  It’s a 
                        mathematical impossibility.  If I’m 
                        not one of the special ones and I’m 
                        meant to just casually date the in-
                        betweeners for the rest of my life, 
                        then I’m okay with that. 

                                 HENRY
                        That...doesn’t sound right.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe someday prince charming will 
                        ride up on the white stallion...

           KNOCKING at the front door.

                                 DAPHNE (cont’d)
                             (re: door)
                        ...but until then.

           Daphne walks past Henry, who follows her to the front door.

                                 HENRY
                        Wait, who’s this?

           She opens the door to reveal Rick smiling on the other side!

           Henry’s stomach drops.

                                 RICK
                        My God!  You look criminally hot!

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well thank you, Rick.

                                 RICK
                        ‘Sup Kissinger?

                                 HENRY
                        ............................Hey Rick.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Gimme one minute, I have to grab 
                        shoes and a jacket.

                                 RICK
                        Take your time, babe.

           Daphne disappears into her room, leaving Rick and Henry 
           staring at each other.

                                 RICK (cont’d)
                             (creepy excited)
                        It’s finally goin’ down!

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, you really manufactured an 
                        opportunity for yourself.

                                 RICK
                        Not easy, my friend.  But at the end 
                        of the day, nobody can hold the 
                        Rickster down, ya know?

           Henry wants to take a shower.

                                 RICK (cont’d)
                        No hard feelings though.  We’re still 
                        cool.  And don’t worry, bro...
                             (leans in, whisper)
                        ...I’ll hit that back at my spot.  I 
                        get pretty loud when I’m layin’ pipe, 
                        wouldn’t want it to be weird for you.

           Henry’s fists clench.  White knuckles.

           Daphne appears from around the corner, pulling on a jacket.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Shall we?

                                 RICK
                        Let’s shall.

           Rick jiggles his eyebrows at Henry, and the door CLOSES.

           Henry is left alone.  This doesn’t feel right, either.

           INT. HENRY’S CAR - EVENING

           The car is parked on a residential street.

           Henry sits behind the wheel, deep in thought.

           George Michael’s “Freedom” PLAYS on the radio.
           Like a reflex, Henry TAPS his fingers on the wheel, playing 
           the notes on an imaginary piano.

           After a few beats of Henry wracking his brain-

           -the passenger door OPENS.  Christina gets in.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I am going to KICK YOUR ASS tonight.

                                 HENRY
                             (half-hearted)
                        In your dreams.

           She gives him a kiss.  Then pulls back.  Senses:

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 HENRY
                        Hmmm?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I said, what’s wrong?

                                 HENRY
                        Nothing.  Nothing at all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           Henry and Christina enter, mid-discussion.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I don’t see what the big deal is.   
                        It’s not like she’s marrying the guy.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, but Rick’s such a dirtbag.  I 
                        mean, he’s a nice enough guy, but 
                        he’s just...not respectful.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        She’s a big girl, Henry, I’m sure she 
                        can fend for herself.

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t understand.  The last thing 
                        that Daphne needs is a guy that 
                        doesn’t know how to treat her right.

           At the bar we find Marcy and Evan.  They wave.
                                 CHRISTINA
                             (mildly annoyed)
                        Are those your friends?

           Henry nods, leads her over to the married folk.

                                 HENRY
                        Evan, Marcy, this is Christina.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey there!

                                 MARCY
                             (surprised, unsure)
                        Hi Christina.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        So nice to meet you both.

           Henry steps forward to order drinks.

           Marcy eyes him, and then turns to Christina.

                                 MARCY 
                        So Christina, I heard that you don’t 
                        think that Sudsy Monchik is the best 
                        racquetball player of all time.

           Before Christina can even ask “Who is Sudsy Monchik?” Evan is 
           all over her.

                                 EVAN
                        Are you SERIOUS!?  The guy’s a five-
                        time pro world champion!  He’s third 
                        on the list of all-time tournament 
                        wins and still in his prime!  Have 
                        you seen his backhand!?  Have you 
                        EVER seen his backhand!?!?!?

           With Evan accosting Christina about professional racquetball, 
           Marcy pulls Henry aside for a one-on-one.

                                 MARCY 
                        When Evan told me that we were 
                        “doubling with Henry,” I thought 
                        you’d be bringing someone else.

                                 HENRY
                        Who else would I bring?

                                 MARCY
                             (SIGHS, to herself)
                        Oooookay, how do I do this?

           After some thought, Marcy pulls out her iphone.
                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        Sign into your charm account.

                                 HENRY
                        Why?

                                 MARCY
                        Because I said so.

           Henry signs into his charm account.

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        Now check the one remaining match.

                                 HENRY
                        But I’m not supposed to, I’m still on 
                        number four.

           Marcy stares at Henry.  An intense “do my bidding” stare.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Yeesh, fine.

           He clicks the fifth and final match.  Daphne’s photo pops up.

           Henry is legitimately surprised.  He takes a second.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        ...Daphne’s my fifth match?

                                 MARCY
                        And you’re her’s.

                                 HENRY
                             (realizing)
                        So the other night...?

                                 MARCY
                        Yep.

                                 HENRY
                        And when she came to find me at...?

                                 MARCY
                        Yep.

                                 HENRY
                        And now she’s on a date with the 
                        skeevy triathole because...

                                 MARCY
                        Uh-huh.

           Henry looks to Christina, who is being passed the Apple 
           Martini she ordered.  Evan is still preaching at her.
                                 HENRY
                             (his crossover moment)
                        Okay.

                                 MARCY
                        ‘Atta baby.

           She gives Henry a nod of encouragement. 

           Henry walks over to Christina - he’s a little sad.  

                                 HENRY
                        Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

           She reads his face: “uh-oh.”  Follows him off.

           Marcy joins Evan at the bar. 

                                 EVAN
                        What’s that about?

                                 MARCY
                        Henry and Daphne are in love.

                                 EVAN
                        They finally figured it out?!

                                 MARCY
                        Despite their best efforts not to.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait, how do you know about all this?

                                 MARCY
                        I’m on the team now.

           They look back to Henry and Christina.

                                 EVAN
                        Is he telling her now?
                             (Marcy nods)
                        Well, she can’t be that upset, it’s 
                        only like their fourth date.

           Masking her sadness with anger, Christina decides to BLAST 
           Henry in the face with her martini.

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (immediately regrets it)
                        I’m sorry, that was excessive.

                                 HENRY
                             (dripping vodka)
                        No, I think I deserved it.
           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry bursts out of the bowling alley, on a mission.  

           He blows past ERICA and MORGAN (Henry and Daphne’s respective 
           sex dates) walking in to the alley, hand in hand.  Erica 
           double takes on Henry, and then hides her face.

           Meanwhile, Henry encounters disaster in the form of-

           -a firetruck, lights on, blocking his car in.

           Frantic, Henry beelines for a fireman.

                                 HENRY
                        Hey!  That’s my car, I gotta get my 
                        car out!

                                 FIREMAN
                        I’m sorry sir.  World’s Largest Horse 
                        is on the loose, just came through 
                        and took out a powerline.   We’re 
                        going to be here for a while.
                             (sniffs Henry: vodka)
                        And I don’t think you should be 
                        driving in the state you’re in.

           Off Henry’s face:  FUUUUCK.

           With no other options, Henry takes off running.

           EXT. RESTAURANT VALET - SAME

           Rick opens the door to his car for Daphne.  She gets in

           Rick struts around to the driver’s side.  A grinnin’ perv.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Henry is running out of steam, sweating like a pig.

           He stops for a brief rest, and then cuts through a park.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Henry is really fucking tired now.    He looks like he might 
           die, or at least vomit.  He stops to catch his breath.

           That’s when he sees it-

           -The World’s Largest Horse, grazing by the jungle gym.   

           The beast catches his gaze.   Mano a caballo.
                                 HENRY
                        Eeeeeeasy now.

           The horse SNORTS.  And then something odd happens.

           It trots over to Henry and starts licking his face.

           He CHUCKLES a bit.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Hey there.

           The horse finds an apple slice (from the martini) tucked in 
           Henry shirt pocket.  It nibbles on the apple.  

           Henry strokes its mane.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        You must love martinis.

           EXT. RICK’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Rick helps Daphne out of his car.  SHUTS the door.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You understand the consequences of 
                        lying to me about this?

                                 RICK
                        I swear to God.  Scouts honor.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Okay.  I’ll come upstairs, but if you 
                        don’t show me a D-cup bra with an 
                        authenticated George W. Bush 
                        signature, then we’ve got problems.

                                 RICK
                        You’ll be eating those words.

           Their trek to the front door is interrupted by NOISE.

           CLOPPING noise, moving fast and getting closer.

           Daphne and Rick turn to see-

           -the world’s largest horse CHARGING down the street with 
           Henry on his back!  It is by no means a smooth ride.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Is that...Henry!?

           Henry is bouncing around, holding on for dear life, doing 
           everything in his power to stay on this horse.
           As Henry gets closer to Daphne and Rick, he tries to pull 
           back on the reins...which is really just his belt looped 
           around the horse’s neck.

                                 HENRY
                        Whooooa boy!

           The world’s largest horse responds poorly to this request.

           The horse spins and BUCKS, LAUNCHING Henry off!

           Henry soars through the air and-

           -LANDS HARD on the hood of Rick’s car!

                          DAPHNE
                                                          RICK
           Oh my God!
                                              WHAT THE HELL, MAN!?

           The car alarm BLARES, and the world’s largest horse GALLOPS 
           off into the distance.

           Daphne runs to Henry.

           Annoyed, Rick TURNS OFF the car alarm.

           Daphne finds Henry semi-conscious on the car’s hood.  All she 
           can think to say is:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Was that the world’s largest horse?

                                 HENRY
                             (loopy, dazed)
                        I named him Jamarcus.

                                 RICK
                        But he’s white.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Rick!  That’s really racist!

                                 RICK
                             (to himself)
                        Is it?

           Daphne helps Henry up into a sitting position.

                                 DAPHNE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 HENRY
                             (shaking out the cobwebs)
                        I had to see you.

           Long pause.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Well, here I am.

                                 HENRY
                        Right.  Yeah.  So I guess I gotta...

           Henry takes a beat to gather this thoughts.

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        ...What you were saying earlier.  
                        About not being the special one.  You 
                        are the special one, you know?
                             (that was awkward)
                        What I mean is, your whole casual 
                        being alone theory is bullshit 
                        because the in-betweeners are so 
                        beneath you.  You deserve, like, a 
                        topper, or whatever it is that’s 
                        better than an in-betweener.
                             (little progress, if any)
                        Let me start over.  Christina is a 
                        totally amazing girl.
                             (Daphne scowls)
                        No no!  That’s not what I meant!  I’m 
                        only pointing how amazing she is so 
                        that I can make an appropriate 
                        comparison that expresses...

           Henry wipes sweat off his brow.  Once again, Daphne has 
           turned him into a flustered and rambling mess.  

           It’s gotten so bad that he has to address it:

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        I’m bombing, aren’t I?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’d gong you off stage if I could.

                                 HENRY 
                             (frustrated)
                        Listen, the point is, or I guess my 
                        question is...
                             (gulp)
                        ...do you think that maybe you and I 
                        fell in love with each other and just 
                        didn’t know it right away?

           It’s such an obscure question, but Daphne gets it and it 
           makes her a little gushy inside.

           She KISSES him.  Hard and to the point.  It rules.

           The kiss lasts the perfect amount of time, right between 
           majestic and obnoxious.  Henry is actually blushing.
                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Thank you for doing that, I was 
                        having a lot of trouble building up 
                        the courage.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I could tell.

           A soft WHIMPERING NOISE.  Confusion.

           Holy shit, Rick is still here!  And he’s tearing up!

                                 RICK
                             (deteriorating)
                        I’m sorry, but that was really 
                        beautiful and, like, really 
                        frustrating for me at the same time 
                        because...it was so perfect, you 
                        know?  And I want that, I really want 
                        to find that, like, one amazing girl 
                        to be with.  And I thought Daphne 
                        might be her, but obviously she’s 
                        not, and, I dunno, it just never 
                        seems to work out for me with any 
                        girl long-term, and I don’t know what 
                        I’m doing wrong.  It sucks!  

           Long pause.

                                 HENRY
                        Well...first of all, you should stop 
                        transparently trying to bang any girl 
                        willing to entertain the idea.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Yeah.  And don’t call a girl “babe” 
                        or “baby” until she’s let you stay 
                        over at her place.

                                 RICK
                        Oh.

           Henry hops up off of the car.  Holds out his hand.

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 DAPHNE
                             (takes his hand)
                        Lead the way.

           Hand in hand, Henry and Daphne leave Rick alone.
           EXT. STREET CORNER - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Daphne turn the corner, and walk past us.  We 
           follow them down the sidewalk.

                                 HENRY
                        So, my car’s, like, miles away.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You rode the world’s largest horse 
                        for over a mile?

                                 HENRY
                        No, I picked him up at a park about 
                        half mile away.  Still pretty good 
                        for a sweeping romantic gesture, no?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Unbeatable.

                                 HENRY
                        Good.  Because my taint feels like it 
                        went ten rounds with Manny Pacquiao.

                                 DAPHNE
                        The night is young.

                                 HENRY 
                        Speaking of that, am I going to move 
                        into your bedroom, or are you going 
                        to move into mine?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I say...we have sex in your bed, 
                        cuddle in my bed, and sleep in 
                        separate beds.

                                 HENRY
                        God...DAMN IT!  I love you.  

                                 DAPHNE
                        I love you too.

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s go to my bed.

           FADE OUT.

           OVER CREDITS:

           INT. INTERNET CAFE - MORNING

           At the counter we find Mark (the power player) and Jennifer 
           (the gold digger) getting their orders.  Coffee & pastries.

           Jennifer reaches for her purse, a hollow gesture.
                                 MARK
                        Don’t be ridiculous, babe.  I got 
                        this covered.

           Mark pulls out his wallet and begins sifting through 
           (flaunting) $100 bills for a $12 order.  Jennifer loves it.

           The cashier rolls his eyes: “what a D.”

           PAN AWAY to find:

           Christina (the almost perfect match) sitting with Steve (the 
           good samaritan).  Christina is down-in-the-mouth.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry, Chris.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        It just sucks, you know?  I was 
                        starting to really like him.

                                 STEVE
                        Well at least you got an explanation.  
                        My last date was going well and then 
                        she blew me off out of nowhere.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I’d take that over what I got.

                                 STEVE
                        Buck up, huh?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I hate it when you say that.

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry.  I’m just saying that we still 
                        have one more match left.

           Through the cafe window, we see the World’s Largest Horse 
           GALLOP down the sidewalk.

           THE END.
