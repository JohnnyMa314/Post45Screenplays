           A PIANO PLAYS, tentative and haltingly amateurish.  
           Liebestraum.

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           A rambling two-story house with a mansard roof set far back 
           from the street - a throwback to another era.  The type of 
           house Edward Hopper would paint.  

           Peeling paint, unkempt yard, and foliage which threatens to 
           obscure the house from the street.

           INT. PARLOUR - DAY

           Heavy brocade drapes frame the window, parted just enough to 
           let through a shaft of light.

           Large wooden furniture and faded rugs.  Everything in the 
           room feels bulky and thick.

           A mason jar rests on a crocheted doily atop the piano.  Air 
           holes punched into the metal lid.  Inside a chrysalis 
           attached to a twig.  

           We see the BACK OF A YOUNG GIRL playing the piano.  Frilly 
           dress.  Long brown hair tied with a huge bow.  Booted feet 
           work the piano pedals.  

           The girl glances out the window as a UPS truck pulls to a 
           stop in front of the house.  She bolts from the piano bench.

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           A rugged-looking UPS MAN wearing brown shorts and shirt hops 
           out of his truck.  He carries a package and hand-held 
           scanner.

           He bounds up the steps and KNOCKS.

                                 UPS MAN
                        UPS.  Hello?

           He opens the screen door and steps into...

           INT. FOYER - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

                                 UPS MAN (CONT’D)
                        UPS.  Anyone home?
           ELDA WINNOWS appears at the top of the stairs, her face 
           obscured in shadow.  From her boots and frilly dress, we know 
           her to be the young girl playing piano a moment ago.  

                                 ELDA
                        Are you a pervert or a rapist?

                                 UPS MAN
                        Beg your pardon?

                                 ELDA
                        Mama says all men are perverts or 
                        rapists.  Which are you?

                                 UPS MAN
                        Uhhh... I’m with UPS.  Is this 
                        10708 Willowbrook?  I couldn’t find 
                        a street address.

                                 ELDA
                        I knew Mama was wrong!  I’ve read 
                        stories about you and dreamed you’d 
                        come... and here you are!

                                 UPS MAN
                        Huh?

                                 ELDA
                        You’ll have to excuse me.  I’m 
                        afraid I’m ill-prepared to receive 
                        a gentleman, let alone a someone of 
                        your obvious refinement and 
                        breeding...

           Elda steps into the light.  She’s in her late teens, thin and 
           angular, and is clearly...

           A YOUNG MAN DRESSED LIKE A VICTORIAN TEENAGE GIRL.

           The UPS Man reacts.

                                 UPS MAN
                        Holy shit!

                                 ELDA
                        I love to dance.  Do you know the 
                        quadrille?  It’s such a civilized 
                        form of expression, don’t you 
                        agree?

                                 UPS MAN
                        Dude... what the fuck?
           Just then, MARY WINNOWS, 50s, appears in the doorway carrying 
           a basket of vegetables.  She wears a drab unflattering floor-
           length dress and a cameo choker accentuates her neck.  Her 
           face a road map of bitterness and disappointment. 

           This is Elda’s mother.

           She stops upon seeing the UPS man.  Spins on Elda.  Her eyes 
           like laser beams.

                                 MARY
                        What’s goin’ on here?

                                 ELDA
                        Nothing, Mama.  He just stopped by.

                                 MARY
                        I shoulda known the minute my back 
                        was turned...

                                 ELDA
                        No, Mama.

                                 MARY
                        Go to your room.

                                 ELDA
                        But...

                                 MARY
                        To your room.

                                 ELDA
                        Mama!

                                 MARY
                           (hissing)
                        TO YOUR ROOM!!

           Elda scampers up the stairs.  Mary turns, confronting the UPS 
           man.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe what I’m seeing.

                                 UPS MAN
                        Tell me about it -- you let him 
                        dress like that?

                                 MARY
                        You come smellin’ around like a dog 
                        in heat, making googly eyes at my 
                        daughter...
                                 UPS MAN
                        Daughter?  Are you fuckin’ kidding 
                        me?

                                 MARY
                        She may be a looker now, but in 
                        twenty years this is what you’re 
                        gonna get.

           Mary lifts her dress over her head.  The UPS Man spins in 
           horror, shielding his eyes.

                                 UPS MAN
                        Jesus Christ!  What the hell is 
                        wrong with you people?

           He makes his escape.  Mary turns.  Looks at the package left 
           behind.

           She moves to the box, cracks the seal.  Lifts out a card.

           INSERT:  “Happy Birthday, Son.  Your Father.”

           Mary reaches into the box and extracts a baseball glove.  Her 
           eyes narrow with pure hatred.

           INT. ELDA’S ROOM - DAY

           Elda gazes out her window and watches the UPS truck pull 
           away.  She rests her forehead against the windowpane.

           She moves to her bed and lifts the corner of her mattress.  
           She pulls out a well-worn copy of “Jane Eyre.”  

           She sits on the edge of bed and opens the book.  Her eyes 
           swim over the pages, devouring the words.  She SIGHS.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Elda!

           Elda jumps, startled, and closes the book.  Deftly returns it 
           to its hiding place.

           INT. WINNOWS KITCHEN - DAY

           Mary stands at the sink, peeling potatoes.

           Elda enters timidly.  Nervously toys with her hair.
                                 ELDA
                        I don’t see the harm in just 
                        talking to the young gentleman.

                                 MARY
                        The world is an evil place filled 
                        with vile, disgusting creatures... 
                        and men are the worst.

                                 ELDA
                        How would you know, Mama?  You 
                        never allow anyone within a mile of 
                        this house!

           Mary stares ahead, a faraway look in her eyes.

           A DOG BARKS.  We cannot tell if real or imagined.

                                 MARY
                        Trust me.  I know.

                                 ELDA
                        Like it or not, one day I’m gonna 
                        get married and leave this place.  

                                 MARY
                        You’re full of pretty stories.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s not stories, Mama.

           She moves to the window, lost in her fantasy.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        He’ll be handsome and ride a big 
                        white horse.  We’ll move to an 
                        estate in the country.  Maybe get a 
                        little cottage out back just for 
                        you.

                                 MARY
                        You’ve been readin’ that “Jane 
                        Whore” again, haven’t you?

                                 ELDA
                        Eyre, Mama.  “Jane Eyre.”  It’s 
                        just a book.

                                 MARY
                        I told you, I don’t want you 
                        reading that smut.  It puts ideas 
                        in your head and gets you all riled 
                        up.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY(cont'd)
                        Ain’t no man ever gonna come for 
                        you.  Ya hear me?  Nevah!  Nevah!

                                 ELDA
                        Why must you chase away any dream I 
                        ever have?

                                 MARY
                        Settle down, clackety-clack!  

                                 ELDA
                        Alright, Mama.  Then why was he 
                        here?  Huh?

           Mary slams down the paring knife.  Wipes her hands on a tea 
           towel.

                                 MARY
                        You wanna know why?  He stopped by 
                        to wish you happy birthday.

           Elda reels.  A beat while the news registers.

                                 ELDA
                        Birthday?!  Mama, today is my 
                        birthday?

                                 MARY
                        Mmm-hmmm.

                                 ELDA
                           (to herself)
                        The 16th of August is my birthday.

                                 MARY
                        I shoulda told ya sooner.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, Mama!

           Elda moves to hug her.  Mary shrinks back.

                                 MARY
                        He left something for you.

           Elda’s hand flies to her chest, breathless.  

                                 ELDA
                        What?  Where?!

           Mary points.  Elda races into...
           INT. PARLOUR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           A BEAUTIFULLY WRAPPED GIFT sits on the table.

           Elda grabs the box.  Mary appears in the doorway.

                                 ELDA
                        I ain't never had no package like 
                        this before.  It's so beautiful!

                                 MARY
                        He wanted to give you something 
                        special.  I hope you like it.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, I’m sure I will.  I’m just sure 
                        I will!

           Elda kneels on the floor.  The package before her.  She lifts 
           the lid and removes a BOOK, a puzzled look on her face.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                           (reading)
                        “Venereal Diseases of the Mouth?”

           Elda opens the book to see a PHOTO OF A MOUTH COVERED IN 
           SORES.  She flings the book away in disgust, her eyes wide.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Aaaa!

           She scrambles to her feet.  

                                 MARY
                        The world is full of disease and 
                        men.

           Elda rushes from the room.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                           (calling after her)
                        They kill anything of beauty.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Elda scrubs a dress on a washboard which rests inside a 
           galvanized metal tub.  Her eyes red from crying.

           Behind her, she HEARS LEAVES RUSTLE.  A TWIG SNAPS.
           Elda spins.  Looks at the overgrown hedge running along the 
           back of the property.

                                 ELDA
                        Hello?

           Nothing.

           She returns to her washing.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           BIRDS CHIRP.  Sunlight streams through the window.  

           Elda sits at the dining room table reading aloud from a 
           McGuffey Reader, an antiquated school book.  Mary stands 
           behind her, braiding her hair.

                                 ELDA
                        “We sat in the grass next to a 
                        brook, and drank in the warmth of 
                        the sun.  I turned to look at my 
                        lover, at his parted lips while he 
                        slept.  The lips that held the 
                        promise of a kiss that was mine and 
                        mine alone.”
                           (putting down the book)
                        Can we stop now?  I'm tired.

                                 MARY
                        Did you review your spelling?

                                 ELDA
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 MARY
                        Anagnorisis.

                                 ELDA
                        “Anagnorisis.”
                           (spelling)
                        A-N-A-G-N-O-R-I-S-I-S.  
                        Anagnorisis.

                                 MARY
                        Derivation?

                                 ELDA
                        Greek.

                                 MARY
                        Sentence?
           Elda hesitates.  She bows her head in shame.

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t remember what it means.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a character in a Greek tragedy 
                        whose true nature is ultimately 
                        revealed.

                                 ELDA
                        Sorry, Mama.

                                 MARY
                        What happens to ignorant girls?

                                 ELDA
                        They get gang-raped by toothless 
                        carnival men with dirty 
                        fingernails.

                                 MARY
                        Now get along to your chores.

           Elda closes the book and gets up from the table.  She bites 
           her lip, knowing better, but still...

                                 ELDA
                        I saw the yellow vehicle again.

                                 MARY
                        So?

                                 ELDA
                        Why can’t I go to a real school?

                                 MARY
                        You know why.  The world is a 
                        dangerous place filled with awful 
                        things.  You're better off here.  
                        With me.

                                 ELDA
                        In my books young ladies meet 
                        gentlemen at cotillions and social 
                        functions, so I thought --

           Mary thrusts a broom into Elda’s hands.

                                 MARY
                        Sweep the porch while I’m gone.
           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           Elda stands in the doorway.

           Mary puts on her gloves as she moves down the walkway.  She 
           wears a hat and shawl, dressed for town.

                                 MARY
                        ...And don’t feed that cat.  It’s 
                        feral.

                                 ELDA
                        Boots isn’t feral.

                                 MARY
                           (disdainfully)
                        Boots.

           Mary disappears behind the foliage.

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY (LATER)

           Elda sits forlornly on the porch steps playing with a small 
           BLACK CAT WITH WHITE PAWS.  A broom rests against the 
           railing.  

           A SCHOOL BUS FILLED WITH KIDS passes the house.  

           The bus BACKFIRES and the cat springs off her lap.

                                 ELDA
                        Boots!

           EXT. YARD - DAY

           The cat races across the yard, Elda in pursuit.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           The cat disappears into a field.  Elda follows.

                                 ELDA
                        Kitty?!

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A FLASH OF BLACK streaks across the road.  Elda follows a 
           split second behind.  
           She darts into the path of an approaching CAR.  The driver 
           BLASTS THE HORN.  Elda spins on her heel and falls backward, 
           the vehicle narrowly missing her.  

           She scrambles to her feet, shaken.  Looks across the street 
           to see...

           A two-story brick building.  SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL spelled 
           out in metallic letters.

           TWO JOCKS IN A TRANS AM barrel into the parking lot, HIP HOP 
           BLASTING from their car stereo.

           Elda instinctively grooves to the music, as if it possesses 
           her.  She pop-locks, her natural ability evident.  The effect 
           is both unsettling and compelling. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           A nameplate reading “Miriam Anderson - Principal” rests at 
           the edge of a meticulously organized desk.  Behind which 
           sits...

           PRINCIPAL ANDERSON, 40s, officiously put-together, wearing a 
           matching tailored jacket and skirt.  She hears:

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?

           Principal Anderson looks up to see Elda, standing in the 
           doorway.  Is this a joke?

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        Yes?

                                 ELDA
                        I’d like to enroll, please.

           Principal Anderson raises an eyebrow.

           INT. ELDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elda works at her loom.  She passes a shuttle back and forth 
           through the shed, pulling the reed of the loom forward after 
           each pass. 

           Elda wears a floor length gown, her long braided hair 
           cascading down from underneath a sleeping cap.

           A SMALL PEBBLE hits her window with a TICK.  She turns toward 
           the window.
           ANOTHER PEBBLE.  TICK.  She lays down the shuttle.  Peers 
           into the darkness.

           A third PEBBLE.  Elda draws back, alarmed.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           CRICKETS CHIRP.  Elda carries a kerosene lamp to LIGHT her 
           path.

                                 ELDA
                        Hello?  Is someone there?

           She waits for a beat.  Nothing.  She turns to go inside.

                                 ELDA (CONT'D)
                           (gasping)
                        Ahhh!

           The light REVEALS A HEART-SHAPED CIRCLE OF STONES in the 
           grass.  A small plastic bottle of hand lotion lies in the 
           center.

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           Mary naps in a wicker chair, a fly swatter on her lap.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.  Mrs. Winnows?

           Mary opens her eyes to see Principal Miriam Anderson standing 
           before her.  The Principal holds a manila folder in her hand.

                                 MARY
                        Yes?

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        I'm Miriam Anderson with the 
                        Spartanburg School District.  Elda 
                        came to see me yesterday.  Your 
                        grand... child?

                                 MARY
                        Daughter.  Not that it’s any 
                        concern of yours.

           Principal Anderson studies Mary’s face.  Is she serious?

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        Actually it is.  She stopped by to 
                        enroll.
           A mixture of surprise and betrayal washes over Mary’s face.

                                 MARY
                        Elda is home-schooled.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        I suspected as much, given her... 
                        proclivities... but there’s no 
                        paperwork on file.

                                 MARY
                        My daughter won’t be going to your 
                        school.  She’s better off here.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        Mrs. Winnows, we have a very strict 
                        truancy policy in this county.  A 
                        number of standards need to be met 
                        before we approve home-schooling.  
                        Elda will have to attend public 
                        school in the meantime.

           She hands Mary a little blue card.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        If she doesn’t report to the 
                        registrar tomorrow, I’ll have to 
                        get protective services involved, 
                        and we may even move to emancipate 
                        her.  Have a good day.

           Principal Anderson turns and walks down the pathway.  Mary 
           looks back at the house.  Her lips tight.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           An overgrown hedge, thick with entwined vines and gnarled 
           branches.  Elda sits on the ground, her head resting on the 
           hedge.  She SOBS.

                                 SOFT LILTING VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please don't cry.

           Elda GASPS and sits upright.  The voice is high-pitched with 
           a slightly effeminate drawl, though still recognizably male.

                                 SOFT LILTING VOICE (O.S.)
                        I didn’t mean to frighten you.  I 
                        don't like to hear anyone so 
                        unhappy.
           Elda peers through the overgrowth.  A darkened shape visible 
           on the other side.

                                 ELDA
                        Who are you?

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        My name is Shelby.  We moved here 
                        about a month ago.

                                 ELDA
                        I'm Elda.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        I heard you playing Liebestraum the 
                        other night.  It’s my favorite.

                                 ELDA
                        You heard me on the piano?  Oh my!  
                        I’m so embarrassed.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        Don’t be.  You play beautifully.

                                 ELDA
                        I find it unforgivably cruel to 
                        make fun of me so.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        I wasn’t making fun.  I could 
                        listen to your fingers dance across 
                        the keys all night.  Such lovely 
                        hands deserve to be protected.

           She looks at Shelby.  A realization.

                                 ELDA
                        The lotion!  That was you?

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        Your music is a gift.  I wanted to 
                        give you something in return.  Why 
                        were you crying?

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, I’ve never gone to a real 
                        school before.  I afraid people 
                        won’t like me -- that I won’t fit 
                        in.  You must think me silly.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        Not at all.  It would be weird if 
                        you weren’t nervous.
           Elda approaches the hedges.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        Stay back!

                                 ELDA
                        I’d like to see you.

                                 SHELBY
                        No.  You won’t think I’m 
                        attractive.

                                 ELDA
                        I’m not like that.

           A DOOR OPENS in the distance and another voice, high-pitched 
           and effeminate, calls out.

                                 SHELBY’S PARENT (O.S.)
                        Shelby!  Time to come in.

                                 SHELBY (O.S.)
                        Yes, Dad!
                           (then, to Elda)
                        I have to go.

           LEAVES RUSTLE.  Shelby is gone.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Elda packs her lunch into a wicker picnic basket.  Mary sits 
           before a large colander snapping beans.

           Elda, flushed, presses her hands to her cheek.

                                 ELDA
                        My gosh.  I’m a nervous wreck.  How 
                        do I look, Mama?

                                 MARY
                        Like a skull on a stick.

                                 ELDA
                        I know you’re upset, but it’s time 
                        for me to meet people.  To live my 
                        life.

                                 MARY
                        You have no idea how cruel it can 
                        be out there, Elda.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY(cont'd)
                        You’re like a  dumb piece of corn 
                        riding toward the grist mill, 
                        waiting to be crushed into meal.

                                 ELDA
                        Please, Mama, you’re scaring me.  
                        Can’t you be happy for me just this 
                        once?  Think of it as a young lady 
                        making her debut into society.

                                 MARY
                        Why, of course!  Like a debutante!

                                 ELDA
                        Yes!

                                 MARY
                        So now my daughter thinks she’s a 
                        member of the Social Register?

           Mary waves her arms, majestically.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, may I present 
                        Miss Jangley Bones.

           Elda glances at the clock.

                                 ELDA
                        Goodness.  8:15!

           She grabs her lunch basket and bolts.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Elda stands at the side of the road, the wicker basket 
           clenched in her fist.

           The bus pulls to a stop.  Elda bites her lower lip and places 
           her foot on the first step.  

           She spins toward home.  The porch is empty.  She looks back 
           to the bus, exhales and climbs aboard.

           EXT. SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           General mayhem as students make their way to class.

           Elda stands on the lawn in front of the school.  Her eyes 
           swim across the sea of teens, her face hopeful.
           A GROUP OF GIRLS approach.  Elda curtsies.  The girls look at 
           Elda incredulously and burst into PEALS OF LAUGHTER.

           Elda watches them pass.  She looks at their short skirts and 
           fitted tops.  She glances down at her own floor-length woolen 
           dress.

           A JOCK passes.  Elda coquettishly drops a handkerchief.  His 
           tennis shoe grinds it into the grass.  Her face falls.

           CLOSE ON CLEAVAGE.  The rack belongs to CYNDI MILLER, 20, 
           devastatingly beautiful, wearing a crop top and talking on 
           her cell.

                                 CYNDI
                           (into phone)
                        Rob!  You’re such a liar!  I saw 
                        Dave at the party, so you weren’t 
                        hanging with him.  Where were you? 

           She is intercepted by TERSHELLE LEONARD, 17, a walking 
           Noxzema ad.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Hey, Bee-yotch!

                                 CYNDI
                           (into phone)
                        Talk to you later.  Tershelle’s 
                        here.

           She hangs up.  She and Tershelle air kiss.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        Fuck he pisses me off!

           Tershelle rolls her eyes.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Let me guess.  Rob?  Call the 
                        Action News Team.

                                 CYNDI
                        If you knew he was fucking around, 
                        you’d tell me, right?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Of course.  Cyndi, it doesn’t say 
                        much if you can’t trust him.

                                 CYNDI
                        I know.
                                 TERSHELLE
                        Sooo.... I just got off the phone 
                        with Robyn.

           Tershelle grimaces, not wanting to be the messenger.

                                 TERSHELLE (CONT’D)
                        She’s gonna call... after her x-
                        ray.

                                 CYNDI
                        Fuck!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Don’t get your thong in a wad.  We 
                        don’t know anything yet.

                                 CYNDI
                        Well “x-ray” can’t be good, now can 
                        it?

           They are joined by SUSAN LITTELL, 16, pretty with large eyes 
           and a small brain.  Her arms full of books.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hey!

                                 TERSHELLE / CYNDI
                        Morning, Susan.

           Tershelle looks at the book titles.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        “Surviving Menopause,” “Psychic 
                        Pets,” “Self Breast Examination for 
                        Dummies?”  W-T-F?

                                 SUSAN
                        My chiropractor said the weight of 
                        my boobs is putting a strain on my 
                        back, so she wants me to build up 
                        my muscles by carrying these.

                                 CYNDI
                        Won’t that just be more weight up 
                        front?

                                 SUSAN
                        She’s a medical doctor, Cyndi.

                                 CYNDI
                        Who massages your bush with a warm 
                        rock to bring you good luck.
                                 SUSAN
                        You can laugh, but it works.  Now I 
                        do it before every performance.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Way too much information.

           Cyndi turns.  Smacks into Elda.

                                 CYNDI
                        Watch where you’re going!

           The girls stare at Elda, shocked by her appearance.  Elda 
           fumbles nervously.

                                 ELDA
                        I’m sorry.  I was looking for my 
                        class schedule.

                                 CYNDI
                        Well, Mother Hubbard, have you 
                        checked your cupboard?

           The GIRLS LAUGH and continue on their way.  Elda stands, 
           dejected.

           A SCHOOL BELL RINGS.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS – DAY

           Raised lab desks littered with Bunsen burners and various 
           flasks.  Students sit on stools behind desks, two to a table.

           MS. DANIELLE MASTERSON, mid-30s, shapely and tall, stands 
           with Elda at the front of the room.  Elda stares at the 
           floor.

           A periodic chart hangs on the wall behind them.

                                 MS. MASTERSON
                        Everyone.  This is Elda Winnows.  
                        She'll be joining us for the rest 
                        of the year.

           ROB and DAVE, the two Trans Am jocks we saw earlier, SNICKER.

                                 MS. MASTERSON
                        Is there a problem, you two?

                                 ROB
                        No.  We’re good.
           Ms. Masterson places her hand on Elda’s shoulder and points 
           toward the back row.  

                                 MS. MASTERSON
                        Why don't you take that empty seat 
                        next to Kevin?

           Elda looks past Rob and Dave to see KEVIN LUCE, 16, lanky and 
           adorable.  She stares, thunderstruck by his handsome good 
           looks.

           Rob spins around toward Kevin.

                                 ROB
                        You should tap that.  At least 
                        it’ll be clear who plays the girl.

                                 KEVIN
                        Good point.  How do you and Cyndi 
                        work it out?

                                 DAVE
                        Fuck off, faggot.

                                 KEVIN
                        Lick my puckerhole, bitch monkey.

                                 MS. MASTERSON
                        HEY!  Knock it off!

           Elda slides into the empty seat.  Smooths her hair.  Kevin 
           nods at her.

                                 KEVIN
                        ‘Sup?

           Elda GIGGLES coquettishly, HICCUPS then BURPS.

           INT. HALLWAY – DAY

           Elda stands before her locker, in deep concentration.  She 
           holds a piece of paper in her hand and spins the combo lock 
           to and fro.  

           TWO GIRLS talk at an open locker a few feet away.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Just try out.

                                 GIRL 2
                        No way.  It’s too scary.
           Elda pulls the handle and the locker opens.  She GASPS.  
           Looks at the locker with amazement.

                                 GIRL 1
                        You’re always complaining how you 
                        don’t fit in.  You wanna be 
                        popular, right?

                                 GIRL 2
                        Of course I wanna be popular.

           Elda turns toward them, all ears.  

                                 GIRL 1
                        So audition.

                                 GIRL 2
                        I don’t know --

                                 GIRL 1
                        I’ve seen you dance.  You’ve got 
                        the moves.  And once you’re a 
                        Sparkler, every guy at school is 
                        gonna be hot for you. 

                                 ELDA
                        Excuse me?  What’s a Sparkler?

           Rob and Dave pass.  Rob pushes Dave into Elda, slamming her 
           into the locker.

           Dave recovers and shoves Rob.

                                 DAVE
                        Anus flake!

           Rob LAUGHS as they continue down the hall.  Elda rubs her 
           shoulder.  She looks over.  The girls are gone.

           INT. CAFETERIA – DAY

           The United Nations of high school, each table a different 
           clique.  There is much LAUGHING, CHATTERING, and CLANGING OF 
           SILVERWARE AND TRAYS.

           Elda scans the room.  Her hand tightly clutches her picnic 
           basket.

           AT THE JOCK TABLE

           Rob holds court.
                                 ROB
                        ... so my mom gets a call, and it’s 
                        a picture of this dude’s Johnson.  
                        She had my sister’s phone!

           The group LAUGHS.  

           Elda slides into an empty chair.  She LAUGHS, an attempt to 
           be part of the group.

           All heads turn and look at her in disbelief.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck out of here, freak!
                           (he points)
                        Your table’s over there.

           AT THE GAY TABLE

           Elda approaches a group of effeminate gay boys.  A GAY BOY 
           holds out his arm, blocking her.

                                 GAY BOY
                        We’re only into straight-acting 
                        boys.  Sorry, girlfriend.

           Elda turns away, puzzled.

           AT THE GOTH TABLE

           Lots of black hair, eye makeup, and heavy jewelry.  Elda 
           stands next to a GOTH GIRL.

                                 GOTH GIRL 
                        Are you into The Cure?

                                 ELDA
                        There’s a cure now?  When I had 
                        polio Mama said it had to run its 
                        course.

           The Goths look at each other, a bit uncomfortable.

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Okay... you’re a little too weird 
                        even for us.
           AT THE MISFIT TABLE

           A GUY IN A BACK BRACE sits alone.  He is gawky, peculiar-
           looking, with long hair.  He looks up at Elda and smiles.  
           She pauses, then moves on.

           AT THE SPARKLERS TABLE

           Team captain Cyndi and not-so-bright Susan eat side by side.  
           Tershelle approaches with her tray and sits across from them.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        It’s a hairline fracture.  Robyn 
                        can’t walk without crutches.  Six 
                        weeks.

                                 CYNDI
                        Six weeks?!  That’s great.  Just 
                        fuckin’ great.

                                 SUSAN
                        So she can’t walk without crutches.  
                        It doesn’t mean she can’t dance.

           Cyndi looks at Susan incredulously.

                                 CYNDI
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SUSAN
                        Maybe it’s like an accent.  You 
                        know how English people are all 
                        “cheerio chap” and shit when they 
                        talk, but when they sing, they 
                        don’t have an accent?

           Susan smugly looks at the girls, proud of her analytical 
           reasoning skills.

                                 CYNDI
                        It must suck to lose brain cells 
                        when you take a dump.

           Susan’s face falls.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        We’ve got time.  We’ll come up with 
                        something.

                                 CYNDI
                        We are so fucked.
           Elda appears at their table.  She curtsies nervously.

                                 ELDA
                        Hello.  May I join you?

                                 CYNDI
                        Look!  It’s Little Orphan Tranny!

           Tershelle and Susan CRACK UP.

                                 ELDA
                        No.  My name’s Elda.

                                 CYNDI
                           (overly cheerful)
                        Hi!  I’m “I don’t give a shit.” 
                           (pointing to Tershelle and 
                            Susan)
                        And that’s “You’re interrupting us” 
                        and “Fuck off you fugly freak.”

           Tershelle and Susan wave as Cyndi “introduces” them.

           Elda stands frozen with embarrassment.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  This is when you slink away 
                        and leave us alone.  No words 
                        necessary.  Buh-bye now.

           Cyndi turns back toward the girls.  Elda shuffles away.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Harsh, Cyndi!

           BACK AT THE MISFIT TABLE

           Elda sits down and smiles at Back Brace Boy.  He stands and 
           leaves.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           MR. GRAYSON, 30s, walks along the rows, passing back papers.  

           “JANE EYRE” written in large letters on the blackboard.  

           Elda sits in the back row.  Cyndi, Tershelle, and Back Brace 
           Boy are seated toward the front.
                                 MR. GRAYSON
                        Since it appears no one is doing 
                        the reading, tomorrow you’re 
                        responsible for the next two 
                        chapters of “Jane Eyre,” and there 
                        will be a quiz.

           The CLASS GROANS.  Elda smiles with delight.  Mr. Grayson 
           looks at her.

                                 MR. GRAYSON (CONT’D)
                        And dressing like Charlotte Bronte 
                        will not earn you extra credit.

           The CLASS LAUGHS.  Elda notices all eyes on her.  She tries 
           to make herself as small as possible.  The BELL RINGS.

           Back Brace Boy stands to leave.

                                 MR. GRAYSON (CONT’D)
                           (to Back Brace Boy)
                        When am I getting a paper from you?

                                 BACK BRACE BOY
                        I’ll turn it in tomorrow.

           His voice is lilting and effeminate.  Elda knows that 
           voice.... SHELBY!

           Elda tries to catch him, but he’s out the door.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Elda scans the crowd.  No sign of him.

           INT. GYM – DAY

           PERCUSSIVE MUSIC.  GIRLS IN WORKOUT CLOTHES rehearse a 
           choreographed dance routine. 

           COACH TESLEY, early 30s, watches carefully.  She wears cotton 
           shorts and a spandex top.  

           Elda appears in the doorway.  She stares, mesmerized by the 
           girls’ moves.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Make it sharp!  Really hit those 
                        positions.  Come on, Sparklers!  
                                 ELDA
                           (to herself)
                        Sparklers?!

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        You're off the beat, Susan.  Pick 
                        it up!  There ya go!

           Cyndi and Tershelle rush toward each other.  Tershelle lands 
           an aerial cartwheel.  Cyndi puts her hands down and collides 
           with Tershelle on the way up.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Damn, girl!

                                 COACH TESLEY
                           (yelling)
                        Stop!  Stop!  

           Coach Tesley walks to a boom box and TURNS OFF THE MUSIC.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Grab some water.

           The girls towel off, grab water, stretch.  Tershelle moves to 
           her gym bag, followed by Cyndi.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        You almost took off my weave.

                                 CYNDI
                        Sorry.

           Coach Tesley approaches.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        I think we should cut the tumbling 
                        pass.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Not if you want to get to 
                        nationals.  The team needs air.  
                        You gotta nail it, Cyndi.

           Coach Tesley notices Elda standing in the doorway.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  This is a closed practice.  
                        No spectators!  Out!

           Elda backs out of the room.  Coach Tesley does a double-take.
                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell was that?

           EXT. SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Elda rushes out of the building as the bus pulls out of the 
           parking lot into the street.

                                 ELDA
                        Wait!

           She exhales, resigned.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           LIGHT RAIN falls.

           Elda walks at a clip, head down, her wicker basket clutched 
           to her chest.  

           A Trans Am glides to a stop next to her.  Rob drives with 
           Dave riding shotgun.

                                 ROB
                        Hey!  Want a lift?

           Elda smiles, her eyes sparkle.

                                 ELDA
                        How very gallant!

                                 ROB
                        Hop in.

           Elda moves to the door.  The CAR LURCHES FORWARD and stops.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that.

           Elda approaches the car.  Grabs the handle.  The CAR LURCHES 
           FORWARD.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Ooops.  My bad.  Come on.

           Elda grabs the handle.  Rob floors it.  TIRES SQUEAL as the 
           car PEELS OUT, throwing GRAVEL into Elda’s face.  The car 
           makes a u-turn and passes Elda.
                                 ROB
                        Hey, idiot!  That trick’s older 
                        than your granny dress!

           The car speeds away.  Elda picks up her pace.  

           A beat.  Elda HEARS a CAR ENGINE REV behind her.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Whack-a-mole!

           Elda turns to see Dave leaning out the car window with a 
           hockey stick.  

           The CAR ACCELERATES.

           She tries to run but they are upon her.  The stick catches 
           her behind the knees, flinging her into the mud.  Her basket 
           flies into a puddle.

           EXT. PORCH – DAY

           Elda tiptoes up the steps and gingerly removes her muddy 
           boots.

           She hurriedly rubs the dirt off her face and smooths her 
           hair.

           INT. DINING ROOM – NIGHT

           Mary and Elda sit across the table from each other.  Their 
           silence interrupted by the CLINK OF UTENSILS.

           Elda stares at her plate, eating without tasting. Mary 
           watches her with smug delight.

                                 MARY
                        One time my daddy took me to the 
                        shore to watch the gulls.  They 
                        were so pretty.  Alabaster white.  
                        Well, this gray gull shows up that 
                        wasn’t like any of the others.  You 
                        know what happened?

                                 ELDA
                        No. 

                                 MARY
                        One of them white gulls came up and 
                        pecked him.  Peck!
           Elda flinches.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Then another gull.  Peck!  In an 
                        instant they all turned on the gray 
                        one.  Peck peck peck peck peck peck 
                        peck peck peck!!

           Elda grips her napkin.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        When they were done, the only thing 
                        left was a beak.

                                 ELDA
                        That's a horrible story.

                                 MARY
                        People are like gulls.  They smell 
                        the weak and the sick...

           Looking at Elda, with meaning.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        ... and the different.

           Elda swallows hard.

                                 ELDA
                        I'm awfully tired.  May I be 
                        excused?

                                 MARY
                        You must think me a liar -- telling 
                        you what a horrible world it is, 
                        when a debutante like yourself has 
                        got nothing to worry about.  You 
                        must be quite popular already.

           Elda stands and moves toward the door.  She pauses.

                                 ELDA
                        Mama?  I’ve been thinking about 
                        school...

                                 MARY
                        So have I.

           Elda spins, her face hopeful.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It might be a good thing for you to 
                        be out in the world.
           Elda’s face falls.  She trudges out of the room.  Mary sips 
           her tea, a self-satisfied smile creeping over her face.

           INT. BUS - DAY (MOVING)

           Elda stares out the window of the bus as they pull into the 
           school parking lot.  Shelby glides into view RIDING A SEGWAY.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Shelby removes his helmet as Elda approaches.  She runs her 
           hands along the Segway.

                                 ELDA
                        I like your riding machine.

                                 SHELBY
                        I wanted a horse.  My parents 
                        bought me a Segway instead.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s nice.
                           (a beat)
                        I’m sorry I walked away yesterday.  
                        I didn’t know it was you.

                                 SHELBY
                        I know I’m not much to look at.

                                 ELDA
                        That’s not it.  I was scared.  I 
                        don’t think I belong here.

                                 SHELBY
                        Of course you do.  You’re just 
                        overwhelmed is all.  Know what 
                        helps me when I’m scared?

                                 ELDA
                        What?

                                 SHELBY
                        Break it down into steps, then 
                        concentrate on the first one.  
                        Nothing else.  It all begins with 
                        one step.

                                 ELDA
                        What does?
                                 SHELBY
                        Anything you truly desire.  I 
                        wanted to meet the girl who plays 
                        such lovely music.  And look... I 
                        have.  

           Elda coyly turns away, embarrassed.  Shelby smiles.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY – DAY

           A large piece of paper posted on the wall.  Huge glittery 
           letters spell “SPARKLER TRY-OUTS!!!”

           Elda stands before the sheet, contemplating.  She bites her 
           lip, turns and walks away.  

           A beat later she returns.

                                 ELDA
                        One step.

           She scribbles her name on the sheet.

           INT. GYM – DAY

           PERCUSSIVE MUSIC.  

           Cyndi, Susan, and Tershelle, wearing gold and purple Sparkler 
           outfits, sit behind a table.  Susan works a boom box.

           A GROUP OF GIRLS IN WORKOUT CLOTHES gather off to the side.  
           Each has a number pinned to her.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        No way!

           Cyndi looks up to see...

           Elda, wearing a full-length dress and audition number.

                                 CYNDI
                        Cinder-fella?!  Hee-fuckin-larious!

           Coach Tesley steps out onto the floor, addressing the group.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Robyn’s out for the rest of the 
                        season, so we’re only looking for 
                        one girl.  You’ve got some big 
                        shoes to fill, ladies.  You ready?  
                        Group One!  Let’s see it.
           Four girls run into position.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Five - six - seven - eight!

           Coach Tesley leads the group in the first part of the 
           combination, then steps aside.  The girls range from mediocre 
           to no talent.  They hit a pose.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Nice job!  Group Two!

           Group One exits as Group Two runs into place, which 
           includes...  

           TANYA MORETTI, the school whore.  Bad highlights.  Tons of 
           makeup.  Skimpy top.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Tanya Moretti is such a skeeze.

                                 CYNDI
                        Just looking at her makes my cooch 
                        itch.

           Elda looks at Tanya.  Notices her ample cleavage.  Elda 
           undoes the top button of her high-necked dress.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Five - six - seven - eight!

           Group Two starts the combination.  Tanya’s boob leaps out of 
           her top.  She dances, unaware.  The girls CRACK UP.

           Group Two hits the closing pose.  Tanya smiles broadly, her 
           breast exposed.  Clueless.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Way to go Group Two!  Tanya... your 
                        friend upstaged you.

                                 TANYA MORETTI
                        Huh?

           Coach Tesley points.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Feel a draft? 

           Tanya looks down and stuffs her breast back into place.  

           Elda quickly re-buttons her top button.
                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT'D)
                        Group Three!  Let’s go!

           Group Three -- Elda’s group -- runs into position.

                                 CYNDI
                        This is gonna be sweet!

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Ready?  Five – six – 

           Coach Tesley sees Elda.  She gestures to Susan -- “kill the 
           music.”  

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Wait!  Wait!  Stop!

           The MUSIC CUTS OUT.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                           (to Elda)
                        Ha ha.  Very funny.  Clear the 
                        floor, please.

           Elda looks around in confusion.  Coach Tesley points at her.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you.

           Elda, embarrassed, scoots off the floor.

                                 CYNDI
                        Coach?

           Cyndi rushes to Tesley and whispers in her ear.  Coach Tesley 
           looks at Elda.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                           (to Elda)
                        Okay.  Sorry.  Come back.

           Elda takes her spot with Group Three.  Coach Tesley nods to 
           Susan.  MUSIC BLASTS.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Five - six - seven - eight!

           Elda attacks the routine with crisp sharp moves.  She 
           trounces everyone else.

           The group hits a pose as the MUSIC ENDS.  A beat of silence.  
           Cyndi, Tershelle, Susan, and Coach Tesley stare in shock, 
           mouths open.
                                 SUSAN
                        Whoa!

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Oh my God!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        “Dude Looks Like a Lady” rocked it!

           A beat.  Coach Tesley shakes off her excitement.  Back to 
           business.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Great job, everyone.  Give 
                        yourselves a hand.

           The girls APPLAUD.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        We'll be making our decision 
                        tonight and post our selection in 
                        the window next to the principal’s 
                        office.

           AT THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN

           Elda GULPS down water.  A GIRL IN LEOTARDS waits behind her.

                                 GIRL IN LEOTARDS
                        You were awesome!  Where did you 
                        learn to dance like that?

                                 ELDA
                        Mama used to chase me around the 
                        house with a skillet.

           Elda moves away, leaving the Girl in Leotards looking 
           perplexed.

           Coach Tesley intercepts Elda.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        By any chance, can you do an aerial 
                        cartwheel?

           INT. COACH TESLEY TESLEY’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Photos of sports teams and memorabilia hang on the wall.  
           Coach Tesley sits on the edge of her desk, facing Tershelle, 
           Susan, and Cyndi, who paces.
                                 CYNDI
                        I’m not gonna let some fugly granny 
                        tranny ruin the team!

                                 SUSAN
                        What’s a tranny?

                                 CYNDI
                        A boy that wants to be a girl.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        You’re overruled, Cyndi.  She was 
                        the best.

                                 CYNDI
                        This is my last shot at Nationals!

                                 SUSAN
                        Listen to the tranny!  He knows 
                        what he’s talking about.

           Cyndi looks at Susan.  Are you kidding me?

                                 CYNDI
                        Susan, how can I be a tranny?  
                        You’ve seen me naked.

                                 SUSAN
                        I know.  You look REALLY good!

                                 CYNDI
                        I’m not the tranny, moron!  We’re 
                        talking about Scrotum Girl.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        You want a chance at Nationals?  
                        Elda is your ticket.

                                 CYNDI
                        But she’s a he!

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Nothing in the books says a 
                        Sparkler has to be female.

                                 CYNDI
                        I’d take an Emo chick with hairy 
                        armpits... even a fat ass who can 
                        move... but that thing...

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        It’s not a beauty contest.
                                 TERSHELLE
                        We can work on her appearance.

                                 SUSAN
                        I have surprisingly hard nipples.

           They all react to Susan.  Huh?

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to contribute, but I 
                        didn’t know what to say.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Listen to your heart, Cyndi.  You 
                        know what’s right.

           Cyndi looks at the group.  She nods begrudgingly.

           INT. PARLOR - NIGHT

           Elda kneels with a skein of yarn looped around her 
           outstretched hands.  Mary sits in her rocking chair, winding 
           the yarn into a ball.

                                 MARY
                        I’ve decided to let you come back 
                        home.  You don’t belong at that 
                        school.

                                 ELDA
                        I want to stay, Mama.

           Mary stops winding the yarn.  Looks at her daughter.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        There’s a group called the 
                        Sparklers.  They dance at football 
                        games and stuff.

                                 MARY
                        Why should I care about something 
                        like that?

                                 ELDA
                        I tried out.

           A beat, then Mary bursts into LAUGHTER.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        It's not a joke, Mama.
                                 MARY
                        Dancing?  You!  Of course it's a 
                        joke.  Clackin’ around like a 
                        demented skeleton...

                                 ELDA
                        I made the team.

           Mary's LAUGHTER SUBSIDES.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m a Sparkler.

                                 MARY
                        Why would you subject yourself to 
                        that kind of embarrassment?

                                 ELDA
                        They think I'm good.  They wouldn't 
                        have picked me otherwise.

                                 MARY
                        Oh, Elda.  Look at yourself.  You 
                        can’t honestly believe that!

                                 ELDA
                        Say what you want.  I’m doing this.

           A beat.  Mary returns to her yarn.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Did you meet father at school?

           Mary’s hands freeze mid-air.  Her jaw tightens.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you ever talk about him, 
                        Mama?  I’ve never even seen his 
                        picture.

           Mary looks at Elda.  Her eyes blazing and fierce.

                                 MARY
                        I burned ‘em all.  He was a vile, 
                        disgusting creature.  Like all men.

           Elda swallows.  Looks away.

           INT. SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICE - DAY

           A SECRETARY stands behind the counter of a drab, 
           institutional-looking office.
           Mary approaches.

                                 MARY
                        Hello.  I’d like a home school 
                        application, please.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           An escalator.  Elda rises into view.  Cyndi, Tershelle, and 
           Susan behind her.  Elda trips at the top and falls.  The 
           girls help her up.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        So, Elda, inquiring minds want to 
                        know... are you a transvestite or a 
                        tranny?

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CYNDI
                        Do you still have your junk?

                                 ELDA
                        No.  Mama made me get rid of it a 
                        long time ago.

                                 CYNDI
                        What?!

                                 SUSAN
                        Your Mom?!  Ewwww!

                                 ELDA
                        Mama doesn’t like any junk lying 
                        around the house.  She likes 
                        everything put in its place.

           The girls exchange a look.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        No.  That’s not what we’re talking 
                        about.  

           Cyndi nods toward Elda’s crotch.

                                 CYNDI
                        We mean your “junk.”

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Did you get it cut off?
           Elda looks at them, puzzled.  Tershelle “cuts” with her 
           fingers across her face.  Elda brightens.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh!  No.  Mama says short hair is 
                        for harlots. 

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda, we’re talking about what 
                        you’ve got between your legs.

           Elda glances around, embarrassed. 

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  It’s just us girls...

           Elda relents.  Leans in confidentially.

                                 ELDA
                           (whispering)
                        Why... I have a dingle dangle, of 
                        course.

                                 CYNDI
                        Of course.

           The girls GIGGLE.  Elda walks to the railing.  Gazes in 
           wonder at the mall.

                                 ELDA
                        This place is like a storybook 
                        land!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        You've never been to a mall?

                                 ELDA
                        Mama doesn't approve of them.

                                 SUSAN
                        So where do you get your clothes?

                                 ELDA
                        I make them.

                                 CYNDI
                        Quelle surprise.
           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

           Elda stands before a department store mirror in a cute dress.  
           The girls on either side of her.  Elda shakes her head no.  
           The girls nod yes.

           Elda in a skirt and sweater.  Elda shakes her head no.  The 
           girls nod yes.

           Elda in a drab floor-length black dress.  Elda nods yes.  The 
           girls shake their heads no.

           INT. MALL FOOD COURT - DAY

           The girls sit around a table with trays of fast food.  A 
           shopping bag at Elda's feet.

           Elda sees Kevin seated across the way.

                                 ELDA
                        He's beautiful.

           The girls follow Elda's gaze.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Kevin Luce?

                                 ELDA
                        He's my science partner.  He's so 
                        handsome.

                                 SUSAN
                        You two would make a cute couple!

                                 CYNDI
                        There’s just one problem.
                           (pointing)
                        That’s what he likes.

           JUSTIN, 16, delicately handsome, slides in next to Kevin.  He 
           takes a bite of corn dog.

                                 ELDA
                        I like corn dogs, too.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Everyone at this table likes corn 
                        dogs.  Holla!

           They girls high-five.  Elda looks at them, perplexed.
                                 SUSAN
                        Except when they jizz in your face.

           Cyndi, Tershelle, and Susan LAUGH.  

           Cyndi turns.  Her smile fades.  

           Rob and Dave stand at a food counter waiting for their order.  
           Tanya Moretti, the school whore, leans against Rob.  Her hand 
           strokes his chest.

                                 CYNDI
                        What the fuck?!

           Cyndi bolts from the table.  Tershelle looks after her.  Sees 
           the trouble.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Oh shit!  Come on.

           Tershelle, Susan, and Elda scramble to their feet.

           AT THE COUNTER

           Cyndi steps between Tanya and Rob.

                                 CYNDI
                           (to Rob)
                        I told you I don’t want you hanging 
                        with her!

                                 TANYA MORETTI
                        It’s a free country.

                                 CYNDI
                        I wasn’t talking to you, Terror 
                        Tits!

                                 TANYA MORETTI
                        Terror Tits?

                                 CYNDI
                        Yeah, your boobs are like a horror 
                        movie.  Just when I think I’m safe, 
                        they keep popping up.

           Tershelle, Susan, and Elda join them.

                                 ROB
                           (to Cyndi)
                        Chillax, will ya?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROB(cont'd)
                        We’re just talking.  Don’t get all 
                        psycho bitch.

                                 ELDA
                        Don’t speak to her that way.

           Everyone looks at Elda, surprised.

                                 ROB
                        What did you say, Dick Chick?

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda, I can handle this.

           Elda steps forward.  She gets in Rob’s face.

                                 ELDA
                        A gentleman should treat a lady 
                        with respect.  Not say hurtful 
                        things to her.

                                 ROB
                        Wow.  You’re right.  I feel real 
                        bad.  
                           (he bows, formally)
                        My apologies, your ladyship.

           Elda curtsies.

                                 ELDA
                        Apology accepted, but tell Cyndi 
                        you’re sorry.  Not me.

                                 ROB
                        Oh... one more thing...

           Rob nails Elda in the crotch.  Elda goes down.  Cyndi rushes 
           to her side.

                                 CYNDI
                           (to Rob)
                        You asshole!

                                 ROB
                           (to Elda)
                        Thanks for the lesson... freak!

           He leaves with Dave and Tanya.

                                 TERSHELLE
                           (calling after them)
                        Have fun with Chlamydia!
                                 CYNDI
                           (to Elda)
                        I told you to stay out of it.  Why 
                        did you have to butt in?

                                 ELDA
                        My dingle dangle hurts so bad.

                                 CYNDI
                        Hey!  I know something that’ll make 
                        you feel better.

           INT. CYNDI'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           We HEAR a RIP and Elda SCREAMS.

           QUICK CUTS:

           -- Cyndi holds a strip of fabric covered in wax and hair.  A 
           smooth swath of skin visible on Elda’s hairy back.

           -- Elda leans back, her head in a sink.  Cyndi shampoos her 
           hair.

           -- The WHIR OF A BLOW DRYER.  Tershelle twists a brush 
           through Elda's hair.

           -- CLOSE ON Elda's eye, magnified in a vanity mirror.  A hand 
           applies mascara.

           -- CLOSE ON Elda’s lips.  An applicator adds sheen.

           The girls look at their work.

                                 CYNDI
                        Ready?

                                 ELDA (O.S.)
                        Uh-huh.

           Tershelle holds up a mirror.  Elda stares at her reflection.  
           Her hair in a French braid, eyebrows arched, face made up.  
           Still not much of an improvement.

           Elda GASPS, tears welling up in her eyes.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh my God!  I’m so pretty!  I’m a 
                        pretty girl!

           The girls exchange an incredulous look.  Tershelle teeters 
           her hand to and fro making a “so-so” gesture.
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Mary walks with her arms full of folded linens.  She looks at 
           the door, slightly ajar, at the end of the hallway.

           She pauses.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Mary, twenty years younger, nears the door.  Her face fresh 
           and hopeful.  A noticeable baby bump.

           We HEAR FAINT MOANING coming from within.

                                 MARY
                        Henry?

           She grips the doorknob and swings the door open to reveal...

           A HAND holding a HONEY BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE.

           Mary GASPS.  Hands fly to her mouth.  The linens fall to the 
           floor.

           AN ENORMOUS GREAT DANE/SHEPHERD MIX bolts from the bedroom, 
           knocking her against the door jamb.

           CLOSE ON Mary’s face, contorted.  Her mouth opens...

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           We HEAR A PIERCING SCREAM.  Shrill and prolonged.  CROWS 
           perched in the tree next to the house take to the air with a 
           SQUAWK.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY (AS BEFORE)

           Mary SLAMS the door shut.  The folded linens still in her 
           arms.

           EXT. CAR WASH – DAY

           A large handmade sign which reads “WET YOUR FAVORITE 
           SPARKLER!”
           The Sparklers, clad in bikinis, throw soapy sponges and chase 
           each other with buckets of water.

           Susan collects money from customers.

           Elda wears a vintage bathing suit that resembles long 
           underwear with a skirt.  She puts on a pair of fashionable 
           sunglasses and poses.  Cyndi and Tershelle spray her with 
           water.

           INT. AUDITORIUM – DAY

           A placard onstage reads “SPARTANBURG’S GOT TALENT.”  We HEAR 
           “Flight of the Bumblebee” as Elda works a loom.  

           She pulls off an area rug just as the MUSIC ENDS.  

           Perplexed reactions from the students.

           INT. ELDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elda stares at her reflection.  She wears glitter eye shadow 
           and lip gloss.  She glues an appliqué heart to her cheek.  

           Mary appears next to her.

                                 MARY
                        When I was a young girl, an organ 
                        grinder would parade his monkey 
                        through town beggin’ for coins.  
                        BoBo.  His face was done up just 
                        like yours.

                                 ELDA
                        Please, Mama!  I'm nervous enough 
                        as it is.

                                 MARY
                        If I give you a penny, will you 
                        dance me a jig?

           INT. ROOM OFF THE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           The Sparklers, clad in purple crop tops and gold skirts, 
           stand in a circle.

           They CLAP RHYTHMICALLY -- their version of a club handshake.  
           Elda joins in, thrilled to be part of the ritual.
                                 SPARKLERS
                        Say what?  We own it.  Our moves 
                        are gonna show it.  We're here.  So 
                        smell us.  We know that you are 
                        jealous.  We what?  We rock it.  A 
                        win is in our pocket!

           The girls hug each other.

                                 SPARKLERS
                           (ad lib)
                        Good luck!  Let’s rock this shit  
                        out!, etc.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Listen to the music and stay on the 
                        beat!  I wanna see tight 
                        formations!

           She picks up a ROCK from the table, a puzzled expression on 
           her face.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Does this belong to anybody?

           She holds it to her cheek.

                                 COACH TESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  It’s warm.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh!  That’s mine.

           Susan takes it.  Cyndi and Tershelle look at each other and 
           CRACK UP.

                                 ELDA
                           (to Susan)
                        I’m so nervous.  How do I look?

                                 SUSAN
                        As good as can be expected.

                                 ELDA
                        Thanks!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Oh, Elda!  Spirit ribbons.

                                 ELDA
                        What?
           Tershelle holds up her ponytail.  It is tied with gold 
           ribbon.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        You need a spirit ribbon.  Hurry!

           Elda frantically scans the dressing tables.  She spots a 
           purple ribbon and grabs it.

           A HAND slams down on hers.  It belongs to Cyndi.

                                 CYNDI
                        Only team captain wears purple.  
                        Everyone else wears gold.  There’s 
                        some over there.

           Elda rushes to the table.  Grabs the ribbon.  Looks at her 
           reflection in the mirror and smiles, giddy with nervous 
           excitement.

           INT. GYM – NIGHT

           Spectators fill the stands.  

           An electronic scoreboard reads “SPARTANS 32, COUGARS 28.”  
           BASKETBALL PLAYERS line the front row.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Make some noise for the award-
                        winning Spartanburg 
                        Sparkleeerrrssss!

           The SPARKLERS sprint onto the floor and strike their opening 
           pose.  Elda stands front and center.

           IN THE STANDS 

           Coach Tesley watches nervously.

           People notice Elda.  Nudge each other.  Titters of LAUGHTER.

           Cyndi and Tershelle, smiles frozen, exchange a look.  Uh-oh.  

           Elda scans the crowd.  All eyes on her.  A few people point.  
           LAUGHTER SPREADS.  Doubt flits across her face.

           Suddenly, Elda catches a glimpse of Mary.  Looks again to 
           make sure, but a spectator shifts, blocking her view.

           The MUSIC STARTS.
           Elda falters.  Thrown.  A few steps behind.

           She turns the wrong way.  Knocks Tershelle to the ground.  
           Elda offers her hand.  Tershelle pushes her away.  

           Elda struggles to find her place in the routine.  She turns.  
           Face to face with Cyndi.

                                 CYNDI
                        Relax.  Give into the music.  Let 
                        it take you.

           They part.  Something changes within Elda.  Her dancing 
           becomes passionate.  Intense.

           BASKETBALL PLAYER 1 watches Elda.  He nudges his friend.

                                 BASKETBALL PLAYER 1
                        Yo!  Check out low-rent RuPaul!

           Elda attacks the routine with sharp precise moves.

                                 BASKETBALL PLAYER 2
                        That’s some freaky ass shit, man!

           The Sparklers strike their final pose as the MUSIC STOPS. 

           Spectators WHISTLE and STOMP THEIR FEET.  Elda’s chest rises 
           and falls.  She smiles.

           Coach Tesley stands, APPLAUDING WILDLY.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Woo!  Yeah!

           Elda glows, triumphant.  She looks into the crowd.  Mary is 
           gone.  Was she ever there?

           INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

           Elda, carrying a duffel bag, discovers Mary asleep in a chair 
           with a blanket pulled up to her neck.  An open book rests on 
           her lap.

           Elda gently shakes her.

                                 ELDA
                        Mama?

           Mary opens her eyes and stretches.
                                 MARY
                        What time is it?

                                 ELDA
                        It’s late.

                                 MARY
                        How was your little show?

                                 ELDA
                        I thought I saw you there.

                                 MARY
                        Me?  What business would I have 
                        going to something like that?

                                 ELDA
                        They liked me, Mama.  I made people 
                        smile.

                                 MARY
                        I wasn’t aware you were performing 
                        for the deaf, dumb, and blind.

                                 ELDA
                        You’re not gonna get to me tonight.  
                        I feel too good.  I don’t think 
                        I’ve ever been happier.

           Elda kisses Mary on the cheek and bounds out of the room.  
           Mary scowls and rips off the blanket.  She is fully dressed.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS – DAY

           Mr. Grayson leans against his desk.  Elda sits in the front 
           row.  Tershelle and Cyndi seated behind her.

                                 MR. GRAYSON
                        In Victorian times, it was quite 
                        common to lock away the mentally 
                        ill.  Was Rochester right to 
                        confine Berte to the attic?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Hell yeah.  That crazy bitch was 
                        setting fires! 

           Elda leaps out of her seat.  She appeals to the class.

                                 ELDA
                        It was a cry for help!  Berte 
                        wanted to see the world.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELDA(cont'd)
                        Meet a man!  Wouldn’t you set a 
                        fire if you were locked away and 
                        couldn’t escape?  Hello?!

           The class stares at her in stunned silence.

                                 TERSHELLE
                           (to Cyndi)
                        Okay, girlfriend needs to get out 
                        more.

           EXT. TERSHELLE’S HOUSE  - NIGHT

           MUSIC BLARES.  A house party in full swing.  

           Elda stands on the front lawn.  She nervously fiddles with a 
           lace handkerchief.  She watches KIDS through the window.

           She turns to leave and drops the handkerchief.  A HAND swoops 
           in, retrieves the fabric.  Elda looks into the face of Kevin, 
           who stands with his boyfriend, Justin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey, Elda!

           She mouths “Kevin.”  The words won’t come.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the other day.
                           (then, to Justin)
                        We had this dissection in 
                        Masterson’s class.  Elda totally 
                        saved my ass.

           He turns back to Elda.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I owe you big time.  You ever need 
                        a favor, just ask.

           Elda nods, unable to speak.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        You comin’ in?

           Elda nods.

           INT. TERSHELLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           KIDS dance, SHOUT over the music and play drinking games.

           Elda stands in the kitchen with Cyndi, Tershelle and Susan.
                                 ELDA
                        I just stood there.  I couldn’t say 
                        anything.  Gentlemen make me so 
                        nervous.

                                 CYNDI
                        Wait.  You get nervous around 
                        guys?!

           Tershelle hands Elda a large red plastic cup.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        This will help.

           Elda takes a whiff.  A look of alarm.

                                 ELDA
                        Devil water?!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        It’s just a beer.

           Elda hesitates.

                                 CYNDI
                        Let me guess.  You’ve never had a 
                        drink before.

                                 ELDA
                        Mama doesn’t approve of liquor.  
                        She says every time a young lady 
                        drinks, a puppy is born without a 
                        tail.

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s so not true.  My mom drank 
                        when she was pregnant with me, and 
                        I had a tail.

           The girls look at Susan, horrified.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        I got it taken off.  Duh!

           A beat.  Tershelle turns to Elda.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        I don’t see your Mama here.  Do 
                        you?

           Elda smiles.  She downs the cup in one gulp.
                                 SUSAN
                        You’re gonna be soooo popular!

           A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

           Elda drinks.  

           Elda spins a girl around to reveal an elaborate braid.  A 
           LINE OF GIRLS APPLAUD.  The next girl in line eagerly rushes 
           forward, ready for Elda to work her magic.

           Elda drinks.

           She pop-locks with a GROUP OF GUYS.

           Elda drinks.

           A row of red plastic cups.  We HEAR IRISH FOLK MUSIC.

                                 KIDS (O.S.)
                        Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!

           A semi circle of KIDS CLAP and CHANT in time to the music.

           Elda dances a traditional Irish folk jig -- rigid upper body 
           above flailing legs.

           EXT. TERSHELLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kevin and Justin talk on the patio.  Elda approaches, a 
           plastic cup of courage in her hand.

                                 ELDA
                        I want you to take me to the dance.

           Kevin, surprised, looks at Justin, then at Elda.

                                 KEVIN
                        To the Junior Prom?

           Elda nods.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I already made plans with Justin...

                                 ELDA
                        He can come, too.  You said if I 
                        never needed a favor...

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, but --
                                 ELDA
                        I’ve always dreamed of going to a 
                        dance with a boy, even though Mama 
                        won’t like it.

           Kevin looks at Justin.  How can I say no?  Justin shrugs and 
           nods.

                                 KEVIN
                           (to Elda)
                        Okay.  It’s a date.

           Elda beams.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Your mom have a problem with you 
                        being gay, too?

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, yes.  Mama hates when I’m 
                        gay... And I’ve been gay a lot 
                        since I started school.

           Kevin and Justin LAUGH.  They’ve been there.

           INT. TERSHELLE’S HOUSE – NIGHT

           Elda rushes up to Cyndi, Tershelle and Susan, plastic cup in 
           hand.

                                 ELDA
                        I’m going to the dance with a boy!

           She swoons drunkenly.  Tershelle and Cyndi catch her.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my!  I think I’ve got the 
                        vapors!

                                 TERSHELLE
                           (to Cyndi)
                        You know where she lives?

                                 CYNDI
                        Yeah.
                           (then, to Elda)
                        Come on, Lady Nutsack.

                                 ELDA
                        Call me Berte.  I’m never going 
                        back to the attic.  You hear me?  
                        Never!
                                 CYNDI
                        Okay.

           EXT. ELDA’S HOUSE – NIGHT

           Cyndi’s Miata parked in front of the house.  

           Cyndi guides Elda up the walkway.  Elda drinks from a large 
           plastic cup, her other arm slung around Cyndi’s shoulder.

                                 CYNDI
                        Where’s your key?

                                 ELDA
                        You’re like my sister.  I always 
                        wanted a sister.  Promise you’ll 
                        help me.

                                 CYNDI
                        I am helping you.

                                 ELDA
                        No.  Help me escape.

                                 CYNDI
                        Escape from what?

                                 ELDA
                        She’ll try and stop you.  Don’t let 
                        her.  Promise?

                                 CYNDI
                        Yes.  I promise.

           Cyndi reaches into Elda’s pocket.  She GASPS.  Quickly 
           extracts her hand.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 ELDA
                        What?

                                 CYNDI
                        That wasn’t your house key.

           Elda reaches into her pocket and retrieves her key.  Hands it 
           to Cyndi.

                                 ELDA
                        No attic.  I don’t want to be 
                        locked in the attic.
           Elda stops.  She looks at Cyndi, studying her face.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        I used to think you were pretty, 
                        but you’re not.  You’re not pretty 
                        at all.

                                 CYNDI
                        You want me to dump your ass right 
                        here?

                                 ELDA
                        You’re beautiful.  If I looked like 
                        you, I don’t think I could stand 
                        it.   So so beautiful.  

           Cyndi looks away, touched and embarrassed.

                                 CYNDI
                        Come on.  You’re drunk.

           They move toward the door.

                                 ELDA
                        Now you have to tell me I’m 
                        beautiful.  That’s how it works.

                                 CYNDI
                        You’re beautiful... inside, okay?  
                        Let’s get you to bed.  You’re gonna 
                        be in a world of pain tomorrow.

           INT. ELDA’S ROOM - DAY

           Mary flings the curtains open with a WHOOSH.  SUNLIGHT blasts 
           Elda’s face.  She MOANS and lifts her hand to shield herself.  
           A massive hangover.

                                 ELDA
                        Ow!  Mama, what’s your problem?

           Mary rips off the covers.  Throws them to the floor.

                                 MARY
                        Going to the mall... Shakin’ your 
                        bee-hind at football games...

           Mary holds up a red plastic cup.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        ... and now comes the booze.  A 
                        respectable young lady doesn't do 
                        such things.

           Elda lumbers out of bed.

                                 ELDA
                        A teenage girl does, Mama.  
                        Chillax.

                                 MARY
                        Chillax?  I don’t even know what 
                        you’re sayin’ to me.

           Elda grabs her robe.  Passes Mary.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s English, Mama.  It’s the way 
                        teenagers talk.  Why are you all up 
                        in my grill?

           Mary grabs Elda’s arm.  Spins her around.

                                 MARY
                        Someone’s gettin’ a little big for 
                        her britches.

                                 ELDA
                        No.  Someone’s got a life outside 
                        this house, and you’re jealous.

                                 MARY
                        Jealous?  Of you?  Come come, Elda.

                                 ELDA
                        For years you told me what an awful 
                        world existed outside these walls.  
                        I know I’m the gray gull.  I see 
                        that I’m different.  It doesn’t 
                        matter.  People like me anyway.  
                        The world treated you poorly and 
                        you turned your back on it.  Maybe 
                        you got pecked to death, Mama... 
                        but not me.

                                 MARY
                        There’s gonna be some big changes 
                        around here, gal.

                                 ELDA
                        Like what?
           INT. SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Elda SLAMS her locker door, revealing Cyndi, Tershelle, and 
           Susan.

                                 CYNDI
                        Grounded?  How long?

                                 ELDA
                        A month.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        That's so shady!  The prom is this 
                        weekend.

                                 ELDA
                        I’ll have to tell Kevin I can’t go.

                                 CYNDI
                        Screw the dance.  What about 
                        regionals?

                                 ELDA
                        You’ll have to find someone else.  
                        She won’t even let me come to 
                        practice after school.

                                 CYNDI
                        What?!  I knew you’d fuck us over!

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi?!

                                 CYNDI
                        You only got into the Sparklers 
                        because of me.  I... We... need 
                        you.

                                 ELDA
                        Really?  You need me?

                                 CYNDI
                        Yes.

           Elda shakes her head, solemnly.

                                 ELDA
                        Okay.  I won’t let you down.
           INT. ATTIC - DAY

           Elda carries a large dress form across the floor.  She 
           disappears down a flight of stairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           Elda and Mary eat across from each other.  Elda places her 
           utensils on her plate and stands.

                                 ELDA
                        I’m not feeling well, Mama.  I 
                        think I’ll go to bed.

           INT. ELDA’S ROOM - EVENING

           Elda tucks a blanket around the dress form, which lies in her 
           bed.  She grabs her duffel bag and disappears out the open 
           window.  

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           Elda, in antiquated workout clothes, rehearses with the 
           Sparklers.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS – DAY

           A roomful of students.  Elda holds an elastic woven band with 
           a headlamp attached to the front.  She scans the room and 
           slides it into her backpack.

           INT. PARLOUR – DAY

           Mary dozes in her rocking chair.  Elda tiptoes through the 
           room with a small bolt of fabric.

           INT. ATTIC – NIGHT

           Elda guides a swath of fabric through a sewing machine.  A 
           SMALL CIRCLE OF LIGHT from her headlamp illuminates a dress 
           form.  

           She cuts the thread, stands and holds the fabric up to the 
           form.  She turns.  Her elbow hits the dummy.

           In slo-mo, the dress form falls with a DULL THUD.
                                 MARY (O.S.)
                           (calling up)
                        Elda?!

           Elda flicks off the headlamp, plunging the room into 
           DARKNESS.

           We HEAR FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS and Mary enters with a 
           kerosene lamp, ILLUMINATING the room.

                                 MARY
                        Why didn’t you answer me?

                                 ELDA
                        I didn’t hear you.  I was looking 
                        for a spare shuttle and my lamp 
                        went out.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t like hearing sounds in the 
                        attic.  Makes me think we got us a 
                        rat.

           Elda slides past Mary and disappears down the stairs.  Mary 
           glances around the room.

           EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD – DAY

           Elda sits outside with Shelby eating lunch.

                                 ELDA
                        I’ve been practicing so much, I 
                        think my toes are nearly bloodied, 
                        Have you ever been to a dance?

                                 SHELBY
                        No.  I can’t dance.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, everybody says that.  I bet you 
                        can. 

                                 SHELBY
                        No.  Really.  My body doesn’t 
                        metabolize calcium properly.  
                        That’s why I have a Segway and the 
                        brace.  I can’t stand for long 
                        periods or walk too far.  I always 
                        wanted to dance, though.

           He gazes at Elda.
                                 SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Elda?  Would you wear your dress 
                        for me?  I’ve been imagining what 
                        you look like in it.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s too risky.  Besides, I can’t 
                        let Mama find out.

                                 SHELBY
                        No... from your bedroom window.  I 
                        can see you from mine.  Please?

           Elda bites her lower lip, contemplating.

           INT. ELDA’S ROOM – NIGHT

           Elda wears a royal blue satin gown, and admires her 
           reflection in a full-length mirror.  She looks surprisingly 
           elegant.

           She moves to the window and parts the drapes.  She spins.

           INT. SHELBY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Shelby watches Elda spin from afar, framed by her window.  He 
           twirls on his Segway.

           INT. PARLOUR - AFTERNOON

           Elda works the loom while Mary knits in her chair.

           Elda glances at the grandfather clock.  Distracted.  Mary 
           notices.

                                 MARY
                        Why don't you make us some tea?

                                 ELDA
                        Tea?

                                 MARY
                        Yes, tea.

           Elda stands and tentatively moves toward the kitchen.  She 
           makes a show of noticing the clock.
                                 ELDA
                        Oh my.  Look at the time.  
                        Shouldn’t you be headin' into town 
                        before it gets too late?

                                 MARY
                        Sounds like you're trying to get 
                        rid of me.  You fixin' to go 
                        somewhere?

                                 ELDA
                        No, Mama.  I'm grounded.  Remember?

                                 MARY
                        Oh, I remember.  Just making sure 
                        you do, too.

           Elda's mind races.  She sits back down.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Aren't you forgetting something?

                                 ELDA
                        What?  Oh!  The tea.  Yes.

           Elda stands again.  She moves toward the kitchen.

                                 MARY
                        I’m chilly.  Hand me my wrap before 
                        you go.  It's on the loveseat.

           Elda picks up a piece of fabric draped over the chair.  Royal 
           blue satin.  Her blood freezes.

                                 ELDA
                        Where did you get this fabric?

                                 MARY
                        That ol’ thing?  Well, I been 
                        hearin’ sounds coming from the 
                        attic, so I threw everything out 
                        thinkin’ we might have a rat.

                                 ELDA
                        My dress!  My dress was in the 
                        attic!

                                 MARY
                        Oh, was that yours?  It was so big 
                        I thought it was an old tarp.  What 
                        would you need with a dress like 
                        that, anyways?
           The DOORBELL RINGS.  Elda looks up, her eyes wide with 
           terror.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Expecting company?

           Elda tries to speak but the words won't come.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Go to your room.

           Elda stands, frozen.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                           (hissing)
                        To your room!

           Elda bolts.

           INT. FOYER - AFTERNOON

           Mary opens the door.  Kevin stands on the porch dressed in a 
           tux.  He carries a wrist corsage.

                                 KEVIN
                        Mrs. Winnows?  Hi, I'm Kevin.

           Kevin extends his hand.  Mary just looks at it.

                                 MARY
                        What do you want?

                                 KEVIN
                        I'm here to pick up Elda – for our 
                        date?

                                 MARY
                        Elda ain't goin' nowhere.  She's 
                        indisposed.

                                 KEVIN
                        Is she sick?

                                 MARY
                        Yes.  She's got the polio.

           Kevin LAUGHS.

                                 KEVIN
                        Polio?  That’s a good one!

           Mary glares at him.  His smile fades.
                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I thought polio was...

                                 ELDA (O.S.)
                        Mama likes to joke.

           Mary spins to find Elda standing on the stairs.  She wears 
           her drab floor length dress.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to keep you waiting, Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Wow.  You look...
                           (giving up)
                        My car's outside.

           Elda passes Mary.  Mary grabs her arm, fiercely.

                                 MARY
                        Don't you dare leave!  Don't you 
                        walk out that door!

           Elda flings her hand away.  Quickly ushers Kevin outside.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You're grounded!  You hear me?!

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS)

           Mary follows the couple down the walkway.  Elda and Kevin 
           jump into his car.  

                                 MARY
                           (shouting)
                        He’s just using you, Elda!  You’re 
                        gonna be the fool.  Wait and see!  
                        I’m right!

           The ENGINE REVS and SCREECHES away.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m always right.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON (MOVING)

           Kevin drives.  Elda smells her wrist corsage.  She extends 
           her arm and admires it. 
                                 ELDA
                        No one ever brought me flowers 
                        before.

           Kevin looks at her and smiles.

                                 KEVIN
                           (joking)
                        Glad I could be your first.
                           (he CHUCKLES, then)
                        Your mom’s a piece of work...

                                 ELDA
                        Let's not talk about Mama.  Tonight 
                        is about us. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Us? 

           Kevin looks at Elda.  She smiles coquettishly.  He LAUGHS, 
           thinking it a joke.

                                 ELDA
                        I have a confession.  This is the 
                        first dance I've ever gone to with 
                        a boy. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Me, too. 

           Elda smiles, oblivious.

           EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           A procession of students in formal wear walk up the steps 
           into the building.  

           Elda and Kevin follow.  Elda gazes at a huge banner above the 
           entrance which reads “Written in the Stars.”  She takes a 
           luxurious breath and smiles.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Elda and Kevin enter a wonderland of streamers, balloons, and 
           glittering lights.

           A BAND PLAYS on a riser with a dance floor area in front, 
           ringed by cafe tables.

           Elda spots Cyndi, Tershelle, and Susan, all in prom finery.  
           She GASPS then SQUEALS.  Rushes over to them.  Kevin follows.
                                 ELDA
                        You all look so beautiful!

                                 KEVIN
                        Excuse me, ladies.  Time to find 
                        the BF.  

           Kevin wanders off.

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda, where’s your dress?

                                 ELDA
                        Oh.  Mama found it and tore it up.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        What?!  That is so cunty.

                                 ELDA
                        Cunty?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Yeah.  You know, really awful.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s okay.  I’m not gonna let it 
                        get to me.  Tonight has been 
                        magical.

                                 SUSAN
                        I think you look very pretty.

                                 ELDA
                        Really?

                                 SUSAN
                        No.  But isn’t it nice to be told 
                        you look pretty?

                                 ELDA
                        I guess...

                                 CYNDI
                        Susan, do you have to look at 
                        instructions every time you put in 
                        a tampon?

                                 SUSAN
                        Duh!  Yeah.

           Cyndi rolls her eyes.
           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (LATER)

           Kevin and Elda dance.  She is in heaven.

                                 KEVIN
                        I really admire you.  You’ve got 
                        huge balls.

           Elda looks at her dress.

                                 ELDA
                        Where?

                                 KEVIN
                        No.  It’s an expression.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh.

           Justin, wearing a tux, appears at Elda’s side.  He taps her 
           on the shoulder.

                                 JUSTIN
                        May I cut in?

           Elda GIGGLES coyly, and curtsies.

                                 ELDA
                        Of course.

           She opens her arms.  Justin moves past her and grabs Kevin.  
           They dance.

           Elda stands for a beat, confused.

                                 ELDA
                        I’ll get us something to drink.

           The boys are too into each other to notice.  She moves away.

           AT THE REFRESHMENT TABLE

           Elda picks up a drink.  Trans Am Dave slides next to her and 
           pours from a flask into her cup.

                                 ELDA
                        Hey!

           Dave snatches the spiked drink from her hand.
                                 DAVE
                        Thanks.

           Elda gets herself a fresh drink.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        So... what up, Pickle Surprise?

                                 ELDA
                        My name is Elda.

                                 DAVE
                        If I get drunk enough, I might let 
                        you blow me.

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, but Kevin is my escort for 
                        the evening.

           Dave watches Kevin and Justin slow dance.

                                 DAVE
                           (pointing)
                        Looks like you got cock-blocked.

           Elda turns just as Justin and Kevin move in for a kiss.  Elda 
           stares wide-eyed, covering her mouth.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh!

           She rushes to them, pushing them apart.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you two?!

                                 KEVIN
                        Elda!

                                 ELDA
                        That’s not right!  You’ve both got 
                        hoo-haws!

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s your problem?  We had an 
                        agreement.  You knew Justin would 
                        be here.

           Elda turns, puzzled.  Looks for an escape.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Elda!
           EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Elda, distraught, rushes from the auditorium.  Her HEELS 
           CLACKING on the walkway draw the attention of Cyndi, who sits 
           on a cement wall overlooking the parking lot.  

           Cyndi is wasted.  Dried mascara tears stain her cheeks, 
           making her look like a sinister clown.  She swigs from a 40-
           ounce Olde English.

                                 CYNDI
                        Run Cinder-fella!  At midnight your 
                        pussy turns into a dick!

           Cyndi CRACKS UP at her own joke.  

           Elda hastily wipes her cheeks and approaches.

                                 ELDA
                        What are you doing out here?

                                 CYNDI
                        Rob passed out, so I’m getting 
                        shitfaced, too.  
                           (toasting Elda)
                        Happy prom.

           Elda sits down next to her.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

                                 ELDA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CYNDI
                        Pffft!  It’s only a dance.  Who 
                        gives a fuck, right?  Me and Rob 
                        are gonna have the rest of our 
                        lives together after we get 
                        married.

                                 ELDA
                        Married?  Do you love him?

                                 CYNDI
                        Love!?  I'm the cute popular girl.  
                        He's the cute popular boy.  We look 
                        great together.  That's how it 
                        works.

                                 ELDA
                        But that’s not enough.  How does he 
                        make you feel?
           Cyndi puts her hands on Elda’s face and climbs to her feet.  
           She lowers her dress straps and hefts her cleavage.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        Check out my tits.  Perky, right?  
                        I got a flat stomach and nice ass 
                        too.  I’ve peaked. 
                           (shouting)
                        I'm at my fuckin' peak!

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CYNDI
                        It’s all downhill now.  I need to 
                        marry him while I can still land 
                        him, right?  Tick tock tick tock.

           Cyndi sinks back to the ground, sitting very close to Elda.

                                 ELDA
                        That’s sad.

                                 CYNDI
                        You’re gonna pass judgment on me?  
                        Fuck you!

                                 ELDA
                        Sometimes I think we get trapped 
                        into seeing things the way they 
                        are, and we’re afraid to dream 
                        about what’s possible.

                                 CYNDI
                        You think I’m afraid?  Of what?

                                 ELDA
                        You're lead Sparkler.  You’re 
                        pretty and popular.  People look up 
                        to you.  But once you leave the 
                        safety of high school, then what?

           Elda has nailed it.  Cyndi's eyes narrow.

                                 CYNDI
                        You don't know shit.  You still 
                        think some prince is gonna ride up 
                        on his horse and carry you away to 
                        fairytale land.

                                 ELDA
                        Is that so bad?  Don't we all 
                        deserve that?
                                 CYNDI
                        I don't know.

                                 ELDA
                        I think you deserve a prince.

           Cyndi turns toward Elda.

                                 CYNDI
                        You do?

           They move into each other.  A soft tender kiss.  Elda's eyes 
           snap open.  She jolts back.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh no!  I'm sorry!  I didn't mean 
                        to do that!

           The first DROPS OF RAIN fall.

           Cyndi gathers her hair.  Pulls it away from her face.

                                 CYNDI
                        Hold my hair.

                                 ELDA
                        What?

                                 CYNDI
                        My hair!

           Elda grabs Cyndi's hair.  Cyndi lurches forward and vomits.

           RAIN POURS from above.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Elda stands at the sink, ILLUMINATED by MOONLIGHT.  Her hair 
           and clothes drenched.  Her body convulses as she stifles a 
           SOB.  Mary emerges from the shadows.

                                 MARY
                        Mama's here, child.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh, Mama!

           Elda, SOBBING, rushes into Mary’s arms.
                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        I think there’s something wrong 
                        with me!  Everything is all 
                        confused!

                                 MARY
                        I tried to tell you, but you 
                        wouldn't listen.  

                                 ELDA
                        I'm sorry, Mama.

           Mary strokes Elda’s hair.

                                 MARY
                        Men dip their bucket into your 
                        well, trying to quench a thirst 
                        that never dies.  And when they’ve 
                        drained you dry, they turn to the 
                        closest thing at hand to satisfy 
                        their needs.  A watermelon.  A jar 
                        of face cream... or...

           Mary gets a faraway look in her eyes.

           We HEAR A DOG BARKING.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        ... other things.

                                 ELDA
                        It hurts so much.

                                 MARY
                        I tried to protect you.  Lord knows 
                        I tried.  But you’re safe now.  
                        You’ll always be safe... long as 
                        you’re with your Mama.

           Elda slowly nods.  Maybe Mama is right...

           EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

           Shelby and Elda sit on bleachers bordering a running track.  
           Shelby’s Segway rests nearby.

                                 SHELBY
                        I thought you liked Kevin.

                                 ELDA
                        I did, but...
                                 SHELBY
                        Don’t you like him anymore?

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know...

                                 SHELBY
                        Is there someone else?

           Elda looks at Shelby.  She blushes.  Searches for an answer.

           Shelby scoots closer to Elda.  She becomes nervous.  No man 
           has ever sat this close to her.

                                 SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Elda, can I feel you up?

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know what that is.

           Shelby puts his hands on Elda’s man boobs, squeezing 
           rhythmically.

                                 SHELBY
                        It’s like a little massage.  You’ll 
                        like it.  I promise.

           He opens his mouth, his face in rapturous ecstasy.  Elda is 
           surprised by his transformation.

                                 SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my!  You’ve got GREAT tits!

                                 ELDA
                        Thanks.

           Elda glances away, slightly embarrassed.  

                                 SHELBY
                        What’s the matter Elda?  Don’t you 
                        like me?

                                 ELDA
                        I do.  It’s just... I kissed Cyndi 
                        at the dance.

           Shelby’s hands stop.

                                 SHELBY
                        Kissed her?  On the mouth?

                                 ELDA
                        Yes.
                                 SHELBY
                        Did you use tongue?

                                 ELDA
                        I can’t remember.  We were talking, 
                        and all of a sudden I felt like I 
                        wanted to hold her.  To protect 
                        her.

                                 SHELBY
                        It sounds like you have feelings 
                        for her.

           Elda draws back.

                                 ELDA
                        I can’t have feelings for Cyndi.

                                 SHELBY
                        Why?

                                 ELDA
                        That would be wrong.

                                 SHELBY
                        It’s not wrong.  Maybe you’re a 
                        lesbian.

           Shelby scoots closer.  Starts to “massage” again.

                                 ELDA
                        A lesbian?

                                 SHELBY
                        Yeah.  A girl who likes other 
                        girls.

                                 ELDA
                        No!  That’s impossible.

                                 SHELBY
                        Our heart tells us who we like, 
                        Elda.  There’s no choice.  We just 
                        have to listen.  Maybe you should 
                        invite Cyndi over and kiss her 
                        again.  Just to see if you like it.

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know...

                                 SHELBY
                        I could even watch.  
           The thought of this turns Shelby on.  He MOANS.

                                 SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Oh Elda, you feel so good.  Am I 
                        making you feel good?

                                 ELDA
                        Um... I guess...

                                 SHELBY
                        Oh!  Elda... I love you!  I LOVE 
                        YOU ELDA!  OH!

           Shelby convulses on himself.  

                                 ELDA
                        Shelby?! 

           Shelby stands frozen, mortified.

                                 SHELBY
                        I have to go.

           He hobbles to his Segway.  Elda watches him speed away, 
           perplexed.

           INT. ELDA’S ROOM - NIGHT  

           Elda, wearing a full length nightgown, sits at a vanity 
           mirror.  Mary stands behind her, brushing her hair.

                                 MARY
                        No matter what you do, or what you 
                        try, I will always be one step 
                        ahead of you.

                                 ELDA
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 MARY
                        I know you wanted to go to your 
                        competition, but dancing is better 
                        left to whores.

                                 ELDA
                        May I go to bed now?

           Mary walks to the door.  She turns.

                                 MARY
                        I hope you pray real hard tonight.
           Mary closes the door.  Elda pulls a duffel bag from 
           underneath her bed.  She rips off her nightgown to reveal 
           she’s fully dressed.

           She open the window and climbs out onto the trellis, 
           disappearing into the night.

           INT. BUS - NIGHT

           Sparklers fill the seats.  Animated CHATTER.

           Elda bounds up the stairs and scans the rows.  No Cyndi.

           She grabs an empty seat in front of Susan and Tershelle.

                                 ELDA
                        Have you ever been felt up?

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah.  Tons of times.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Of course.

                                 ELDA
                        So it’s a normal thing?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Did Kevin try to get some?

                                 ELDA
                        No.  Shelby.  My next door 
                        neighbor.

           The GIRLS REACT with OOOHS.

                                 SUSAN
                        Someone got a handful down below!

           The girls LAUGH and high five each other.

                                 ELDA
                        He told me I had great tits.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Wait!  Tits?

           Cyndi appears at the top of the stairs.  Elda smiles.  

           Cyndi makes her way down the aisle.  Elda slides over to the 
           window.  Cyndi passes.  Elda’s smile fades.  Cyndi stops at 
           the next row.
                                 CYNDI
                           (to Susan)
                        Move.

           Susan reluctantly stands, maneuvers around Cyndi and joins 
           Elda.  Cyndi slides in next to Tershelle.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Hey, girl!

                                 CYNDI
                        Hey.

           Elda looks at Cyndi.  Cyndi avoids eye contact.

                                 SUSAN
                           (to Cyndi)
                        Elda was just telling us about 
                        getting felt up.

                                 CYNDI
                           (uninterested)
                        Oh.

           Susan turns back to Elda.

                                 SUSAN
                        So was it fun at least?

                                 ELDA
                        It was okay, until he got really 
                        excited and did this jerky thing... 
                        kind of like dancing.

                                 SUSAN
                        And it goes all over your face.  
                        Been there.  He left right after, 
                        didn’t he?

                                 ELDA
                        Yeah!  How did you know?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Typical spooger.  As soon as they 
                        cum, they’re done.

                                 SUSAN
                        And you’re left looking for a 
                        Kleenex.

           Elda looks at Cyndi, who listens to her iPod.  Cyndi closes 
           her eyes.
           INT. BUS - NIGHT - MOVING (LATER)

           The girls sleep.  Cyndi’s head rests on Tershelle’s shoulder.  
           Elda watches Cyndi doze.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           A male stick figure indicates the Boys Locker Room.  Coach 
           Tesley pushes the door open for Elda.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        You can change in here.

                                 ELDA
                        Why don’t I get to change with the 
                        rest of the girls?

           Coach Tesley looks at Elda.  Is she serious?

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        You don’t have the same equipment.

           Elda looks at her blankly.  Then a realization.  A look of 
           panic.

                                 ELDA
                        You know!  Please don’t tell anyone 
                        I’m a lesbian!

           Coach Tesley throws up her hands, flummoxed.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        What?!  Just get changed.

           INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Elda unzips her duffel bag.  She GASPS.  

           She pulls out a crop top which reads “WHORE” and a pair of 
           CROTCHLESS PANTIES. 

           INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Elda rounds a bank of lockers and walks into...

           HER TEAMMATES, in various stages of undress. 

           Cyndi, topless, stands front and center.  Elda stares, awed 
           by Cyndi’s boobs.  The girls notice and SCREAM.
                                 CYNDI
                        Elda!  What the fuck!

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Get out of here!

                                 ELDA
                        I’m looking for Coach Tesley.

           The girls SHRIEK LOUDER and point, covering themselves.

           Elda looks down.

           SHE HAS POPPED A WOODY UNDERNEATH HER DRESS. 

           Elda covers her bulge and runs away.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Spectators fill the stands.  A packed house.  Four Judges sit 
           behind a table at the edge of the floor.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen... the Ardmore 
                        Emeralds!

           A DRILL TEAM CLAD IN GREEN AND WHITE rushes the floor, waving 
           at the crowd.  They hit their opening pose.

           MUSIC STARTS.

           INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Elda paces.  Coach Tesley enters with a costume wrapped in 
           plastic.

                                 ELDA
                        Sorry!  I didn’t know...

                                 COACH TESLEY
                           (handing her the costume)
                        We don’t have time.  Here’s a 
                        spare.  It’s gonna be small but 
                        you’ll have to make it work.  
                        Hurry!  We’re on deck!

           Coach Tesley rushes out.  Elda spins.

                                 ELDA
                        What about panties?
           Coach Tesley is gone.  Elda picks up the crotchless 
           underwear.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

           MUSIC STOPS.  The Emeralds hit the end of their routine and 
           freeze.  The crowd APPLAUDS and SHOUTS.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Thank you, Emeralds!

           The Emeralds break their pose and clear the floor.

           INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           Elda stares at her reflection.  The costume is ridiculously 
           small.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, they just 
                        missed qualifying for Nationals 
                        last year, and tonight they're 
                        hoping to change that.  Please 
                        welcome to the floor... the 
                        Spartanburg Sparklers!

           The crowd APPLAUDS.  The auditorium is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS.

           Lights create FOUR ILLUMINATED ROWS on the floor.  Cyndi 
           leads a few Sparklers into position.  They strike a modern 
           dance pose.  

                                 CYNDI
                           (like a drill sergeant)
                        Spark-lers!  Light it up!

           Cyndi STOMPS and CLAPS.  A SYNCOPATED BEAT.  The other girls 
           pick it up.

           Tershelle and MORE SPARKLERS join them, marching in time to 
           the beat, filling in the gaps.  They hit the same pose and 
           join in the STOMP CLAP.

           A THIRD GROUP OF SPARKLERS follow.  

           The formation complete except for a gap in the front line.
           Elda marches into position.  The costume barely covers her 
           body.

           IN THE CROWD

           Coach Tesley looks at Elda.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Oh dear God.

           Spectators start to LAUGH.

                                 CYNDI
                        Spark-lers!  Sound off.

           Row by row the girls shout out a number and pop into starting 
           position, their right leg lifted in passé.

                                 GIRLS
                        One - two - three - four!

           Tershelle stands directly behind Elda.  Her eyes widen.  She 
           stares at Elda’s exposed butt cheek.

           PERCUSSIVE MUSIC BLASTS.  LIGHTS BUMP TO FULL.  The Sparklers 
           launch into their routine.  They weave in and out of each 
           other, one formation morphing into another.

           CLOSE ON Elda's face, determined.  She dances like someone 
           possessed, with sharp tight moves.

           Coach Tesley looks at the judges.  A row of stoic humorless 
           faces.

           Tershelle weaves past Cyndi.  She cuts her eyes to Elda’s 
           skirt.  Cyndi follows her gaze.  A glimpse of skin.

           Cyndi turns away from the audience and flattens her back.  
           Her legs spread in a wide stance.

           Elda loops her arms through Cyndi’s and leans back to 
           complete a fan kick.

           Spectators recoil.

                                 SPECTATORS
                           (in unison)
                        Ohhhhh!

           Elda moves to the edge of the floor.  A running prep followed 
           by a series of aerial cartwheels.
                                 SPECTATORS
                           (punctuating each of 
                            Elda’s cartwheels)
                        Oh!  Oh!  Oh!

           A Judge shakes her head with disgust.  Scribbles on a 
           scorecard.

           The crowd CONVULSES WITH LAUGHTER.  General pandemonium.  The 
           Sparklers hit their closing pose.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        The Spartanburg Sparklers... 
                        showing us everything they’ve got!

           PROLONGED LAUGHTER with a SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE.

           Coach Tesley shakes her head in disbelief.

           INT. AUDITORIUM BACKSTAGE - DAY

           An elated Elda bounds offstage, followed by noticeably pissed 
           Sparklers. 

                                 ELDA
                        That was awesome!  We rocked it!

           Cyndi shoves Elda, hard.  Elda falls to the floor, stunned.

                                 CYNDI
                        I’ll kill you, you tranny piece of 
                        shit!

           Elda scrambles to her feet.

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi?

                                 CYNDI
                        You were planning to fuck us over 
                        all along, weren’t you?!

                                 ELDA
                        What do you mean?

                                 CYNDI
                        Going commando, numb nuts!

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t understand.
                                 CYNDI
                        Bullshit!  You can’t be that 
                        clueless!

           Coach Tesley rushes between Elda and Cyndi, holding them at 
           bay.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Look, I know we’re all upset, but 
                        we can’t have a fight here.

                                 CYNDI
                           (to Coach Tesley)
                        What’s gonna happen?  Do we still 
                        have a shot?

           Coach Tesley looks at the group, her expression grim.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        We’ve been disqualified for lewd 
                        conduct.

                                 SPARKLERS
                           (ad lib)
                        No!  What?  Etc.

                                 CYNDI
                        I never wanted her fugly ass on the 
                        team in the first place.  I told 
                        you she’d ruin everything!

                                 ELDA
                        Didn’t want me on the team?  I 
                        thought we were friends.

                                 CYNDI
                        Are you kidding?  Look at you!  
                        You’re a freak and nobody likes 
                        you.  You’re only here because you 
                        can dance and land an aerial.

                                 ELDA
                        You were just using me?

           Coach Tesley places her hand on Cyndi’s shoulder.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Come on...

           Cyndi flings Coach Tesley’s hand aside.  She points at Elda, 
           enraged.
                                 CYNDI
                        Keep away from me, bitch!  I don’t 
                        wanna see your donkey dick face 
                        again!

           Cyndi stalks off.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Not cool, Elda.  

           Tershelle follows, joined by the rest of the girls.  Susan 
           turns for one final shot.

                                 SUSAN
                        P.S.... your tits suck!

           Elda, on the verge of tears, turns to Coach Tesley.

                                 ELDA
                        Coach, I didn’t mean...

           Coach Tesley holds up her hand.

                                 COACH TESLEY
                        Not a word, Elda.

           INT. BUS - AFTERNOON  

           Elda sits at the back of the bus, alone.  She CRIES SOFTLY.

           INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

           Mary sits in her rocker, working on her needlepoint.  We HEAR 
           THE DOOR open.

                                 MARY
                        What happens when a young lady lies 
                        to her mother?

           Elda pauses in the open doorway carrying her duffel bag.  She 
           looks awful.

                                 ELDA
                        “A kitten is born without eyelids.”

                                 MARY
                        Go to bed.

           Elda shuffles toward the stairs.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Elda walks next to Shelby, who rides his Segway.

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi totally hates me.

                                 SHELBY
                        Give her time.  She’ll come around.

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know.  I’ve never seen 
                        anyone so mad.  I think I really 
                        blew it, Shelby.

           Elda stops, overcome with a wave of emotion.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        What if she never talks to me 
                        again?

           Shelby stops.  Pulls Elda into a hug.

                                 SHELBY
                        Hey!  You’re a good person.  You 
                        didn’t blow it.

           She pulls away.  Wipes a tear from her eye.

                                 ELDA
                        Thanks.

                                 SHELBY
                        I wish there was something I could 
                        do to make you feel better.

           Elda smiles, wistful.

                                 ELDA
                        It’s funny.  All my life I hoped to 
                        meet a gentleman like you, and now 
                        that I have...

                                 SHELBY
                        ... your heart has picked someone 
                        else.  

                                 ELDA
                        I’m sorry.
                                 SHELBY
                        Don’t you dare be sorry.  Go win 
                        back your lady.

                                 ELDA
                        How?

                                 SHELBY
                        One step.

           Elda smiles.

                                 ELDA
                        I could kiss you right now!

                                 SHELBY
                        Can I feel you up instead?

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           EXT. SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           In the courtyard, Elda waves at Cyndi.  Cyndi flips her off.  
           Elda smiles and returns the gesture.  Cyndi moves away.  
           Elda’s smile fades.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Cyndi, Tershelle, and Susan approach the Sparkler table to 
           find a cupcake.  The icing spells out “I’m Sorry.”

           Elda watches from the doorway.  

           Cyndi hands it to a Handicapped Girl who throws her arms 
           around Cyndi.

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY

           CLOSE ON a sign reading “The Sisterhood:  A Lesbian Support 
           Group.”

           Elda enters and shuts the door.

           A second later the door opens and two Lipstick Lesbians 
           escort her out.
           EXT. SPARTANBURG HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Students pour into school.  Elda steps off the bus, 
           considers, then turns and walks in the opposite direction.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Elda sits before the four regionals judges.  She holds up the 
           crotchless underwear and the “whore” crop top, her face 
           impassioned.

           They exchange looks.  Is this chick for real?

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. GIRLS RESTROOM - DAY

           Cyndi stands at the sink, fixing her lipstick.  Elda emerges 
           from the stall behind her.

                                 CYNDI
                        You’re not supposed to be in here.

                                 ELDA
                        Lesbians can use the ladies’ room.

                                 CYNDI
                        You’re not a lesbian.

           Cyndi turns to leave.

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi, please!  I didn’t mean to 
                        get us disqualified.  I miss you.

                                 CYNDI
                        Before I left high school I wanted 
                        to do something special... to take 
                        the Sparklers to nationals.  That 
                        was it, Elda.  That was my shot.  
                        Now it’s gone.

                                 ELDA
                        You’re already special, Cyndi.  You 
                        don’t need the Sparklers or Rob, or 
                        any of that other stuff.

           Cyndi looks at Elda.  Tears well up in her eyes.
                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        I started to really like you.  
                        Stupid, huh?

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi...

           Elda reaches out to touch Cyndi’s shoulder.  Cyndi draws 
           back.

                                 CYNDI
                        I can’t be seen with a freak like 
                        you.  I have a reputation to 
                        protect.  Stop trying to be my 
                        friend, okay?

           She leaves.  Elda looks at her reflection in the bathroom 
           mirror.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Elda, books in hand, walks through the parking lot.  She 
           HEARS MOANING.

           Elda sees Rob banging Tanya Moretti in the backseat of the 
           Trans Am.

           Elda flings open the door and grabs Rob by the back of his 
           shirt.

                                 ELDA
                        Get off of her!

                                 TANYA MORETTI
                           (screaming)
                        Oh my God!

           Tanya covers herself as Rob tumbles out of the car.  He lifts 
           up his pants.

           Elda GASPS, stares at his crotch.

                                 ELDA
                        You’ve got a dingle dangle!

                                 ROB
                        What the fuck is your problem, Dick 
                        Chick?

           Rob grabs his crotch.
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You want some of this?  Is that it?

                                 ELDA
                        You don’t deserve someone like 
                        Cyndi.

           Elda charges Rob.  They fall to the ground, punching each 
           other.  Students gather.

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Elda, her face bruised and swollen, sits across from 
           Principal Anderson.  Elda has a cut on her lip.

                                 ELDA
                        Suspended?! Why?

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        You started the fight.

                                 ELDA
                        But that’s not fair!  Rob was 
                        cheating on Cyndi.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        I don’t care.  You threw the first 
                        punch.

                                 ELDA
                        That is totally cunty.

                                 PRINCIPAL ANDERSON
                        And now you’ve been expelled.

                                 ELDA
                        What?!

                                 MIRIAM ANDERSON
                        I called your mother.  She's on her 
                        way.  She can home school you from 
                        now on.  We’ll put a rush on the 
                        approval.  

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Elda bursts through the door.

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi!
           Elda scans the room full of students.  No Cyndi.  She backs 
           out of the classroom and closes the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Time to go, Elda.

           Elda turns to face Mary.

                                 ELDA
                        No.  I want to stay here.  With my 
                        friends.

                                 MARY
                        Friends?  Ha!  No one here gives a 
                        damn about you.  They’re just using 
                        you.

                                 ELDA
                        I'm not going, Mama.

                                 MARY
                           (advancing on her)
                        Don't make a scene.

                                 ELDA
                           (shouting)
                        I don't wanna go!  I'm staying at 
                        school!

           Mary grabs a taser gun out of her purse.  We HEAR A CLICKING 
           SOUND as she pushes it into Elda's shoulder.  Elda convulses 
           and falls to the floor.

           Students and faculty rush into the hall, drawn by the 
           commotion.  Mary puts Elda's arm around her neck and, with 
           the help of some students, hoists Elda to her feet.

                                 MARY
                        Please excuse my daughter.  She's 
                        overcome with emotion.

           Mary guides Elda through the crowd.

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           Mary, wearing goggles, clears leaves from the front walkway 
           with a leaf blower.
           Cyndi approaches the gate.  A purple spirit ribbon in her 
           hair.

                                 CYNDI
                           (calling out)
                        Mrs. Winnows?
                           (then, waving)
                        Hello?

           Mary powers off the blower and lifts her goggles.

                                 MARY
                        What do you want?

                                 CYNDI
                        I’m Cyndi, team captain of the 
                        Sparklers.  Is Elda around?

                                 MARY
                        She’s doesn’t want to see you.

                                 CYNDI
                        I know she’s probably pissed, but I 
                        wanted to apologize and thank her.

                                 MARY
                        For what?

                                 CYNDI
                        Regionals.  Whatever she told them 
                        worked.  They withdrew the 
                        disqualification, and our scores 
                        were enough to compete at 
                        nationals.  

                                 MARY
                        Why do I care?

                                 CYNDI
                        We want her back.  We couldn't have 
                        taken regionals without her, and 
                        she can’t dance if she’s not 
                        enrolled as a student.  I even 
                        smoothed things over with the 
                        Principal.

                                 MARY
                        My daughter told me she doesn’t 
                        want anything to do with you dirty 
                        whores.

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda would never say that.
                                 MARY
                        I’d like you to leave now.

           Cyndi pauses.

                                 CYNDI
                        Tell her I stopped by at least?

           Mary glares at her.  Cyndi turns to leave.

           EXT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           Mary, dressed for town, walks through the gate and disappears 
           behind the hedges.  

           Cyndi emerges from the foliage.  She gazes up toward the 
           attic window.

           INT. WINNOWS HOUSE - DAY

           Cyndi tiptoes across the foyer.  She steps on a SQUEAKY 
           floorboard.  She pauses.  Looks up the staircase.

           A DOOR SHUTS in a neighboring room.  Cyndi spins toward it.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                           (whispering)
                        Elda?!

           INT. PARLOUR - DAY

           Cyndi moves through the room.  Looks in awe at the antiquated 
           decor.

           We HEAR A FAINT GIGGLE.  Cyndi spins.  Walks into...

           THE KITCHEN

           A GIRL sits at the table with her back to Cyndi.  A shawl 
           over her shoulders.

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda?

           Cyndi moves around to the side to see...

           A PORCELAIN DOLL.
                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

           A LOUD WHIR.

           Mary explodes from the pantry with the leaf blower in her 
           hand.  Charges at Cyndi.  The blower aimed at her face.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                           (screaming)
                        Aaaahhhh!

           Cyndi’s cheeks flap from the force of the air.

           The purple ribbon flies from her hair.

           Cyndi SCREAMS as Mary chases her through the gate.

           INT. ELDA'S ROOM - SUNSET

           Elda dozes.  Mary sets a tray with a bowl of soup onto the 
           nightstand.  Elda stirs and opens her eyes.

                                 ELDA
                           (groggily)
                        My body is so heavy.

           Mary lifts Elda and props pillows behind her.

                                 MARY
                        You've been through a lot.  Mama's 
                        here to take care of you.

           Mary sits beside her.  Lifts the bowl of soup.

                                 ELDA
                        When Rob got out of the car, I 
                        swear I saw a dingle dangle.  Why 
                        would he have a dingle dangle?

                                 MARY
                        Shhh.  You’re imagining things.

           She holds up a spoon to Elda’s mouth.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Open the hangar.

           Elda opens her mouth.  Mary feeds her.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Your eyes were playing tricks on 
                        you.

                                 ELDA
                        I guess so.
                           (a beat)
                        Did anyone from school stop by to 
                        see me?

                                 MARY
                        No child.  I’m sorry.

           Elda turns away from the window.

                                 ELDA
                        Close the drapes.

           Mary stands.  Elda shuts her eyes.

           INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

           Elda PLAYS PIANO while Mary knits.  It’s Liebestraum.  Elda 
           stops and PLAYS A FEW CHORDS of some other tune.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t like that song.

           Elda stops.  PLAYS Liebestraum.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Elda stands before the stove, her worn copy of “Jane Eyre” in 
           her hand.  She opens the latch to reveal glowing orange 
           embers.

           Elda tosses the book into the stove.  The book bursts into 
           flame.  Elda watches it burn for a beat, then latches the 
           door closed.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Elda helps Mary clear breakfast dishes from the table.

                                 MARY
                        We have time for a quick lesson 
                        before you get to your chores.

                                 ELDA
                        Yes, ma’am.
           Elda retrieves the McGuffey Reader from the sideboard.  She 
           sees something on the floor.  Familiar.  She reaches down.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get this?

           Mary turns.  A PURPLE SPIRIT RIBBON dangles from Elda’s hand.

                                 MARY
                        That was part of your costume.

                                 ELDA
                        No.  Mine was gold.  Only team 
                        captain wears purple.

                                 MARY
                        You must have picked it up by 
                        accident.

           Elda looks at Mary.  She knows.

                                 ELDA
                        Cyndi was here, wasn’t she?!

                                 MARY
                        I told you, nobody stopped by to 
                        see you.

                                 ELDA
                        Liar!  Why would you do that, Mama?  
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MARY
                        Haven’t you suffered enough, Elda?

                                 ELDA
                        You know!  And you’re trying to 
                        keep us apart.

                                 MARY
                        Know what?

                                 ELDA
                        I’m a lesbian!  And I love Cyndi!  
                        And she’s in love with me!

                                 MARY
                        Oh, Elda!

                                 ELDA
                        Enough, Mama!  No more.  I’m done 
                        with your interference.  
           Elda reaches into Mary’s purse.  Grabs the taser.  Points it 
           at Mary.  A threat.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna be the one in control.

           INT. PARLOUR - DAY

           Elda pauses in the doorway with a small suitcase.  Mary knits 
           in her rocker.

                                 ELDA
                        I'm all packed up.  Goodbye, Mama.

                                 MARY
                        Before you walk out that door, I 
                        got a little story to tell you 
                        about the birds and the bees.

           Elda SIGHS.

                                 ELDA
                        You done tole me about the birds 
                        and the bees a long time ago.

           Elda turns to leave.

                                 MARY
                        I didn't tell you everything...

           Elda stops, frozen in her tracks.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        When I was a little girl, my most 
                        precious treasure was a doll my 
                        Mama gave me.  I named her Clara.  
                        Oh, how I loved that doll!

           Elda turns, drawn in by the story.  Sets the suitcase down.

                                 MARY
                        ... and when I learned I was with 
                        child, I prayed to God that he 
                        would bless me with a daughter.  My 
                        own little Clara...

                                 ELDA
                        Really, Mama?
                                 MARY
                        ... a pretty little girl that I 
                        could dress up and protect from all 
                        the awful things in this world.

                                 ELDA
                        You can’t keep out all of the bad, 
                        Mama.  That’s just part of life.

           Mary turns to Elda.  Her eyes laser sharp.

                                 MARY
                        You can’t keep out the bad when 
                        it’s inside of you.

                                 ELDA
                           (puzzled)
                        Mama...?

                                 MARY
                        Boys and girls are different.  
                        Little boys have dingle dangles, 
                        and little girls have hoo-haws.

                                 ELDA
                        No, Mama, you got that wrong.  The 
                        girl's got the dingle dangle.

                                 MARY
                        And when a boy and girl come 
                        together, the boy puts his dingle 
                        dangle in the girl's hoo-haw.

                                 ELDA
                        Mama!  You're confused.  Girls got 
                        the dingle dangle.

                                 MARY
                        Boys got the dingle dangle.

                                 ELDA
                        But, Mama, I got...

           The realization hits Elda.  She MOANS, low and guttural.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Ahhhh... ahhhh.

                                 MARY
                        God smite me down.  But I got my 
                        daughter, didn't I?  My own little 
                        Clara.  My pretty little girl!
           Elda pulls at his hair, beside himself (now that he knows 
           he’s a boy).

                                 ELDA
                        No!  Why... ?  NO!!!!

           Elda grabs his suitcase and flees from the room.

                                 MARY
                           (calling after him)
                        My pretty little girl!  My own 
                        precious daughter!

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Elda races down the street, suitcase in hand.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Elda sprints into the parking lot to find a school bus filled 
           with Sparklers pulling away from the curb.  He jumps in front 
           of the bus.  Flags it down.

                                 ELDA
                        Stop!

           The bus SQUEALS to a stop.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS)

           Elda leaps up the steps.  Tershelle and Susan seated in 
           front.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Elda?!

                                 ELDA
                        Where’s Cyndi?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        She’s eloping with Rob tonight.

                                 ELDA
                        Eloping?  She can’t.  I think I’m 
                        in love with her.

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Ewww!
                           (catching herself)
                        I mean... awwwww!
                                 ELDA
                        Where is she?

                                 TERSHELLE
                        Rob’s picking her up at her house.

           She throws him her keys.

                                 TERSHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Here.  Take my car.  Hurry!

                                 ELDA
                        Thanks.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Elda scans the cars in the parking lot.

                                 ELDA
                           (shouting after the bus)
                        Which one is yours?!

           Too late.  The bus pulls onto the street and drives away.  

           Elda looks at the key chain.  He presses a button.  We HEAR A 
           CHIRP and LIGHTS FLASH on a beat-up Honda.

           INT. TERSHELLE’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Elda climbs into the car and shuts the door.  He looks at the 
           steering wheel.

                                 ELDA
                        I don’t know how to drive!

           Elda gets an idea.

                                 ELDA (CONT’D)
                        Shelby!

           EXT. CYNDI’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Rob sits in his Trans Am in front of Cyndi’s house.  He REVS 
           the ENGINE.  Cyndi struggles out the front door with a large 
           suitcase.

                                 ROB
                        Hurry up!  I wanna get moving.
                                 CYNDI
                        You could help with my shit, ya 
                        know?

                                 ELDA (O.S.)
                        Cyndi!

           Elda sails into view -- riding the Segway.  Cyndi smiles.

                                 CYNDI
                        Elda?!

                                 ELDA
                        You can’t marry him!

           Rob jumps out of his Trans Am as Elda glides to a stop.

                                 ROB
                        What the fuck?!

           Elda steps off the Segway.

                                 ELDA
                        He’s not a gentleman.  I caught him 
                        spooging on Tanya Moretti.

                                 CYNDI
                        What?!

           She spins to confront Rob.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        That’s what the fight was about?  
                        You said Elda came onto you.

                                 ROB
                           (to Elda)
                        You don’t learn, do you?

           Rob charges Elda.  Lands a punch across his face.  Elda 
           recoils.  Rob stands in boxer mode.

                                 CYNDI
                        Rob!  Stop it!

                                 ROB
                        Come on, Dick Chick!

           Elda hits the Sparklers’ opening pose.  He executes a series 
           of piqué turns and kicks Rob in the balls.  Hard.

                                 ROB
                        Oooff!
           Rob convulses on himself and hits the ground.

                                 ELDA
                        The name is Elda.

           Cyndi rushes to Rob.

                                 CYNDI
                        Are you okay, Rob?

                                 ROB
                        What the fuck do you think?  No!

                                 CYNDI
                        Good!

           And she nails him in the balls, too.  He SCREAMS.  Cyndi 
           moves to Elda.  Touches his cheek.  Elda flinches in pain.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        I was worried about you.

                                 ELDA
                        You were?

                                 CYNDI
                        Uh-huh.  I tried to see you.

                                 ELDA
                        I know.  Look... I know you think 
                        I’m a freak, but I don’t care.  I 
                        have feelings for you, and I had to 
                        tell you.

                                 CYNDI
                        I do think you’re a freak...

           Elda bows her head.  Cyndi smiles and LAUGHS.

                                 CYNDI (CONT’D)
                        ...but the feeling is mutual.

           Elda smiles.

                                 ELDA
                        Really?

           Cyndi nods.  Elda looks at her, earnest and serious.  He 
           takes her hand in his.

                                 ELDA
                        One more thing you need to know.  
                        I’m not a lesbian.  I’m a boy.
           Cyndi pretends to be shocked.  Shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 CYNDI
                        Wow.  That’s... wow.  

                                 ELDA
                        I know it’s a lot to take in.

                                 CYNDI
                        Yeah.  That’s a huge deal.  Ummm... 
                        I knew that.

                                 ELDA
                        You did?

                                 CYNDI
                        Uh-huh.  Now I’ve got a confession.  
                        I’m not a lesbian.

                                 ELDA
                        You’re not?  So you like...?

                                 CYNDI
                        I knew you were a guy when I kissed 
                        you.  Yeah.

           She takes his hand.  They walk toward the Segway.

                                 ELDA
                        Oh... one more thing.  I don’t have 
                        a hoo-hah.  I have a dingle dangle.

                                 CYNDI
                        I can live with that.

           They smile.  He steps onto the Segway.  She climbs in behind 
           him.  Wraps her arms around his waist.

                                 ELDA
                        Did everyone know I was a boy all 
                        along?

                                 CYNDI
                        Uh-huh.

                                 ELDA
                        Why didn’t anyone tell me?

           He STARTS THE SEGWAY.

           They zoom off into the horizon.
                                 ELDA (O.S.)
                        By the way, you’ve got great tits.  
                        I really want to feel you up.

           TITLE OVER BLACK: TWO WEEKS LATER

           EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           “National High School Drill Team Championship” scrolls across 
           a large electronic marquee.  “Exhibition performance” 
           flashes.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen.  Your silver 
                        medalists, the Spartanburg 
                        Sparklers.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           A packed house.

           LIGHTS REVEAL the Sparklers.  Cyndi and Elda are front and 
           center.  They both wear purple spirit ribbons.  We HEAR A 
           PUMPING HIP HOP BEAT.  They DANCE.

                                                          FADE OUT.

                                    THE END.
