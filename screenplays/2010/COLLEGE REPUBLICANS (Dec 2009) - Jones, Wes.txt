           TITLE CARD: AUGUST 1973

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           President RICHARD M. NIXON sits at his desk, talking on 
           the telephone.  A newspaper is spread out before him.

                                 NIXON
                        Now God damn it, I’m not going to have 
                        this.  Not on top of everything else.  
                        Press.  Cocksuckers.  They’re killing me.  
                                 (pause)
                        Yeah, I know, I know.  I’m looking at The 
                        Post right now.  Who is this kid?
                                 (pause)
                        He worked for the campaign?  For CREEP?  

           Nixon listens.

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                                 (surprised)
                        Segretti?  Really?  Fucking Christ.  This 
                        shit is... Ahh.   Fuck.   
                                 (pause)
                        We’ve got to come down on this.  I’d just 
                        start right at the top and fire some 
                        people.   Whatever department it came out 
                        of, I’d fire the top guy.  And, uh...  
                        don’t you agree?    

           Nixon looks at the newspaper closely.

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        And find this kid Rove.   Get the FBI on 
                        him, take a statement.   That’s right, 
                        Rove.  Karl Rove, “Teacher of Dirty 
                        Tricks.”

           We see a close up of the article Nixon is looking at, 
           with a photo of the young man in question.  The headline 
           reads: GOP PROBES OFFICIAL AS TEACHER OF TRICKS.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           The sign outside the building says REPUBLICAN NATIONAL 
           COMMITTEE.
           INT. RNC MEETING ROOM - DAY

           A young man enters the room.   He is tall and trim with 
           shaggy hair and sideburns.  He wears large, thick 
           glasses, and a wide necktie.  It is the young man from 
           the newspaper, KARL ROVE, 22.

           Entering the room immediately after Rove is an older man 
           in a dark suit, FBI AGENT, 48

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Have a seat.

           Rove sits.  The agent sits across from him and takes out 
           a pen and note pad.

           Rove’s young face is rosy and angelic, but his eyes 
           suggest a hardness.   He does not seem nervous.

                                 FBI AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Rove, are you aware of the existence 
                        of an audiotape recording of your remarks 
                        to a seminar of College Republicans in 
                        San Diego, the tenth of March, 1972. 

                                 ROVE
                        I’m aware that a recording exists that 
                        the Washington Post claims to be my 
                        remarks.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        You recall your remarks as different than 
                        was reported by the Post?

                                 ROVE
                        Yes.  I suspect the recording was 
                        doctored in some way.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Mmmm Hmmm.   And when did you first come 
                        to know Lee Atwater?

                                 ROVE
                        That depends on how you define the word, 
                        “know.”

           The FBI Agent subtly rolls his eyes.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Why don’t you start at the beginning.
           Rove pauses for a moment, thinking.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CRNC OFFICE - DAY 

           Written on the frosted window of the office door is: 

           COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, JAMES COSTELLO, 
           CHAIRMAN.

           Rove sits across the desk from JAMES COSTELLO, a handsome 
           28 year-old man in a crisp suit.  

                                 COSTELLO
                        Are you sure you want to do this?

                                 ROVE
                        You said it yourself.   I belong in your 
                        chair.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Well, I was thinking in ‘75.  

                                 ROVE
                        I’m thinking now.

           Costello smiles.

                                 COSTELLO
                        You’re awfully young to be Chairman, 
                        Karl.  You’ll be up against Edgeworth-- 
                        he has seniority, and now Terry Dolan’s 
                        running... 

                                 ROVE
                        I’m the same age as Terry Dolan.

                                 COSTELLO
                        That’s not the point.  Dolan’s 
                        Connecticut.  He’s got money, support, 
                        connections.  He’s got delegates.  What 
                        do you have?

                                 ROVE
                        Dolan is vulnerable.  His support is wide 
                        but not deep.   He’s out of touch with--
                                 COSTELLO
                                 (interrupts)
                        Shit, Karl, it’s only two years.  Why 
                        don’t you wait it out?

                                 ROVE
                        Can’t do it, Jim.  I’ve got other plans 
                        in ‘75.   

                                 COSTELLO
                        You want it, I get that.  And why not?  
                        This position launches careers.  We are 
                        an arm of the Republican. National. 
                        Committee.  
                                 (pause)
                        The goddamn RNC Chairman is right across 
                        that hall.   It’s access.  A seat at the 
                        table: senators, staffers...

                                 ROVE
                        ...the White House.

                                 COSTELLO
                        If I back you-- if Chicago backs you, and 
                        you lose...

                                 ROVE
                        Good thing I don’t plan on losing.

           Rove’s cockiness is trying. 

                                 COSTELLO
                        If you challenge Dolan and lose, you’ll 
                        be finished.  You will not work in 
                        Washington for a long, long time.   

                                 ROVE
                        Understood.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Look, I like you.  But you’ve got to show 
                        us something before we go all in on you. 

                                 ROVE
                        I will give you something to see.

                                 COSTELLO
                        You’ll need a campaign manager.  

                                 ROVE
                        I’ll need an assistant.  I can manage my 
                        own campaign.
                                 COSTELLO
                        Bullshit.  You don’t know anybody south 
                        of Virginia.  You need somebody with 
                        juice, juice down South.  It’s the only 
                        region still up for grabs, so that’s 
                        where the fight’s going to be.

           Costello strokes his chin, thinking.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        I know a kid down in South Carolina.  
                        He’s a bit rough around the edges, but if 
                        anyone can pull this off it’s him.   And 
                        if he puts you in this chair, you need to 
                        put him in that one.

                                 ROVE
                        What’s his name?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

           A passenger train rumbles through the frame.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY 

           Karl Rove sits on the train reading a book.  It is called 
           THE KING MAKERS, by Leonard Lurie.

           TITLE CARD: COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY  

           Rove walks out of the station, looking for his ride.  

           A baby-faced young man, who looks about 16, holds up a 
           sign that says “ROVE”.

                                 ROVE
                        I’m Karl Rove.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Well, I’m Lee Atwater.  Great to finally 
                        meet you, Karl.

                                 ROVE
                        You’re Lee Atwater?
                                 YOUNG MAN
                        That’s right!  I’m gonna make you the 
                        next chairman of the College Republicans!

                                 ROVE
                        You sound a lot older on the phone.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        I got a baby face.   But I’m old enough 
                        to drink  and  I’m old enough to kick 
                        Terry Dolan’s ass for ya.

           Another young man seems to have overheard the 
           conversation.   He becomes agitated.

                                 AGITATED MAN
                        What did you say?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        What’s it to you, Mack? 

                                 AGITATED MAN
                        Don’t mouth off to me.  Terry Dolan’s a 
                        friend of mine.

           Agitated Man, though short in stature, glares at them 
           with the eyes of a killer.

                                 ROVE
                        Hey, we don’t want any trouble here.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Go piss up a flagpole.

           Agitated Man lunges at the young man, grabs his shirt, 
           and SLAMS HIM up against a wall.  

                                 AGITATED MAN
                                 (in his face)
                        Don’t sass me, boy!

           Karl Rove freezes, shocked by the scene.  

           The attacker punches the young man in the stomach.  He 
           crumples to the ground in pain.   

           Agitated Man turns and points a finger at Rove.

                                 AGITATED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Get ready, four eyes.  Me and you are 
                        gonna mix.

           Full of fear, Karl Rove faces a fight-or-flight moment.
           He drops his bag to the ground and awkwardly raises his 
           fists, in the manner of an old-fashioned boxer.

           Their would-be fisticuffs are interrupted by LAUGHTER, 
           coming from the young man on the ground.  Agitated Man’s 
           demeanor changes immediately.   The ruse is blown.

                                 AGITATED MAN (THE REAL ATWATER) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Aw, Roscoe!

                                 YOUNG MAN (ROSCOE)
                                 (laughing)
                        I’m sorry, Lee, it’s too much... “Don’t 
                        sass me, boy!” 

           The Young Man laughs some more.  Karl Rove glares at 
           Agitated Man, who he now understands is the real LEE 
           ATWATER, 22.  

           Rove’s face is red with anger.  He turns and walks away.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (under his breath)
                        Shit.

           Atwater hustles after Rove, who is already headed back 
           inside the train station.

           INT. TRAIN STATION

           Rove is at the ticket counter.

                                 ROVE
                        One ticket to Washington, D.C. 

           Atwater catches up to him.

                                 ATWATER
                        Karl, Karl!  I’m sorry.  It was just a 
                        little bit of fun.

                                 STATION AGENT
                        That’ll be $24.50 please.

                                 ROVE
                                 (to Agent)
                        One moment.  

           Rove steps aside from the counter and turns to Atwater.  
           He is livid.
                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Fun?  Fun!  This is not fun.  This is a 
                        fight for the future leadership of our 
                        Party.  I need serious, serious people on 
                        my side, not a... redneck jackass.  I’m 
                        risking my fucking career for this!

                                 ATWATER
                        What career?  You’re a gopher at the 
                        CRNC.

                                 ROVE
                        I have significant organizational 
                        responsibilities there, thank you very 
                        much.  Now, I have a train to catch.

                                 ATWATER
                        You’re just gonna go back to DC?  Drop 
                        out of the race? 

                                 ROVE
                        No, I’m going to go back to DC and I’m 
                        going to win.  But there’s no longer 
                        anything for me to do here with you.

                                 ATWATER
                        You can’t win without the South, Karl.  
                        And you can’t win the South without me.

                                 ROVE
                        Hardly.  I have the support of the 
                        Chicago faction and the tacit endorsement 
                        of the Chairman.  Presuming I split the 
                        South--

           Atwater abruptly shifts gears, interrupting Rove.

                                 ATWATER
                        You want to know the truth?  That wasn’t 
                        about fun.  Nothing is.  That was a test.

                                 ROVE
                                 (skeptical)
                        A test?

           The pint-sized Atwater confronts Rove, the larger man, 
           with an almost feral intensity.

                                 ATWATER
                        You’re damn straight.  I had to see what 
                        you’re made of.  You want a fight? I’m a 
                        fighter.  You want to win?  I’m a winner.   
                        But are you?

                                 (pause)
                        If I’m going to be your corner man 
                        against Terry Dolan and his bag of 
                        assholes, it’s my head on the block too!

                                 ROVE
                        And what did you find out from your 
                        “test?”

                                 ATWATER
                        You didn’t run and I like that.  But are 
                        you gonna do what it takes?-- Whatever it 
                        takes?  Are you gonna go all the way?   

                                 ROVE
                        Absolutely.

                                 ATWATER
                        Then I’ll take you on.

           Rove ponders this for a moment.

                                 ROVE
                        Okay.  Let’s go.

                                 ATWATER
                        Alright.  How about a do-over?  
                        I’m Lee Atwater.

                                 ROVE
                        Karl Rove.

                                 ATWATER
                        Damn glad to meet you, Karl.  It’s time 
                        to get this engine runnin’.

           They walk out of the train station together.  Rove makes 
           a confession to Atwater that trails off as they walk 
           away.

                                 ROVE
                        That was good, turning it around like 
                        that.  You made it a referendum on my 
                        qualifications instead of yours.  I 
                        wasn’t fooled, but other people can be...

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           A rusty, green 1952 Plymouth pulls onto a two-lane road.
           INT. CAR

           The Young Man from earlier, ROSCOE, 16, is behind the 
           wheel.   Rove is in the back, Atwater sits shotgun.

                                 ATWATER
                        Drop us off at Boog’s Garage, right off 
                        of Two Notch Road.

                                 ROVE
                        Are you old enough to drive?

                                 ROSCOE
                        Yessir, Chairman Rove.

                                 ROVE
                        “Chairman Rove,” I like that.

                                 ATWATER
                        Roscoe’s my personal driver.  He also 
                        mows Senator Thurmond’s lawn. 

           Rove’s legs are a little cramped in the back seat by a 
           large black GUITAR CASE.

                                 ROVE
                        You play guitar, Roscoe?

                                 ROSCOE
                        Nosir.

                                 ATWATER
                        She’s mine, Karl.  I don’t go on any kind 
                        of road trip without my Gibson 335.

                                 ROSCOE
                        Lee’s the best blues guitarist in the 
                        history of the College Republicans.

                                 ATWATER
                        Kind of like being the world’s tallest 
                        midget, I know.

           Rove smiles.  He seems to be warming up to Lee after all.

           EXT. CAR RENTAL SHOP

           It is a run-down, backwoods auto-body garage.  A large 
           sign says “BOOG’S GARAGE,” below it “CAR RENTALS.”
           INT. CAR RENTAL SHOP

           Karl Rove is at the counter.

           The counter man has a workshirt with an stitched nametag 
           that reads: BOOG.  

           Boog is scrutinizing Rove’s GULF OIL credit card as if he 
           has never seen one before.

                                 BOOG
                        Plastic, huh?  Gonna have to call this 
                        in.

           EXT. CAR RENTAL SHOP

           Rove and Atwater watch as Boog pulls up in a mustard 
           brown FORD PINTO.  The engine sputters and crackles as 
           the car stops in front of them.

                                 ATWATER
                        I see you’ve spared no expense, Karl.

           Rove ignores the comment.

                                 BOOG
                        All yours.

                                 ATWATER
                        Thanks, Cap.  

           Atwater grabs the keys and throws his bags and guitar 
           case in the back seat.

                                 ROVE
                        I want to sit down somewhere for a 
                        strategy session.

                                 ATWATER
                        We’ve got to be in Atlanta by nightfall-- 
                        campaign event tonight.  We’ll talk shop 
                        on the way. 

           The pinto pulls onto the rural 2-lane highway and heads 
           west.  They’re on their way.

           INT. PINTO - DAY

           Atwater drives.  Rove is looking at Atwater’s campaign 
           materials and charts.  
                                 ATWATER
                        It’s a blitzkrieg.  We hit 6 states in 10 
                        days, and lock up the support of each of 
                        the 6 Southern state chairmen.  If we 
                        come into the convention with all the 
                        delegates from the South, the Chicago 
                        boys will bring us the rest.

                                 ROVE
                        It’s ambitious.  Dolan has strong ties 
                        with the Southern leadership.  How will 
                        we bring them over to our side?

                                 ATWATER
                        By moving them away from Terry Dolan’s 
                        side.   

           Atwater picks up a book and tosses it on Karl Rove’s lap.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        The Art of War, by Sun Tzu.

                                 ROVE
                        Yes, I’m familiar with it.

                                 ATWATER
                        “All warfare is based on deception.  Hold 
                        out baits to entice the enemy, feign 
                        disorder, and crush him.”  

                                 ROVE
                        I find the writings of Machiavelli to be 
                        more apt for political warcraft.

                                 ATWATER
                        Hail to The Prince.

                                 ROVE
                        “In war, discipline can do more than 
                        fury.”

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s a good one.  

                                 ROVE
                        The element of surprise will be key.

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s the key I’m singing in, baby Karl.  
                                 ROVE
                        Dolan doesn’t know about this trip.  He 
                        doesn’t know that his support in the 
                        South is about to collapse.

                                 ATWATER
                        Hell, you could fill Carolina Stadium 
                        with things Terry Dolan doesn’t know. 

                                 ROVE
                        What about Edgeworth?  

                                 ATWATER
                        He’s not a factor.  Nobody knows him down 
                        here.  

                                 ROVE
                        Edgeworth should not be underestimated.  
                        He’s got a clear Libertarian message that 
                        plays well with Y.A.F. Goldwater kids... 
                        He has a very statesman-like quality.

                                 ATWATER
                        Statesman!  Statesman?!  Ain’t nothing 
                        worse than a politico who thinks he’s a 
                        “statesman.”  

           Rove returns to his notes.  Atwater notices the clock.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Shit! It’s 5:30 already.  We gotta get 
                        some drivin’ in.

           Atwater pops in an 8-TRACK CARTRIDGE into the car stereo. 
           Up-tempo R&B MUSIC fills the car as he stomps on the gas.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        “Speed is the essence of war.  Attack 
                        where your enemy is not prepared.  Appear 
                        where you are not expected.”

           Rove grabs onto the passenger-side hand grip as the Pinto 
           careens down the highway.

           EXT. BETA THETA PI HOUSE - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD: ATLANTA, GEORGIA

           The pinto pulls to a stop across the street from their 
           destination, the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity House.  
           Rove and Atwater look out at the house.  It is a 
           plantation-style mansion, brightly lit, with loud music 
           coming from within.  

                                 ROVE
                        A frat party?

                                 ATWATER
                        The Beta Theta Pis are like duck on a 
                        junebug with the Georgia C.R.    

           INT. FRAT HOUSE

           The scene is crowded, but subdued.  Despite the music and 
           alcoholic drinks, an air of upper crust formality hangs 
           over the proceedings.

           Atwater hugs a burly young man with a buzz cut, EARL, 21

                                 EARL 
                        Shit, Lee, I didn’t think you we’re 
                        coming in until tomorrow!  

                                 ATWATER
                        You know I can’t miss a Beta house mixer.  
                        Earl, this is the next Chairman of the 
                        CRNC, Karl Rove.

                                 EARL
                        Pleasure, Karl.

                                 ROVE
                        Earl.

                                 ATWATER
                        Let’s get some drinks!  Friday’s my junk 
                        day.

                                 EARL
                        Now, Lee, you behave yourself now.  
                        There’s some members of the national 
                        chapter here and they like things to be a 
                        certain way.

                                 ATWATER
                        Earl... It’s me.

           Atwater gives Earl a wide grin as he and Rove head into 
           the party.   Earl shakes his head.
           ROVE AND ATWATER MINGLE

           The occasion is more formal than might be expected.  
           Atwater seems a bit under dressed and receives a few 
           disapproving glances as he makes his way through the 
           crowd.   Rove, in his rumpled suit, is passable.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (to no one in particular)
                        Evening.

           Lee and Karl walk past two attractive YOUNG LADIES.  Lee 
           spins around to talk to them.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, this is Karl Rove, the next 
                        Chairman of the College Republicans.  And 
                        I’m Lee Atwater, his five-star general.   
                        But you can call me... General.

           Young Lady #1 chuckles at his joke.

                                 YOUNG LADY #1
                        Oh, I heard about that campaign.  You’re 
                        running against Terry!

                                 ROVE
                        Yes, that’s right.

                                 YOUNG LADY #1
                        Our girlfriend Kate is going with him.  
                        What makes you so sure you’re going to 
                        win?

                                 ATWATER
                        Better strategy, better ideas.  Plus, 
                        Karl’s a lot smarter than Terry Dolan.  
                        Tell her somethin’ really smart, Karl.

                                 ROVE
                        Uh...  Did you know... that, uh...

           Rove is dumbstruck.   Suddenly, he has an idea!

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        In the ‘72 presidential election in 
                        Georgia, Nixon won 75% of the vote!  His 
                        highest total of any state.  Beat 
                        McGovern by 50 points.  And bested his 
                        own total from ‘68 by...

           He suddenly notices the blank faces looking back at him.
                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        ...almost, uh, 45 points.

                                 YOUNG LADY #1 
                        That’s... fascinating.

           Awkward silence.

           LATER, AT THE DRINK TABLE

           Rove and Atwater are ordering their drinks from an 
           African-American SERVER.

                                 ROVE
                        I’ll have a mint julep, please.  Hold the 
                        Bourbon.

                                 ATWATER
                        You got PBR?

                                 SERVER
                        Yes, sir.

           In the distance beyond, Lee notices a young man in a 
           sharp suit and bow tie come out from the door of a closed 
           room.   The man has an air of importance, he is JOHN 
           KINNEY, 26.

           Atwater directs Rove’s attention to him.

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s John Kinney, the Georgia Chairman.  
                        He’s the man we need to see. 

           They watch as Kinney is followed out of the room by a 
           shorter man in a dark grey pin-striped suit.   

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        And that’s... Is that...?

           It is TERRY DOLAN, 22, the dark-haired, pale-skinned, 
           beady-eyed rival candidate.  

                                 ROVE
                        That’s Terry Dolan.

           Dolan and Kinney shake hands as they leave the room 
           together, looking very chummy.  Rove and Atwater look at 
           each other, as if to say, “Oh, shit.”  

           They start to cross the room toward their adversary.  
           Rove hesitates.
                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                                 (low voice)
                        What about the element of surprise?  

                                 ATWATER
                                 (low voice)
                        We’re gonna have to go off book.  Follow 
                        my lead.

           INT. FRAT HOUSE HALLWAY

           Moments later, they reach Dolan and Kinney.  Kinney does 
           not seem pleased to see Atwater.

                                 ATWATER
                        John Kinney.  How are you doing, sir?

                                 KINNEY
                                 (condescending)
                        Glad you could make it, Lee.  Things are 
                        always so... entertaining with you 
                        around.

                                 ATWATER
                        This is the fellow I was telling you 
                        about... Karl Rove.

           Rove and Kinney shake hands.

                                 KINNEY
                        Karl.

                                 ROVE
                        Good Evening, sir.

                                 KINNEY
                        Karl, this is Terry Dolan.

           They do not shake hands.  

                                 ROVE
                                 (cold)
                        We’ve met.

                                 DOLAN
                        Indeed.

           Atwater steps in and offers his hand to Dolan.

                                 ATWATER
                        I don’t believe I’ve had the pleasure.
                                 KINNEY
                        Terry, this is Lee Atwater.  Lee’s from 
                        South Carolina.  Some backwater town, I 
                        can’t remember the name.

           Lee ignores Kinney and stares into Dolan’s eyes as he 
           shakes his hand.

                                 ATWATER
                        Damn glad to meet you, Terry.  It’s an 
                        honor, an absolute thrill.  

                                 DOLAN
                        Thanks.

           Atwater TIGHTENS HIS GRIP as he continues to shake 
           Dolan’s hand exuberantly.  Dolan is clearly 
           uncomfortable. 

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s gonna be a hell of a campaign, hell 
                        of a campaign!   I can’t wait for the 
                        convention.  I’ve got goosebumps!  

                                 DOLAN
                        Uh... I’m sure you do.

                                 KINNEY
                        Well, gentleman, I might as well break 
                        the news now:  I’m endorsing Terry for 
                        National Chairman.

           This is a blow.  Rove looks at Atwater, who seems 
           strangely unbothered.    

                                 ATWATER
                        Dang!  Really?  But we just got here.  
                        You haven’t even heard Karl’s platform.

                                 KINNEY
                        I’ve just spent the last hour talking 
                        with Terry and I liked what he had to 
                        say.  

                                 ROVE
                        Look, Mr. Kinney, I can assure you--

                                 KINNEY
                        He’s got some big ideas about the future 
                        of the CR.  Fundraising, campus activism.   
                        He’s got it all laid out in his campaign 
                        bible.    
                                 DOLAN
                        John, if we could not discuss that here.  
                        I would prefer--

                                 ATWATER
                        Campaign bible?  You don’t say?

                                 KINNEY
                        It’s a notebook, this thick.

           Kinney spreads his thumb and index finger.

                                 DOLAN
                                 (snide)
                        It’s thicker than Nixon’s head.

                                 ROVE
                        You have a problem with the President, 
                        Terry?

                                 DOLAN
                        Nixon’s not a true conservative.  He’s 
                        compromised the movement.  And every day 
                        on television he does more damage.

                                 ATWATER
                        You mean Watergate?

                                 KINNEY
                                 (annoyed)
                        Yes, Lee.

                                 DOLAN
                        Goldwater is the way.  

                                 ROVE
                        Goldwater lost by 22.6 percentage points.  
                        He gave LBJ the greatest popular majority 
                        in American electoral history.  That’s 
                        not “the way.” 

                                 KINNEY
                        You have a problem with Goldwater, Rove?  
                        Most of us think he had the better ideas.

           Lee Atwater is losing interest in the conversation.

           In the distance, Atwater observes a man in a seersucker 
           suit walk out of the room that Dolan and Kinney emerged 
           from.  He is the tall, tanned, DAPPER MAN. 
           Through the open door Atwater spies a large, THICK 
           NOTEBOOK on a table inside the meeting room.  It has 
           DOLAN ‘73 written on the spine.  

           This can only be Dolan’s CAMPAIGN BIBLE.  Lee’s eyes 
           widen.  No one else has noticed.   The Dapper Man closes 
           the door and walks away. 

                                 ROVE
                        Elections are about issues, not ideas.

                                 KINNEY
                        I’m not sure I’m with you.

                                 DOLAN
                        That’s because you’re with me.

           Dolan and Kinney laugh at the joke.  A hint of anger 
           flashes onto Rove’s face.

                                 ROVE
                        John, you need to think beyond ‘76.  The 
                        political alignment of this country is up 
                        for grabs.  Georgia and the South voted 
                        Democrat for the last hundred years.   
                        But not anymore.  

           Atwater sees that no one is paying attention to him and 
           casually slips away from the others.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Our generation-- if we can be pragmatic-- 
                        has a chance to build a lasting 
                        Republican majority.

           Lee quietly opens the door and enters the Dolan/Kinney 
           meeting room.

           INT. MEETING ROOM

           Atwater quickly and quietly closes the door behind him.  
           The chattering ambiance of the party is silenced.

           He briefly inspects his surroundings: it is a large 
           conference room with a round table in the center and 
           scattered furniture throughout.

           On the table is Terry Dolan’s campaign BIBLE.  It is dog-
           eared and crammed with inserts and other material.

           Atwater picks it up and with great anticipation begins to 
           open it. 
                                 KATE
                        May I help you?

           Atwater is beyond startled.

           In a soft upholstered chair in the corner sits KATE KING, 
           21, an attractive young woman in a cocktail dress.   

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh,  hello.   Harvey LeRoy Atwater, at 
                        your service.

           Lee gives her a short bow.  Kate lights up a cigarette.  

                                 KATE
                        So... what are you going to do with that 
                        big notebook, Harvey LeRoy?

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, this?  I’m... just retrieving it for 
                        my friend Terry.

                                 KATE
                        I didn’t think Terry had any friends.

                                 ATWATER
                        In Georgia?  Well, we’ve only met a few--

                                 KATE
                                 (interrupts)
                        I meant anywhere.

                                 ATWATER
                        No, we think the world of Terry.

                                 KATE
                        Now I know you’re lying.

           Atwater smiles.  He likes this girl.

                                 ATWATER
                        I didn’t get your name...

                                 KATE
                        Kate.  Kate King.

                                 ATWATER
                        Kate, right... You’re Terry’s girl.

                                 KATE
                        I’m his travelling companion, yes.
                                 ATWATER
                        Well, a pleasure to make your 
                        acquaintance.  Unfortunately, I do have 
                        to get back to my party.

           Atwater, still holding the notebook, turns to leave.

                                 KATE
                        Uh, I don’t think so.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well... I’m flattered, Ms. King.  I mean, 
                        you’re very beautiful, but just not my 
                        type.

           Kate smiles at Atwater’s brashness, in spite of herself. 

                                 KATE
                        You can go, just leave the book.  

                                 ATWATER
                        What would you do if I just left with it?

                                 KATE
                        Nothing.  But the man outside in the 
                        seersucker suit would beat you to a pulp.

                                 ATWATER
                        Fair enough.

           Atwater walks over to Kate and hands her the book.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Before I go... do you have happen to have 
                        a cigarette for me?

           INT. FRAT HOUSE HALLWAY

           The heated political debate continues.

                                 DOLAN
                        Rockefeller moderates like you are a 
                        cancer on the party.  

                                 ROVE
                        I’m not a moderate.  I’m a pragmatist.  

                                 KINNEY
                        Oh, give it up, Rove.
                                 ROVE
                        No, Goldwater had great ideas.  The 
                        problem is he told people about them.
                        So he wants to use a tactical nuke on 
                        North Vietnam?  Great.  

                                 DOLAN
                        Limited war is for queers.   

                                 ROVE
                        But you don’t tell the voters you’re 
                        going to do it-- voters who oppose any 
                        nuclear first-strike by a margin of eight 
                        to one.  John, if you--

           Rove looks around and sees that John Kinney is no longer 
           with them.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Where did he go?

           Dolan looks at Rove and chuckles derisively.  

                                 DOLAN
                        I bet that happens to you a lot, doesn’t 
                        it?

           INT. MEETING ROOM

           Atwater is entertaining Kate with a bar trick.   

           With the tip of his cigarette, Lee burns a small hole in 
           the bottom of the clear plastic wrapper of the cigarette 
           pack.  He then drops in an extinguished cigarette butt, 
           trapping it in the plastic.  He presents the pack to 
           Kate.

                                 ATWATER
                        Now.  It goes in pretty easy, but can you 
                        get it out of that hole?  

           Kate seems game for a challenge.  She takes the pack from 
           him and tries.  The cigarette butt bounces overtop the 
           hole repeatedly, but never falls out.

                                 KATE
                        I suppose you can do it.

           Atwater takes the pack and bends it slightly.   He then 
           blows forcefully through the newly created gap between 
           the pack and the plastic.  
           The air escapes through the hole and carries the 
           cigarette butt with it into the air.   It is a surprising 
           and amazing sight.  Kate applauds. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Very nice.

                                 ATWATER
                        Let’s play a game.

                                 KATE
                        What kind of game?

                                 ATWATER
                        A liar’s game.  I’ll ask you five 
                        questions. All you have to do is get all 
                        five wrong.  

                                 KATE
                        All wrong?  I think I can do that. 

                                 ATWATER
                        Of course you can.  It’s easy.   But 
                        let’s make it a bet.  If you get just one 
                        right, I get the notebook.

           Kate scoffs.

                                 KATE
                        And if I win?

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ll quit my campaign and endorse Terry.

           Kate laughs.

                                 KATE
                        Why not?

                                 ATWATER
                        Okay.   

           Atwater stands up and extends both his hands, beckoning 
           Kate to do the same.   

           They hold hands and look each other in the eyes.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Here we go... What state are we in?

                                 KATE
                        Wyoming.
                                 ATWATER
                        Who’s president of the USA?

                                 KATE
                        I am.

           Atwater laughs.

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s good.   Here’s one... Are you in 
                        love with Terry Dolan?

           Kate thinks about this for a moment.

                                 KATE
                        Yes.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (sly)
                        How can I be sure you’re lying?

                                 KATE
                        You can’t.

           Atwater raises his eyebrows.

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s true.  

                                 KATE
                        Shit.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, Kate, I thought you would at least 
                        get to five.

                                 KATE
                        What was five?

                                 ATWATER
                        I think I’ll keep that one in my pocket.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, come on.

                                 ATWATER
                        All right, I’ll ask you... if you promise 
                        to lie still-- I mean, still lie.

                                 KATE
                        I promise.
                                 ATWATER
                        The question is... Am I going to kiss 
                        you?

           Kate thinks about this.

                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 ATWATER
                        You would have won.

           He kisses her.

           INT. FRAT HOUSE HALLWAY

           Rove spots John Kinney, far on the other side of the 
           room, talking with a young women.   Dolan and Rove are 
           alone in the hall together.

                                 DOLAN
                        You might as well not waste your time 
                        with Kinney.

                                 ROVE
                        Thanks for the tip.

                                 DOLAN
                        My friends at the Beta Pi national 
                        chapter have agreed to finance a 
                        renovation of this house-- on my 
                        recommendation.

                                 ROVE
                        Wow, you’re such a player, Terry.

                                 DOLAN
                        If you quit now, I’ll let it go and I 
                        won’t ruin you professionally.

                                 ROVE
                        You have no idea who you’re dealing with.

                                 DOLAN
                        Hmmm.  Karl C. Rove, born Christmas Day 
                        1950. Olympus High School, Salt Lake City 
                        class of ‘69.  University of Utah ‘69-71, 
                        didn’t finish... Maryland, 1971, didn’t 
                        finish... should I go on? 
                                 ROVE
                        Congratulations, you can read a 
                        transcript. 

                                 DOLAN
                        Father, Louis Rove, walked out on your 
                        family, Christmas Day 1969-- your 
                        nineteenth birthday, wasn’t it?

                                 ROVE
                        Fuck you, Dolan.   

           Dolan smiles, satisfied to have gotten under his skin.

                                 DOLAN
                        Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is 
                        forever.  Think about it.

           Dolan starts to walk away.  Rove steps in his path.  He 
           points a finger down at Dolan, touching his chest.  Rove 
           is significantly taller and more physical.

                                 ROVE
                        You listen to me, you little fuck.  I 
                        will put a knife in you.  And you will 
                        bleed.  

           The Dapper Man, and another of Dolan’s henchman, The MAN 
           IN BLACK, quickly arrive on the scene.

           Rove backs off.

                                 DOLAN
                        Oooh.  Talk dirty some more, Karl.

           INT. MEETING ROOM

           Atwater and Kate are now only semi-clothed as they 
           continue to kiss, deeply and passionately.

           A sense of danger hangs pervasively in the air.

                                 KATE
                        Terry could walk through that door...

           More kissing.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        ...any minute.

                                 ATWATER
                        No, I locked it.
           Atwater kisses Kate’s ear.

                                 KATE
                        When did you lock it?

                                 ATWATER
                        When I walked in and saw you out of the 
                        corner of my eye.

           Kate kisses Lee on the mouth aggressively and they fall 
           over into a chair together.

           They are suddenly INTERRUPTED by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  

                                 DOLAN (O.S.)
                        Kate?

           Kate and Lee scramble to put their clothes back on.

                                 KATE
                        Just a minute...  
                                 (whispers to Atwater)
                        The window.

           Atwater trips over the leg of a chair as he hurries to 
           the window, causing a loud THUD.

                                 DOLAN (O.S.)
                        Is everything alright?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.  
                                 (whispers to Atwater)
                        Go. Go.

           Lee is halfway through the window.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (whispers)
                        The book.

                                 DOLAN (O.S.)
                        Open the door, Kate, or I’m going to have 
                        Roger do it.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (whispers)
                        I’m not leaving without the book.

           Kate shoves the book into Atwater’s arms, knocking him 
           all the way out the window.

           Atwater lets out a muffled YELP as he hits the ground.
           CRACK!

           The Dapper Man BREAKS OPEN the door.

           Terry Dolan coolly strides into the room.  He notices 
           three things immediately:

           ONE: The open window.  TWO:  Kate’s disheveled state.  
           THREE: The empty table where the book had been.

           Dolan glares at Kate furiously.  She seems frightened.  
           The Dapper Man closes the door ominously.

           INT. FRAT HOUSE

           Karl Rove is standing awkwardly near a window, away from 
           the other party guests.  Not knowing what to do with 
           himself, he sips his drink and seethes. 

           Gazing out the window, Rove’s eyes widen.  He sees 
           Atwater running across the yard, clutching Dolan’s large 
           notebook under his arm.

           Rove quickly leaves.

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The pinto wheels around the corner and screeches to a 
           halt near the front yard.  Atwater hurriedly climbs in.

           INT. PINTO - NIGHT

           Rove is furious with Atwater.

                                 ROVE
                        That was a total fucking fiasco.

                                 ATWATER
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ROVE
                        We lost Georgia.  Dolan knows everything.  
                        He’s pulling strings.   And he’s going to 
                        be in Gainesville tomorrow.

                                 ATWATER
                        I stole his campaign bible and made out 
                        with his girlfriend.  I consider that a 
                        smashing success.
                                 ROVE
                        John Kinney hates your guts, Lee.  What 
                        the fuck were you thinking we could 
                        accomplish there?

                                 ATWATER
                        Kinney’s a prick.  I should have told you 
                        that.  He doesn’t matter, we don’t need 
                        him.

                                 ROVE
                        He’s the state Chairman! What about the 
                        plan?

                                 ATWATER
                        Kinney’s about as useless as tits on a 
                        boar hog.  My man Earl’s got just as much 
                        juice in the Georgia C.R. as Kinney.   

                                 ROVE
                        You’re fucking this up, Lee.  Don’t sugar-
                        coat it.

                                 ATWATER
                        You gotta trust me, Karl.  This is the 
                        best thing that could happen to us.      

                                 ROVE
                        You’re insane.

                                 ATWATER
                        Don’t you see?  Everything your saying, 
                        it’s exactly what Terry Dolan thinks.   

           Atwater holds up his copy of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        This is textbook stuff.  Deception.  
                        Feigning disorder.

                                 ROVE
                        We’re not feigning disorder.  This is 
                        actual disorder.

                                 ATWATER
                        Speak for yourself.

           They are approaching a well-lit service station.  

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Pull over here.   I gotta call Earl back 
                        at the Beta house, tell him what 
                        happened.
                                 ROVE
                        Tell him what?

           The pinto slows to a stop.

                                 ATWATER
                        Karl, when word gets around that party 
                        that I stole Dolan’s girlfriend, you 
                        stood up to his bullies, and we got run 
                        out of the place... It’ll be legendary.

                                 ROVE
                        It’s an embarrassment.

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s a frat house, Karl, not the Utah 
                        state legislature.  You’ll solidify your 
                        image as a man’s man, fighting against 
                        the Yankee interlopers.

                                 ROVE
                        Hmm.  

           Rove thinks Atwater might be onto something.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        We’ll, let’s check out Dolan’s book.  
                        That is a score.

                                 ATWATER
                        Thank you.

           Atwater opens Terry Dolan’s campaign bible.  Despite its 
           thoroughly worn appearance, all the pages ARE COMPLETELY 
           BLANK.

           Rove glares at Atwater.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Well, that’s weird.   

           Rove grabs it from Atwater and looks through it himself.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a fake.  She must have switched 
                        books on me somehow... the crafty little--

                                 ROVE
                        No.  I don’t think so.

           Atwater is baffled.
                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        I think Dolan is the fake.  I’ll bet he 
                        just points at the book and never shows 
                        people the inside.

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah.  You might be right.  

                                 ROVE
                        Let’s head out to Gainesville tonight, 
                        get there before Dolan.

                                 ATWATER
                        Let’s do it.  I’ll drive.  I’m wired.

           They pull out of the service station and speed off into 
           the night.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. CAR - DAWN

           Rove and Atwater are sound ASLEEP in their seats as the 
           morning light streams into the Pinto.   The car is parked 
           on the side of a rural road.

           They are suddenly awoken by the TAPPING of a billy club 
           against the driver’s side window.   It is an irate COUNTY 
           SHERRIF.

                                 COUNTY SHERRIF
                        You fuckin’ hippies can’t sleep here!  
                        Move it on across the county line before 
                        I run ya in for vagrancy!

           INT. DINER - MORNING

           Atwater and Rove are having breakfast.

           Rove is finishing his bacon and eggs as Atwater is 
           starting into a bowl of cereal.

                                 ROVE
                        I could really use a shower.

                                 ATWATER
                        We’ll hit my friend Pine-Top’s place 
                        before the seminar.
                                 ROVE
                                 (looking at his notes)
                        The Young Republicans leadership seminar.   
                        Do we have a speaking slot there?

                                 ATWATER
                        Nah, we’re just hobnobbin’.

           Atwater sprinkles sauce on his cereal.

                                 ROVE
                        What are you doing?  What is that?

                                 ATWATER
                        Tabasco sauce.

                                 ROVE
                        On corn flakes?

                                 ATWATER
                        I like to spice it up.  I drank a whole 
                        bottle of Tabasco onetime, on a bet.   
                        Think it messed up my taste buds.

                                 ROVE
                                 (chuckles)
                        Lee, you might be the dumbest smart 
                        person I’ve ever met.

           Atwater smiles.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Let me ask you a question...

           Atwater takes out a pen and starts drawing something on a 
           napkin.  He shows Rove the napkin. On it Lee has made a 
           square made up of NINE POINTS:

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Can you connect each of these dots using 
                        four straight lines?  

           Rove looks at the points and thinks.   He takes the pen 
           and draws a straight line across the bottom row, pausing 
           at the last dot. 
           He then continues his line past the third dot and into 
           the margin, and makes his next line diagonally back 
           toward the box.  Rove soon completes the puzzle.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Well, well, well.  Nicely done.  You 
                        know, no candidate I’ve worked with has 
                        gotten that puzzle on the first try.  
                        Including Senator Thurmond.  

           Rove smiles smugly.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        But I can do it with only three lines.

           Rove furrows a brow and looks at the puzzle again.

                                 ROVE
                                 (mystified)
                        Three lines?

                                 ATWATER
                                 (changing subject)
                        I heard you say last night elections are 
                        about issues, not ideas.

                                 ROVE
                        I didn’t think you were listening.

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s not about ideas or issues.  It’s 
                        about emotions.

                                 ROVE
                        No.  Emotions play a role, but it’s too 
                        varied and random to be significant. 

                                 ATWATER
                        They play the biggest role.  Voters ought 
                        to feel, not think. 

                                 ROVE
                        Ridiculous.  Too hard to control.

                                 ATWATER
                        You just figure out whatever it is that 
                        gets people most riled up, and you hang 
                        it around the other guy’s neck.

           The waitress comes by their table.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you fellas anything else?
                                 ROVE
                        Yes.  I’d like one egg please.  Raw, 
                        still in the shell.

           The waitress gives Rove a strange look.  Rove glances at 
           Atwater slyly.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Okay.

                                 ATWATER
                        And the check, hon.  We gotta truck on 
                        outta here.

           She leaves.  Rove continues the conversation.

                                 ROVE
                        Attacks on the opposition can work, but 
                        it can easily blow back on the attacker.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m not just talking about attacks. I’m 
                        talking about totally ignoring what an 
                        election is about, and making it about 
                        something else.  

                                 ROVE
                        So this election is not about organizing 
                        the party on campuses...

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s about Terry Dolan being a Yankee 
                        weasel who wants to come down here and 
                        set his agenda, not the people’s.

           Rove chuckles.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        They don’t have to love you as long as 
                        they hate the other guy more.

           The waitress brings them the check and an egg in the 
           shell.  Rove is delighted.

                                 ROVE
                        Okay, here’s a question for you: Can you 
                        make this egg stand on its tip?

                                 ATWATER
                                 (evasive)
                        This egg?  
                                 ROVE
                        It’s a test.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (to imaginary audience)
                        My opponent will talk about this egg but 
                        he refuses to talk about what happened at 
                        the CR seminar in San Diego.

                                 ROVE
                        That’s no-- What do you know about that?

           Atwater just smiles and picks up the egg.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m full as a tick.  Let’s get out of 
                        here.

           Lee Atwater smacks the egg down on the table.  The shell 
           cracks slightly and flattens, leaving the egg standing on 
           its tip.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

           TITLE CARD: GAINESVILLE, FL.

           Karl and Lee pull up in the brown Pinto.  A muscular 
           blues instrumental plays on the SOUNDTRACK.

           They get out of the car and walk across the parking lot.

           They are dressed for success, freshly groomed, briefcases 
           swinging at their sides.  Ready to conquer Gainesville.   

           Rove’s hair is still wet from his shower.

           They see a BLACK 1970 CADALLAC COUPE DE VILLE pull into 
           the lot.  The Dapper Man is behind the wheel.  

                                 ROVE
                        Dolan.

           Rove and Atwater hurry into towards the cover of the 
           building and watch their rivals discreetly.

           Terry Dolan, Kate, The Dapper Man and the Henchman in 
           Black all step out coolly.  Terry Dolan puts on a pair of 
           black sunglasses.

           They hurry inside.
           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Atwater and Rove enter the empty lobby.  A sign greets 
           them:  KEYNOTE SPEAKER: ROBERT EDGEWORTH, CHAIRMAN OF THE 
           MICHIGAN COLLEGE REPUBLICANS.   

           Edgeworth’s smiling picture is next to the words.  Rove 
           does not seem pleased.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           They enter the packed hall, and remain standing in the 
           back of the room.  

           ROBERT EDGEWORTH is at the podium.  He is a tall, thin 
           man with wispy fair hair.  He looks significantly older 
           than his 27 years.  

           Edgeworth’s speech is nearing its climax. 

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        We need a national party that reflects 
                        the core of our beliefs: That every 
                        individual matters.  That personal 
                        responsibility is vital.  That we trust 
                        the actions of free men and women, not 
                        the dictates of a bureaucracy.

                                 ROVE
                                 (to Atwater)
                        Damn that’s good, I’ve got to use that 
                        sometime.

           Atwater draws Rove’s attention to Dolan’s party, which 
           has just entered the other side of the lecture hall.

           Dolan’s group now includes an older PORTLY MAN. Rove 
           takes special interest in him.  

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        That’s Morton Blackwell.

                                 ATWATER
                        Who?

                                 ROVE
                        He’s the godfather of the CR.  He’s was 
                        chairman in the 60s.   
                                 ATWATER
                                 (remembering)
                        Oh yeah, right, and he still hangs 
                        around.  “The oldest College Republican.”

           They watch as Blackwell whispers into Dolan’s ear.  Dolan 
           nods and leaves the room with the DAPPER MAN.

                                 ROVE
                        I didn’t know he was backing Dolan.
                        His influence goes to the highest levels.

                                 ATWATER
                        Don’t worry about.  My buddy Al Dark is 
                        here, works for the Governor.  One word 
                        from him gets us the Florida Chairman.

           Rove is skeptical.  Their attention turns to the stage.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                                 (to audience)
                        It is our beliefs that will carry the 
                        day.  It is our ideals that will speak to 
                        the coming age.  Thank you.

           The crowd applauds.

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           The crowd files out of the lecture hall.  Atwater pushes 
           through, Rove follows.

           Some Dolan volunteers are handing out LEAFLETS.  They 
           seem very organized.  Rove takes one.  

           The leaflets show a stylized photo of Terry Dolan’s 
           smiling face under the words: DOLAN: CRNC IN 73.  Rove 
           frowns.  

           Atwater is trying to get the attention of his friend, the 
           consultant ALVIN DARK, 28.  Dark is tall and tanned, with 
           an athlete’s physique.   Dark is a fast talker.

                                 ATWATER
                        Hey, Al!  Alvin Dark!  It’s Lee.

                                 DARK
                        I’m sorry, do I know you?

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s Lee.  Lee Atwater.  South Carolina.
                                 DARK
                        Oh, Atwater!  Right.  You look... 
                        different or something.

                                 ATWATER
                        This is Karl Rove, he’s going to be-- 

                                 DARK
                        Rove, you look tighter than a new girdle.

                                 ROVE
                        Well, I-- I’m not.

           Dark laughs obnoxiously. 

                                 DARK
                        I’m just fucking with you.

                                 ATWATER
                        Alvin, we could sure use...

                                 DARK
                        I know, I know.   This thing is turning 
                        into a streetfight.  You know, fuck 
                        Dolan.  And Blackwell.  He’s a bastard.  
                        I’m in with you guys.  All the way.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Mighty fine of you, sir.

                                 DARK
                        Anything you need.  Well, almost 
                        anything.  No, one thing.  You get one 
                        favor.  You want me to talk to the 
                        Chairman for you?

                                 ATWATER
                        We would appreciate it.

                                 DARK
                        Eh... alright.  

                                 ROVE
                        That’s good enough for me.

                                 ATWATER
                        Good enough to smack your granny.

           Atwater notices Kate King walking by behind Dark.  She 
           makes eye contact with Lee discreetly.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        You fellas excuse me for a minute?
           Atwater slips away, leaving Rove and Dark alone.  An 
           awkward moment passes.

                                 DARK
                        I’m going to leave now.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Kate heads into the ladies’ restroom.  Atwater follows.

           INT. LADIES’ ROOM

           There is a minor commotion among the several young women 
           in the room at Atwater’s appearance.   They leave 
           abruptly.

           Lee tips an imaginary hat to them as they go.

                                 ATWATER
                        Ladies.

           He and Kate are alone.  They look at each other for a 
           brief moment.   Suddenly, they throw themselves into a  
           passionate kiss.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           The hall is mostly empty now.  Robert Edgeworth is at the 
           podium gathering up his papers.   A group of well-wishers 
           are walking away from him toward the exits.

           Another approaches.  It is Karl Rove.

                                 ROVE
                        Great speech, Bob.

           Edgeworth recognizes the voice before he turns around.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        How are you, Karl?

                                 ROVE
                        Fabulous.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Good to hear.

           Awkward pause.
                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got to be honest with you, Karl, I 
                        was very disappointed to hear you had 
                        entered the race.

                                 ROVE
                        I’m sure you were.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        No, not like that.  It’s just... I have a 
                        lot respect for you, your intelligence 
                        and potential.   And I think you’re 
                        making a mistake here.

                                 ROVE
                        And you’re wrong.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Maybe, maybe so.
                                 (pause)
                        I was really hoping to have your support 
                        for my candidacy.

           Rove laughs.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        I’d have gladly returned the favor and 
                        supported you in two years.

                                 ROVE
                        It wasn’t to be.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        It’s not too late.

                                 ROVE
                        You’re going to lose, Bob

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        It’s certainly possible.  But also beside 
                        the point.

           Rove scoffs at this, but is confused.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        However this turns out, let’s remember 
                        we’re all on the same side.  You and I 
                        agree on 90% of the issues, the last time 
                        I checked.

                                 ROVE
                        This campaign is about more than issues.
                                 EDGEWORTH
                        What is it about?

                                 ROVE
                        It’s about...  who we are.  Who puts the 
                        better face on the party.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Ah, the cult of personality.  Inescapable 
                        in politics, I suppose.  

                                 ROVE
                        It is, after all, a popularity contest. 

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Are you sure you’re that popular?

                                 ROVE
                        I will be.

           Edgeworth picks up a tinge of darkness in Rove’s comment.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Be careful, Karl.

           Rove smiles.  

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        Facilis descensus Averni.

                                 ROVE
                        Pardon?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        It’s from Virgil.  “It is easy to go down 
                        into Hell; the gates of dark death stand 
                        wide; but to climb back again, into the 
                        upper air; that’s the real task.”  

           Rove bristles, he seems to feel condescended.

                        Virgil, really?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        The poets had some interesting things to 
                        say too, Karl-- it’s not just the 
                        generals and schemers.

                                 ROVE
                                 (irritated)
                        Believe it or not, I have read Virgil.  
                        If you think that you can--
                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Relax, Karl, I’m teasing you.

                                 ROVE
                        Well, I--  I don’t appreciate it.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I apologize then.

           Edgeworth extends his hand.  Rove shakes it.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just have an honest debate.  True 
                        to our ideals. 

                                 ROVE
                        You think I’m going to betray our ideals.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        No, I--

           Edgeworth stops himself, wary of an argument.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        The only thing a man can betray is his 
                        own conscience.   It was nice seeing you 
                        again, Karl.

           Edgeworth walks away.  Rove feels compelled to get in the 
           last word.  It comes out as awkward and confrontational.

                                 ROVE
                        Yeah.  Well, you’ll see me again.  Real 
                        soon. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Terry Dolan stands with a group of important-looking 
           OLDER GENTLEMAN.  The Portly Man --Morton Blackwell-- 
           introduces them to Terry.   Handshakes all around. 

           Rove walks out of the lecture hall, just in time to 
           witness the scene.   

           He sees that Alvin Dark is with Dolan’s group, laughing 
           his OBNOXIOUS LAUGH.   Rove watches suspiciously as they 
           leave the lobby together.

           Rove stands alone in the empty lobby.  He looks around.
                                 ROVE
                                 (calls out)
                        Lee?

           EXT. UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE HALL - DAY

           Karl Rove is having a conversation in a phone booth.  He 
           seems a bit irate.

                                 ROVE
                                 (on phone)
                        Look, Jim.   This Atwater kid is a flake.   
                        He doesn’t know what he’s doing.  He 
                        needs to go back to where he came from.
                                 (pause)
                        I disagree.  
                                 (pause)
                        Please, Jim.  I need some help from 
                        Chicago.  Send me Tom Redstone.  Billy 
                        the Girl.  Anybody.   

           Rove’s face does not like Jim’s answer.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Well-- I--- I don’t know why you still 
                        think that.
                                 (pause)
                        Fine.  If that’s the way you feel. 
                                 (pause)
                        Hello?

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Kate peeks out the Ladies’ Room door. The coast is clear.  

           She and Atwater emerge.  She is fixing her clothes.  Lee 
           is proudly disheveled.

           They start to go their separate ways, but Kate suddenly 
           turns around, heading back to Lee.

                                 KATE
                        I almost forgot...

           Lee moves in to kiss her.   Kate slaps him away.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Knock it off.

           Kate looks around to make sure nobody is watching them. 
           She hands him a piece of paper with an ADDRESS on it.  
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        It’s Terry’s condo down here where he’s 
                        staying.  You should check it out 
                        tonight.

                                 ATWATER
                        You want me to meet you at Terry’s place?  
                        Christ, woman, that is bold!

                                 KATE
                        No, you idiot, I’m not going to be there.  
                        You need to spy on him.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh.  Why?  What’s, uh...?

           Lee realizes she’s not going to tell him.

                                 KATE
                        You never know what you might find.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. GAINESVILLE STREET - NIGHT

           The Pinto is parked on the street outside Dolan’s condo.   
           It is the size of a large two-family house.  The 
           residential block is crowded with similar structures.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Lee and Karl sit in the car.  Lee is behind the wheel.  
           They eye the darkened windows of Dolan’s condo.

                                 ROVE
                        Are you sure you can trust this girl?

                                 ATWATER
                        No.

                                 ROVE
                        That’s comforting.

                                 ATWATER
                        We got nothing to lose for now.

                                 ROVE
                        It could be a ruse to distract us.

                                 ATWATER
                        Nah.  I think something’s going down. 
                                 ROVE
                        We’ve been here over an hour.  

                                 ATWATER
                                 (dismissive)
                        Just work on your graphics.

           We see that Rove has a notepad in front of him that he’s 
           been doodling on.  It says: “ROVE ‘73” in different hand-
           drawn letter styles.

                                 ROVE
                        Well, I’m bored.   We should do something 
                        here.   It’s time.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (skeptical)
                        What are you gonna do?   

                                 ROVE
                        I do have some experience with this sort 
                        of thing.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, you do?   

           Rove glares at him.  

                                 ROVE
                        Like, what do you think is in those 
                        garbage cans over there?

           Rove points at two garbage cans up the driveway beside 
           the building.

                                 ATWATER
                        I don’t know.  Garbage?

                                 ROVE
                        Maybe.  Maybe old bills, phone records, 
                        receipts.  Information. 

           Lee looks at Karl.  Karl looks back at Lee.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Atwater is rooting through the GARBAGE CAN.  Rove stands 
           watch a few yards away, peering around the corner of the 
           building. 

           Atwater picks a rotten GRAPEFRUIT out of the garbage.  He 
           makes a face as he handles it.   
                                 ATWATER
                                 (whispers)
                        Why do I have to do this?

                                 ROVE
                                 (whispers)
                        I’m the candidate, I shouldn’t get my 
                        hands dirty.

           Atwater chucks the grapefruit in Rove’s direction.  It 
           sails past Rove and SPLATTERS.

           Dogs bark.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

                                 ATWATER
                        Shhh.

           Rove glares at Atwater, who goes back to digging through 
           the garbage.   

           Atwater pulls out a crumpled paper and inspects it.  It 
           is a torn page of a magazine.  He starts to unfurl it.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

           Rove walks over, his interest piqued.

           It is a PHOTOGRAPH from a magazine, of a burly, SHIRTLESS 
           MAN, with a mustache and hairy chest.

           Atwater unfurls the rest of the image, revealing the man 
           in the picture to be totally nude.   

                                 ROVE AND ATWATER
                        Aaahhh!

           Atwater drops the picture.  Karl and Lee are stunned.  

                                 ROVE
                        Good God.

           Rove looks in the trash can, there are more crumpled-up 
           gay porn images.  Rove picks up a few of them.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Eww!  Eww. Don’t touch that!

                                 ROVE
                        Dolan is a closet case.
                                 ATWATER
                        He’s a fucking fairy is what is he is.

                                 ROVE
                        Shhhh!
                                 (low voice)
                        This is unbelievable.

                                 ATWATER
                        This is fantastic.

                                 ROVE
                        Can we use this?

                                 ATWATER
                        Use it?  Are you fucking shitting me?   
                        This is a gift from the gods.  

           CAR HEADLIGHTS suddenly move across the scene.   A black 
           car pulls into the driveway, heading towards them.

           Lee Atwater shoots like a bullet into the back yard.   
           Rove follows a split second later.

           A man jumps out of the car and CHASES AFTER THEM.

                                 CAR MAN
                        Hey!  

           Rove and Atwater flee in a mad panic.   

           Atwater’s eyes dart around the backyard.   It is enclosed 
           by a CHAIN LINK FENCE.  They are trapped!

           Rove obliviously runs by Atwater and SMACKS INTO THE 
           FENCE, almost knocking it completely down.

           Rove bounces off the fence, staggers, but does not fall.

           The fence is now at a 45 degree angle.   Atwater climbs 
           it quickly and easily to the other side.  Rove follows.

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE

           Two large ROTTWEILERS come after them, barking viciously.  

           This yard is also fenced in.  Rove and Atwater run for 
           the gate as the Rottweilers nip at their heels.

           The Car Man is climbing over from his side of the fence. 

           They reach the gate, open it.   They’re out!
           Rove tries to close the gate behind them, but it is too 
           late.  The dogs are upon him.

           Atwater RUNS INTO THE STREET.   A car screeches to a 
           halt, mere inches from hitting him.  Lee freezes.

           It is a POLICE CAR.  Atwater makes eye contact with the 
           POLICE OFFICER behind the wheel. 

           A second later, Rove comes running past.  He flies down 
           down the street, the two Rottweilers in pursuit.  

           Atwater runs away from the police car, up the driveway of 
           the house across the street.

           The Officer jumps out and chases after Lee.

                                 OFFICER
                        Stop right there!

           Lee threads a narrow passage between two houses.  The 
           Officer follows closely behind. 

           The Car Man watches them all disappear into the distance 
           and chooses not to follow.

           DOWN THE STREET

           Rove is barely ahead of the Rottweilers.  He weaves in 
           and out of the spaces between parked cars, to minimize 
           the animals’ speed advantage.

           Finally, Rove climbs up the back end of a large car and 
           scrambles up onto the roof.   The metal roof lets out a 
           loud CRUNCH as it bends with the impact.

           The dogs bark and paw at the sides of the car.  Rove is 
           safe, but stranded.

           ATWATER AND THE POLICE OFFICER

           They sprint through the back yards of the block, dodging 
           barbecue grills and patio furniture.

           Atwater turns sharply around a blind corner, and ducks 
           underneath a CLOTHESLINE.

           The Officer, a taller man, is tagged by the clothesline 
           and falls to the ground onto his back.

           Atwater is free and clear.
           ROVE ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR

           The Rottweilers are barking loudly.  A light goes on in 
           the window of the nearest house.  

           Rove stands up, readies himself, takes two steps, and 
           JUMPS off the roof and over a nearby fence.

           He lands with a roll safely in the next yard.  There is 
           now a fence between Rove and his canine attackers.  

           Rove retreats into the back yard of the house.  The dogs 
           continue to bark.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. GAINESVILLE STREET - NIGHT

           It is some time later, back on Dolan’s block.   Rove 
           emerges from some bushes and cautiously approaches the 
           Pinto.

           He hurries to the car, trying to stay low and out of 
           sight, and slips in the passenger side door.   

           INT. PINTO - NIGHT

           The car seems to be empty until Lee Atwater pops his head 
           out from the back seat.

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s about time.  

                                 ROVE
                                 (startled)
                        Ah!

                                 ATWATER
                        I been waiting forever back here.

                                 ROVE
                                 (sarcastic)
                        So sorry.  How rude of me.  Can we get 
                        the fuck out of here please?

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m with you, Chairman.  We got a big day 
                        tomorrow, big day.
           Atwater climbs into the driver’s seat.  Rove is still 
           calming down.

                                 ROVE
                        What are we going to do... about Dolan?

                                 ATWATER
                        What are we gonna do?  We’re gonna strip 
                        the bark off the little bastard. 

                                 ROVE
                        I don’t know...  We don’t have any proof.

                                 ATWATER
                        We don’t need to prove anything.  We need 
                        take a big magic marker and write “queer” 
                        right on his forehead.  

                                 ROVE
                        It’s not that simple.

                                 ATWATER
                        You ever met a real homo before, Karl?

           Close up of Karl Rove thinking.

           INT. HOUSE - KARL’S MEMORY - DAY

           It is a sunny summer day, Karl stands outside on the 
           porch and KNOCKS on the edge of the screen door.

                                 ROVE
                        Hello?

           He lets himself in.  He looks around for the occupant.

           Rove sees a half-closed door to a room with a colored 
           light on inside.   He goes over to it.   STRANGE MOOD 
           MUSIC can be heard from within.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           Karl pushes open the door.  SHOCK AND HORROR take over 
           his face.   We see nothing of the inside of the room.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PINTO - NIGHT

           Rove answers Atwater’s question.
                                 ROVE
                        No.  Never.

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, no one has.  And when word gets out 
                        that Dolan is a dick jockey, they will 
                        run from that WASPy motherfucker like 
                        he’s a black Jew with leprosy.

                                 ROVE
                        He’ll just deny it, and we’ll look bad.

                                 ATWATER
                        If he has to come out and say “I am not a 
                        homo,” then say hello to Chairman Rove, 
                        it’s over.

                                 ROVE
                        The story won’t be him.  It’s going to be 
                        us accusing him. 

           Atwater laughs.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, okay.  We’re not going to accuse him 
                        of anything, see.   It’s just a rumor. 

                                 ROVE
                        Well, that can still be--

                                 ATWATER
                                 (mock outrage)
                        And our campaign will not be spreading 
                        any rumors, I can tell you that.

                                 ROVE
                        Then who will be?

                                 ATWATER
                        The Edgeworth campaign, of course.  

           Atwater smiles.  

                                 ROVE
                        What if it comes back to us?

                                 ATWATER
                        We play dumb and keep movin’.
           EXT. GAINESVILLE STREET - NIGHT

           The Pinto drives away into the distance.  However, the 
           camera remains on Terry Dolan’s street.

           We see Terry Dolan walk out of his condo.   

           But Dolan’s condo is actually ACROSS THE STREET from the 
           condo whose garbage Rove and Atwater searched.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. COLLEGE HOUSE - MORNING

           The brown Pinto is parked outside of a small, poorly 
           maintained home.

           Lee Atwater stands in the yard, wearing extremely short 
           jogging shorts, doing leg stretches.

           INT. COLLEGE HOUSE LIVING ROOM- MORNING

           Karl Rove is asleep on a ratty plaid couch.  The sound of 
           a door SLAM wakes him up.

           Atwater hustles into the room with a spring in his step.  
           He is drinking from a large jar of TANG ORANGE DRINK.

           He gulps downs the drink.  Rove sits up, disheveled.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (re: Tang)
                        Good stuff.

                                 ROVE
                        What time is it?

                                 ATWATER
                        Time to hit the phones.

                                 ROVE
                        How long have you been up?

                                 ATWATER
                        Since five.  Just can’t sit still today.  
                        Already did a four mile run.   
                                 (yells down hallway)
                        Hey Pine-Top! Wake the fuck up, we need 
                        you!
           MONTAGE SEQUENCE - PHONE CALLS

           We see a quick montage of phone calls.  Each line of 
           dialogue belongs to different conversation, with untold 
           time passing between each one.

           An up-tempo chunk of SOUTHERN FUNK ROCK kicks off with a 
           cowbell intro.  

                                 ROVE
                        Hi, Ron.  My name’s Sam Smith.  I’m 
                        calling on behalf of Robert Edgeworth... 

                                 ATWATER
                        You know, he said something really out 
                        there about Terry Dolan... I’m just not 
                        sure I can believe it.

           Atwater has the Dolan campaign flyer in front of him.   
           He has written “QUEER” on Dolan’s forehead in the photo.

                                 ROVE
                        I thought so, especially after this Dolan 
                        thing.  Oh, uh... forget I said that.
                                 (pause)
                        Well... okay.  But you didn’t hear this 
                        from me...   

                                 ATWATER
                        Would you like to participate in a poll 
                        about the candidates for CRNC chairman?

                                 ROVE
                        Would you like to participate in a poll?

           PINE-TOP, a young man with his hair buzzed into a CREW 
           CUT is on the phone also, reading from a script.

                                 PINE-TOP
                        Question Three: Would you be more or less 
                        likely to support Terry Dolan if you knew 
                        he was homo-sexual?

           EXT. GAINESVILLE STREET - DAY

           The Brown Pinto rolls out of town.  Over the images, we 
           hear VOICE OVER of Karl and Lee continuing their calls.

                                 ROVE (V.O.)
                        I heard he made a pass at the guy...
           INT. PINTO - DAY

           Lee and Karl bob their heads to the music.

                                 ATWATER (V.O.)
                        You’re assistant to the State Chairman?  
                        Well, I’ll just leave a message...  

           EXT. RURAL FILLING STATION - DAY

           A gas station attendant pumps gas into the Pinto.   Lee, 
           still in his jogging outfit, JOGS IN A CIRCLE around the 
           car.  Rove watches.

                                 ROVE (V.O.)
                        ...Tell the Chairman I’m 100% sure Terry 
                        Dolan is not gay.  Even if he’s heard 
                        otherwise.  

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           INT. GEORGIA FRAT HOUSE - DAY

           We see Lee’s friend Earl dialing a rotary phone.  

           Quick cut to Earl talking on the phone. 

                                 EARL
                        Yeah, I don’t think John Kinney knows 
                        about Terry.  What would that say about 
                        him if he did?

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

           Sign says: WELCOME TO ALABAMA

                        Yeah, Gene, I don’t know what to think.  
                        It’s some pretty deviant stuff.

           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

           The Pinto pulls into a roadside motel.
           INT. OFFICE -- MORNING

           Close up of the phone ringing.  Georgia Chairman John 
           Kinney on the phone.

                                 KINNEY
                        Well, uh, I can’t be certain... who I’m 
                        supporting any more...

                        What?  What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - MORNING’

           The pinto drives very slowly along the road.  Rove 
           drives.  Lee Atwater is JOGGING alongside the driver’s 
           window, talking as he runs.

                                 ROVE
                        Next we see the Alabama Chairman?

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, but be careful-- he’s one of those 
                        third eye Jesus freaks.  They scare the 
                        tar out of me.

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING

           We hear a phone ringing.   The Southern Funk on the 
           soundtrack reaches a percussion interlude (cowbell).

           INT. CRNC OFFICE - MORNING

           National Chairman Jim Costello is on the phone.

                                 COSTELLO

                        No.  Certainly no one from my campaign. 
                        Yes, Sam Smith is from my campaign...

           EXT. COLLEGE TOWN - DAY

           The Pinto passes a sign that says MONTEVALLO, ALABAMA. 

           INT. ALABAMA CHAIRMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Karl and Lee are meeting with the Alabama State Chairman, 
           JEFF, 27, and two other men.

                                 ROVE
                        Mr. Chairman.

                                 CHAIRMAN JEFF
                        Karl, this my colleague from Liberty 
                        University, Reverend Falwell. 

                                 ROVE
                        Reverend.

           The Reverend JERRY FALWELL, 40, stocky with a large chin, 
           shakes Karl Rove’s hand.

                                 FALWELL

                        Yeah, hi, it’s Terry.  I just wanted... 
                        There’s a vicious rumor going around that 
                        I’m not a queer-- I mean that I am a 
                        queer.  That’s the rumor, I mean.  But 
                        I’m not.

                        Gene: I’ve never heard about it.  I’ve

           INT. ALABAMA CHAIRMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           The soundtrack song fades far into the background as Lee 
           and Karl continue their meeting.

                                 CHAIRMAN JEFF
                        If it’s true, it’s an outrage.  And 
                        Robert Edgeworth is the one spreading 
                        this around?

                                 ATWATER
                        That’s how I heard about it, Jeff.

                        Well, he’s doing the lord’s work.  A gay 
                        person would just as soon kill you as 
                        look at you.

           Atwater steals an impish look with Rove. 

                                 ROVE
                        For sure.

                                 ATWATER
                        And with a handsome gentleman like 
                        yourself, Reverend, I’m afraid killing 
                        might be his second choice.

           Rove looks away, trying not to laugh.  Reverend Falwell, 
           stone-faced, ponders this.

           The Southern funk soundtrack song kicks into high gear 
           again, the MONTAGE continues.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

           TITLE: OXFORD, MISSISSIPPI
           The Pinto pulls into the campus of the UNIVERSITY OF 
           MISSISSIPPI.   There is a mass PROTEST going on.

           The PROTESTERS are not unkempt students, however, but 
           middle-aged middle-class white folks.   

                                 BULLHORN MAN
                        What do we want?

                                 CROWD
                        NOW!

           INT. MISSISSPPI CHAIRMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           The Mississippi State Chairman, FOSTER, 26, looks out the 
           window high above the protest.  Rove and Atwater are 
           sitting in chairs behind him.

                                 FOSTER
                        School freedom, big issue down here.

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s forced busing, Karl.  People don’t 
                        like the federal government forcing kids 
                        to go to schools hundreds of miles away.  
                        Ain’t that right, Foster?

                                 FOSTER
                        Damn right.

                                 ROVE
                                 (skeptical)
                        Hundreds?  Really?

                                 FOSTER
                        And they make them go to nigger schools.  

           The word “nigger” freezes Rove and Atwater.  They look at 
           each other.   

                                 FOSTER (CONT’D)
                        And Nixon supports that.   Now, I’m 
                        Chairman of the Mississippi College 
                        Republicans, but I will not support the 
                        national party if they make my nephews go 
                        to nigger schools.
           Rove is still frozen, unsure of how to proceed.  Atwater 
           begins to thaw. 

                                 ATWATER
                        Look, Foster, I’m from South Carolina.

           Long pause.  Foster nods.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Whatever the views of the national 
                        leadership on integra-- on “forced 
                        busing”-- you can be sure that Karl here 
                        is going to fight for what’s right, 
                        whether its popular up there or not.

                                 FOSTER
                        Amen.

                                 ATWATER
                        Damn right.

                                 FOSTER
                        So where do you stand, Karl?

           All eyes on Karl.   He seems a little uncomfortable.

                                 ROVE
                        Well.... I sincerely believe that, uh... 
                        well, it’s not up to me.   States need to 
                        decide for themselves.

                                 ATWATER
                        States’ rights.

                                 FOSTER
                        States’ rights!

           INT. CHAIRMAN’S OFFICE LOBBY - DAY

           Lee is talking on the PHONE at the reception desk.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (on phone)
                        Okay.   I understand. 

           Atwater’s face is eerily blank.  He seems stunned.

           Rove approaches him.  Karl senses the strangeness.

                                 ROVE
                        What?  What is it?
                                 ATWATER
                        Message from Earl...

           Atwater still seems in a fog, not entirely present.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        ...It’s over.   Terry Dolan dropped out 
                        of the race.   We won.

           The look at each other a moment, as the news sinks in.

           EXT. COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

           Rove and Atwater run down long steps of the building 
           screaming in celebration.

                                 ROVE AND ATWATER
                        Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

           At the bottom of the steps, they grab each other’s 
           shoulders and jump up and down together.

           INT. MISSISSIPPI FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The jumping up and down continues, now in a crowded room 
           full of revelers at a Mississippi Fraternity PARTY.

           The raucous scene pulses with MUSIC and SHOUTING.  Lee 
           Atwater is the center of attention, shotgunning a can of 
           PABST BLUE RIBBON, with the crowd cheering him on.

                                 CROWD
                        Lee!  Lee!  Lee!

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeaeeeeaaaaa!  Whoo!

           Rove downs a shot and makes a face.   He sees Atwater 
           talking to a pretty young COLLEGE GIRL.

           Karl thinks about going over to his friend, but he slips 
           away and quietly and LEAVES THE ROOM.

           INT. MISS. FRAT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Karl Rove is on the phone with CRNC Chairman Jim 
           Costello.   Rove struggles to hear over the loud music in 
           the next room.
                                 ROVE
                        Hello?  Jim?

           INT. COSTELLO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The conversation is intercut between Rove at the 
           Frathouse and Costello at his apartment in Washington. 

                                 COSTELLO 
                        Karl, I have never witnessed such 
                        wholesale destruction of someone’s 
                        character in such a short amount of time.

           Pregnant pause.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        Very impressive.  Was I right about 
                        Atwater?  

           INT. MISS. FRAT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

                                 ROVE
                        It’s my campaign, Jim.  I destroyed Terry 
                        Dolan.  Lee Atwater is my assistant.

                                 COSTELLO
                                 (skeptical)
                        Well.  Just don’t forget your promise.

                                 ROVE
                        Of course.  Lee will be my #2 in 
                        Washington. 

                                 COSTELLO
                        I’m going to talk to Chicago.  You’ll 
                        have our delegates, all of them.

           Rove pumps a fist in the air.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

                                 ROVE
                        Thank you, sir.

           As Rove hangs up the phone, Lee comes busting into the 
           lobby, with two COLLEGE GIRLS, one on each arm.

                                 ATWATER
                        C’mon, Karl, night’s a wastin.’
                                 ROVE
                        Where, uh... ?

                                 ATWATER
                        I cannot leave Mississippi tomorrow 
                        before we fully experience the almighty 
                        power of the Delta Blues!

           EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

           Cars surround the establishment, a ramshackle cinderblock 
           building off the side of a rural highway.  It has a two-
           tone peeling paint facade, in grey and sky blue.

           A large plain sign says BLUE FRONT CAFE.

           An African-American OLD MAN sits in a metal folding chair 
           on the concrete porch.

           The Pinto pulls up and parks, followed by another car, a 
           GREEN BUICK.  Karl and  Lee step out of the Pinto, while, 
           the two girls from the party emerge from the Buick.

           Karl is very apprehensive.  Lee strides across the gravel 
           parking lot with breezy aplomb. 

                                 ATWATER
                        This joint is bad ass.  
                                 (to Girl #1)
                        C’mon, baby doll.

           She takes his arm.

           INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

           The four young people walk into the rough and tumble 
           blues bar.   They are the only white people there.

           The all-black crowd takes immediate notice of them as 
           they stand in the entryway.   

           Rove and the college girls are extremely uncomfortable.  
           Lee hardly notices, his eyes are on the stage.

           An old BLUESMAN, 65, sunglasses, is on the stage.  He 
           plays a beat-up acoustic guitar and sings in a low moan.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (to Rove)
                        That guy’s a local legend out here: Blind 
                        Mississippi McGee.
                                 ROVE
                        Can we sit down or something?

           Atwater walks up to the bar.  The crowd’s attention has 
           by now moved elsewhere.

                                 ATWATER
                        Four Buds and four shots of whiskey.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Atwater downs a shot of whiskey while Karl and the two 
           girls sip on their beers.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                                 (offering shots)
                        No?

           Atwater downs a second shot.

                                 COLLEGE GIRL 1
                        I’ll have one.

                                 ATWATER
                        Alright!  
                                 (to Rove)
                        C’mon, Karl, don’t let her show you up.

           Karl, annoyed, takes the fourth shot in his hand.  He and 
           Girl 1 down their shots at the same time.  

           Girl 1 exhales vigorously.  

           Rove gags and THROWS UP in his mouth.   Spittle runs down 
           the side of his cheek.  The others LAUGH at him.

           INT. BATHROOM

           Rove splashes water over his sweaty face.  The sink is 
           incredibly grimy.

           In the mirror, Karl is startled by his sudden glimpse of 
           a BLACK PATRON waiting behind him for use of the sink.

                                 ROVE
                        Ah!

           Rove RUNS OUT of the bathroom.  The patron washes his 
           hands.
           AT THE BAR

           Rove sits with Girl 2.  Atwater and Girl 1 are nowhere to 
           be seen.

                                 ROVE
                                 (irate)
                        This is fucking unbelievable.   Where did 
                        they go?

                                 GIRL 2
                        I don’t know.  Outside.  To get 
                        something.

                                 ROVE
                        I didn’t see anyone out there.

                                 GIRL 2
                        What, you think I’m lying?

                                 ROVE
                        Did I say that?  No.

           They sit in silence, the crowd applauds at BLIND 
           MISSISSIPPI’s performance of a slow, sorrowful, classic 
           BLUES SONG.  He talks to the crowd.

                                 BLIND MISSISSPPI
                        Thank ya.  Thank ya much.  Got a new kid 
                        up here.  We gonna see what he can do.  
                        This is, uh...   

           They look to the stage.  It is Atwater, with his GIBSON 
           335 guitar.  Atwater whispers in the bluesman’s ear.

                                 BLIND MISSISSPPI (CONT’D)
                        ...Fat Baby Atwater.

           Atwater steps up to the mic.  Karl shocked. Girl 2 cheers 
           wildly.  The crowd doesn’t know what to make of him.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (in “Blues” voice)
                        ‘S here’s a li’l song by a Mr. B.B. 
                        King...

           Atwater launches into an electric Blues riff.   His chops 
           are immediately evident.  Lee is a fantastic guitarist.   
           Blind Mississppi joins in on HARMONICA

           The surprising abilities of Atwater and switch to a fun, 
           up-tempo number brings the roadhouse crowd to life.  
                                 VARIOUS CROWD
                        Wooo! ... Yeah, Fat Baby ...  White boy 
                        can play ...

           Lee leans into the mic and starts to sing-- his voice is 
           a little nasally, but has perfect raspy blues attitude.  
           The crowd EXPLODES.

           Everyone is having a great time.  Everyone except Karl.  

           Without a word, Girl 2 leaves him at the bar and goes to 
           to sit at Girl 1’s table near the front of the stage.

           Lee dances across the stage and does the SPLITS.

           Karl stews.

           SOME TIME LATER

           Lee and Blind Mississippi McGee are now playing a slower 
           number.   McGee is doing the vocals now. 

           Karl is still at the bar alone.  A shabbily dressed rail 
           THIN MAN, 55, comes up next to him and orders a drink.

                                 THIN MAN
                        I’ll have a Maker’s, on the rocks.  And 
                        it’s on this young gentleman here.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You got it.

                                 ROVE 
                        No.  No, I will not be paying for this 
                        man’s drink.

                                 THIN MAN
                        Your pal Fat Baby said drinks were on you 
                        if he got up there.

           Bartender looks at Rove.

                                 ROVE
                        This old man is talking out of his ass.   
                                 (to Thin Man)
                        Take a hike, dirtball.  

           The Thin Man takes a step toward Rove.   He is a smaller 
           man than Rove, but his intensity is a little frightening.
                                 THIN MAN
                        I’m not sure I heard you.  You wanna say 
                        that to me again?

           Rove points a shaky finger at the Thin Man’s chest.

                                 ROVE
                        Back off, old timer.  I don’t want any 
                        trouble here... 

           A group of four or five Patrons have gathered around the 
           scene, encircling Rove in a confrontational manner.

                                 PATRON 1
                        What the hell is this?

                                 PATRON 2
                                 (to Rove)
                        That’s Blue Johnny Slim.  Are you fuckin’ 
                        with Blue Johnny Slim?

           Rove is really flustered now.  He backs away and clumsily 
           knocks over a CHAIR, hitting another PATRON.

           Patron 1, clearly having fun with the situation, CLAPS 
           his hands LOUDLY near the back of Rove’s head. 

           Rove freaks out and RUNS out of the bar.   He TRIPS and 
           falls through the threshold of the door onto the porch. 

           EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

           Karl is in a full PANIC.  He quickly jumps up and 
           continues to RUN.

           He reaches the Pinto.  The doors are locked.  Rove runs 
           away down the empty dirt road.  No one follows him, no 
           one has even left the roadhouse.

           DOWN THE DIRT ROAD 

           Well out of sight of the Roadhouse, Karl slows down from 
           his sprint and crumbles into a grassy DITCH on the side 
           of the road.

           He curls into a ball.  His breathing is heavy.   Tears 
           stream down his cheeks.  

           Gradually, his breathing slows.   His eyes close.  

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. GRASSY DITCH BESIDE DIRT ROAD - MORNING

           Karl wakes up.  The bright morning sun hurts his eyes.

           EXT. ROADHOUSE - MORNING

           Rove walks up to the Roadhouse.

           In the light of day, the Roadhouse looks like an 
           abandoned building.   The Pinto is the only car outside.

           Rove looks inside the windows of the Pinto.  It is empty.

           Suddenly, a FIST flies out of nowhere and PUNCHES ROVE IN 
           THE FACE.  It belongs to a raging Lee Atwater, who has 
           ambushed Rove.

                                 ROVE
                        Ow!

           Rove falls to the ground.

                                 ATWATER
                        You son-of-a-bitch!

           Atwater hits him again, a glancing blow.  

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        I coulda got laid last night!  But you 
                        had to fuck it up, you dumbshit.

           Atwater continues the attack.  Rove defensively grabs 
           onto Atwater and pulls him the ground.

                                 ROVE
                        You think you’re such a fucking bigshot.  
                        Well, I’m bigger than you!  

           They ROLL AROUND in a cloud of DUST, trading blows.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Hillbilly.

                                 ATWATER
                        Faggot.

           Atwater grabs his hair and smears his face in the dirt.  
           Rove throws him off. 
                                 ROVE
                        You can’t pull hair! That’s against the 
                        rules! 

           Atwater kicks Rove in the midsection.

                                 ATWATER
                        There’s no fucking rules!

           Rove catches a kick and twists Atwater’s foot.  Atwater 
           grimaces in pain.

           EXTREME WIDE SHOT

           The fight continues on.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. ROADHOUSE - DAY - SOME TIME LATER

           Karl and Lee sit next to each other, against the wall of 
           the roadhouse.  They are totally EXHAUSTED.  

           They both hold wet wads of scrap cloth to their scratched 
           and bruised faces.

           Rove looks at Atwater.   All the animosity has been 
           drained out of them.

                                 ATWATER
                        You know... I don’t think Blind 
                        Mississippi knew I was white.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           An airplane flies through the frame.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           A man sits reading the Washington Post, a story about 
           Watergate.   He is smoking a cigarette.  We do not see 
           his face.

           A STEWARDESS standing at the gate makes an announcement.
                                 STEWARDESS
                        Now boarding Delta Flight 17 to Ann 
                        Arbor, Michigan.

           The man abruptly puts down his newspaper, revealing 
           himself to be Terry Dolan.   The Dapper Man is with him.

           Dolan grabs his bag to board the plane.

                                 DAPPER MAN
                        You sure about this?

                                 DOLAN
                        Listen to me carefully: When I am done, 
                        he will be lying in a pool of blood.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Karl and Lee are walking down the middle of the dirt 
           road, side-by-side.   Lee is carrying a GAS CAN.

           The Pinto can be seen far behind them in the distance, 
           pulled off the side of the road.

                                 ATWATER
                        There’s a station a mile or so up.  I saw 
                        it last night when I was driving around 
                        looking for you.

                                 ROVE
                        Thanks.   Thanks for doing that.  
                        I’m really...  I’m....  I probably 
                        shouldn’t have ran off like that.

           Rove can’t quite bring himself to say the word “sorry.” 
           Atwater smiles.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Tell me, Karl, why do you want to be 
                        Chairman?

                                 ROVE
                        I want to bring a new energy and new 
                        ideas to the...

                                 ATWATER
                        No, not the bullshit.  For real.  Where 
                        are you trying to go with this?  

           Rove looks over to Atwater, his tone more serious.
                                 ROVE
                        The Presidency.

           Atwater laughs.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m not seeing you as... presidential.

                                 ROVE
                        No, I don’t want to be President.   I 
                        don’t think I’m a good candidate, 
                        personally.

                                 ATWATER
                        Thanks for telling me now.

                                 ROVE
                        I’m going to be the chief advisor to a 
                        President.  That’s where the real power 
                        is.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Behind the throne.

                                 ROVE
                        Right.  

                                 ATWATER
                        And the College Republicans is sort of... 
                        way, way behind the throne.  

                                 ROVE
                        No, it’s a start.  Starting now, I plan 
                        to win.  I plan to win state elections, 
                        national elections, every time out.

                                 ATWATER
                        Perfect record.

                                 ROVE
                        If you can do that, people are going to 
                        notice you.   

                                 ATWATER
                                 (mock awe)
                        Yeah, wow, that’s impressive. I can’t 
                        believe no one’s ever thought of that 
                        before.

                                 ROVE
                        Funny.
                                 ATWATER
                        Here I was planning to lose sometimes and 
                        win sometimes. Win all the time?  Genius!

                                 ROVE
                        I know how I’m going to do it.  Don’t 
                        expect me to tell you though.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oooh.  File that under: “Karl’s top 
                        secret plan for world domination.”

           Atwater is really amusing himself now.  Rove is annoyed.

                                 ROVE
                        You wouldn’t understand anyway.  It’s a 
                        very complex formula of statistics and 
                        demographics.

                                 ATWATER
                        Secret formula.  That’s even better.

                                 ROVE
                        Big words, lots of numbers, not your 
                        thing.

                                 ATWATER
                        Just make sure the Russians don’t get it.  

                                 ROVE
                        The numbers are there.  If you know how 
                        to look at them, you can find the people 
                        who are going to support your candidate.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, there’s a candidate in this plan?  
                        It’s not just words and numbers?

                                 ROVE
                        It has to be the right candidate.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m with you on that one.  Hitch your 
                        wagon to a star.   

                                 ROVE
                        No, that’s what you don’t want to do.

                                 ATWATER
                        Karl, you could start an argument in an 
                        empty house.   
                                 ROVE
                        You need to make a candidate.  Out of 
                        nothing.  If you can make someone, then 
                        you control them.  A candidate that makes 
                        you can just cut you loose when they 
                        don’t need you anymore. 

                                 ATWATER
                        Winning every election with totally 
                        unskilled candidates.  Genius!

                                 ROVE
                        Some skill would help.   And they have to 
                        be somewhat wealthy and ambitious.   But 
                        mostly clueless.

                                 ATWATER
                        So they depend completely on you.

                                 ROVE
                        Right.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well, I guess there’s no shortage of 
                        clueless rich guys.

                                 ROVE
                        Exactly.  And who among them wouldn’t 
                        want to be President?

                                 ATWATER
                        Hmmm.... You’d have to really flatter the 
                        candidate, make him think all his ideas 
                        are great and he’s really smart.  

                                 ROVE
                        That’s right.

                                 ATWATER
                        And you need to pretend to be dumber than 
                        you are.

                                 ROVE
                        You’re getting it.

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, it’s a great idea.  You are pretty 
                        smart.

                                 ROVE
                        Thanks.
           Atwater smiles.  Rove seems to have no idea that he’s 
           being humored in exactly the way that’s been described.

           Lee and Karl stop walking, as there is a fork in the 
           road.  They are unsure which way to go.  A faint rumble 
           of THUNDER is heard in the distance.

                                 ATWATER
                        Hmmm.   I don’t remember this.

           Wide shot: they are at a classic SOUTHERN RURAL 
           CROSSROADS, right out of a Blues ballad.  

           A cluster of rickety shack-type buildings sits on the 
           corner.  Karl and Lee are startled by a voice from the 
           front porch.   It is an elderly black woman, MADAME 
           TOUISSANT, 60.

                                 MADAME TOUSSAINT
                        You boys looking for something?

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, is there a filling station around 
                        here?  Our car--

                                 MADAME TOUSSAINT
                        Don’t go that way.

           Karl and Lee look at each other.

                                 MADAME TOUSSAINT (CONT’D)
                        The devil’s down that path.

                                 ROVE
                        So we should go the other way?

                                 MADAME TOUSSAINT
                        Devil’s down that way too.

           Raindrops begin to fall.   The sky is about to open.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well, uh, thanks for all your help.

           Wide shot as Karl and Lee hustle down the road.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. EDGEWORTH’S OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Heavy rain falls over a nondescript building.
           INT. EDGEWORTH’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Robert Edgeworth sits at his desk looking at some papers.

           A SHADOWY FIGURE approaches from the hall through the 
           open door.

           Edgeworth looks up.  It is Terry Dolan.

                                 DOLAN
                        Hello, Robert.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Terry?  What are you doing here?

           Dolan speaks with an authority that verges on sinister.

                                 DOLAN
                        I have a proposition for you.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                                 (wary)
                        Proposition?

           Dolan hastily reconsiders his choice of words.

                                 DOLAN
                        I mean, uh... a proposal.

           Edgeworth starts to say something, but instead just looks 
           at Dolan, mystified.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. SERVICE STATION PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           It is pouring rain.  At a random roadside station, Karl 
           Rove is inside a phone booth.

           Atwater, in the background, puts gas in the car.

                                 ROVE
                                 (on phone, annoyed)
                        Yeah, Jim Costello.  Well, where is he?   
                        I was supposed to hear from him.  
                                 (pause)
                        Just have him call me back.  I’ll be at 
                        the University of Arkansas at, uh...

           Rove pulls out a crumpled sheet of paper.
                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        ... the, uh, student slash faculty meet-
                        and-greet.  Let me give you the number 
                        there...

           EXT. CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s a large mansion house used for campus functions.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE BAR

           Rove and Atwater sit at a bar.   Rove seems glum.

           Atwater points out a circle of people talking and 
           laughing in the next room.   Several attractive young 
           women are in the group.

                                 ATWATER
                        We should head over there, I’ll introduce 
                        you to Rex, Arkansas State Chairman.

           Atwater points out a young man in the circle with big 
           glasses, REX, 25.  Rex laughs loudly.  He is listening to 
           a young bushy-haired PROFESSOR, smoking a cigar with his 
           back to the camera. 

                                 ROVE
                        I don’t really feel like it.

           Atwater scoffs.  

                                 ATWATER
                        It’s why we’re here, you know.

                                 ROVE
                        You go over, tell him who I am, and let 
                        him know I’d like to meet him.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Sure.  Sure thing.

           Atwater does not move.

                                 ROVE
                        The first thing I want to do when we get 
                        to Washington: cut funding for the 
                        Georgia CR.
                                 ATWATER
                        I don’t know... John Kinney’s one of your 
                        supporters now, Karl.  He left Dolan.

                                 ROVE
                        Well, he wasn’t before.  He’s just trying 
                        to ride my coattails.  Fucking worm.

                                 ATWATER
                        We can still use him though.

                                 ROVE
                        True.  But after the convention.  He’ll 
                        learn not to cross me again.

           Atwater finishes his drink and heads over to the circle.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ll go get Rex.

           Rove sits, alone.

                                                                FADE TO:

           SOME TIME LATER

           Rove still sits alone.   Atwater has fully ingratiated 
           himself into the conversation circle in the next room.  
           He seems to have been there for some time.

           Rove looks over at him, raises his eyebrows.   Atwater 
           makes eye contact and gestures at Karl to wait a moment.  

           Rove gets up and leaves.

           ROVE ON THE HOUSE PHONE

                                 ROVE
                        Hi Jim!  Good to finally get you on the 
                        phone.   Where the hell--

                                 COSTELLO (V.O.)
                                 (other end of the phone)
                        Rove, shut the fuck up and listen.

           Rove’s face registers an unpleasant expression.

           BACK IN THE PARTY ROOM

           Atwater continues to mix with Rex’s group.
                                 PROFESSOR (O.S.)
                        And so I said to her, “Where’s that water 
                        comin’ from?”

                                 ATWATER
                        No!  No you did not!

           Atwater laughs.  He likes the Professor.

           Rove appears and pulls Atwater aside abruptly.  Karl’s 
           voice quivers as he struggles to keep his composure.

                                 ROVE
                        It’s over.  It’s fucking over.  We’re...  
                        I... we’ve lost. 

                                 ATWATER
                                 (low voice)
                        What are you talkin’ about?

           They are interrupted by Rex and the rest of the group, 
           who engage Rove, unaware of his fragile state.

                                 REX
                        Mr. Rove... a pleasure to meet you.  I’m 
                        Rex Wellemeyer.

           Rove shakes his hand limply.  Rex presents Rove to the 
           group.   

                                 REX (CONT’D)
                        This young gentleman is going to be 
                        National Chairman of the College 
                        Republicans.

                                 ROVE
                        No.  I’m not.   Not now.  Not anymore.  
                        Thanks to... dickheads... like you.   

           Atwater forces a laugh, attempting to pass the comment 
           off as a joke.   Rex laughs awkwardly, confused.   

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Yeah, he’s a Republican all right.

           The group roars with laughter.  The Professor is very 
           popular.  Rex laughs as well.  

                                 REX
                        Karl, you’ll have to excuse Professor 
                        Clinton here-- he’s a hopeless liberal.

           The young law professor is future President BILL CLINTON.
                                 PROFESSOR (CLINTON)
                        Hopeless?  I was born in Hope, a little 
                        town right down in Hempstead County.

                                 ROVE
                        I don’t care about your Hopetown, okay? 

                                 ATWATER
                        Please excuse us for a moment.

           Atwater escorts Rove away from the circle.

           IN THE NEXT ROOM

           Rove, still agitated and emotional, argues with Atwater.

                                 ATWATER
                        What the hell’s a matter with you?

                                 ROVE
                        It’s done.  It’s over.  Edgeworth is 
                        Chairman.

                                 ATWATER
                        Get a fucking grip, Karl!

                                 ROVE
                        He’s teamed up with Dolan.   He’s got all 
                        Dolan’s people now.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Are you drunk again?

                                 ROVE
                        I talked to Costello!  Edgeworth has all 
                        Terry’s Blackwell people and Kinney and 
                        everyone else.   He has fucking everyone!

                                 ATWATER
                        Well, uh... I’ll get on the phone, we can 
                        get ‘em back... I can-- 

                                 ROVE
                        There’s not enough time--the, the 
                        convention’s in two weeks-- 

                                 ATWATER
                        Just calm down.

                                 ROVE
                        We don’t have the votes!  
                                 ATWATER
                        It’s a setback.  We’re close.  It’s not a 
                        blowout.  

           Rove is on the verge of tears.

                                 ROVE
                        No, it’s done.  I’m quitting the race.

                                 ATWATER
                        Don’t be an idiot.  You have the Chicago 
                        syndicate, and all the votes they bring.  

                                 ROVE
                        No, I’ve got nothing. Chicago dropped me.  

                                 ATWATER
                        What?

                                 ROVE
                        They’re sitting it out.  They don’t want 
                        to back a loser.  And that’s what I am.

           Karl turns away from Lee and walks out the door into the 
           summer night.

           EXT. CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Karl is laying down in the grass of the lawn, staring up 
           at the stars.   He looks depressed to the point of 
           catatonia.

           A waft of cigar smoke enters his field of vision.

           It is young Professor Clinton.

                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON
                        Rough night, huh?

                                 ROVE
                        Please go away.

                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON
                        I know.  I know how you feel.  I’ve been 
                        there.  Beat down, tired.  Working hard, 
                        and not much to show for it.

                                 ROVE
                        Really, just go.
                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON
                        You feel pushed around.  A victim of the 
                        profound and powerful forces that are 
                        remaking our world.  But I’m not going to 
                        lie to you.  You are NOT a victim.

                                 ROVE
                        I’m not?

                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON
                        No.  Because each and every one of us has 
                        the power to change our world.  The power 
                        to learn from our mistakes.  

                                 ROVE
                        Maybe I could have done a few things 
                        differently.

                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON
                        Karl, success is not the measure of a 
                        man, but a triumph over those who choose 
                        to hold him back.  

           We see a close up of Rove’s face.  He is taking Clinton’s 
           words to heart.  His confidence is coming back to him.

                                 PROFESSOR CLINTON (CONT’D)
                        There is nothing wrong with America that 
                        cannot be fixed by what is right with 
                        America.  But the most important thing is 
                        to never give up.  Never quit.  Never 
                        quit.  Never quit. 

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rove bursts into the room with authority.  Lee is there 
           waiting.

                                 ROVE
                        I will be the Chairman!  I will not let 
                        them take this from me!

                                 ATWATER
                        Alright, I like it.  Let’s fuckin’ do 
                        this!

                                 ROVE
                        Alright!  Now, what are the fuck are we 
                        going to do?

                                 ATWATER
                        We’re going to the convention.
                                 ROVE
                        Yes!  With... no base of support, really.

                                 ATWATER
                        We’ll have Chicago.  I talked to Costello-

                                 ROVE
                        When?

                                 ATWATER
                        When you were lying on the fucking lawn.  
                        He’s gonna give us another chance.  I 
                        told him we’ll have the votes, that I 
                        have a plan.

                                 ROVE
                        You have a plan?

                                 ATWATER
                        No.  I lied about that part.

                                 ROVE
                        Hmmm.

           Silence.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well if we can’t get more votes, we’ll 
                        just have to take theirs away...

                                 ROVE
                                 (thinking)
                        Take theirs away...?

                                 ATWATER
                        Maybe we can dig up something on 
                        Edgeworth, maybe he...

                                 ROVE
                        Of course, that’s it!   We can do that!  
                        We’ll take theirs away!

                                 ATWATER
                        Are you makin’ fun of me?

                                 ROVE
                        No, I want to kiss you!

           Rove immediately regrets having said that.  Lee looks at 
           him strangely.   Suddenly the mood is very awkward, the 
           excitement has dissipated.
                                 ATWATER
                        But you’re not, though, right?

                                 ROVE
                        No.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (subdued)
                        Alight.  Let’s do this.

                                 ROVE
                        Okay.  Let’s ... go.

           They walk out together, a safe distance apart.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. MARRIOTT HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           TITLE CARD: COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION 1973

           MARRIOTT HOTEL, LAKE OF THE OZARKS, MISSOURI

           The mustard brown Pinto slows to a stop at the far edge 
           of the parking lot.

           Karl and Lee look out the windshield at the unremarkable, 
           unappealing building, taking it all in.

                                 ATWATER
                        Kind of a dump, huh?

                                 ROVE
                        What time does Costello’s plane touch 
                        down?

                                 ATWATER
                        2:15.   What time is the credentials 
                        meeting?

                                 ROVE
                        7:30.   

           Rove exhales.

                                 ATWATER
                        What?

                                 ROVE
                        You really think we can get away with it?
                                 ATWATER
                        Well, if you can’t run with the big dogs, 
                        then stay under the porch.

           Rove bristles at the remark, and steps on the 
           accelerator.   Atwater has pushed his buttons.

           The Pinto drives across the parking lot towards the 
           hotel.  A 1970s BLUES-ROCK SONG thunders onto the 
           soundtrack.

           ARRIVAL MONTAGE SEQUENCE.

           The pace is hectic as we jump from scene-to-scene.

           INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY - DAY

           Rove and Atwater walk hurriedly through the lobby, 
           carrying suitcases and stacks of papers.

           Earl, from Georgia, is there.   Lee calls out to him.

                                 ATWATER
                        Earl, great to see you.  Take this.

           Atwater hands him some paperwork without stopping.

                                 EARL
                        What is it?

                                 ROVE
                        New credentials-- you’ve been promoted.

           Earl looks at the paper curiously.

           INT. MARRIOTT HALLWAY - DAY

           We see JEFF, the ALABAMA CHAIRMAN wandering the hall with 
           a few ASSOCIATES in toe.  

           Rove stops to shake his hand, barely.

                                 ROVE
                        Thanks for sticking with me, Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Rove ‘73... because Bob Edgeworth is a 
                        homo-lover.  
                                 ATWATER
                        I like it.

                                 JEFF
                        Where’s the ballroom?

           Atwater is already gone down the hall.

                                 ROVE
                        There isn’t one.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM

           Atwater’s friend, PINE TOP, stands at a desk.

           Atwater enters the room, closes the door behind him, and 
           drops a stack of BLUE FLYERS on the desk.

           EXT. MARRIOTT HOTEL

           National Chairman James Costello steps out of the back 
           seat of his airport taxi.   

           He is flanked by two YOUNG MEN in sunglasses:  BILLY THE 
           GIRL, chubby with long sideburns, and TOM REDSTONE.

           INT. LOBBY

           Costello and his group step into the lobby.  Atwater’s 
           teenage assistant, Roscoe, announces their arrival.

                                 ROSCOE
                        The Chicago Boys are here!

           Rove and Atwater greet them.  They talk as they walk.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Why the hell did I let you put this thing 
                        up in the Ozarks?

                                 ROVE
                        Low turnout, sir, favors the incumbent 
                        party.   That’s us.

                                 COSTELLO
                        We’ll you’ve certainly got a low turnout.

                                 TOM REDSTONE
                        Half the delegates are voting by proxy.
                                 ROVE
                        All the better, we’ve got a stack of 
                        proxies, and absentee voters can’t change 
                        their minds.

           INT. HALLWAY

           They walk down towards a meeting room.  Rove hastily 
           introduces Costello’s associates.

                                 ROVE
                        Lee, this is Billy the Girl... 
                        ...and this is Tommy Redstone.

           Tom Redstone nods at Lee.  Lee nods back, an ODD MOMENT 
           passes between them.  They know each other.

           The group reaches the meeting room and closes the door.

           INT. LOBBY

           The lobby is becoming more crowded as delegates arrive.  

           Pine-Top is passing out the BLUE FLYERS to everyone.  

           INT. HALLWAY

           Rove and Billy the Girl are walking down the hall.   Rove 
           thumbs through a stack of papers as he walks.

           FOSTER, the racist Chairman of Mississippi is walking 
           down the hallway towards them.

           Rove starts to greet him, but Foster does not make eye 
           contact and walks right by.

                                 ROVE
                        Fucking Atwater.  I thought he had that 
                        guy for us.  

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                                 (speaks in a high voice)
                        Blackwell got to him for Edgeworth.   The 
                        treachery runs deep.

                                 ROVE
                        Put him on the list.
                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        Yes, sir.

           Billy the girl writes in a notepad as they walk..

                                 ROVE
                        You’re all business, Billy, I like that.  
                        Where the fuck is Atwater anyway?

           INT. LOBBY - FRONT DESK

           KATE KING is at the front desk.  Atwater approaches her.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well hello, Miss King.

                                 KATE
                                 (coolly)
                        Mr. Atwater.

                                 ATWATER
                        I didn’t think Terry was here yet.

                                 KATE
                        I’m not here for Terry.   I’m here 
                        representing the Wyoming College

                        Chairwoman.

           EXT. HOTEL

           Two black TOWN CARS appear outside the Hotel.

           Out of the first car steps Terry Dolan, with the Dapper 
           Man, and the Man in Black.  

           Robert Edgeworth steps out of the other car, along with 
           his assistant, the bookish PENNEBAKER.

           Dolan looks intense and sharp in a dark tailored suit.  
           Edgeworth wears tweed.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY

           The Edgeworth/Dolan group walks in.   
           Georgia Chairman JOHN KINNEY and Florida operative ALVIN 
           DARK are there to meet them. Dolan shakes Kinney’s hand 
           and introduces Edgeworth.  Kinney holds up a blue flyer.

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOBBY

           Rove, Atwater, and the Chicago Boys are walking towards 
           the exit when their counterparts come into view.

                                 ROVE
                        Here we go...

                                 COSTELLO
                        I’ll do the talking.

           The rival groups converge.  Dolan walks up to Rove, 
           irate, pointing at the BLUE FLYER.

                                 DOLAN
                        What the hell is this?

                                 ROVE
                        How should I know?  

                                 COSTELLO
                        Let me see that.

           The flyer is a list of bullet points, titled THE CASE 
           AGAINST ROBERT EDGEWORTH.   Point one: - ASSOCIATES WITH 
           KNOWN HOMOSEXUALS.

                                 DOLAN
                        You better lock your fucking door 
                        tonight, Rove.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (coughs)
                        Homo.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Hello, Jim.  How have you been?

                                 COSTELLO
                        I’m well, thanks.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                                 (polite)
                        So, what the hell is this?

           Costello looks over the flyer.  Sees point: - RECEIVED 
           ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY AT A MENTAL HOSPITAL IN 1966.
                                 COSTELLO
                        This is obviously the work of some of 
                        some rogue delegate.  See, they slander 
                        Karl as well...

           A second, much less noticeable heading at the bottom of 
           the sheet reads:  THE CASE AGAINST KARL ROVE.  

                                 ROVE
                        What?  Give me that.

           Rove grabs the flyer.   He seems genuinely surprised.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                                 (reading)
                        Pompous windbag...?

           A bearded man, LEON MEACH, 33, with wisps of grey, 
           approaches them.   He has an air of authority.

                                 MEACH
                        What seems to be the problem, gentlemen?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Leon!  Great to see you...

                                 MEACH
                        Likewise, my good man.

                                 COSTELLO
                        You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

                                 MEACH
                        Well maybe if there was an airport within 
                        a hundred miles of this rathole...

           Atwater laughs.  Everyone likes Meach.

                                 PINE-TOP (O.S.)
                        Hey.  Let go!

           Dolan’s two henchmen escort Pine-Top forcefully into the 
           scene, one on each arm.

                                 DAPPER MAN
                        This is the guy.

                                 MEACH
                                 (to Pine-Top)
                        Have you been distributing these 
                        broadsides?
                                 PINE-TOP
                        No way!

           The Dapper Man knocks Pine-Top’s bag out of his hand.   A 
           hundred BLUE FLYERS spill out onto the ground.

                                 MEACH
                        Mr. Chairman, I move that we have hotel 
                        security remove this man and that he be 
                        henceforth banned from the convention.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I second the motion.

           Costello hesitates, looking at Edgeworth and Meach.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Granted.   Get him the hell out of here.
                                 (beat)
                        Okay, let’s get on with this.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           TITLE CARD:  CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE MEETING

           Sitting at the head of a large table are the five 
           committee members: Costello, Rex from Arkansas, Meach, 
           Dolan’s Man in Black, and Alvin Dark.

           Seated around the table are 15-20 other College 
           Republicans.   There are not enough seats, the room is 
           crowded.

           We see Rove, seated across from the committee members.  
           There is an intimidating amount of research papers and 
           other materials in front of him.   

           Billy the Girl sits beside Rove, Atwater stands against 
           the wall in the background.   

           Costello begins the meeting, speaking in the RAPID FIRE 
           pace of an auctioneer.

                                 COSTELLO
                        I hereby call to order this meeting of 
                        the Credentials Committee of the College 
                        Republican National Convention

           Costello bangs his gavel on the table. 
                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        It is now...  7:40 PM, The floor is open, 
                        are there any motions on the floor?

                                 HICKS
                        Mr. Chairman.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Chairman Hicks, Delaware.

                                 HICKS
                        I move to commence with confirmation of 
                        the State Chairs.

           Rove looks over toward Billy the Girl and nods.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Do I have a second?

                                 PENNEBAKER
                        I second.

                                 COSTELLO
                        That motion is in order.  Those in favor? 

           A loud CHORUS OF VOICES respond in unison: 

                                 VOICES (MAJORITY)
                        Aye!

           Atwater makes eye contact with Tom Redstone, on the other 
           side of the room.   

           Redstone nods and leaves the room.  Atwater quietly slips 
           out as well.

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL

           Redstone and Atwater meet in the stairwell, careful to 
           note that they are alone.

                                 ATWATER
                        You got it?

           Redstone hands Atwater a small duffle bag.  Atwater opens 
           it.   Inside is a reel-to-reel AUDIO TAPE RECORDER.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Nice.   You won’t regret this, Tom.

                                 TOM REDSTONE
                        I’ll see you in Washington.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           The credentials meeting continues.

                                 COSTELLO
                        The floor recognizes John Kinney, Georgia 
                        State Chairman.

           John Kinney stands up.  Karl Rove and Billy the Girl 
           exchange a look.  Billy nods.  Rove raises his hand.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        Candidate Rove, Utah.

                                 ROVE
                        Point of Information.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Established.

                                 ROVE
                        John Kinney is not the Georgia State 
                        Chairman.

           The crowd murmurs with surprise.   Kinney is amused.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        The real Georgia State Chairman is... my 
                        colleague here, Earl Peavy.

           Dolan and Edgeworth look at each other, confused.  Lee’s 
           Georgia friend Earl sits beside Rove, nodding. 

           Kinney is flustered as he fumbles with his paperwork.

                                 KINNEY
                        Rove, that’s ridiculous.  I have--

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        Point of Order.

                        All remarks must be directed to the 
                        chair.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Sustained.  Direct future remarks to me.

                        Fine.  Jim, I am the goddamned Chairman 
                        of the Georgia CR and I’ve got the papers 
                        that say so.

           Rove whispers in Earl’s ear.  Earl stands up.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Peavy, Georgia.

                                 EARL
                        Mr. Chairman, I’d like to present to the 
                        committee a notarized copy of the 
                        Constitution of the Georgia CR that 
                        clearly identifies me as the current 
                        Chairman.

           The room erupts.

           Costello bangs his gavel, Kinney’s voice rises above the 
           din.

                                 KINNEY
                        That’s a load of bunkum.  Earl, you sit 
                        the hell down.

                                 ROVE
                        Point of Order!  Point of Order!

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           The room has calmed down.

           At the head of the table, Costello, Meach, and Alvin Dark 
           inspect the Georgia Constitution.   Edgeworth hovers 
           nearby, conferring with his assistant, Pennebaker.

           Chairman Jeff of Alabama confers quietly with Billy the 
           Girl.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s going on?  Is Earl really the 
                        Chairman of Georgia?

                                 BILLY THE GIRL 
                                 (whispers)
                        No, but... technically, yes.  Over the 
                        last few weeks, Karl’s people have been 
                        quietly launching coups at the local 
                        level in the Edgeworth states.  If we 
                        just get them sworn in today, Karl’ll be 
                        Chairman by the time it gets sorted out. 
           They watch as John Kinney pleads with Leon Meach.

                                 BILLY THE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Meach is the swing vote.   He’s a friend 
                        of Edgeworth, but mostly impartial.

           The committee settles down and prepares to vote.

                                 COSTELLO
                                 (calls out)
                        Committee Members in favor of certifying 
                        Earl Peavy as Georgia State Chairman, 
                        please raise their right hand.

           At the head of the table, three members raise their 
           hands: Costello, Rex, and-- reluctantly-- Meach.    

                                 EDGEWORTH
                                 (outraged)
                        Leon!

                                 MEACH
                        The documents are legit, Bob.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Those opposed?

           Alvin Dark and Dolan’s Man in Black raise their hands.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        By a 3-2 vote the committee hereby 
                        certifies Earl Peavy, Chairman of 
                        Georgia.

           Costello bangs his gavel.   John Kinney is livid.

                                 KINNEY
                        What the-- Are you--?  God almighty, 
                        Rove, you are an assface cocksucker!

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        Point of order!

                                 KINNEY
                        I move this committee certify that Karl 
                        Rove has an ass for a face!

                                 DOLAN
                        I second the motion.

                        You’re out of order, Kinney.
                                 KINNEY
                        You all are out of your goddamn mind!

                                 DOLAN
                        Those is favor of certifying that Karl 
                        Rove has an ass for a face?

                                 SCATTERED VOICES
                        Aye!

                                 ROVE
                        Point of Order!

           Costello pounds his gavel repeatedly.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Sergeant-at-arms, remove these men!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY

           Atwater knocks on a hotel room door.  He knocks again.

           Kate King opens the door a crack, remaining behind the 
           security chain.

                                 ATWATER
                        I just want to say in advance, I’ve only 
                        got time for a quickie.

           Kate slams the door.   Atwater talks to her through the 
           closed door.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Look, you’re mad.  I get that.

                                 KATE  (O.S.)
                        I’m sure you get that a lot. 

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ve come to offer my sincerest 
                        apologies.

           Kate opens the door a crack.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, really?  For what?  

                                 ATWATER
                        For all the bad shit I’ve done.
           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE
                        All of it, huh?

                                 ATWATER
                        The whole shebang.   I swear on my momma 
                        that I will never call Terry Dolan a homo 
                        again.

                                 KATE
                        It would really be overkill at this 
                        point.

           Lee smiles.

                                 ATWATER
                        Let me make it with you-- I mean, make it 
                        up to you.

           Kate rolls her eyes and shuts the door in his face again.

           Atwater almost starts to walk away, but then he hears the 
           sound of Kate unlocking the SECURITY CHAIN.

           She opens the door.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           The Credentials Committee meeting rages on.

                                 COSTELLO
                        By a 3-2 vote, Haywood Spencer is 
                        certified as Chairman of Mississippi.

           Haywood Spencer shares a celebratory handshake with Rove.

           Foster, the former Chairman of Mississippi stands up.

                                 FOSTER
                        Point of information.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Granted.

                                 FOSTER
                        That shit-lickin’ bastard hasn’t even 
                        lived in the state of Missippi for a 
                        fucking red-ass year!

                                 COSTELLO
                        You’re out of order!  
                                 FOSTER
                        No, you’re out of order!  This whole damn 
                        chicken farm is out of order.   The 
                        goddamned RNC is going to tan your hide 
                        over this, Costello

           Costello bangs his gavel. The clamor and chaos grow.  The 
           committee is pelted with crumpled up credentials papers.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Order!  Order!   

           Rove smiles and leans back in his chair.

           INT. KATE KING’S ROOM

           Kate and Lee are in bed together, smoking cigarettes.

                                 ATWATER
                        Can I ask you something personal?

                                 KATE
                        Sure.

                                 ATWATER
                        Who are you voting for?

                                 KATE
                                 (laughs)
                        Oh, shut up.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’m serious.

                                 KATE
                        Well... Edgeworth, of course.

                                 ATWATER
                        Kate, we need your vote.  I told our 
                        people to let you keep your credentials, 
                        that you would be for Karl.

                                 KATE
                        Well, I don’t like Karl.

                                 ATWATER
                        Hell, I’m not sure I like him either, but 
                        he’s my ride.  
                                 KATE
                        No offense, Lee, but I wouldn’t vote for 
                        Karl to save your life.   He doesn’t 
                        stand for anything.

                                 ATWATER
                        Oh, that’s cold...  Don’t do it for me 
                        then, do it for Terry.

                                 KATE
                        For Terry?

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, I’m gonna talk to Terry, I’ll bring 
                        him over to our side.

                                 KATE
                        How are you gonna do that?

                                 ATWATER
                        I have something for him... a peace 
                        offering.  

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           Much time has passed.   The room has thinned out and a 
           general weariness has set in.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I move that this meeting be adjourned and 
                        reconvened at a decent hour which would 
                        allow a conference call with the head of 
                        the RNC, to resolve these disputes. 

                                 HICKS
                        I second the motion.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Motion granted.   Those in favor of 
                        adjourning the meeting?

                                 VOICES (MINORITY)
                        Aye!

                                 COSTELLO
                        Those opposed?

           Rove and his allies shout loudly and forcefully.

                                 VOICES (MAJORITY)
                        Nay!
                                 COSTELLO
                        The nays have it, the meeting continues.  
                        It is 3:45 AM, the floor is open.  Do we 
                        have a motion to put before the floor?

           Costello gets hit in the face with a wad of paper.  

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        Who threw that?! 

           INT. TERRY DOLAN’S HOTEL ROOM

           Atwater sits across a desk from Dolan and The Dapper Man.  
           A few other of Dolan’s ASSOCIATES are in the room also.

                                 ATWATER
                        So.

           Dolan takes a long drag on a cigarette and says nothing.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here, Terry?

                                 DOLAN
                        What am I doing here?

                                 ATWATER
                        Yeah, what do you want from the College 
                        Republicans?

                                 DOLAN
                        Really, Lee, I could give a fuck about 
                        the College Republicans.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Is that so?

                                 DOLAN
                        It’s a social club for rich kids to pick 
                        their noses. 

           Atwater laughs.

                                 ATWATER
                        You know, I think me and you could be 
                        pretty good friends... if circumstances 
                        were to change.

                                 DOLAN
                        Is that so?
                                 ATWATER
                        Maybe.   Could I bum a smoke from you?

           Dolan nods to the Dapper Man, who gives Lee a cigarette.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Friday’s my junk day.

                                 DAPPER MAN
                        It’s Saturday.

                                 ATWATER
                        Whatever.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           We see Chairman Jeff of Alabama asleep with his head on 
           the table, a tiny puddle of drool next to his mouth.

           Rove slaps him awake.  Jeff snaps to attention.

                                 COSTELLO
                        By a 3-1 vote, the committee confirms the 
                        credentials of Jeff Messing, Chairman of 
                        Alabama.

           Rove applauds.   The room has really thinned out.  Of the 
           committee, Dolan’s Man in Black is passed out.

           INT. TERRY DOLAN’S HOTEL ROOM

           Dolan points an intense, threatening finger at Atwater. 

                                 DOLAN
                        I know exactly what you and Rove did to 
                        me, I understand how you did it, and I 
                        recognize... that it was a masterstroke.

                                 ATWATER
                                 (surprised)
                        Well... thank you.

                                 DOLAN
                        I want to do what you did on a massive 
                        scale.   Go negative, with independent 
                        groups, outside campaign apparatus.  Say 
                        whatever we want.  But it’s going to take 
                        money.   Lots of it.

           Atwater starts rattling off a list.
                                 ATWATER
                        Racial integration.   Abortion.   Flag-
                        burning.   I do NOT care about these 
                        issues-- but a lot of people do.   

                                 DOLAN
                        People are sick of it.

                                 DAPPER MAN
                        Sick of the hippies.

                                 DOLAN
                        No better feeling than smashing a bottle 
                        over a hippie’s head.

                                 ATWATER
                        There’s a storm brewing.     

                                 DOLAN
                        And it’s going to rain money.

                                 ATWATER
                        Edgeworth’s not going to do it.   He’s a 
                        boy scout.   He’s got to go.

                                 DOLAN
                        Perhaps. But Rove is an insufferable ass.

                                 ATWATER
                        They’re all a bunch of nose-pickers, 
                        what’s it to you?

                                 DOLAN
                        I can’t allow him to win.  And I’d lose 
                        credibility with my backers.  

                                 ATWATER
                        Just hear me out... Rove wins, 
                        and he goes off to Washington-- with me 
                        as his #2 of course-- but he’s... 
                                 (pause for effect)
                        ...brought down by a scandal!

                                 DOLAN
                        Scandal?

                                 ATWATER
                        I happen to have with me an audio tape 
                        recording of one Karl C. Rove.

                                 DOLAN
                        Doing what?
                                 ATWATER
                        Just imagine... Edgeworth loses 
                        tomorrow... Rove loses a month from now-- 
                        and you’ve got a friend at the head of 
                        the CRNC

                                 DOLAN
                        What do you want?

                                 ATWATER
                        I’d bet my Gibson 335 that you’ve got a 
                        stack of Edgeworth proxies somewhere in 
                        this room right now.  

           Atwater raises his brow.   Dolan and the Dapper Man look 
           at each other.

                                 ATWATER (CONT’D)
                        Ten, twenty absentee votes would swing 
                        this race, big time.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE NIGHT

                                 ROVE
                        I move to close the session.

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        I second.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Those in favor?

                                 ROVE AND BILLY THE GIRL
                        Aye.

           Costello looks around the room.  Rove and Billy the Girl 
           are the only people left.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Thank god.  It is... Jesus Christ, 5:20 
                        AM!   This session is closed. 

           INT. MARRIOTT HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

           Atwater exits Dolan’s room, holding the duffle bag.

           He takes a moment to look over his shoulder before 
           continuing down the hall.

           He does not see, however, that Edgeworth’s assistant 
           Pennebaker is watching him.
           INT. KARL ROVE’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Atwater enters.   Rove and Billy the Girl are having 
           beers, celebrating their success.

                                 ROVE
                        Lee?  Where have you been all night!?  

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ve been--

                                 ROVE
                        Doesn’t matter... it worked!  We did it.   
                        All of our people got in, we should be 
                        within... what?

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        A couple of votes, either way.

                                 ROVE
                        Unbelievable.   I feel like I could walk 
                        on water right now.   You want a beer?

           Atwater says something very quietly to Rove.   Rove 
           glances over toward Billy the Girl.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Billy, could you... excuse us for a 
                        moment?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Rove and Atwater, alone in the room, unzip the duffle 
           bag.  Inside is the stack of Edgeworth’s proxies.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god.  Edgeworth’s proxies.  You’re 
                        amazing.  How did you get these?

                                 ATWATER
                        We don’t talk about how we make sausage.

                                 ROVE
                        It’s over.  I’m not going to win by a 
                        couple votes-- I’m going to destroy him.

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ll have that beer now.

           Rove laughs as he tosses Lee a can of Pabst and heads 
           over to the telephone.
                                 ROVE
                        I’ve got to make a quick call.

           Rove dials a room number.

                                 ROVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s Karl.   
                                 (pause)
                        It went great tonight.   You were 
                        fabulous.   Fabuloso.   
                                 (pause)
                        Yeah, of course, everything we talked 
                        about.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM

           On the other end of the line, we see the supposedly 
           impartial Leon Meach.

                                 MEACH
                                 (on phone)
                        I don’t want to be appointed to that 
                        committee, I want to be the Chair.

           INT. KARL ROVE’S ROOM

           Rove, hangs up the phone, sees Atwater preparing to 
           leave.

                                 ROVE
                        Hey, where are you going?

                                 ATWATER
                        I’ve got to get these to Pine Top, he’s 
                        at the Holiday Inn down the road.   He’s 
                        gonna make copies and put your name on 
                        them instead of Edgeworth’s.

                                 ROVE
                        Wow.  This is really crossing a line from 
                        exploiting a loophole to full-on fraud.

                                 ATWATER
                        You got a problem with it?

                                 ROVE
                        Nope.  That’s why I’m bringing you to 
                        Washington with me, Fat Baby.

           Rove and Atwater clink beer cans.
                                 ATWATER
                        Fuck em all!

                                 ROVE
                        Landslide!

           Atwater closes the door.   Rove is left alone.   We hold 
           on him for a moment as he realizes this.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. MARRIOTT HOTEL - MORNING

           TITLE CARD: COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION -  
           FINAL ROLL CALL

           The morning sun shines over the Marriott Hotel.

           INT. GREAT CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           This room is much larger than the other conference room.   
           The full delegation is present, about 40-50 College 
           Republicans.

           Chairman James Costello presides at the podium.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Now, according to the rules, we shall 
                        proceed to the roll call and the roll 
                        call shall continue until we have chosen 
                        our next National Chairman.   We begin 
                        with the state of Alabama.   Chairman 
                        Jeff Messing, how do you cast your vote?

           Chairman Jeff of Alabama stands up.

                                 JEFF
                        Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the Alabama 
                        College Republicans proudly cast our vote 
                        for Mr. Karl Rove.

           Rove’s faction cheers and applauds loudly.   Rove sits 
           with a smug grin on his face.   He looks to his left, at 
           an empty chair.

           INT. MARRIOTT HALLWAY

           Lee Atwater is late for the roll call.  He hustles toward 
           the great conference room, carrying the duffle bag.
           Coming from the other direction is Kate King.  She has 
           her hand on the door, about to enter.

                                 ATWATER
                        You do the right thing in there now, 
                        Kate.

           Kate rolls her eyes at Atwater and heads into the room.

           INT. GREAT CONFERENCE ROOM

           The roll call continues.  Costello speaks from the 
           podium.   Atwater sits down in the seat next to Rove.  

                                 ROVE
                        You don’t want to miss this.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Chairman Abate of Arizona is not in 
                        attendance and will be voting by proxy.  
                        Who presents the proxy?  Mr. Edgeworth?

           Bob Edgeworth stands up.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Mr. Chairman, it seems the proxy from the 
                        Chairman of Arizona has... disappeared.

           The crowd murmurs at the surprising news.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Disappeared?

           Edgeworth looks to his left, at Dolan.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Yes, we had it last night, but now, it’s 
                        gone.   They’re all gone.

           The murmur erupts into a rumbling chaos.  Random shouts 
           of accusations and blame punctuate the din. 

           Costello bangs his gavel.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Gentleman!  Gentleman!

           At that moment, Pennebaker walks over to Rove.

                                 PENNEBAKER
                        Bob would like a private meeting with 
                        you.
                                 ROVE
                        Now?

           INT. MEETING ROOM

           Edgeworth enters the room.  Rove is sitting at the table. 

                                 ROVE
                        Would you like to discuss the terms of 
                        your surrender?

           Edgeworth sighs.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I just don’t understand you, Karl.  
                        You’re a brilliant kid.  We co--

                                 ROVE
                        I’m not a kid anymore, Bob.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                                 (snaps)
                        Yes you are a fucking kid.  You are an 
                        over-sensitive insecure little boy.  A 
                        man wouldn’t need to say that.

           Rove is taken aback.   He has never seen the usually calm 
           Edgeworth so angry.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        We could’ve worked together in 
                        Washington.   We could’ve been a force.   
                        I might have even worked as your #2 after 
                        the first year.  Did that ever rattle 
                        around in your arrogant little head?  

                                 ROVE
                        Bob, shut the fuck up.  I’m sick of--

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        No, you shut the fuck up and listen.   
                        You’re a cheat.  I know you stole the 
                        proxies, and you’ve forged copies.

                                 ROVE
                        I have no idea what you’re referring to.  

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        The sad part is you probably had the 
                        votes to win after Credentials.  So why 
                        cheat?  
                                 ROVE
                                 (suddenly livid)
                        You’re a liar!  You have no proof!   

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        You know, you’re right.  I don’t have 
                        proof.   

                                 ROVE
                        You don’t?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I’m not going to play that game.  I don’t 
                        need to.

           Rove is confused.

                                 EDGEWORTH (CONT’D)
                        This is your last chance.  Resign and 
                        join my ticket.   Come work with me in 
                        Washington.  We can do great things, do 
                        it the right way.

           Rove laughs.

                                 ROVE
                        What?  You think you’re just going to 
                        march down from your mountaintop with 
                        your moralizing and I’m going to feel all  
                        shamed and....  
                                 (fake crying)
                        I’m so sorry, I’ve been baaad...

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        No, I just wanted to give you a chance.

           Rove stands up.   He is more determined than ever.

                                 ROVE
                        Well, I’ve been down that road, Bob.  I’m 
                        not a sucker, and I’m not a quitter. 

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        What are you?

                                 ROVE
                        I was put on this earth to lead this 
                        party.  It’s fourth and goal and I’m 
                        putting this fucking ball in the end 
                        zone.  Good. Night.

           Rove starts to leave.
                                 EDGEWORTH
                        It’s not a fucking game, Karl.  You can’t 
                        be a leader by tricking people into 
                        voting for you.   People have to believe 
                        in you and you have the believe in them.  
                        But they’re just a bunch of marks to you.   
                        That’s not a leader, that’s a con man.  

           Rove has his hand on the open door.

                                 ROVE
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Wow.  Another lecture by Bob Edgeworth, 
                        the voice of God.   Are you finished?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        No.   But you are.   Costello’s agreed to 
                        preside over a second roll call, with the 
                        real delegates.    

                                 ROVE
                        What?  You’re bluffing.  Costello would 
                        never do a second vote.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        At the end of the day, we’re both going 
                        to be elected chairman, and it will be up 
                        to the Party elders to decide who is 
                        legitimate.

                                 ROVE
                        Horse shit.

           Rove is starting to doubt himself.

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        And Dolan’s going to destroy you in the 
                        press.   He has a tape recording of you 
                        in San Diego discussing dirty campaign 
                        tactics.  I don’t think the Party is 
                        going to want to touch you with a ten-
                        foot pole after that.   

           Rove stands stunned, frozen, holding the open door.

                                 ROVE
                        A... tape recording?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I’ve tried hard to talk him out of it, 
                        actually.  
                                 ROVE
                        You have?

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Well... to be honest, not that hard.

           Edgeworth walks past him through the open door.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. GREAT CONFERENCE ROOM

           Looking a little shell-shocked, Rove sits down in his 
           chair.   Atwater notices something is up.

                                 ATWATER
                        What’s going on?  What did he say?

           Rove, deep in thought, says nothing.   

           On the other side of the room, the Delaware Chairman 
           stands as the roll call continues.

                                 HICKS
                        The state of Delaware casts its vote for 
                        Robert Edgeworth.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Thank you, Chairman Hicks.   The roll 
                        stands at 3 votes for Mr. Edgeworth,  4 
                        votes for Mr. Rove.

                                 ROVE
                                 (to Atwater)
                        Give him back the proxies.

                                 ATWATER
                        What?  Are you out of your mind?   Why?

                                 ROVE
                                 (frazzled)
                        I don’t like it...  It, it feels like a 
                        setup.

                                 ATWATER
                        This is it.  We’ll lose without them. 

                                 ROVE
                        No, it’ll be close, but we can still win.

                                 ATWATER
                        Can?
                                 ROVE
                        Billy, take them over.

                                 BILLY THE GIRL
                        Yes, sir.

                                 ATWATER
                        Billy, you’ll do no such thing.

           Atwater grabs the duffle bag away from Billy.   A brief 
           tug-of-war ensues.

                                 ROVE
                        Lee!

           Atwater relents and Billy takes the bag.

                                 ATWATER
                        Fuck.

           INT. GREAT CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edgeworth, seated on his side of the room, opens the bag 
           and sees the proxies inside.

           He looks up to see Billy the Girl walking away.

           Edgeworth looks over to Rove.   Rove raises his eyebrows 
           at Edgeworth smugly, as if to say “See how moral I am.”  

           At the front of the great hall, the vote continues.   
           Alvin Dark sits next to the FLORIDA CHAIRMAN.

                                 FLORIDA CHAIRMAN
                        The Florida College Republicans proudly 
                        support Bob Edgeworth for Chairman.

           Edgeworth’s faction applauds.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. GREAT CONFERENCE ROOM - MUCH LATER

           The roll call is winding down.   The atmosphere is tense.

           Pennebaker hands Costello a sheet of paper at the podium.  
           Costello and Meach pour over it.

                                 COSTELLO
                        The Chairman of Wisconsin votes via proxy 
                        for Mr. Edgeworth.
           Atwater glares at Rove.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        It stands dead even.  36 votes for 
                        Edgeworth, 36 votes for Mr. Rove.  

           The crowd receives the result breathlessly.   

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        The Regional Chairmen have been counted, 
                        the report from the proxies has been 
                        confirmed-- we have one last state to 
                        hear from, and then the roll call shall 
                        be concluded. 

           Rove and Atwater look at each other, very much on edge.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        College Republicans, we shall soon have a 
                        new Chairman.  I now call the great state 
                        of Wyoming.  Chairwoman Kate King, how do 
                        you vote?

           Kate stands up.   Atwater gazes intently at her.   She 
           does not look at him.   

                                 KATE
                        On behalf of the Wyoming College 
                        Republicans, I cast my vote for... 
                        Karl Rove. 

           The room erupts with cheers and applause from Rove’s 
           faction.

           Rove pumps his fist.  Supporters and well-wishers crowd 
           to give him a pat on the back. 

           Atwater is visibly relieved.   He blows a kiss to Kate 
           King, who gives him a sly smile in return.

           Costello bangs his gavel.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Order!  Please, settle it down.   I have 
                        an announcement to make.

           The crowd quiets.

                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        It’s been brought to my attention that 
                        the rules state... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSTELLO (CONT’D)
                        if a losing candidate wishes to protest 
                        the ruling of the credentials committee, 
                        he may request a second, provisional roll 
                        call from the disputed delegates, to 
                        allow party authorities time to verify 
                        their credentials. 

                                 ATWATER
                                 (to Rove)
                        What the fuck is he talking about?

                                 ROVE
                        I can’t believe this is for real.  
                        They’re having a second vote-- the 
                        endgame is going to play out at the RNC.

                                 COSTELLO
                                 (to all)
                        It is a highly unprecedented maneuver.  
                        Mr. Edgeworth, do you wish to initiate 
                        such a protest?

           Bob Edgeworth stands up.   

                                 EDGEWORTH
                        I do, Mr. Chairman.

                                 COSTELLO
                                 (sighs)
                        Okay, I guess we’re going to do this 
                        again.   The Chair calls on... 
                        Provisional Chairman Kinney of Georgia. 

                                 ATWATER
                                 (to Rove)
                        Christ Jesus, by the time this is done, 
                        I’m going to wish I never knew you.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. RNC MEETING ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

           We jump back into the middle of Rove’s interview with the 
           FBI AGENT regarding the tape recording.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        How did you first come to know Lee 
                        Atwater?

                                 ROVE
                        I’m not sure I understand what you mean 
                        by that...
                                 FBI AGENT
                        Alright.  Let’s just move on.  Describe 
                        your recollection of your remarks to the 
                        San Diego seminar...

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. RNC HALLWAY - DAY

           Rove and the FBI Agent exchange a cursory handshake and 
           part ways.

           Atwater approaches Rove shortly afterward.

                                 ATWATER
                        How did it go?

                                 ROVE
                        Fine.   I never blinked.   They’ve got 
                        nothing.

                                 ATWATER
                        Well, it’s the court of public opinion 
                        that matters.

                                 ROVE
                        No, it’s one man’s opinion that matters.

           INT. RNC CHAIRMAN’S WAITING ROOM

           We see a close up shot of a large, imposing door.   The 
           door reads:  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN

           Rove and Atwater are seated in chairs outside the door.   

           They seem very small, as if in kindergarten chairs.

           Costello walks out of the office.

                                 COSTELLO
                        Okay, go on in, Karl, the boss wants to 
                        see you now.

           Rove takes a last look at Atwater.   Lee nods.   Rove 
           puffs himself up and follows Costello into the Chairman’s 
           office.
           INT. RNC CHAIRMAN’S OFFICE

           Rove sees that Robert Edgeworth is there, seated in a 
           leather chair across from the Chairman’s desk. 

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN (O.S.)
                        Have a seat, son.

                                 ROVE
                        Yes, sir.

           Rove sits in the empty chair next to Edgeworth and looks 
           at the nameplate on the Chairman’s desk.

           It reads: GEORGE H. W. BUSH, CHAIRMAN.

           Rove looks up at man behind the desk, who will later 
           become the 41st President of the United States.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                        So, Karl, I have to tell you... I’ve been 
                        hearing some pretty nasty things about 
                        you and what you’ve been up to.  Is there 
                        any truth to it?

                                 ROVE
                        None whatsoever, sir.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                                 (skeptical)
                        I’ve heard the tape.

                                 ROVE
                        I can assure you, the tape has... 
                        probably been doctored.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                        Hmm.

           Bush sits back in his chair, eying the two young men.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Whether that’s the case or not... I’ve 
                        reached my decision.

           Rove and Edgeworth brace themselves.  

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Bob... the legitimate College Republican 
                        National Chairman... is Karl Rove.  My 
                        ruling is final.  
                                 EDGEWORTH
                        Sir, on what grounds do you base this 
                        decision?

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                        I don’t have to answer to you, you little 
                        weasel.  You leaked sensitive information 
                        to the Washington Post.  If I ever see 
                        your face again, you will regret it.  
                        Now, get the hell out of my office, and 
                        get the hell out of my party!    

           Edgeworth gets up to leave, stunned.  Rove struggles to 
           restrain a smile. 

           INT. RNC CHAIRMAN’S WAITING ROOM

           Rove walks out Bush’s office door.  Atwater is there 
           waiting, having overheard the whole thing.

           They are both ecstatic, but decorum prevents them making 
           any noise outside the Chairman’s door.

           Rove lifts his fists into the air, quivering.  Atwater 
           dances a funny, silent dance of celebration.

           The two men embrace, victorious.

           Quickly, they back away from each other and reinforce 
           their heterosexual manhood with a calm handshake.

                                                               FADE OUT.

           TITLE CARD: THREE MONTHS LATER

           INT. RNC BUILDING - WASHINGTON, D.C.

           Across the hallway from Chairman Bush’s office, an open 
           office door reads: COLLEGE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, 
           KARL ROVE, CHAIRMAN.

           Inside the office Rove and Atwater watch a small 
           television set.

           On the television is Richard Nixon, giving an infamous 
           press conference.
                                 NIXON
                                 (on television)
                        ..because people have got to know whether 
                        or not their President is a crook.  Well, 
                        I am not a crook.  

           Rove turns off the television.

                                 ROVE
                        Ugh.

                                 ATWATER
                        He’s cooked.

           An attractive woman in business attire, ANNABELLE, pokes 
           her head in the office.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Hello, boys.

                                 ATWATER
                        You’re looking lovely today, Annabelle.   
                        When are you going to let me take you 
                        out?

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Why, thank you, Lee.  Not anytime soon.
                        The boss wants to see you in his office.

                                 ROVE
                        I’ll be right over.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        No, not you.  Lee.

           Rove is irritated, but unsurprised.

                                 ATWATER
                        Sure thing, baby doll.

           Annabelle leaves.  Rove pleads with Lee.

                                 ROVE
                        Can you please ask him to look at the 
                        demographics reports I’ve prepared?

                                 ATWATER
                        Well... I’ll try, but that’s not the kind 
                        of stuff we usually talk about.

                                 ROVE
                        What do you talk about?
                                 ATWATER
                        You know, life lessons.

           Rove rolls his eyes.   Atwater heads out of the room.

           Rove peeks down the hallway after him.

           George Bush is out in the hall as well, walking into his 
           office.   Rove watches as he greets Atwater warmly.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                        How are you getting on, Lee?  Are you 
                        enjoying the use of my boat?

                                 ATWATER
                        Yes, sir.   My girl Sally, she can’t get 
                        enough of it... of the boat.

           Bush laughs a paternal laugh.   Rove approaches them.

                                 ROVE
                        Excuse me, sir?

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                                 (sharp)
                        Yes?

           Rove is startled by the sharpness and decides to avoid 
           the topic he intended to bring up.

                                 ROVE
                        Um, is there.. anything I can do for you?

           Bush looks at him oddly.  Then he remembers something.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH
                                 (digging in his pocket)
                        Yeah.

           He tosses a set of CAR KEYS to Rove, who catches them 
           awkwardly.

                                 RNC CHAIRMAN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Run these down to lobby for me.   Talk to 
                        Annabelle first.   Thanks.

           Atwater and Bush head into the Chairman’s office 
           together, leaving Rove holding the keys.

           INT. RNC BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

           Rove sits on a bench waiting, stewing.
           Impatient, he gets up and heads outside.

           EXT. RNC BUILDING - DAY 

           It is a bright, crisp autumn day in Washington, D.C.

           Rove looks up and down the street.

           Out of the distance, he sees a MYSTERIOUS FIGURE STRIDING 
           TOWARD HIM almost in slow-motion, backlit by the sun.

           The figure gets closer, details emerge.   It is a young 
           man, 26, wearing blue jeans, cowboy boots, and a leather 
           bomber jacket from the Texas Air National Guard. 

           It is the young GEORGE W. BUSH.

           Young George W. heads toward the door of the building, 
           not noticing Rove.

                                 ROVE
                        Hey!

           George W. looks over to him.

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Yeah?

                                 ROVE
                        Um, you’re here to see me.

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        I am?

                                 ROVE
                        Yeah, you’re George Jr. right?... I 
                        didn’t-- the jacket... I didn’t know you 
                        were a pilot... That’s cool...

           George W. looks at Rove strangely as he rambles on.

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Who are you?

                                 ROVE
                        Oh! I-- I’m Karl Rove, I work for your 
                        dad, I have the keys for you!

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Oh, okay.   He’s not gonna see me 
                        himself, then.  Okay.
                                 ROVE
                        Hey, you’re at Harvard Business now, 
                        right?

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Yup.

                                 ROVE
                        If you ever need any help with anything, 
                        I know a lot about finance, marketing, 
                        leadership, strategy--

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Woah.  Slow down there, Tex.  What are 
                        you, some kinda boy genius or something?  
                        Heh, heh.

                                 ROVE
                        No, I--

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        You got those keys?

                                 ROVE
                        Of course.

           Rove hands George W. the keys, his hand lingering for a 
           second too long.

                                 GEORGE W. BUSH
                        Thanks a bunch.  I’ll see you around, 
                        genius.

           George W. turns and leaves.   Rove takes special notice 
           of the back pocket of his jeans, the worn circle mark of 
           a tin of chewing tobacco.

           Rove watches George W. in awe as he walks away down the 
           street, back toward the sun.

                                 ROVE
                                 (to himself)
                        Wow.

           THE END.

           END CREDITS CHARACTER NOTES:
           KARL ROVE went on to become one of the most successful 
           and controversial political consultants of all time.   He 
           is widely viewed as the mastermind of George W. Bush’s 
           political career from its earliest days.  In the Bush 
           White House he enjoyed power, access, and a role in 
           policy creation that was unheard of for a political 
           strategist.  

           Accusations of dirty tactics and abuse of power continued 
           to follow Rove throughout his career.  He is currently a 
           paid commentator for FOX News.

           LEE ATWATER rose quickly through the ranks of Republican 
           politics, becoming an influential operative in the Reagan 
           White House by age 30.  As presidential campaign manager 
           for George H. W. Bush in 1988, his aggressive and 
           racially-charged tactics brought Bush from 17 points 
           behind in the polls to a landslide victory in three 
           months.  He’s been called the “best campaign manager who 
           ever lived.” 

           Atwater died tragically of a brain tumor in 1991, at age 
           40.  On his deathbed, he renounced his ways and wrote 
           letters of apology to all those he felt he had wronged, 
           including Michael Dukakis and convicted murderer Willie 
           Horton.

           TERRY DOLAN co-founded the National Conservative 
           Political Action Committee (NCPAC) in 1975.  NCPAC was 
           one of the first big money independent groups that 
           circumvented campaign finance restrictions to launch 
           unaccountable attack ads.  In the words of Dolan, “the 
           shriller you are the easier it is to raise funds.” NCPAC 
           was a major contributor to the ascendency of conservative 
           Republicans in the 1980s.    

           Dolan died of AIDS in 1986.

           DR. ROBERT EDGEWORTH became a beloved educator and 
           scholar, an esteemed professor and Chairman of Classical 
           Languages at Louisiana State University.  His 
           encyclopedic intellect and love of popular trivia led to 
           successful appearances on games shows such as Jeopardy.  
           He was never active in national politics again.   

           Dr. Edgeworth passed away in 2004 after a long battle 
           with cancer.
