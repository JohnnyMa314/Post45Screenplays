           EXT. SIERRA NEVADA FOOTHILLS - DUSK

           A small trail cuts through a dense pine forest with a six 
           foot base of snow.  

           SUPER:  1888, Sierra Nevada Foothills

           We HEAR a horse breathing.  Faintly.  Then louder.  And 
           LOUDER.

           STOMP.  A LARGE HORSE HOOF.  A worn black boot and spur - 
           the rider’s - jangles.  We catch a glimpse of a weapon - 
           A PISTOL, WITH AN IVORY HANDLE.

           The lone horse and rider pass through -- and eventually 
           disappear around the bend.  We are left in the silence of 
           the empty trail.

           EXT. SMALL MINING TOWN - NIGHT

           The only sign of life in a small mining town is the smoke 
           and light from a TAVERN.  

           INT. TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

           Inside are a ROUGH GROUP OF MEN, blowing off steam 
           drinking rye, playing cards, and flirting with whores.

           A DRUNK spills a whisky at the end of the bar.  A 
           BARTENDER sighs and turns to his employee --

                                 BARTENDER
                        LIONEL!

           LIONEL perks up - a curly haired innocent - aged 18 
           years.  He pushes a rag over the spill.  As he scrubs, a 
           FIGURE sets in front of him, dropping snow on the floor.

           The FIGURE wears the worn black boots.  The FIGURE 
           carries the ivory handled pistol.  

           Lionel gazes up at the FIGURE.  The bartender steps in 
           front of him.  Protective.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Can I help you?

           Miners pause their games and stop their flirting. 

           The bartender produces a bottle and pours a slug.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Alls we got is rye anyhow.

           The FIGURE drinks it down.  A messy beard - from weeks of 
           uncare is all we see of his face.

           The bartender nods to the hardest group of men in the bar 
           as he refills the glass.  They rise on cue and put their 
           guns on the FIGURE.  At his back.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Rumor says there’s a man.  A man from the 
                        plains goin’ ‘round killing his own kin.  
                        Rumor says he come back here to wipe his 
                        seed from this earth.  You heard this 
                        rumor, fella?

                                 FIGURE 
                        No.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Rumor says the man carries an ivory 
                        handled pistol.  Like the one we all saw 
                        on you.

           The bartender pulls a shotgun out from under the bar.  
           Lionel stands by, terrified.  The FIGURE downs another.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Now.  Get the hell outta here.

           The FIGURE tosses a coin on the bar and exits.

           INT. TAVERN - LATER

           A SCRUFFY MAN enters, wiping snow from his head.  A small 
           armed posse remain in the bar.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        He’s gone.  We seen him gone ‘round the 
                        bend at river start.

                                 BARTENDER
                                 (to Lionel)
                        You needn’t worry, son.  We look after 
                        folks here.

           EXT. SMALL CABIN - NIGHT

           A light snow falls.  Lionel trudges to his small cabin.  
           He feels a presence behind him and stops.  
                                 LIONEL
                        It’s true, ain’t it?

           He turns to face LEMAY -- the FIGURE from the bar.  He is 
           more imposing than we previously imagined.  50 years old.  
           Six and a half feet tall.  A bear skin coat covering his 
           formidable frame.  Wisps of gray hair over his ears and 
           under his hat.  Eyes of pale blue.

                                 LEMAY
                        It’s true.

                                 LIONEL
                        I ain’t done nothing wrong.

                                 LEMAY
                        What’s done doesn’t factor.

                                 LIONEL
                        What is it, then?  Just who I is?

           LeMay slowly pulls his pistol.

                                 LEMAY
                        You ever been with a woman?  Ever make 
                        love to one?

                                 LIONEL
                        I ain’t telling.

           LeMay moves forward and speaks as he does.

                                 LEMAY
                        We’ll make an exchange.  I’ll tell you 
                        what you want to know.

                                 LIONEL
                        What I want to know....  What good is 
                        knowing now?

                                 LEMAY
                        Everything.  What I know is everything.

                                 LIONEL
                        What d’ya know?

                                 LEMAY
                        Your name.

                                 LIONEL
                        My name?  You want to tell me my name.  
                                 (convinced)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIONEL (CONT'D)
                        You don’t know my name.  We ain’t no sort 
                        of kin.

                                 LEMAY
                        Have you done it?  Have you been with a 
                        woman?

                                 LIONEL
                        Even if I say, you c’aint know if it’s 
                        true.

           The blue eyes bore into Lionel.  The gun gripped in his 
           hand.

                                 LIONEL
                                 (conceding)
                        I c’aint afford it.

                                 LEMAY
                        Your name is LeMay.

           He quickly fires one shot right through Lionel’s 
           forehead.  Lionel collapses into the snow.

           LeMay goes to him, kneels, and whispers into dead 
           Lionel’s ear while he closes his eyes.

                                 LEMAY
                        LeMay.  You hear it?

           Lionel LeMay lays splayed out in the snow.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

           LeMay hands the Scruffy Man a sack of coins.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        Gonna be a storm tonight.

                                 LEMAY
                        Most likely.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        Still looking for kin?

                                 LEMAY
                        One more.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        Maybe I know something you might wantta 
                        hear...about another.

                                 LEMAY
                        Speak it.
           The Scruffy Man pauses purposefully.  LeMay produces more 
           coins.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        Heard word in that town ‘bout a young man 
                        came through - ‘bout a month back - 
                        claiming to be Lionel’s twin brother.

                                 LEMAY
                                 (pondering)
                        A rumor.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        Yeah.  A rumor. 

           LeMay hops on his horse.

                                 LEMAY
                        Looks like a storm coming.

           His worn black boot jangles out of frame...

           BEGIN CREDITS

           A BRUTAL SNOWSTORM covers the rocks above the treeline 
           and forest below.

           EXT. SNOWSTORM - NIGHT

           LeMay rides through it.  He sees a CAVE ahead.

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           LeMay unpacks his gear.  He gathers wood.  Lights a fire.

           EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

           LeMay stands outside as smoke pours out of the cave and a 
           strange orange light glows within.

           INT. CAVE - LATER

           LeMay hangs his boots and bear skin coat to dry.

           He sits by the coals to keep warm.  He tears a piece of 
           jerky with his mouth and chews.

           LATER

           LeMay inserts an after dinner chaw and lets the tobacco 
           juice seep into his gums.   
           He takes out his ivory handled pistol and scrubs it 
           clean, making sure the powder is dry and functional.

           LATER

           He sets out a sleeping area.

           He lies on the ground, his pale blue eyes WIDE OPEN as 
           the snow falls and we fade to white.  

           END CREDITS

           EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - DAY

           A clear day after the storm.  Three feet of fresh snow.

           CAL (18) looks almost exactly like LIONEL by any physical 
           description - but let’s be clear - they are as different 
           as night and day.  Whereas Lionel was an innocent, Cal is 
           guilty and suspicious and duplicitous and downright scary 
           looking.  He’s got a baby face, but the kind that makes 
           you uneasy.

           PATTY and LOGAN - mid 20s - are his two followers.  They 
           all clean their guns and prep for some violent scheme.

                                 PATTY
                        I seen one these guns before.  Woo wee.  
                        I seen a test outside Sacramento.  They 
                        fire off 200 rounds a minute.  Invented 
                        by a man named Gatling.  Called a Gatling 
                        Gun. 

                                 LOGAN
                        No shit - everyone knows what they 
                        called.  Damn Patty, you think you’re the 
                        only educated one of the group.

                                 PATTY
                        Can you write, Logan?  Can you? ‘Cause I 
                        can write.  What’s the last thing you 
                        wrote?

                                 LOGAN
                        What kind of fool needs to write?  If 
                        something can’t be said, what the hell 
                        use is it to me?

                                 CAL
                        A man that can write is a valuable man...

           Both followers silently listen when Cal decides to speak.
                                 CAL
                        ...he fills the gaps of understandin’ for 
                        those who wasn’t there...  

           He places a big shell into his gun.

                                 CAL
                        ...he controls what we pay attention 
                        to...what we remember...  
                                 (beat - Cal has a small 
                                 epiphany)
                        ...it could even be said, the men who 
                        write control our Fate.

           Cal finishes loading up his big ‘ole .557 Elephant Gun.

                                 PATTY
                        See?

           EXT. WAGON TRAIL THROUGH THE WOODS - DAY

           Snow rests on the side of the trail.  Four US ARMY 
           SOLDIERS on horseback accompany the movement of a wagon 
           carrying a big trailer in back.  

           The leader is named WILSON (43).  From atop his horse, he 
           can barely see the trees through heavy fog.  All we hear 
           is the natural movement of the caravan.

           BOOM.  A shot rings out and explodes the head of one of 
           the soldiers.  They all come to a stop and pull their 
           guns.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Shit -- I thought you said there weren’t 
                        no Indians round these parts?

                                 WILSON
                        They’re ain’t.  Washoe go South in 
                        winter.

           Another shot rings out and Soldier 1’s chest explodes - a 
           mess of intestines spill out.  He falls forward and his 
           horse runs away with his dead body still on it.

           The two remaining soldiers and wagon drivers gaze around 
           the woods.  Nothing but fog and snow and trees cover the 
           hillside. 

           Wilson hops off his horse and takes cover behind it.  A 
           third shot rings out, partially hitting him in the leg.
                                 WILSON
                        Dammit!  Who the hell is out there?  

           He fires randomly into the trees.

                                 CAL (O.S.)
                        Drop your weapons or we’ll kill you all.

                                 WILSON
                                 (sotto)
                        I know that voice.

                                 LAST SOLDIER
                        They can’t know how to work the weapon, 
                        sir.  We’ll get reinforcements and find 
                        it.

                                 WILSON
                                 (pondering)
                        All right.  DROP YOUR WEAPONS!

           The wagoners and the two soldiers drop their weapons, 
           raise their hands, and get off their horses.

           EXT. TREES ABOVE THE TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Down from the trees and through the fog come three black-
           clad, faces covered bandits - Cal, Patty, and Logan.  Cal 
           carries his huge Elephant Gun.

           WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Patty and Logan go the back of the wagon and unveil: 

           A Big Gatling Gun and boxes of ammunition.

                                 LOGAN
                        Got it, boss.

           Cal takes down his mask.

                                 WILSON
                        Dammit - I knew I knew your voice.  
                        Sonofabitch.  Coward.

           Cal unloads a huge gunshot from his Elephant Gun into the 
           chest of the remaining soldier at point blank range.  
           Wilson scrambles for a hidden gun in his boot.  Cal pulls 
           his .45 and shoots Wilson’s shoulder.  Wilson bounces 
           around on his one leg, his right shoulder dangling loose, 
           barely attached to his body.
                                 WILSON
                        You sonofabitch!  I knews you were a 
                        sonofabitch the moment I laid eyes on 
                        you.  You weren’t fit for duty - you 
                        dirty - son of a whore mother.

           Cal curiously watches Wilson dance around in the snow, 
           one legged and arm dangling.  Bleeding.  

                                 WILSON
                        I curse the day I ever taught you...

           He unloads five shots into Wilson.  He calmly reloads his 
           six shooter and goes over to the two wagoners - standing 
           in stunned silence.  He pops one bullet in each of their 
           brains.  They are so shocked, they don’t bother to put up 
           a fight or move.

                                 CAL
                        Let’s go.

           Logan and Patty hop onto the wagon and drive away with 
           their Gatling Gun.

           EXT. GOLD MINE CAMP - DAY

           Dirt-covered men carrying old picks and tools return from 
           a miserable day of pulling color from the hills.  It is a 
           poor operation.  Makeshift tents.  Small fires.  A fight 
           breaks out in the background over something petty.  
           Knives are pulled.  LeMay walks past - disinterested - 
           toward -- 

           INT. WHORE’S TENT - DAY

           An ugly, dying, old whore holds a baby.  LeMay enters.

                                 LEMAY
                        There a whore go by the name Claire 
                        living here?

           The old whore looks at him stone faced.  LeMay hands her 
           a coin.

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                                 (resentful)
                        She been gone for years now.

                                 LEMAY
                        Where?
                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Got herself a husband.  Dumb mule.

                                 LEMAY
                        And her child?

           The old whore notices the ivory handled gun.

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Where d’you get that gun?

           LeMay takes out coins.

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        I don’t need no money.  Tell me about the 
                        gun.  I heard about a man with that gun.

           LeMay takes out the gun and holds it carefully in his 
           hand.  It is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship.  A long 
           barrel perfectly made.  The handle - solid white ivory - 
           doesn’t get worn - looks as good as new.

                                 LEMAY
                        Made originally for a British Captain 
                        stationed in Africa.  Handle is made from 
                        an elephant tusk.  

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Can I touch it?

           LeMay looks at the old woman and senses no threat.  He 
           hands her the loaded gun.  She takes the ivory handle.

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Heavy.

                                 LEMAY
                        Now...where is she?

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Lives on a farm down near Truckee.

                                 LEMAY
                        Tell me the name of the farm.

                                 UGLY OLD WHORE
                        Coleman.

           He takes the gun back from her.  He makes to leave and 
           stops at the door of the tent.

                                 LEMAY
                        This was my daddy’s gun.
           He exits.  The old whore pats the head of the baby.

           EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - DAY

           A large contingent of US Army soldiers encircle the scene 
           of destruction wrought by Cal’s gang.  SOLOMON (35) a 
           confident half-breed Indian, raised as a white, dons a 
           crisp lieutenant’s uniform and examines Wilson’s frozen 
           corpse.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE (O.S.)
                        Sir, they found the last one about a mile 
                        from here.  Still in his saddle.

           Solomon checks Wilson’s right lower boot and sees a 
           little .22 still in place.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        The Washoe done this?

           SOLDIER ERNIE is Solomon’s number two in self-imposed 
           exile from the East whence he came.  He rubs his thin 
           moustache. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Washoe go south in the winter.

           Solomon points up to where Cal and his gang came from.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m seeing three sets of tracks and this.

           Gestures to the frozen headless corpse.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Some sort of game gun.  Not a rifle.  
                        Read about holes like these in elephants 
                        and lions.

           They walk over to another body.

                                 SOLOMON
                        He did this one at point blank with the 
                        big gun.  Wilson went for his boot gun.  
                        He pulled a .45, shot his shoulder.  Then 
                        he shoots the remaining five shots into 
                        Wilson...

           Solomon goes over and picks up shells.
                                 SOLOMON
                        Reloads.  Walks straight up to these two.  
                        Boom.  Boom.
                                 (kneels)
                        Three men.  But one does all the killing.  
                                 (standing)
                        Perfect spot for ambush.  Likely 
                        overcast.  Wilson couldn’t see a thing.  
                        Those shells - just shooting into the 
                        woods, blind.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Not amateurs, then.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Not amateurs.  A man done this much 
                        damage -- no telling what he’ll do with 
                        our Gatling Gun.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Criminal isn’t trained.  Won’t be able to 
                        work it.

           EXT. SHORE OF RED LAKE - DAY

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           Cal cranks the Gatling Gun test firing it on the beach 
           shore, the only spot where snow doesn’t cover the ground.  
           Sand kicks up 100 yards down the beach. 

           Patty waves his hat in the air.

                                 PATTY
                        Hot damn.  That thing is on fire.

           Cal turns the gun into the lake and starts ripping off 
           shots over the ice-covered lake, the bullets creating 
           heat tracers across the ice.  He aims down and shoots the 
           ice, which cracks and breaks.  He lets the magazine run 
           out of bullets and keeps cranking the empty chamber.

                                 LOGAN
                        Lemme get a try on that.

                                 CAL
                        Can’t waste the ammunition.

           Patty and Logan are disappointed.
                                 CAL
                        But come on over here, I’ll shows you how 
                        it works.

           The ice CRACKS loudly.  The men stop and listen as the 
           entire surface of the lake CRAAAACKS.

           EXT. TRUCKEE - DAY

           On a tundra plain WIND WHISTLES and LeMay rides atop his 
           horse at a slow trot.  The snow filled foothills in the 
           background.  In the distance is a large fenced-in farm.

           EXT. COLEMAN HOUSE - DAY

           LeMay ties his horse.  He sees a little girl, 5 years 
           old, chasing a dog outside.  She giggles happily.  

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Her name’s Megan.

           Coleman comes off his porch.  He wears glasses and is 
           losing his hair and is filled with good cheer.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Name’s Coleman.

           He offers LeMay his hand.  LeMay takes it.

           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Coleman pours a rich cup of coffee for LeMay.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Claire will be back from church in just a 
                        bit.

           Coleman stirs his coffee, peaceful and unaware.

                                 LEMAY
                        How long you lived here?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Oh...getting on four years now.  Claire 
                        loves it.  Megan - Megan gets a bit 
                        lonely.

           Megan enters the house.  She walks straight up to LeMay.
                                 MEGAN
                        Hi.  I’m Megan. 

           Smiling - she is really cute.

                                 MEGAN
                        What’s your name?

                                 COLEMAN
                        He’s a friend of mama.  

           Megan stares at LeMay. 

                                 LEMAY
                        How old are you?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m five.

           Coleman sees something outside.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’ll be damned.

           SOLDIER ERNIE rides up on his horse.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Two visitors in one day!

           Coleman exits to greet Soldier Ernie.  LeMay and Megan 
           are in the room alone together.

                                 MEGAN
                        You like animals, mister?

                                 LEMAY
                        Some of ‘em.

                                 MEGAN
                        Where you from?  How you know mama?

                                 LEMAY
                                 (picking a chaw from his 
                                 sack)
                        I known her before you were born. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Are you a miner?

                                 LEMAY
                                 (inserting the chaw into his 
                                 gums)
                        No. 
           He sucks in and spits.

                                 MEGAN
                        I like you.  Do you like me?

           LeMay is confounded by the question.  Coleman and Soldier 
           Ernie enter the house.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                                 (wary of LeMay)
                        Howdy.

           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - LATER

           A nice little food spread is laid out for the visitors -- 
           potatoes, tomatoes, some cured meat, and bread.

           Soldier Ernie is stuffing his face, accustomed to the 
           hospitality of others.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Sir - you spend time in these parts 
                        awhile?

                                 LEMAY
                        A few weeks.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        But you know your way.

                                 LEMAY
                        I lived here in years past.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Ever come across a rough seeming gang?  
                        Three men or so?

                                 LEMAY
                        No.

                                 COLEMAN
                        What happened?

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE 
                        It’s a bit embarrassing, but we were 
                        receiving a Gatling Gun from Fort Sherman 
                        and a hooligan gang of criminals 
                        massacred our men and stole the gun.  
                        This would not happen in New York.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Sounds an awful shame.
                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        We were unprepared.  That can be stated 
                        without fear of error - it being quiet 
                        around these parts for so long.  And as 
                        you all know - the Washoe go South in the 
                        winter.

                                 COLEMAN
                        You know anything about the gang?

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Not much, except they killed six men.  
                        Executed some of them.  Ugly.  Solomon’s 
                        on the case.  He’ll track them down.

                                 LEMAY
                        Solomon?

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Old Solomon.  He’s part Indian.  But - 
                        thankfully - raised as a white.  The 
                        smartest man I ever met.  And not soft. 
                        The higher ups and powers-that-be know of 
                        him.  Caught some of the Willets gang 
                        down near Sacramento.  Murdering a 
                        soldier.  He hung the lot.  The rest ran 
                        off.

                                 LEMAY
                                 (mildly impressed)
                        The Willets clan.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        You know them?

                                 LEMAY
                        ‘Course.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        What’s said of them true?

                                 LEMAY
                        Some of it.

           LeMay smiles.  Soldier Ernie wants to ask more, but 
           CLAIRE enters.  At 28, she is still youthful and pretty 
           and looking particularly wholesome in her white Church 
           outfit.  LeMay stands.

                                 CLAIRE
                                 (surprised)
                        What are you doing here?
           EXT. COLEMAN HOUSE YARD - DAY

           Claire and LeMay stand outside.

                                 CLAIRE
                        He’s a good man.  He known what I was.  
                        Found out about Megan.  Didn’t care on 
                        that, neither.  
                                 (beat - as if to further 
                                 prove her point)
                        He built a public library in Truckee.  
                        You know, for books, so people can learn 
                        to read.

                                 LEMAY
                        You learned to read?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I c’aint.  I ain’t never going to be able 
                        to read.

                                 LEMAY
                        People stay the way they are.  The way 
                        they’re made.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t rightly know.

           Megan watches them from the window.

                                 LEMAY
                        She’s mine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Could be.  Don’t know for sure.  He’s 
                        raised her like his own.  

                                 LEMAY
                        She has evil thoughts.  She’s mine and 
                        has evil thoughts.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We all got evil thoughts.

                                 LEMAY
                        No.  Some have bad thoughts -- thoughts 
                        of small betrayals of no consequence.  I 
                        mean evil thoughts.  Thoughts of killing.  
                        And maiming.  And raping.  I got that 
                        from my daddy and he got it from his.
                                 CLAIRE
                        She ain’t like that.  She’s a good child.

           She looks at him and notices the age in his eyes.  And a 
           sadness she didn’t previously know.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You ain’t known to rape.

                                 LEMAY
                        You don’t have others.  Because she’s 
                        wrong. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don’t have to do this.

                                 LEMAY
                        Yes I do.

                                 CLAIRE
                        C’aint you tell we’re living in peace out 
                        here!  We ain’t causing no one no hurt.

           Claire runs inside.  LeMay looks toward the snow capped 
           mountains.

           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - LATER

           Coleman has his arm around Claire.  Soldier Ernie stands, 
           hand positioned near his gun.  LeMay enters the house.  

                                 LEMAY
                        Thank you for your hospitality.

                                 COLEMAN
                        A friend of Claire is a friend of mine.

           LeMay nods.  Megan runs after him and hugs his big leg.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Bye.

           He pats her head.

                                 LEMAY
                        Bye.

           He eyes Claire.  She whispers “Thank You.”
           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Megan and Coleman finish eating oatmeal for breakfast.

                                 MEGAN
                        Can I go outside?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Clear your dishes.

           Megan does as she’s told and runs outside.

           EXT. COLEMAN FARM - LATER

           Megan plays in the yard.  LeMay stands outside the fence 
           looking in.  She sees him and wanders over.

           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Coleman scrubs dishes and looks out the window.  He sees 
           Megan talking to LeMay.  LeMay lifts her up and over the 
           fence.

                                 COLEMAN
                        What the...

           Coleman scrambles to find his shotgun.

           EXT. COLEMAN FARM - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay walks with Megan into the empty fields surrounding 
           the Coleman farm.  She is without a care in the world.

           EXT. COLEMAN PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Coleman exits carrying his shotgun.  Claire blocks him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t.

                                 COLEMAN
                        What’s he doing?

                                 CLAIRE
                        We ain’t got the power to stop it.

                                 COLEMAN
                        The hell I don’t.
                                 CLAIRE
                        He’ll kill you.  He’ll kill all of us.

                                 COLEMAN
                        That’s our daughter.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My daughter.  She’s my daughter.

           This deflates him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We ain’t got no choice.

           Claire coldly steps back inside.  Coleman looks into the 
           distance.

           EXT. FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay sits Megan down in the fields.  He leans over her 
           shoulder and points east towards snow covered mountains.  
           Cold air blows Megan’s light brown hair.

                                 LEMAY
                        Out there.  Is where I come from.  Past 
                        the mountains.  Called the plains.

           LeMay backs away.  Megan’s eyes look due East.

                                 LEMAY (O.S.)
                        In the plains everything is flat.  No 
                        mountains, no trees.  Nothing but fields 
                        and space.  That’s where your ancestors 
                        are from.  Your people.  You are from the 
                        plains.

                                 MEGAN
                        No I’m not.  I’m from California.

           She starts to turn.

                                 LEMAY (O.S.)
                        Keep your eyes that way.  I’m going to 
                        tell you a story.

                                 MEGAN
                        Okay.

                                 LEMAY (O.S.)
                        You have to keep your eyes that way.  
                        There was a boy from the plains.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEMAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        A boy about your age.  And that boy had 
                        evil dreams.  Dreams that came true.

           EXT. COLEMAN PORCH - LATER

           A SHOT rings out across the land.  Coleman sits on his 
           porch, still staring helplessly into the distance.

           EXT. FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay stands holding his smoking gun.  He puts it back in 
           his holster.

           EXT. TAHOE CITY - DAY

           Cal and his gang watch an armed group of finely dressed 
           men escort a large caravan of horses and wagons to the 
           local bank.

           Men from the bank exit carrying heavy containers and load 
           them into the wagon under armed escort.  Cal notices the 
           YOUNGEST LOOKING KID loading up the wagon from the bank.

           Cal picks at his teeth with a toothpick.

           INT. TAHOE CITY SALOON - NIGHT

           The youngest kid is actually named SWIFTY and he is 19 
           years old.  He bashfully orders a whisky from the bar.

                                 CAL (O.S.)
                        I’d like to pay for that.

           Swifty turns to see Cal sitting there with his upkept 
           clothes and scary looking eyes.

                                 SWIFTY
                        That’s all right, friend, I got it.

                                 CAL
                        I insist.

           He tosses coins on the bar.

           INT. BACK OF THE SALOON - LATER

           Patty and Logan linger around the bar, not drinking, and 
           looking generally agitated.  Swifty, however, is swaying 
           with warmth.
                                 SWIFTY
                        Say, how come you ain’t drinking?

                                 CAL
                        I been drinking before I even saw you.  
                        You still got catching up.

                                 SWIFTY
                        Damn.  You don’t seem it.

                                 CAL
                        So how’s a fella get a job in this town?

                                 SWIFTY
                        Gotta know someone.

                                 CAL
                        I know you.

                                 SWIFTY
                        Not well you don’t.  
                                 (beat)
                        Say, you ain’t queer?

                                 CAL
                        I ain’t.  I just ain’t built for the 
                        mines.  I need an easy type job.  Like 
                        you.

                                 SWIFTY
                        Hell, my job ain’t easy!  I gotta lift 
                        boxes of gold and shuffle them around all 
                        day.

                                 CAL
                        Where’s all the gold go?

                                 SWIFTY
                        Some train east.

                                 CAL
                        And what d’you all get?

                                 SWIFTY
                        What ya mean?

                                 CAL
                        What d‘you get for the gold?

                                 SWIFTY
                        What ya think?  We get cash.  Cash money.
           Swifty takes out bills from his pocket and proudly 
           flashes it.

                                 SWIFTY
                        This one’s on me.

           As Swifty heads to the bar Cal glances over to Patty and 
           Logan and nods his head.

           EXT. TAHOE CITY BANK - DAY

           Swifty stumbles hungover to the bank in the morning.  His 
           BOSS sees him walking in.

                                 BOSS
                        Boy, you are later than...Jesus, you 
                        stink.

                                 SWIFTY
                        Sorry, Boss.

           The weekly caravan of horses and armed escorts ride into 
           town and park in front of the bank.

                                 BOSS
                        Git in there.

           Swifty enters the bank.  The BOSS walks to the caravan 
           and everything slows down --

           THE BOSS sees something confusing right in the middle of 
           the street.  He panics right before his chest is filled 
           with Gatling Gun bullets.  And he isn’t the only one. 

           A DEAFENING SOUND OF BULLETS from the Gatling Gun chew up 
           the caravan and bank.  

           CAL 

           whooping and screaming - and churning - the big gun.  

           PATTY AND LOGAN

           standing on the horse trailer pointing their guns, but 
           not bothering to fire.

           CAL 

           keeps spinning and spinning the gun.  No one even gets a 
           chance to return fire.  Eventually, he runs out of 
           bullets.  At least 15 men are felled.
           Cal hops off the horse trailer.

                                 CAL
                        Re-load that bitch.

           He pulls his .45 and goes to observe his damage.  

           CARAVAN

           Men are either laid out dead or squirming because major 
           parts of their bodies are filled with bullets.  

           CAL 

           shoots a squimer.  And another.

           PATTY/GATLING GUN

           reloads the Gatling Gun.  

           COVERED WAGON

           Cal looks inside.  Tons of cash money is everywhere.  
           Lots of holes in it, too.

                                 CAL
                        We got it, boys!

           Logan brings feed bags over.  They gather the cash.

           PATTY/GATLING GUN

           stands over the big gun covering them.

           COVERED WAGON

           as they finish up with the stolen cash, a few people poke 
           their heads out of buildings and the bank.  Cal notices.

           He goes back to the gun.  

           PATTY/GATLING GUN

           Cal takes control as if to use it again and wipe everyone 
           out.

                                 PATTY
                        That’s our last box of bullets.  You 
                        wanna waste it on them?

                                 CAL
                        Don’t go on thinking too much, Patty.
           But Cal puts down the gun.  

                                 CAL
                        Let’s go.

           He steps down onto Gatling Gun shells and walks past.  We 
           linger on the shells.

                                 PATTY (O.S.)
                        Hiya!

           We hear the HORSES AND WAGON MOVING away.

           EXT. TAHOE CITY BANK - DAY

           Solomon picks up a handful of Gatling Gun bullets and 
           looks at Soldier Ernie who shakes his head ruefully.  In 
           the background a trove of US Army men and local law 
           examine the damage. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Where’d he learn to use the gun?

           Just then, A GIANT CARRIAGE rumbles down the street 
           pulled by eight Clyesdale horses driven by a very large 
           CHINAMAN (40) wearing a tailored British suit. 

           Townspeople and soldiers all stop and take notice.  
           Solomon and Soldier Ernie turn -

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (sotto)
                        Christ...

           The carriage stops and CHARLIE JAMES (60s, fat) limps out 
           wearing a Texan-style suit and big hat.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        SOLOMON!

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (tipping his hat)
                        Charlie James.

           Charlie James quickly scans over the damage.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Dammit Solomon what in God’s name 
                        happened to my bank?

                                 SOLOMON
                        We’re dealing with a madman.
                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Hell, Solomon, you’s supposed to be some 
                        sort of genius.  I need a genius to tell 
                        me that?
                                 (gesturing)
                        Look at that over there.  Where’s a 
                        criminal get artillery like that?

           Just then, a large sign for the bank falls and crashes 
           onto the ground, nearly crushing a soldier.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE 
                        From us.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Pardon?

                                 SOLOMON
                        A few weeks ago, we got a Gatling Gun 
                        stole from us.  We assumed the man 
                        wouldn’t know how to use it - it takes a 
                        bit of know-how to load one up, 
                        transport, and fire with accuracy.  

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Looks like ya’ll were wrong.  

           The three men survey the damage.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        I need to make some moves here?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Like what?

           Charlie James pulls Solomon aside.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Listen here, Solomon.  Long before you 
                        were around, we tamed these parts.  This 
                        whole civilization you see sprouting up 
                        didn’t just come from nowhere.  We hadda 
                        handle things different.  Ourselves.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I know what you did.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                                 (smiling)
                        Well, then.  
                                 (beat)
                        You gonna fix it?
                                 SOLOMON
                        I’ll fix it.

           Solomon walks away.  Charlie James watches him go.  The 
           well dressed Chinaman sidles up next to Charlie James and 
           hands him a Gatling Gun shell.

           EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - NIGHT

           LeMay cleans his Ivory Handled Pistol by the light of a 
           fire.  A small piece of game is cooking on his Bowie 
           knife.  He can see down on the fledging mountain town.  
           When finished cleaning his gun, he takes the small cooked 
           game and eats it off the knife.

           Footsteps in the woods behind him.  LeMay doesn’t react.  
           The Scruffy Man appears.  LeMay offers him a piece of 
           game.  The Scruffy Man refuses.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        I went back.

                                 LEMAY
                        And?

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        They say the boy was an exact match.  
                        Identical.

                                 LEMAY
                        He say what he want?

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        He was looking for his daddy.

           LeMay is shaken for just a moment.  He takes out some 
           coins.  The Scruffy Man waves him off.

                                 SCRUFFY MAN
                        I figured this was the last one.  Figured 
                        now we’re square.

           LeMay puts his coins back in his pocket.  He eats meat.  
           The Scruffy Man waits.  After a moment, LeMay finally 
           notices he’s waiting for approval.

                                 LEMAY
                        We’re square.
           INT. WHORE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           MAY is a 43 year-old whore whose big boobs and dark red 
           hair bounce up and down as she unenthusiastically rides 
           reverse cowgirl on top of a fat, hairy, miner.  She looks 
           damn good, despite her lack of enthusiasm. 

           The door to her room opens.  May calmly waves away.

                                 MAY
                        Get out, almost finished here.

           She keeps riding her customer, but the FIGURE stays at 
           the door.  May looks up and recognizes who it is.

           She stops riding the customer.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        What the hell?

                                 MAY
                        Go on, git.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I ain’t done.

                                 MAY
                        Git you orangutang.

           The fat, hairy man gathers his things and he sees LeMay 
           at the door.

           SAME ROOM - LATER

           A cigarette is being lit.  May takes a full drag.  She 
           offers one to LeMay.  He ignores.

                                 MAY
                        I ain’t ashamed of what I done.  The boy 
                        had a chance.  He don’t need to know what 
                        I am.  
                                 (beat)
                        Or what you is.

                                 LEMAY 
                        I’m not concerned with the boy you’re 
                        speaking of.  I’m talking about the 
                        other.

           A flicker of surprise crosses May’s face.  She doesn’t 
           look at LeMay.
                                 MAY
                        I don’t know what you’re talking about.

           He drops a big stack of coins on her dresser.

                                 LEMAY
                        Tell me about the other boy.

                                 MAY
                        There ain’t no other boy.

                                 LEMAY
                        He knows about me.  Who told him?

                                 MAY
                        There ain’t no other boy.

           LeMay unsheathes his enormous Bowie knife.

                                 LEMAY
                        I could make it so you couldn’t work no 
                        more.

                                 MAY
                        Go ahead.  Be doing me a favor.

                                 LEMAY
                        ‘suppose I’ll just wait until he finds me 
                        then.

           He stands to re-sheath his knife.  She moves to take 
           another drag of her cigarette.  Without warning, he 
           quickly whacks down on her cigarette hand and chops it 
           off.  She screams and the hand falls on the ground, still 
           holding a lit cigarette.

                                 LEMAY
                        Now he know where I been.

           LeMay takes back the coins he put on the table and exits 
           the room.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           LeMay walks straight out through the saloon.  May’s hairy 
           customer eyes him, but decides against saying anything.  
           As LeMay walks out May comes screaming from upstairs 
           holding a bloody cloth over her nub.

                                 MAY
                        Look at what that sum-bitch done to me!
           She holds her nub up above her head.  LeMay stops at the 
           front door.  He turns to face the entire saloon, filled 
           with ordinary folks - some miners - but a lot of other 
           business types as this place is on the border of being 
           civilized.  No one says a goddamn thing.

           FRONT DOOR - LeMay is gone.

           INT. COLEMAN HOUSE - DAY 

           Coleman sits at the dinner table staring out the window, 
           food untouched.  His face and body reveal he hasn’t eaten 
           in days. 

           He watches Claire eating as if all was normal.  She chews 
           and picks a piece of meat from her teeth.

           Coleman gets up from the table and begins to pack his 
           gear.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing?

           He takes his shotgun down.

           Claire rises.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You don’t understand what he is.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Maybe you don’t understand what I am.  

           He finishes gathering his things and makes to the door.

                                 COLEMAN
                        And maybe I don’t understand what you 
                        are.

           Coleman exits.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I known you don’t.

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE - DAY

           Patty exits brushing off his hands.

                                 PATTY
                        Ain’t no one gonna find it in there.
                                 LOGAN
                        We ought’n celebrate.  Maybe ride to 
                        Sacramento and find some whores.

           Patty stops suddenly.  

                                 LOGAN
                                 (incredibly nervous)
                        Sorry.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean...I 
                        know you don’t...

           Patty hits Logan to suggest - just let it go!

                                 CAL
                        We’re riding to Reno.

           Cal hops onto his horse.

                                 PATTY
                        Reno?  
                                 (looking to Logan for 
                                 support)
                        Might be some law in Reno...

           Cal eyes both of them.  The matter isn’t up for debate.

                                 LOGAN
                        Or we could go to Reno.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           We recognize this place - where LeMay visited May the 
           whore.  But tonight is raucous.  Drinking, whoring, 
           gambling, music - everything.  And the kings of this 
           party are Patty, Logan, and Cal.  Tossing cash around the 
           bar like idiotic young men all around the world all 
           across time.  But it is Cal who is quietest.  He isn’t 
           even drunk.  Patty is rubbing the legs of two good 
           looking young whores.  Logan holds court telling stories 
           and making a large group laugh.

           Cal sees who he’s been looking for finally make an 
           appearance:  May.  He smiles.  He stands.  And then he 
           notices her bandaged nub.  She sees him and turns away.

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - LATER

           May smokes with her one good hand.

                                 CAL (O.S.)
                        What happened?
                                 MAY
                        I told you not to come here.

           Cal walks to her and holds her arm aggressively.

                                 CAL
                        Who did this?

                                 MAY
                        It was a mining accident.

           A customer pokes his head in the room.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        You all finished?

                                 MAY
                        Give us a few minutes, hun.

           Cal pulls his gun and shoves it in the customer’s face.

                                 CAL
                        I’ll kill you.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Jesus.  Relax.  Sorry.

           He pushes him out the room and closes the door.

                                 MAY
                        You need to go.

                                 CAL
                        I want to stay.

                                 MAY
                        I told you not to come here.

           Cal hugs his mother.  He hugs her desperately, like an 
           infant child, still loosely holding his gun.

                                 CAL
                        I’m going to protect you, ma.  I got 
                        money.  I want you to come live with me.  
                        This is too dangerous.

                                 MAY
                        No.  No.  Come now.
                                 (pushing him away)
                        Now listen to me.  Keep your money.  You 
                        gotta go away from here and get started 
                        somewhere else.  Anywhere.  Don’t tell me 
                        where.  Okay?
                                 CAL
                        I’ll never leave you, ma.  Never.  I’m 
                        not like all of them soldiers and 
                        bankers.

           Cal pulls out hole-filled cash from his pockets.

                                 CAL
                        See?  I got money.  I can get more.

           Cal puts down his gun and lays on the bed.

                                 CAL
                        I want to stay here tonight.

                                 MAY
                        You can’t.

                                 CAL
                        Why not?

                                 MAY
                        Because.

                                 CAL
                        What if I was a customer?

                                 MAY
                        NO.

           Cal sits up.  He takes more money from his pockets.  She 
           goes to him and stops him.

                                 MAY
                        Get away from here.  Go North.  I’ll find 
                        you.

                                 CAL
                        Why do you always want me to leave?

                                 MAY
                        Because I love you.

           He hugs her again.

                                 CAL
                        I love you, too.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - CONTINUOUS

           Still raucous, Cal walks humbly down the stairs.  Logan 
           is chatting it up with a CHARMING GAMBLER.
                                 LOGAN
                        CAL!  Did you get yours one?

                                 GAMBLER
                        He sure looks it!  He looks worn.  You 
                        with May?  May is one hell of a whore, I 
                        tell ya.  One hell of a whore.

           Cal whips out a knife and stabs the Gambler right in the 
           neck.  Blood squirts out everywhere.  He stabs him 
           repeatedly in the stomach over and over again.  The 
           gambler falls to the floor, writhing in pain.

           Everyone in the bar freezes by the sudden outburst of 
           extreme violence.

           Cal walks out of the bar.  Patty and Logan have little 
           choice but to follow.

           EXT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           BIG BUCK (40) is sheriff of Reno.  His badge twinkles 
           from daily polishing and rests on his broad chest.

           The dead gambler is brought outside the saloon.  Buck 
           sighs at the gruesome nature of the man’s death.

                                 SALOON KEEPER (O.S.)
                        The boy was up with May prior to the 
                        stabbing.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Suppose I outta talk to May.

           May fumbles with her cigarette and covers herself with a 
           blanket/shawl to keep warm.  Big Buck approaches her.

                                 BIG BUCK
                          Hey ya, May.

           She doesn’t respond.  Buck’s tone is rarely right.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        They’re saying a boy done this.  A boy 
                        not much older than 18 or thereabouts.  
                        He was with you right before they say.  
                        That true?

                                 MAY
                        This is my fault.
                                 BIG BUCK
                        Now May, don’t go on saying that.  You 
                        didn’t stab no one.

                                 MAY
                        I thought...I thought I could be a mama.  
                        Why couldn’t I be a mama?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Can’t say I understand what you’re 
                        talking about, May.

                                 MAY
                        A mama ought to be able see her child.  
                        It ain’t so much.  I just don’t see why I 
                        do everything wrong. 

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Did the boy say anything about a gambling 
                        debt?  I’m thinking if the man who got 
                        kilt was a gambling man, maybe he owed 
                        him money.  Did he mention anything ‘long 
                        those lines?

           May looks at Big Buck and realizes she’d be better off 
           talking to a rock.

                                 MAY
                        He didn’t say nothing.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Well, shoot.  This sure is a mystery.  

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Behind a post, away from the action, LeMay observes the 
           scene.  He spits tobacco juice.

           EST. FORT GENOA - DAY

           A small army fort where Solomon and Soldier Ernie and the 
           rest of the small contingent of US Army operate in these 
           parts.  It houses 50 men, their equipment, horses, etc.

           INT. FORT GENOA - SOLOMON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Solomon and Soldier Ernie read over records.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Here.
           He passes a file over to Soldier Ernie.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE 
                        Cal Talisker.  An orphan raised in Carson 
                        City.  Joined the army and trained as a 
                        loader for a Gatling Gun...

           The two men look at each other.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Discharged for lying about his age and 
                        for insubordination....  Could be.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Read on.
                                 (pointing to file)
                        His superior officer.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Wilson....  Damn.

           Solomon grabs his coat and prepares his things.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE
                        Where you going?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Carson City.

           EXT. CARSON CITY ORPHANAGE - DAY 

           Solomon rides solo toward a large home.  A few rough 
           looking kids hang outside.

                                 MRS. MARTIN (O.S.)
                        We had so many children through the 
                        years...and I don’t got time to keep good 
                        records.

           INT. ORPHANAGE - CONTINUOUS

           MRS. MARTIN is a stern, strong, Christian woman in her 
           50s.  Solomon drinks tea with her.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Well, this boy run off and tried to join 
                        the army.  Name’s Cal Talisker.

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        Oh Lord.  What he done?
                                 SOLOMON
                        You remember him?

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        Son of the devil that boy.

                                 SOLOMON
                        He killed a whole bunch of men.  Stole 
                        army weaponry.

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        Don’t surprise me.  Couldn’t keep animals 
                        or youngins ‘round that boy alone.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Can you tell me more about him?  
                        Something that might help me find him.

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        A smart boy.  Learnt how to do things 
                        quickly.  But he ran away and came back 
                        so much, he never got much schooling.  
                        You must understand, we got lots of kids 
                        and we can’t give all the attention they 
                        need.  
                                 (beat)
                        There was a lady who come visit now and 
                        again.  A pretty woman, made up to appeal 
                        to men.

                                 SOLOMON
                        A whore?

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        I supposed she was.

                                 SOLOMON
                        His mother?

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        I supposed she was.  Never asked.  She’d 
                        visit and pay him some attention.  Tell 
                        him stories.  Bring him clothes and 
                        sweets.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Do you know where she came from?

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        If I hadda guess, she had the whiff of 
                        Reno to her.  But that’s only a guess.
                                 SOLOMON
                        Reno...  

           The place seems to bear some significance to him.  
           Solomon gets up in a hurry.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You’ve been a tremendous help.

                                 MRS. MARTIN
                        She stopped coming is when he left.  He 
                        ran away and I ain’t never seen him 
                        after.  Figured he got himself in a 
                        scrape and got kilt.  Boy ain’t natural.

           EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - DAY

           Solomon rides through the scene again where the Gatling 
           Gun was originally stolen.

           He finds the spot where Cal observed Wilson and the 
           caravan coming down the trail.  

           CAL’S PERSPECTIVE

           He holds up his shotgun and takes aim, estimating 
           distance and the shooting ability of Cal.

           He goes down to - 

           WILSON’S PERSPECTIVE 

           He gazes around, trying to understand how Wilson saw the 
           scene.

           Solomon changes into civilian clothes - a sturdy, beige 
           leather hide coat and cowboy pants.  He removes his 
           soldier hat and his hair is long and unruly underneath.  
           He covers it with an old black cowboy hat with a half 
           white/half brown EAGLE FEATHER on the puggaree.

           EXT. RENO - NIGHT

           Solomon rides into town.  The streets are quiet - only a 
           few folks are out.

           INT. RENO SHERIFF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Solomon enters to find Big Buck whittling while two 
           drunks are lying passed out in the cage behind him.
                                 BIG BUCK 
                        Good lord, Solomon.  Almost didn’t 
                        recognize you in civies.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (nods)
                        Buck.  Mind if I pick your brain?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Sure as hell do!  Ha.  No, I’m just 
                        jesting.  What’s on your mind?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Well, I could use your help.

                                 BIG BUCK
                                 (excited by the prospect)
                        Really?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m looking for a man.  Might have a 
                        couple fellas with him.  A man with a 
                        whore mother.  Been causing some trouble 
                        and he stoled some equipment of mine.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Hmmmm.

           Big Buck glances over his shoulder and looks at the two 
           passed out drunks.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Sure don’t know.  I don’t know if I seen 
                        anyone fitting that type of description.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You got any crimes or problems of late 
                        round town?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Well...we did have a murder the other 
                        night in the saloon.

                                 SOLOMON
                        A murder?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Brutal stabbing.  I suspect it has to do 
                        with a gambling debt.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You caught the fella?
                                 BIG BUCK
                        Nope.  No sign of him.  Just a boy, 
                        supposedly.

                                 SOLOMON
                        A boy?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Yup.  No older ‘en 18.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Which saloon?

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           Solomon enters the saloon, which is nearly empty.  He 
           sits at the bar and orders a whisky.  

           Three whisky’s later.

                                 BARKEEP
                        Need another?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I wanna meet your whores.

                                 BARKEEP
                        What’s your preference?  I got a new 
                        Injun.  Might be your speed.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What kinda old whores you got?

           The barkeep looks at Solomon askance.  

                                 BARKEEP
                        Alright, fella.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - UPSTAIRS AREA - NIGHT

           Lined up are a bunch of older whores - a sad lot - beaten 
           down by rough years.  Mostly white except one Indian and 
           one Negress for variety.  At the end of the line stands 
           May -- the only one with any spark left in her -- with 
           her hands behind her back.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Her.
           INT. MAY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Solomon pulls out some cash from his pocket and puts it 
           on the table.  May sprays perfume around the room and 
           walks beneath it, her big creamy tits almost falling out 
           of her dress.

           She puts up her hair and Solomon notices her nub.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Oh my God!  What happened to your hand?

           He goes to her and holds her forearm gently, with a 
           surprising familiarity.

           She gazes at him for a long beat.

                                 MAY
                        Old customer wanted something from me.  I 
                        wouldn’t give it.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Does it hurt?

                                 MAY
                        I been hurt worse.

           He pulls her arm around him and hugs her tightly.  She 
           leans her head into his chest and closes her eyes.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (quiet)
                        You here when the murder happened the 
                        other night?

           She opens her eyes and releases the hug and backs away 
           from him slowly.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Was it your boy?

                                 MAY
                        You don’t know nothing...

                                 SOLOMON
                        I got dangerous weaponry stolen by a boy 
                        from Carson City with a whore mother.

                                 MAY
                        That’s why you here.
           She covers her chest and picks up a half smoked cigarette 
           and relights it.  

           Solomon looks at May’s shelf of trinkets.  He notices an:

           EAGLE FEATHER - half white/half brown - matching the one 
           on his hat and picks it up.

                                 SOLOMON
                        The Washoe feather.

                                 MAY
                                 (ironic)
                        For courage...during the hard times...

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (earnest)
                        The people thought so.

                                 MAY
                        Where’s your uniform?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Tonight it’s away.

                                 MAY
                        You get where you wanted to get?

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (matter of fact)
                        I’m a Lieutenant.

                                 MAY
                                 (hesitant)
                        You get married?

                                 SOLOMON
                        No.

           She ponders the meaning of this information as she puts 
           out her smoke.  She goes to him and takes the Eagle 
           Feather back.

                                 MAY
                        You still got a nice face.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You still got nice tits.

           May tries not to laugh, but she can’t help it.  A really 
           nice laugh, too.  Solomon leans in and they share a 
           gentle kiss.  A kiss of two lovers - not of a 
           customer/client.  A kiss that quickly turns deep.
           EXT. FORT GENOA - DAY

           It’s a lazy morning at the Fort.  Soldiers mill about.  A 
           guard chews tobacco and spits.  

           INT. OUTHOUSE - DAY

           Soldier Ernie takes a piss and wiggles it all out.  

           EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY

           Soldier Ernie exits the outhouse when he sees the guard 
           atop the front of the fort suddenly take a huge gunshot 
           through the chest and fall from the perch above. 

           A team of horses with a big trailer comes through the 
           front of the fort.  On it, the Gatling Gun equipped with 
           a shield on both sides.

                                 SOLDIER ERNIE 
                        Holy Christ!

           He runs for cover.

           EXT. ARMORY - DAY

           The team of horses makes a wide turn and comes to a halt.  
           The Gatling Gun unleashes fire, strafing soldiers 
           outside.  Most run and take cover.  A few take hits.

                                 CAL
                        Move, move!

           Patty and Logan run to the armory storage area.  Patty 
           uses the elephant gun to blow open the door.

           AROUND THE FORT

           Soldiers take defensive positions and, using whatever 
           small arms they have on them, fire towards the Gatling 
           Gun.  But only a few shots hit the shields, as anyone in 
           proper range gets strafed with cover fire from the big 
           gun.

           BACK UP ARMORY - GUN RACK

           A few soldiers quickly grab rifles from a back up armory.  
           They run downstairs and form a quick line.  One of the 
           soldiers has stripes.
                                 LEAD SOLDIER
                        We gotta stop them from whatevers they’re 
                        trying to steal.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        What about the gun?

                                 LEAD SOLDIER
                        It has shields.  We’ll just get one 
                        volley before it can get us.  We hit 
                        those men and they’re down.

           The men nod.  They stand ready.

                                 LEAD SOLDIER
                        Wait until they’re coming out.

           SOLDIER ERNIE

           sees the men prepped with rifles and ready.  He’s got his 
           pistol ready to back them up, whatever they’re trying.

           CAL

           rotates the gun around, in a limited range because of the  
           shields, covering Patty and Logan as they prepare to come 
           out.

                                 PATTY
                        You got us covered?

                                 CAL
                        I got you.  Come quick.  They’re 
                        gathering.  I can feel them gathering.

           PATTY

           sprints out lugging a big, heavy box of ammunition.  He 
           makes it to the horse trailer and lifts it in.  A few pop 
           shots ring out, but nothing hits.

           SOLDIER ERNIE

           sees the men with rifles moving into position to take a 
           volley at the door of the armory.  He rises and aims for 
           the Gatling Gun, seeing that it can’t rotate all the way 
           to hit him.  He pops his pistol off - heading straight at 
           the big gun, trying to get a lucky hit and distract from 
           the phalanx of other soldiers.  

           LOGAN
           exits the armory carrying a big box of ammunition.  He 
           moves too slowly and the soldiers are in position.

           LINE OF SOLDIERS

                                 LEAD SOLDIER
                        Fire!

           A volley is fired.

           LOGAN

           is shot down -- dead. 

           LINE OF SOLDIERS

                                 LEAD SOLDIER
                        Reload!

           CAL 

           sees Logon dead on the ground and a red-rage comes over 
           his face.

           SOLDIER ERNIE

           fires shot after shot moving in toward the Gatling Gun, 
           but each keeps pinging off the shields.  

           CAL 

           furious, kicks the shield out of the way and swings the 
           gun all the way around and unleashes fire at the rifle 
           company.  Several men are cut up and go down.  

           PATTY

           jumps down and grabs the second box of ammunition.

           SOLDIER ERNIE reloads and continues to fire.  He tags Cal 
           in the pinky.  Cal screams and swings the Gatling Gun 
           around and mows down Soldier Ernie.

           PHALANX OF SOLDIERS 

           A few rifleman, not fatally wounded, are able to reload 
           and fire individual shots toward Cal, but none hit.

           AROUND THE FORT

           More soldiers come out of the woodwork with rifles and 
           pistols and take aim on the wagon.
           WAGON

           Patty yells and the horses start riding away.  Cal lays 
           more Gatling Gun cover fire, shooting chaotically all 
           around the fort and giving them the space to get away.  
           They ride out of the fort.

           STILL IN THE FORT 

           the damage is extensive.  Dead soldiers on the ground, 
           shot up.  Bullet holes everywhere.  Shells on the ground.  
           Several soldiers walk over and see Soldier Ernie laying 
           dead on the ground.

           INT. RENO AMMUNITION STORE - DAY

           LeMay enters the store.  An old shopkeeper is the only 
           other person inside.

                                 LEMAY
                        Box of .45 shells.

           The old shopkeeper pulls down a box.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Cost you a dollar.

           LeMay throws some coins on the table.

                                 LEMAY
                        Any group come in here lately and buy 
                        some ammunition?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Oh...we got lots of fellas come in here.

                                 LEMAY
                        A couple days ago...before the murder 
                        happen in the saloon down over there.  
                        Maybe some fellas you don’t recognize.

                        I known what you mean, mister.  I don’t 
                        see what’s in it for me.  Suppose they 
                        come back is what I’m saying.

                                 LEMAY
                        You know who I’m talking about, then?
                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Been ‘round like I been, you come to know 
                        what’s coming.  I known when that group 
                        come in, ain’t no good coming from them.

                                 LEMAY
                        But you sold them ammunition anyway.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Not my position to do otherwise.

                                 LEMAY
                        Suppose not.  
                                 (beat)
                        Suppose you think I ain’t up to no good, 
                        neither.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        You ain’t a good man, but you ain’t up to 
                        no good.  See what I mean?

                                 LEMAY
                        Fair ‘nough.  Lemme ask then, what’d they 
                        purchase?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        A couple boxes buckshot.  .45 shells just 
                        like you there.  Some big pieces of metal 
                        scrap I had out back.  Some tools.  
                        Fishing line...

                                 LEMAY
                        Fishing line?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Yup.

                                 LEMAY
                        Not many places to fish outside the lake.  
                        Am I wrong?

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        No, sir.

           LeMay ponders it and makes to leave.

                                 LEMAY
                        Thanks for your help.
           EXT. RED LAKE SHORE - DAY

           Patty unloads all the equipment and ammunition.  Cal sits 
           on the ground in a pout.  His hand and clothes covered in 
           dark red blood from his missing pinky.

                                 CAL
                        He was a good friend.

           Patty resentfully eyes Cal - both for making him do all 
           the work and hogging the grief.

                                 PATTY
                        He known the danger.

                                 CAL
                        It ain’t fair.  It ain’t fair he dead.

           Cal takes off his sweaty hat --

                                 CAL
                        Goddammit!  My hand!

           Patty comes over and takes a look.

                                 PATTY
                        You best get that bandaged professional.  
                        In the war, most men died from infection.

                                 CAL
                        Yeah, all right.

           Cal rises and gets on a horse.

                                 PATTY
                        Smart place to go be Redding.  You know 
                        it, right?

                                 CAL
                        I know it.

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - DAY

           May smokes a cigarette and Solomon lays next to her.

                                 MAY
                        You owe me for the whole night.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Sorry...on a soldier’s salary.  Don’t 
                        have it.
           She turns over and smiles at him nonetheless.

                                 MAY
                        Well, we ain’t too busy.

           He kisses her on the shoulder and gets up.  May stares at 
           him as he puts on his clothes.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You gonna tell me where I can find your 
                        boy?

                                 MAY
                        Don’t ask me that.  That ain’t why you’re 
                        here.

           She puts out her smoke.

                                 SOLOMON
                        It’s part of it.

                                 MAY
                                 (sensing the fun is over)
                        I never asked you what I known you 
                        couldn’t give.

                                 SOLOMON
                        He killed folks.

                                 MAY
                        I born him.

           She turns over and puts her face into the bed.  Solomon 
           goes to her and puts his hand on her back.  She mumbles 
           something into the bed.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I can’t hear you.

           She turns back over.

                                 MAY
                        He’s gone.  He ain’t coming back.  

                                 SOLOMON
                        What?  Why?

                                 MAY
                        To start anew.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What about my gun?
                                 MAY
                        I don’t know about no gun.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Where’d he go?

                                 MAY
                        Let him go.  Please just let him go.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I can’t.

           He goes to kiss her goodbye.  She pulls away and holds up 
           her nub to her face.

                                 MAY
                        It hurts.  
                                 (beat)
                        This...hurts. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        I needa find my gun.

                                 MAY
                                 (angry)
                        He’s gone...gone North and ain’t never 
                        coming back.  That what you want?

           Solomon registers the information.

                                 MAY
                                 (low)
                        I want you to leave.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Okay.

           Solomon goes to the door.

                                 MAY
                        And I don’t want you coming back.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (tips his hat)
                        May.

           He exits.

                                 MAY
                        Don’t ever come back.
           EXT. TWO-ONE SALOON - DAY

           Solomon exits.  The day is clear - we wouldn’t know it 
           was mid-winter.  A posse of six men ride through the 
           street, including Coleman.  He spots Solomon.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Holy Christ, hold up!

           He pulls up his horse and goes over to Solomon.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Solomon, that you?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Mr. Coleman.  How are you?

                                 COLEMAN
                        No good.  No sir.  I come into town to 
                        find some justice.

           Big Buck rides up - he is the leader of this posse.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What’s happened?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Another killer on the loose.  Kilt 
                        Coleman’s daughter Megan.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Megan?

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 1
                        A man come to these parts to kill his own 
                        kin he done spawned.

                                 BIG BUCK 
                        We don’t know all that.

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 2
                        My brother in Kansas says a man kilt six 
                        children last year.  All sired by whores - 
                        his own kin.  Man with a white handled 
                        pistol.  Man supposed to lived out West a 
                        few years back, come to clean up his 
                        mess.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I never heard such a thing.
                                 COLEMAN
                        He killed Megan.  We just buried her.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        We aim to catch him - he was spotted 
                        headed towards the lake.  Let’s go, boys.

                                 COLEMAN
                                 (to Solomon)
                        I sure would appreciate if you come with.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m supposed to be back at the Fort.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Old Solomon’s got too much on his plate.

           Coleman hops off his horse and pulls Solomon aside.

                                 COLEMAN
                        It’ll just take a few days...

           Solomon looks upstairs and catches May looking down at 
           him from the window.  They can’t help but stare at one 
           another.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You got ample men.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I done things right.  I done it how I was 
                        supposed.  And this man...

           Coleman can’t finish his thought as he begins to tear up.

                                 SOLOMON
                        All right, there.  Listen, not much I can 
                        do on my own affair anyhow. 

           He looks back at May.  Still staring.  

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (to everyone)
                        I’m coming.

           All the men are happy/relieved Solomon is coming, except 
           for Big Buck.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Follow me.
           Solomon checks his shotgun is loaded and grabs his horse.   
           He glances one more time up towards May, but she is no 
           longer at the window.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           LeMay rides through the woods.

           He ascends a steep mountain pass.  

           And so begins the -

           TRAVEL MONTAGE

           EXT. WOODS - CAL - TOWARDS REDDING - DAY

           Cal rides, a make-shift bandage on his hand.

           EXT. WOODS - THE POSSE - DAY

           Big Buck leads the posse with Solomon and Coleman 
           following behind.

           EXT. ABOVE THE TREE LINE - LEMAY - DAY

           His horse is slowing down.  LeMay shakes his canteen and 
           notices he is low on water.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM - LEMAY - DAY

           LeMay takes his horse to the water.  The horse drinks.  
           He fills his canteen and takes a long sip.

                                                           MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. TREE LINE - POSSE - DAY

           Solomon takes a large drink from his canteen as the posse 
           waits around atop their horses.  The tracker is a white 
           man named TOWNE (45).  He returns from scouting ahead on 
           foot.

                                 TOWNE
                        He rode over some rock formations I 
                        c’aint see his horse track up yonder.

                                 SOLOMON
                        We lost him?
                                 TOWNE
                        No.  I found the track again up over 
                        there, headed thata way.

           Towne points North even though they were headed West.

                                 SOLOMON
                        He knows we’re following?

                                 TOWNE
                        Don’t think so.  Going at a slow pace.  
                        Doubt he’d move so slow if he knew we was 
                        tracking.  Just a habit he got it seem.

           EXT. ROCKY SLOPE - CAL - DAY

           Cal rides slowly down a slope.  At the bottom, the land 
           evens out and he pulls up, riding along at a brisk pace.

           EXT. PLAIN - CAL - DAY

           Cal rides West along a flat plain.  In the background are 
           the tall peaks of the Sierra Nevada.

           EXT. DEEP SNOW FIELD - LEMAY - DUSK

           LeMay’s horse rides East in deep snow, trudging along.  
           The landscape is covered with untouched snow. 

           EXT. WOODS - LEMAY - LATER

           At the end of the field, LeMay is about to re-enter a 
           wooded area.  He stops and turns his horse.  He gazes 
           back across the field.  Sensing something/someone is 
           following.  He stares for a long moment at the open 
           field.

                                 LEMAY
                        HIYA!

           He quickly turns his horse and sprints into the woods.

           EXT. OTHER END OF THE SNOW FIELD - POSSE - LATER

           Buck, Solomon, and the rest of the posse arrive at the 
           snow field.  The men see a single horse track taking them 
           across into a dark woods. 
           The men look at one another, all knowing that following 
           this single trail leads somewhere they haven’t been 
           before.  Buck clumsily moves forward and all the men 
           follow.

           INT. SMALL MOUNTAIN CABIN - NIGHT

           A mangy DOCTOR (55) cleans his rusty tools as a patient 
           groans in the background.

           HEAVY KNOCK on the door.  The doctor opens up.  Cal 
           stumbles in and holds up his hand.

                                 CAL
                        I need you to look at my hand.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Ye got money?

           Cal produces plenty of cash.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Have a seat.  
                                 (holds up tongs)
                        Need ta remove a bullet first.

           Cal makes his way over to a bed and sits on it.  In the 
           background, we can hear the painful sounds of the Doctor 
           gorging into a patient’s stomach searching for a bullet.

                                 GRAYTON (O.S.)
                        You mind putting a muzzle on that 
                        sumbitch?

           In a bed next to Cal’s, a lump turns over.  GRAYTON (45).  
           He doesn’t look directly at Cal, but addresses him.

                                 GRAYTON
                        What ails you?

           Cal holds up his messy bandaged hand with missing pinky.  
           Cal looks over to the end of Grayton’s bed and next to 
           two six shooters, is a rope with four scalps strung 
           together.

           Grayton smiles with dirty teeth.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Ever seen anythin’ like it?
                                 CAL
                                 (realizing he’s been caught 
                                 peeking)
                        Who are they?

                                 GRAYTON
                        Four Brazilian lawmen.  I’ve just 
                        returned from that godforsaken land.  
                        It’s left me a virus I’m unable to shake.

           Still looking away and addressing Cal...

                                 GRAYTON
                        The Brazilians are disgusting people.

                                 CAL
                        Then why you’d go there?

                                 GRAYTON
                        The work.  Arab slave traders pay a 
                        mighty penny still.  This land has lost 
                        it’s taste for violence.  Lost the taste 
                        for conquest.  I sought it elsewhere, but 
                        the climate and people didn’t suit me.  
                        You’ve been shot.

                                 CAL
                        Just need it dressed proper.  Don’t want 
                        infection.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Would you like to see something?

                                 CAL
                        Why not?

           Grayton rises from bed.  He is surprisingly short, but 
           sturdy as a rock.  He pulls from under his bed a medium 
           sized sack.

                                 GRAYTON
                                 (still looking sideways)
                        My father gave this to me.

                                 CAL
                        You speaking to me?  You oughtta look at 
                        me when you speak.

                                 GRAYTON
                        I am looking at you.

           Because Grayton has a LAZY EYE.  He pulls out a SHRIVELED 
           INDIAN HEAD from his sack and dangles it by the hair.
                                 CAL
                        An Indian.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Not any Indian.  Gomez.  The great Apache 
                        chief.  This head was worth $2,000 before 
                        you and I was born.

           Cal backs away instinctively.  Grayton smiles, his gnarly 
           teeth exposed.

                                 CAL
                        You’re...

           Grayton offers up his hand to shake - still eyeing Cal 
           sideways.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Grayton Willets.  Of the Willets clan.

           EXT. NEAR A CAVE - NIGHT

           Coleman carries wood.  Big Buck arranges a pile of wood 
           for a fire.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Damn, forgot how cold it is above the 
                        treeline.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What are you doing?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Making a fire, it’s freezing.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (pointing East)
                        That man’s gonna smell and see fire.

           Buck pushes over his wood arrangement, his loss of 
           judgement annoying to himself and walks away.

                                 BIG BUCK
                                 (to self)
                        Guess we’ll all just freeze to death.

           A shivering Coleman tosses down a stack of logs.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I ain’t cut out for this.
                                 SOLOMON
                        We’re almost there.  Just a day away.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I didn’t act.  Not when I had the chance.  
                        Never thought myself a coward.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You’re acting now.

                                 COLEMAN
                        It’s too late.

           Coleman kicks the dirt beneath his feet.

                                 COLEMAN
                        You believe everything happens for a 
                        reason?  Believe God has a plan in store 
                        for us?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Don’t know on God’s plan.  Just know 
                        things happen when they meant to.  Don’t 
                        seem like reason has much to do with it.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Fate.  You believe in Fate.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I believe we’re gonna catch this murderer 
                        tomorrow.

           Solomon slaps Coleman on the back.

           ESTABLISHING SHOT - SUNRISE 

           Over the mountains...

           We hear the sounds of grunting, fast running horses...

           EXT. WOODS - THE POSSE - DAY

           Furiously galloping through the woods is the posse.  
           Determined.  Angry.  Ferocious.  The horses dig into the 
           ground, dodging tree branches and other obstacles.  

           Dirt kicks up.  The horses are spread across 300 feet of 
           forest.  Making good time.  A group hardened by a cold 
           night spent in the snow.
           EXT. CLEARING - THE POSSE - LATER

           They come upon an open clearing and slow.  Their horses 
           are breathing heavily.  The men are clearly tired and 
           worn down.

                                 BIG BUCK 
                        Where’s this murdering son of a bitch?

           Towne hops down off his horse.  Solomon looks up to the 
           sky and sees a midday sun.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Should be upon him now.

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Towne walks far ahead from the rest of the posse along 
           the tracks.  He examines the branches around the trail.  
           The imprint on the snow.  He touches the ground. 

           POSSE - watches Towne from a distance.  He stands 
           suddenly and kicks snow on the ground, yells out, and 
           puts his head in his hands.  He sprints back toward them.

                                 TOWNE
                                 (yelling)
                        Turn around.  Turn around.

           As he arrives back at the posse...

                                 TOWNE
                        Turn around.  We’ve lost time.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What happened?

                                 TOWNE
                                 (getting on his horse)
                        He’s led us astray.  The horse track 
                        we’re following has no man riding it.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        No man?

                                 TOWNE
                        He’s on foot.  He sent his horse in one 
                        direction and took another.  
                                 (to Coleman)
                        Who is this we’re chasing?
                                 COLEMAN
                        I don’t know.

           The posse turns and rides back in the direction from 
           which they came.

           EXT. CLIFFS - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay walks along a cliff and peers down to see -

           A HOT SPRING.  Steam rising from the water. 

           EXT. HOT SPRING - LATER

           LeMay bathes in the water.  Naked.  His clothes and gear 
           on the rocks.  He washes his face and rubs water on his 
           neck.  He hears a rustle above him - on the cliffs.  He 
           casually looks up to see:  A BLACK BEAR sniffing at the 
           air.  Smelling LeMay.  

           EXT. ROCKS - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           LeMay is throwing on his clothes quickly.  His hair still 
           wet, he struggles to put on his boots.  He looks around 
           and sees no sign of the bear.

           SUDDENLY, the BEAR emerges from the woods at a full 
           sprint right at LeMay.  

           LeMay yanks out his gun as the bear closes and fires to 
           no effect.  The bear ROARS and takes a swipe at LeMay 
           scratching all across his face and ripping his left ear 
           entirely off.  He drops his gun.

           The bear bellows and turns away from LeMay, who scrambles 
           away past the rocks away from the bear, half clothed, 
           face bleeding.  

           WOODS

           LeMay stumbles away, face completely shredded and bloody.

           HOT SPRING

           The bear walks on the rocks near the spring and sniffs 
           LeMay’s bearskin coat.

           LeMay’s gun is on the ground near the coat.
           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           LeMay stumbles through the woods, blind.  Blood covers 
           his chest and face.  He falls to the ground in exhaustion 
           and crawls to the closest tree to lean on.

           He takes off his shirt and tears one of the sleeves.  

           He wraps it around his head.

           EXT. CLEARING - MUCH LATER

           Cal and Grayton ride casually through a clearing.  Cal’s  
           hand bandaged professionally.  Grayton’s scalps dangling 
           from his horse.  

                                 GRAYTON
                        ...I understand hating soldiers.  Been 
                        conflicting with them most my life.  But 
                        bankers?  Nothin’ wrong with ‘em.  
                        Easiest folks to rob cause they got so 
                        much money -- pay you plenty to avoid 
                        trouble.

                                 CAL
                        Behind the door, bankers participate in 
                        unnatural, cruel, disgusting things and 
                        pay the women to keep quiet.

                                 GRAYTON
                        How come you know so much about whoring, 
                        even though you never been with a whore?

                                 CAL
                        Never been and never will.

                                 GRAYTON
                        You crazier’en me.  
                                 (beat)
                        Anyway...what you got in mind will take 
                        more men. 

                                 CAL
                        You know more men?

                                 GRAYTON
                        ‘Course I do.

           They ride a bit further and notice a pair of black boots 
           sticking out from behind a tree.  Instinctively, they 
           both pull pistols and dance their horses around.
           Passed out against the tree is LeMay with a ripped shirt 
           sleeve wrapped around his eyes and face.

                                 CAL
                        Damn fella what happened to you?

           LeMay stirs.

                                 LEMAY
                        Bear got me.

                                 CAL
                        A bear?  Ain’t they in hibernation?

           Cal hops off his horse.

                                 LEMAY
                        Not when they’re starving.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Leave him, we c’aint help him.

                                 CAL
                        He needs a better bandage.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Man got no horse, no jacket, gonna die 
                        out here.

                                 CAL
                        I’m helping him.

           Cal goes to his sack and pulls out some clean bandages.  
           Grayton rolls his eyes.

                                 CAL
                        Most men died by infection in the war.  
                        Bad bandages.

           He goes to LeMay and unties his shirt sleeve bandage.  He 
           removes it and sees LeMay’s face, mauled badly.  One eye 
           permanently damaged.  One ear all but gone.  The other 
           eye closed.

                                 CAL
                        One eye’ll heal.  

           Cal carefully wraps his clean bandage over the side of 
           LeMay’s head, covering his bad ear and one bad eye.  As 
           he wraps, he talks...
                                 CAL
                        We ain’t gonna be able to take you to 
                        town or anywheres safe.  You ain’t a 
                        soldier or banker is you?  

                                 LEMAY
                        No.

                                 GRAYTON
                        GOOD!  If ya was, my friend Cal would 
                        shoot you dead rather than tend to ya.

           Cal finishes wrapping around LeMay’s half head.

                                 CAL
                        There.  Can you open that other eye?

           LeMay cracks open his one eye.  The scab across it 
           breaks.  He looks straight at Cal.  And he recognizes his 
           progeny when he sees him.  Smiling like a stupid kid.

           LeMay glances over at Grayton and sees his pistol.  Cal 
           stands.  LeMay measures him up and down and notices his 
           guns as well.

                                 CAL
                        That’s better, ain’t it?

                                 GRAYTON
                        Let’s get outta here.

                                 LEMAY
                        Take me with you.

                                 CAL
                        We c’aint.

                                 LEMAY
                        Why not?

                                 GRAYTON
                                 (pulling his gun)
                        Ain’t none of yorn business.

                                 LEMAY
                        I’ll tell you something you want to know.

                                 CAL
                        I know all I needa.

                                 LEMAY
                        You don’t know what I know.
           Cal gets on his horse and saunters up near LeMay.

                                 CAL
                        You’re a crazy old bastard.

                                 LEMAY
                        Ever been with a woman?

                                 GRAYTON
                        He been with your old lady.  Go on and 
                        die already.

           Cal laughs and rides off.  Grayton’s horse turns, kicking 
           up dirt onto LeMay.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Hiya!

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           LeMay limps through the woods.  Head bandaged, but able 
           to see out of one eye again.

           EXT. HOT SPRING - DAY

           LeMay gathers his gear.  And his gun.  He puts on his 
           bearskin coat and hat.  His bowie knife goes into a 
           holster.  He stretches his shoulders wide and heads back 
           in the direction of Cal.  

           He stops.  Looking down, he sees -

           A BEAR TRACK.  He follows it to:  ANOTHER BEAR TRACK.

           He looks up.

           EXT. MEDIUM SIZED HILL - DAY

           Atop a small hill, the BLACK BEAR sniffs around looking 
           for roots and other things to eat.

           At the bottom of the hill, LeMay arrives, having followed 
           its tracks.  He pulls out his Bowie knife and ascends the 
           hill.

           EXT. WOODS - THE NEXT DAY

           The posse rides.  They arrive at -
           THE SAME MEDIUM SIZED HILL

           EXT. ATOP THE HILL - DAY

           The posse rides up and over the crest of the hill.  They 
           are collectively arrested by what they find -

           A DEAD BLACK BEAR - surrounded by red stained snow.

           The horses are skittish at the smell of the blood, the 
           men struggle to hold them steady, circling the dead bear.  
           The men’s eyes are locked on the sight in front of them.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Who are we chasing?

           EXT. RED LAKE INLET - DAY

           LeMay (w/ the head bandage) comes across a small corner 
           of Red Lake.  It looks like a good fishing spot.  He 
           looks around with his one eye carefully, but finds no 
           sign of camp or Cal.  

           EXT. FULL LAKE - LATER

           The sun is going down.  LeMay walks up to the lake and 
           gets a view of the whole thing.  It is massive.  It will 
           take forever to cover the entire thing.

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The posse is moving briskly.  Solomon next to Big Buck.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Sun’s going.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        So?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Mightn’t be our advantage to go at him in 
                        daylight.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Why’s that?

                                 SOLOMON
                        To see.  It being dark, he could pluck us 
                        one by one.
           EXT. FULL LAKE - NIGHT

           It is very dark and cold.  LeMay sits patiently watching 
           the huge lake.  We can barely see anything as there are 
           no lights or anything around it.  LeMay peers around with 
           a monocular until he sees what he’s looking for:

           A SMALL FIRE.  

           Across the lake, east.  He walks in the dark.

           EXT. WOODS - LEMAY NEAR LAKE -  DAY 

           Morning.  LeMay gazes through his monocular and sees what 
           he’s looking for.  He suddenly senses something, and 
           turns.  He leans onto a tree and looks back at the lake.

           EXT. WOODS - BACK 100 YARDS - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay is in the distance, his back leaning against a 
           tree, still looking out towards the lake.

           We hear a footstep.  A figure walks by the camera.  Then 
           another.  Then another.

           It’s the posse - guns drawn - converging on LeMay.

           Towne waits behind the rest of the posse, unarmed and out 
           of harms way.  Solomon, shotgun ready, follows the posse 
           but stops.

           He watches as the posse moves toward LeMay in the 
           distance.  He veers off to a flanking position. 

           The five others walk - spread out - toward LeMay quietly.  

           EXT. WOODS - NEAR LEMAY - CONTINUOUS

           Big Buck holds up his hand for everyone else to wait.  He 
           palms his 6-shooter.

                                 BIG BUCK 
                        You’re surrounded fella.

           He points his gun at LeMay’s back.  He takes a few brave 
           steps forward.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Don’t move or I’ll shoot.
           No response.

           Big Buck looks back at the posse for comfort.  Their 
           number gives them an unusual confidence and they all move 
           forward.  As Buck approaches LeMay his pace quickens and 
           he jumps out in front of him with his gun aimed.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Don’t you move!

           But it isn’t LeMay.  Just a big stick propping up his 
           coat and hat.

           CLICK.  It’s LeMay’s Ivory handled pistol right in his 
           face.  From above.  Inside a hollowed out tree.  LeMay - 
           looking terrifying with half-a-bandage on his head - hops 
           down and takes Big Buck’s 6-shooter out of his hand.  He 
           comes out from the tree, using Big Buck as a shield, 
           pointing one gun in his face and the other at the other 
           four men - all suddenly feeling exposed and vulnerable.

                                 LEMAY
                        You didn’t bring enough men.

           The weight of their guns sag the men’s arms.  Coleman 
           looks around for Solomon.

                                 LEMAY
                        Drop ‘em and get the...

           CRACK

           Solomon - out of nowhere - slams the butt of his shotgun 
           against LeMay’s bandaged head.

           He collapses onto the ground, knocked completely out.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Hot damn, we got him!

           Coleman giddily bounces around.  The rest of the men are 
           subdued by the close call.

           The group drags the knocked out LeMay away and we notice 
           in the background, just 200-250 yards away, the camp with 
           the Gatling Gun, the remnants of a fire, Cal, Grayton, 
           and Patty.  Grayton hops on his horse and rides away, 
           leaving the other two at the lake shore.
           INT. WOODS - DAY

           The posse rides.  Solomon holds his big shotgun on the 
           back of LeMay who has his hands tied.  Coleman rides next 
           to LeMay.

                                 COLEMAN
                        If it we’re up to me we’d burn you alive.  
                        You ain’t got no place on this earth.  
                        Not after what you done.

           LeMay ignores Coleman.

                                 COLEMAN
                        You ain’t so tough seeming.  I reckon I 
                        coulda had you myself.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Easy now...

                                 BIG BUCK 
                                 (smug)
                        Solomon - leave ‘em be.  Ole Coleman’s 
                        got a right to let this criminal have a 
                        piece of his mind.

           Coleman takes out his pistol and points it at LeMay’s 
           head.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’d give you more’n a piece.

           LeMay rides, gun poking at his bandaged head.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - LATER

           A dangerous, steep mountain pass.  The riders go single 
           file.  Overcast.  Snow coming soon.

           Coleman rides behind LeMay and glances over the steep 
           edge.  LeMay sees a loose, big boulder coming up.  He 
           adjusts in his saddle.  As his horse rides by, he jams 
           his shoulder hard into the boulder and nudges it loose.

                                 LEMAY
                        HI-YA!

           His horse quickly scoots forward and the heavy boulder 
           falls right onto Coleman’s horses foot, smashing it and 
           breaking it.  
           The horse neighs loudly and collapses, falling sideways 
           off the side of the cliff taking a screaming Coleman with 
           him. 

           The posse watches helplessly as Coleman and his horse 
           fall to their death.  Solomon looks at LeMay, who carries 
           a big, cocky grin across his face.

                                 LEMAY
                        You oughtta shut him up.

           Big Buck hops off his horse and points his gun at LeMay.

                                 BIG BUCK 
                        Get off.

           EXT. CLEARING - LATER

           Snow is falling.  LeMay is tied up to a tree.  His face 
           taken a few punches.

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 1
                        I says we hang ‘em here.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That our right?  We’re not judge or jury.

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 2
                        Snows coming, I don’t wanna ride with 
                        him.  We all seen what he done.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        You scared?

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 2
                        Damn right.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Can’t do it.

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 1
                        Ain’t no time to be righteous, Solomon.

                                 SOLOMON
                        It ain’t right us deciding.  We keep him 
                        tied and wait out the storm.

                                 POSSE FOLLOWER 2
                        Suppose he c’aint do nothing tied.
           EXT. CLEARING - CAMP - NIGHT

           Still snowing.  The men huddle up under some tree cover.  
           A fire burns.  Solomon, carrying a torch, walks over to 
           LeMay, tied to a tree, freezing, no fire, no nothing.

           TREE

           Solomon offers a piece of meat to LeMay.  He takes it 
           with his mouth, like a dog.  Solomon sees LeMay is 
           shivering and moves the torch a little closer.

                                 LEMAY
                        You the one who snuck up on me?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Yep.

                                 LEMAY
                        Shoulda come out shooting.  I c’aint hear 
                        no more on this side.

           The tactical defeat clearly gnawing at him.

                                 LEMAY
                        You part Indian?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I am.

                                 LEMAY
                        Guess there ain’t shame in being snuck up 
                        on by an Indian.

           EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - DAY 

           The posse rides.  Now LeMay is tied completely up in 
           practically a straight jacket.  His horse is led by one 
           of the posse members.  Two other men ride behind him with 
           shotguns poised.  Snow continues to lightly fall.

           EXT. MINING CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The snow is falling here, too.  And a different posse is 
           riding through.  Seven of them, bearing a familial 
           resemblance to one another.  They stop in the middle of 
           the road. In their path -

           GRAYTON - atop his horse - bearing a toothy smile.
                                 GRAYTON
                        You got word.

           CECIL (35) is Grayton’s younger brother.  The most 
           bookish of the clan.

                                 CECIL
                        We did indeed.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Good.  
                                 (scanning the group)
                        Is that there Little Billy?

           LITTLE BILLY is 16 years old, already with the cold eyes 
           of a young killer.

                                 CECIL
                        Sure is.

                                 GRAYTON
                        You’s just a sprout last time I sees you.

                                 LITTLE BILLY
                        Ain’t a sprout no more.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Ha.  We’ll see about that.  I don’t 
                        suppose you got your pecker wet yet.

                                 WILLETS COUSIN 1
                        Got two bodies on him.

                                 GRAYTON
                        That right?

                                 LITTLE BILLY
                        I see ‘dem scalps.  Who ‘dey?

           Grayton pulls his Brazilian lawmen scalp necklace and 
           holds it up.

                                 GRAYTON
                        These?  Why these are my four Mexican 
                        wives.  Weren’t none of them agreeable.

           The Willets clan whoops and hollers in delight.  And then 
           they turn and ride.
           EXT. RED LAKE - DAY

           Cal and Patty fish in the lake.  The huge blue lake 
           surrounded by snow and mountains.  Quiet.  Very quiet.

                                 CAL
                        ...I ain’t cut out for any kind of life 
                        on the run.

                                 PATTY
                        Something’s holding you here.

                                 CAL
                        Yeah.  Time to make it work on my terms.  
                                 (beat)
                        But I’d understand if you needa...I’m 
                        saying you can take your share. 

           Patty looks at Cal, appreciative of the offer.

                                 PATTY
                        You trust this clan?

                                 CAL
                        I need the guns for what I got in 
                        mind....  But you got enough...enough to 
                        get started elsewhere if you wanna cut 
                        loose.

                                 PATTY
                        And go where?  Do what?

                                 CAL
                        I dunno.  A trade?

           Patty thinks on it.  He looks out across the still water 
           on the lake and comes across his own rippling reflection.

                                 PATTY
                        This the only trade I’m cut out for.

           Cal nods his head in understanding.  Patty tosses his 
           line into the water.

           INT. RENO JAIL - LATER

           LeMay is locked up.  Solomon walks outside with Big Buck.
           EXT. RENO JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           A few townsfolk are around, including Claire.  Big Buck 
           takes her aside.  She coldly takes the news in the 
           background.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m due at the fort.

                                 TOWNFOLK 1
                        You ain’t heard?

           EXT. DAMAGED FORT GENOA - LATER

           Solomon surveys the damage while soldiers fix the fort.  
           SERGEANT JOHN (26) took upon himself the task overseeing 
           the fort rebuild.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        They just rode on in fast as lighting and 
                        set up cover over the armory.  Stole some 
                        magazines for the Gatling Gun.  We got 
                        one of theirs, but boy, we didn’t expect 
                        this.

                                 SOLOMON
                        How many of ours?

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Six.  Includin’ Ernie.

           INT. SOLOMON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Solomon is drinking whisky and pondering by candlelight.  
           Charlie James enters, accompanied by his large Chinaman.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        May I pour me one of those?

           Solomon glances at the finely dressed Chinaman, who goes 
           to the corner of the room and stands silently.  Solomon 
           pushes the bottle across the table.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I thought it was over.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                                 (sitting)
                        It reminds me of the old days.  Chaos.  
                        Washoe still had fight in ‘em.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE JAMES (CONT'D)
                        Confed’ sympathizers all about.  Miners 
                        trying to organize.  Boy, those were the 
                        days.  Not pretty, but not boring, 
                        neither.  These days, well, there’s only 
                        so much satisfaction a man can get from 
                        making money.

           Charlie James throws down a shot.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What do you want, Charlie James?

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Why...I want to help.  See as much I long 
                        for the old days, that ain’t what’s at 
                        stake...

           Charlie James pours himself another.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        ...cause once you built the dam, the 
                        river don’t exist no more.  When the dam 
                        starts to crack, you gotta patch it and 
                        patch it quick.  

           He holds up the glass to cheers.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Otherwise...it starts cracking all 
                        around...

           Charlie throws down another shot.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        ...and well, then you just needa stand 
                        back and watch the dam break and try’n 
                        keep your own head above water.  Cause 
                        that water’ll wash everything away.

           Solomon pours himself another.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        Rest of them Willets gang - the ones you 
                        didn’t hang - shown up in the camp near 
                        Incline pass yesterday.  And with this 
                        here, Solomon, you’re tore to pieces.  
                        You got what - 40 men?  Only 10 of them 
                        worth a damn.  And that boy...he stole 
                        your biggest gun.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I told you, I’d fix it.
                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        These men ain’t a problem to be fixed.  
                                 (beat)
                        They a force to be stopped.  
                                 (beat)
                        It’ll take a different breed than the 
                        boys you got here to stop ‘em.  Men like 
                        that man you got locked up in town.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Saying I oughtta let him out, pay him to 
                        handle this?

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        If it wern 10 years ago -- might be an 
                        option.  But he’s all tore to pieces, 
                        too.
                                 (beat)
                        There’s a clan from Tennessee - Slocom - 
                        set up in Fallon - a couple days ride 
                        from here.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Slocom’s who marched out front of 
                        Sherman?

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        That’s right.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Murders and killers - you wanna bring 
                        more of them here.  That your answer to 
                        all things?  Murders and killers of 
                        children and women.  

           Solomon rises and grabs his coat.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You can’t fight evil with evil.  You 
                        fight it yourself or you don’t fight it 
                        at all.

           He makes to exit.  Charlie James slams his glass down.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.

           Solomon stops.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        You don’t understand what these kind of 
                        men’ll do.
           Solomon remains at the door, his back to Charlie James.  
           Charlie James remains seated, his back to Solomon.  A 
           reverse stand off.

           Charlie James takes another drink.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        What these kind of men have done.

           Solomon exits.

           EXT. FORT GENOA - STABLE - NIGHT

           Solomon takes the reins of a horse.

           EXT. FORT GENOA - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Solomon rides full speed out into the darkness.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           Solomon barges into the Saloon and heads upstairs.

                                 BARKEEP
                        She’s with a customer.

           Solomon ignores...

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Solomon opens the door.  May, it turns out, isn’t with a 
           customer, but is bent over puking into a bin.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You lied to me.

                                 MAY
                        No, I...

                                 SOLOMON
                        Where is he?

                                 MAY
                        I don’t know.

           He grabs her.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Where is he?
                                 MAY
                        I don’t know.

           He shakes her.  Hard.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Where is he?

                                 MAY
                        I don’t know!  I DON’T WANT TO KNOW!

           He shoves her away too hard.  She falls to the ground.  
           Solomon - ashamed - bites his fist.  She rises from the 
           floor.  Unfazed.  She finds water and rinses her mouth.

                                 MAY
                        What would you done if he was yorn?

                                 SOLOMON
                        If he was my what?

                                 MAY
                        If he was YOUR child?

                                 SOLOMON
                        He murderin’ folks, I’d stop him.

                                 MAY
                        You don’t know it.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Well, I don’t have no children.

                                 MAY
                        Yeah.  You don’t.

           Solomon looks over at the puke bin.  He sees a bottle of 
           whisky and takes a big slug.  He makes to exit and stops 
           at the door.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You outta get some rest and eat an 
                        orange.

           He exits.

           Solomon rides through town.  He sees the jail ahead lit 
           by torches.
           INT. JAIL - NIGHT

           LAWMAN EARL is asleep at the desk.  Solomon enters, 
           waking him up.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Lemme talk to him.  
                                 (beat)
                        Alone.

           LAWMAN EARL rises.  Solomon hands him some cash.  

                                 SOLOMON
                        Get your self something.

           Solomon pulls up a chair in front of LeMay’s cell.  LeMay 
           lies on his back, his hat covering his eyes.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I come to understand...

           LeMay ignores him.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I need to understand what I’m facing.

           LeMay lies still.  He could be asleep.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I know you ain’t asleep.  Man like you 
                        don’t sleep.  C’aint possibly sleep.  
                        What you doing c’aint even set right with 
                        you.

           LeMay continues to lie still.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (making to leave)
                        Shhhiiittt...

                                 LEMAY (O.S.)
                        Did you know your daddy?

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (stopping)
                        What’s that?

                                 LEMAY
                        Did you know your daddy?
                                 SOLOMON
                                 (playing along)
                        Barely.  I was young when he passed.

                                 LEMAY
                        Was he a good man?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Yeah.  He was.

           LeMay stirs.

                                 LEMAY
                        And how d’you know it?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Just did.  

                                 LEMAY
                        And the men you chasing.  They are not 
                        good men.

                                 SOLOMON
                        No they are not.

                                 LEMAY
                        How do you know?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I seen what they done.

           LeMay rises.  His head almost touches the top of the 
           cell.  He comes close to the bars.

                                 LEMAY
                        And you come to ask me why - so you can 
                        understand.
                                 (beat)
                        Knowing why won’t help you stop it.

                                 SOLOMON
                        It will for me.

           Solomon looks at the giant in front of him.  It hadn’t 
           dawned on him before how terrifying this man actually is.  

                                 LEMAY
                        There is no why.  
                                 (beat)
                        They do because of what they are.  
                                 (beat)
                        I do because of what I am.
                                 SOLOMON
                        But you could stop.

                                 LEMAY
                        So could you.  
                                 (beat)
                        And so could they...
                        but they won’t....  
                        And I won’t....  
                        And neither will you...

           LeMay goes back to his bed.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Them children of yorn...you didn’t never 
                        give them any chance...to choose...

                                 LEMAY
                                 (putting his hat back over 
                                 his eyes)
                        Ain’t none of us got any choice.

           EXT. TWO-ONE SALOON - NIGHT

           Solomon rides past the saloon and looks up at May’s 
           window.  The light is on and there are shadows inside 
           moving around.  He slows his horse for a moment.

           He kicks his horse and rides out into the night.

           EXT. FORT GENOA - DAWN 

           Solomon rides into the Fort at dawn.  Men are banging 
           hammers, putting up taller walls and various shields and 
           other protection over windows, etc.

           Sergeant John and a few others are fixing a hearty 
           breakfast in anticipation of a hard day’s labor.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (getting off horse)
                        What’s all this?

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Putting up more protection.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Quit it.  Get the men geared up and ready 
                        for battle.
           Solomon walks off.  The soldiers are given pause by the 
           swift change in direction.  Sergeant John scampers after 
           Solomon....

           AWAY FROM THE MEN

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Solomon.  Sir....  
                                 (catching up)
                        The pass is snowed in.  Reinforcements 
                        going to take weeks if the weather holds.

                                 SOLOMON
                        We’re taking the fight to them...we don’t 
                        got weeks.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        But...they got the gun.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Have the men ready in 3 hours.

           Solomon walks off to the barracks.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Where you going?

                                 SOLOMON
                        To sleep.

           EXT. SHORE OF RED LAKE - DAY 

           A hand runs down the barrels of the Gatling Gun.

                                 GRAYTON (O.S.)
                        Did I tell ya or did I tell ya?

           Cal watches the Willets clan admire the gun.

                                 CECIL
                        If we’da had this yesteryear, you’d be 
                        gov’ner of Texas by now.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Who’d want to be a gov’ner?

                                 WILLETS COUSIN 1
                                 (to Cal)
                        You know how ta use it?

                                 CAL
                        I’m trained.
           The entire group smiles...

           MONTAGE  - THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

           -- A horse drinks from a public water trough near the 
           town entrance of Reno. 

           -- Solomon sleeps heavily. 

           -- May adjusts the trinkets on her shelf, including the 
           Eagle Feather, as a customer exits from behind her.

           -- LeMay watches activity in the jail through bars.

           -- Soldiers fill up sacks of gunpower.

           -- Soldiers clean their rifles and bolts.

           -- Charlie James and his Chinaman hand deliver a written 
           message to a telegraph officer.

           -- Big Buck puts on a pot of coffee

           -- the drinking horse looks up as...

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - NEAR PUBLIC WATER

           Cal, Patty, and the Willets gang ride into town full of 
           anger and bravado.  

           EXT. RENO BANK - DAY

           Civilians on the street recoil in fear as the gang rides 
           up to the bank, obviously on a mission.

           INT. RENO BANK - CONTINUOUS

           The armed gang take over the bank.  Cal holds his big 
           elephant gun.  Patty by his side.

                                 CAL
                        Who’s the banker in charge here!

           They gaze around.  A female Employee points to a middle 
           aged bank president.  He stands.

                                 BANK PRESIDENT
                        I am.
                                 CAL
                                 (to woman)
                        Is he?

           She nods her head.

                                 CAL
                        Is he in charge?  He the boss?  Say it.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        Yes.  He’s the boss.

           Cal blows his head clean off with his gigantic gun.  He 
           points to Patty.

                                 CAL
                        This is the new boss.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           The gang rides through the street towards the jail.  They 
           surround the jail and unveil the Gatling Gun.

           INT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay rests on his cot.  Big Buck sips coffee and reads 
           the newspaper, but it is clear something crazy is going 
           on outside.  Several gunshots from outside the jail.  Big 
           Buck looks over to LeMay...as if for guidance...but LeMay 
           just stares at the ceiling.

           EXT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Big Buck exits the jail to confront the armed gang.  Cal 
           stands in front, the Gatling Gun and the Willets gang at 
           his side.

           INT. LEMAY’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay stirs and sees Cal through a crack in the wood.

                                 CAL
                        You the sheriff?

           EXT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Yes I am.
                                 CAL
                        This here is the law, boys!

           The group of men laugh.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        What do you fellas want?

                                 CAL
                        We’re running the bank now.  The law got 
                        a problem with that?

           Little Billy clicks on the Gatling Gun readying it to 
           fire.  Big Buck measures the situation and sees any 
           position other than total submission = death.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        That the agreement you come to with the 
                        bank?

                                 CAL
                        Sure is.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        I suppose it ain’t my business to intrude 
                        then.

                                 CAL
                        You sure are an intelligent lawman.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Thank you.

                                 CAL
                        Safe to say we’re on the same side, then?

           Cal goes to Big Buck and offers to shake his hand.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        ‘suppose you can say that.  Law’s on 
                        everyone’s side.

           They shake.  Cal walks away, laughing....

                                 CAL
                        I like that!  Law’s on everyone’s side.  
                        Never thought of it that way.

           INT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Big Buck re-enters, still trying to process what just 
           happened.  LeMay is standing alert.
                                 LEMAY
                        Do you know who that was?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Just some new fellas in town. 

                                 LEMAY
                        Where’s Solomon?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Look, Solomon ain’t the law in this town.  
                        I am.  You understand?

                                 LEMAY
                        Where is he?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Hell if I know.  Probably solving some 
                        damn mystery.  You needn’t worry about 
                        Solomon.  Best worry about yourself.  
                        Soon as we hear from those plains folks 
                        and pin them killings on you, I right 
                        suspect you’ll be hanged.

           EXT. FORT GENOA - DAY

           Thirty five soldiers are armed, gathered, and ready to 
           march.  Solomon exits his barracks, fresh and revived 
           from his nap and joins his troops.

           In the distance, Charlie James’ large carriage rides up 
           the road leading to the fort.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                                 (to Solomon)
                        Look who’s here.

           Solomon grabs a horse and canters out to meet Charlie 
           James.

           EXT. ROAD NEAR FORT GENOA - DAY

           The Chinaman halts the Clydesdales.  Solomon rides up to 
           the carriage.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        They’ve taken my bank.  In Reno.

                                 SOLOMON
                        We’re ready to march.
                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        You think you know what you’re doing. 
                                 (beat)
                        And you think it best.  But you outta 
                        leave this, Solomon.  Believe me...those 
                        boys, their day is coming soon.  I’ll see 
                        to it.

                                 SOLOMON
                        It’s come tomorrow.  Take us a day to 
                        march to Reno....  When we arrive.  Now 
                        move this carriage.

           Solomon turns his horse around.

                                  CHARLIE JAMES
                        Solomon!

           Solomon pulls back up to him.

                                 CHARLIE JAMES
                        In the natural world, the intelligent, 
                        the brave, and the righteous all get 
                        eaten by the cunning.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Problem you got Charlie James - you don’t 
                        have any faith.

           Solomon winks and rides off.

           The Chinaman looks to Charlie James for instruction.  He 
           points toward home.  The horses turn and head back away 
           from the fort.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - DAY

           The Willets gang invade the saloon.  They drink and 
           celebrate their newfound control of the town.  None of 
           the other patrons enjoy partying with them.  Cal stares 
           longingly upstairs and sips a whisky without enthusiasm.

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - DAY

           May combs her hair.  She knows damn well what’s going on 
           downstairs and won’t show herself.  Cal enters.

                                 CAL
                        Can I do that for you?
                                 MAY
                        You promised me.

           He goes to help her brush her hair.

                                 MAY
                        I’m finished.

           Cal sits on the bed.

                                 MAY
                        What you gone and done?

                                 CAL
                        I got enough.  Enough money forever.  I 
                        run the bank now.

                                 MAY
                        You don’t understand...

                                 CAL
                        Now you can stop.

                                 MAY
                                 (shaking her head)
                        What have you done?

                                 CAL
                        I told you before.  I ain’t leaving 
                        without you.  Without you stopping this 
                        here.  I seen what them men done to you.  
                        Every night.  All those soldiers and them 
                        bankers.  I seen them.  All sorts of 
                        them.

                                 MAY
                        You HAVE to leave.  You understand?  
                        There are men after you.  Men who...

                                 CAL
                        Men who what?  I ain’t afraid of no man.  
                                 (beat)
                        Why don’t you stop...THIS.  I don’t 
                        understand why you can’t stop.

                                 MAY
                        BECAUSE IT’S WHAT I AM.  
                                 (beat)
                        I tried being a mama, but it’s clear, I 
                        wasn’t no mother to you.  

                                 CAL
                        You was...
                                 MAY
                        I’m a whore, Cal.

                                 CAL
                        Don’t say it.  It ain’t true.  People are 
                        whatever they want to be.  Whatever they 
                        says they is.  And whatever others say of 
                        them.  
                                 (beat)
                        I control what I am.  What I do.  I know 
                        I done bad.  Bad things.  But I done ‘em 
                        to make it better.  To make it better for 
                        you.  And you’ll see, in time, people 
                        won’t remember what was done, just what 
                        is said.  I’ll force them to say what I 
                        want.

                                 MAY
                        The soldiers are coming for you.  And he 
                        won’t ever stop.

                                 CAL
                        Let ‘em come.  Let ‘em all come, all them 
                        soldiers and all them bankers.  I’ll take 
                        care of them all.

                                 MAY
                        What I done wrong with you?

                                 CAL
                        You ain’t a whore.  You a lady.  A proper 
                        lady, fit to be a wife and mother and all 
                        those things you wanted.

           He leaves.

           INT. WOODS OUTSIDE RENO - DAY

           Solomon rides his horse alongside a single-file march of 
           soldiers ready for a fight.  He stops and turns, watching 
           his brave men proudly marching through snow, as the sun 
           is low in the sky.

           INT. JAIL - NIGHT

           One of Big Buck’s cronies is watching LeMay.  LeMay raps 
           the bars of his cage.

                                 CRONY
                        Again?
                                 LEMAY
                        I don’t control nature.

           EXT. JAIL - NIGHT

           The Crony escorts LeMay outside with a light and a gun.  
           LeMay, still handcuffed by his hands and feet, enters the

           OUTHOUSE

           The crony waits.  He plays with his gun, as if he were a 
           gunslinger from the dime novels.  Amusing himself.  

                                 CRONY
                        Hurry up, ain’t got all night.

           He picks at his teeth and ponders his life.  He looks at 
           the outhouse and suddenly realizes something is wrong.  

                                 CRONY
                        I said hurry up in there.

           No response.

           He cocks his gun and walks slowly towards the shitter.  
           Holding the light in front.

                                 CRONY
                        I says HURRY UP.

           No response.

           The crony thrusts open the door.  Empty.  

                                 CRONY
                        Damn.

           The crony runs around, looks behind the outhouse.  
           Nothing.  It’s dark out.  

                                 CRONY
                        Damn.  Damn.  Damn.

           EXT. JAIL - NEAR OUTHOUSE - MORNING

           Dawn.  Big Buck and several lawmen surround the outhouse.

                                 CRONY
                        I seen him go in like he done a dozen 
                        times before.  I’m setting here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CRONY (CONT'D)
                        Just waiting and eventually I check and 
                        nothing.  He wasn’t there no more.

           LAWMAN EARL holds open the outhouse door.

                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        He ain’t in here.

                                 CRONY
                        No shit, Earl.  Goddamn you’re dumb.  
                        Stating the obvious.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Hey now.  Calm down.  Now he’s still got 
                        on his cuffs.  Right?  He got cuffs on 
                        his feet.  How far can he gone?

                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        You didn’t hear him running away?

                                 CRONY
                        Shit Earl.  If I heard him running away 
                        what you suppose I wouldda done?

                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        I don’t know.  Let him escape cause you 
                        were playing with yourself, probably.

                                 CRONY
                        Damn Earl.  You’re really asking for it.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Hey.  What did I say?

                                 CRONY
                        I’m about to punch this man in the face.  
                        I’m real sore right now.

                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        Maybe we should go ask Solomon for help.

                                 BIG BUCK 
                        No.  We’re the law here.  Solomon ain’t 
                        in charge of us.

                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        I’m just saying, he the one who brought 
                        the man in.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        I was in that posse, too.  Lead it, in 
                        fact.  In case you forgot.
                                 LAWMAN EARL
                        Fine then.  What outta we do?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        We spread out and go on looking in a few 
                        mile radius.  Bring shotguns.

                                 CRONY
                        Just leave the jail?

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Hell - what do we need someone here for?  
                        Ain’t no damn prisoners thanks to you.

           The men fan out and start the hunt for LeMay.

           INT. RENO BANK - DAY

           Cal and Patty hang out in the bank president’s office.  
           Cal is melancholy.  A female employee enters and hands 
           Patty a bunch of deposit slips.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        These are yesterday’s deposits.

                                 PATTY
                        What am I supposed to do with them?

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        I dunno.  I gave them to Mr. Dunbar every 
                        day.  Maybe you shouldn’t of kilt him.

                                 PATTY
                        Watch your mouth.

           Cal takes some cash from the pile on the table and hands 
           it to her.

                                 CAL
                        You done a good job.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        It’s not mine.

                                 PATTY
                        Hey - if we give you money - you damn 
                        better take it.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        But that’s deposit money.  That’s money 
                        for folks who leave their money with us.
                                 CAL
                        TAKE THE GODDAMN MONEY.

           The female employee takes the money and exits.  Even 
           Patty is taken aback by the petty outburst.

                                 PATTY
                        Something wrong?

           Cal doesn’t respond.  He steams in his own private 
           headspace.  He walks outside into the bank.  The 
           employees eye him with an unexpected defiance, despite 
           the gun dangling from his hand.

                                 CAL
                        GET BACK TO WORK!

           He exits.

           EXT. RENO BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Cal walks out into the street.  Two Willets cousins 
           accompany him like personal bodyguards.  

           From across the street, atop a building, Solomon watches.  
           Several soldiers accompany him.  Solomon motions to a 
           messenger to alert the rest of the troops.  

           Solomon creeps on the rooftop, following Cal.

           INT. BARN - DAY 

           On the outskirts of town, Cal and his bodyguards enter a 
           barn.  Grayton awaits with his rifle.

                                 GRAYTON
                        They following you?

                                 WILLETS COUSIN 3
                        They coming.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Good.

           He pulls away a plank to reveal a dirt tunnel.  Cal is 
           gloomy and sad-seeming.

                                 GRAYTON
                        You all right?
                                 CAL
                        ‘suppose.

                                 GRAYTON
                        After you, boss.

           Cal goes through the tunnel first, followed by the four 
           Willets.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - DAY

           Little Billy brings food towards the barn.  Two soldiers 
           grab him and pull him down, tie up his mouth and cuff 
           him.  They drag him over to Solomon behind a building.  
           There are 35 armed soldiers ready for battle.

           Solomon removes the cloth from his mouth.

                                 SOLOMON
                        How many are in there?

                                 LITTLE BILLY
                        Send in your men and find out.

                                 SOLOMON
                        How many?

           A soldier pokes down on his testicles with a bayonet.

                                 LITTLE BILLY
                        Don’t.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m not going in blind.  Where’s the gun.

           Little Billy doesn’t budge.  Solomon nods to the soldier - 
           giving him the “go ahead.”

                                 SOLOMON
                        Your seed dies here, kid.

           Little Billy winces.  But he isn’t saying a word.

           The soldier pulls away his bayonet and they drag Little 
           Billy away, testicles intact, as Solomon’s bluff got 
           called.

           EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY

           The door is still open.  The toilet - or rather - a box 
           with a hole in it, lifts up.  
           LeMay emerges from a pile of shit.  His handcuffs 
           clatter.  He walks outside and into the jail.

           INT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           The ivory handled pistol sits on top of the jailers desk.  
           A dirty dishpan on the floor.  LeMay shoulders open the 
           door.

           He unlocks his cuffs with the keys from the wall.  He 
           takes his gun.

           LeMay is free.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - DAY 

           Soldiers quietly move through the streets toward the barn 
           in smaller groups.  Armed.  Taking cover behind buildings 
           and objects.

           The barn is far ahead.

           Solomon is in the lead group with Sergeant John and three 
           other soldiers creeping along.  They pass the TWO-ONE 
           SALOON.

           Solomon looks up at May’s window and gazes for a long 
           moment.  They move past, the inertia of the hunt kicking 
           in.  And then he suddenly stops.

                                 SOLOMON
                                 (to Sergeant John)
                        Get ‘em in position.  I’ll meet you at 
                        the barn.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Where you going?

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - DAY

           Solomon bursts in.  She rises - a bit arrested by the 
           moment.  Solomon stands there in the doorway.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m going after your boy with all I got.

                                 MAY
                        He hadn’t given you much choice, I 
                        suppose.

           He goes to her and takes her hand.
                                 SOLOMON
                        I come here to be straight with you.

                                 MAY
                        You always been straight with me.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’ll do my best to bring him alive.

                                 MAY
                                 (whispers)
                        Okay.

           He lets go of her hand and leaves.

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Solomon arrives and without a moments hesitation, motions 
           for everyone to move forward.

           Soldiers hustle and surround the barn.  Aggressive rifle 
           positions.  Solomon leads a group of ten elite soldiers 
           towards the front door.  He pulls out his pistol.  He’s 
           going in first.

           INT. EMPTY BARN - DAY

           The door slams open.  Solomon leads the charge with his 
           pistol.  The ten men file inside.  Empty.

           Solomon peers up.  Down.  And all around for an ambush 
           from within the barn.  Soldiers run around, fully 
           covering all possible angles.

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        CLEAR.

           Beat.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        CLEAR.

           Solomon suddenly realizes and lowers his gun.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Shit.
           EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - ACROSS FROM THE BARN - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Grayton kicks out a boarded window.  

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The Gatling Gun is pointed down at the Barn and all the 
           soldiers below -- manned by a Willets cousin.  

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Soldiers are mowed down.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Several Willet’s rifleman aim from other angles, 
           encircling the outside soldiers with fire.  

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           The gatling gun rips off more fire.

           EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Soldiers are falling all over the place.  It’s like 
           shooting fish in a barrel.

           INT.  ABANDONED BUILDING - GUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Grayton and Cecil are yelling and hollering.  Grayton 
           fires pop shots out with his pistol.

           Cal stands behind the Gatling Gun, a depressed/bored look 
           on his face, as it continues to rattle...

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>...

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           ...<BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           Solomon and the soldiers hit the deck as the barn is 
           getting completely shot through.  Several men are hit.

           The shooting suddenly stops.
           Solomon’s head peaks up.

                                 SOLOMON
                        They’re reloading.  UP UP UP.  Find 
                        cover!

           Eight solid men are up and running around the barn trying 
           to find shields.  One grabs the plank and picks it up.  
           He sees the tunnel.

                                 SOLDIER 3
                        Solomon!

           Solomon runs over and sees the tunnel.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Quick.  Everyone in.

           The men run and dive into the tunnel.

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Cecil struggles to reload the Gatling Gun.  Grayton fires 
           some pistol shots outside.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Crissake, hurry up Cecil.

                                 CECIL
                        I ain’t expert.

           He pulls the chain of bullets into the chamber.  Cal sees 
           the incompetent fumbling around when he needs to be at 
           game speed.  Cal steps in and quickly loads the gun and 
           chambers a round.

                                 CAL
                        There.

           They start firing away again.  Mostly just at the barn, 
           as all the outside soldiers are dead or escaped.

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           Behind the shooting, Cal grabs his Elephant Gun and loads 
           it up.  He checks his pistols.  He also takes a small 
           sawed off shotgun and puts it around his shoulders.

                                 GRAYTON
                        WHERE YOU GOING?
                                 CAL
                        I GOT SOMETHING TO DO.

           EXT. TUNNEL EXIT (BEHIND THE ABANDONED BUILDING) - DAY

           A soldier pokes his head out of the tunnel head.  A 
           Willet’s cousin - charged with guarding the tunnel exit - 
           sees him and as he is getting out, shoots him in the ear.

           The soldier scrambles up and out of the hole and rolls on 
           the ground to avoid fire.

           TUNNEL EXIT

           Another soldier pops out, gun firing.  

           WILLETS COUSIN 

           fires and hits the first soldier again.  

           SECOND SOLDIER 

           is out of the tunnel running low to the ground and 
           returning fire.

           TUNNEL EXIT

           other Soldiers file out one-by-one and take cover.

           WILLETS COUSIN 

           after firing off a lot of rounds, finally takes one in 
           the chest and falls.

           TUNNEL EXIT

           Solomon emerges last.  The men collect around him.  They 
           are behind the building with the still-firing Gatling 
           Gun. 

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - PUBLIC WATER FOR HORSES - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Shit-covered LeMay walks through the empty streets.  He 
           sees the public water for horses. 
           INT. MAY’S ROOM

           May sits by the window listening to the gunfire in the 
           distance.  Cal barges in with his weaponry.

                                 CAL
                        You don’t think of me as a son.

           May - surprised by Cal’s arrival - looks over at him 
           blankly.

                                 CAL
                        Do you?  You think of me as something 
                        else.

           She doesn’t respond.

                                 CAL
                        We’ll live as husband and wife.  You 
                        hear?  I’ll marry you and you won’t whore 
                        no more and no one will be able to say 
                        anything about it.

           She stands and walks slowly over to him.  He stands 
           defiant.  She punches him hard in the face with her nub.

           He takes the blow.  She stares at him with hatred.

                                 CAL
                        Don’t look at me like that.

                                 MAY
                        Your daddy won’t approve.

                                 CAL
                        My daddy?

                                 MAY
                        He who done this.

           She holds up her nub.

                                 CAL
                        My daddy is here?

                                 MAY
                        That’s right.  And he’s the worst killer 
                        in all the land...
           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - PUBLIC WATER - DAY

           A reflected image of LeMay’s bandaged face in the water.  
           He dips his hand in, disrupting the image. 

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        The worst man I ever seen.  Any of us 
                        seen.

           The bandage around his face is coming undone.

           His hands clean his worn black boots.  His spurs.  We see 
           the Ivory handled pistol.

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        He sired children all across the land 
                        with all of us whores...

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - PUBLIC WATER - DAY

           LeMay, just a speck in the corner of the town, peaceably 
           bent over cleaning himself.

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        And reminded us all - of what we are -

           EXT. PUBLIC WATER - DAY

           LeMay rises, back of his head to us. 

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        And that one day he would return.  

           LeMay removes the bandage slowly from his head, revealing 
           his wispy grey speckled hair, as May speaks.

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        Now he has.  Returned to wipe his mark 
                        from the earth.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - DAY

           It is surprisingly quiet in the middle of town.

           Cal walks down the street.  He fires off a big Elephant 
           Gun shot in the air.  He reloads.  A few folks come 
           outside and pay attention.
                                 CAL
                        Listen up.  Anyone see a stranger come to 
                        town looking for me.  Some scary killer.  
                        You tell him I’m here, calling out his 
                        name.  Calling and telling the whole 
                        world where I am.  Tell him his son is 
                        ready for him.

           Solomon leads the six remaining soldiers up the stairs.

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - GUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Gatling Gun is out of bullets again and Cecil tries 
           to reload.  Grayton picks up his shotgun.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Think I’ll head down there to clean up 
                        the scraps.

           The door kicks open and five rifles are in their faces.  
           And Solomon’s pistol.

                                 GRAYTON
                        Some bitch.

                                 SOLOMON
                        My name is Solomon.  That’s my gun.

                        I’m Cecil.

           Cecil fingers a gun in his pants.  Grayton holds his 
           shotgun.

                                 GRAYTON
                        We’re from Texas.

           They both go for their guns...

           <BOOM>  It’s a slow motion volley from the soldiers and 
           it blows Grayton, Cecil, and their cousin straight to 
           hell.
           EXT. BARN AND ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

           Solomon and his men are regrouped.  Other soldiers come 
           out from the woodwork.  The good ones.  The ones that 
           survived.  Sixteen in total.  Enough to finish the job.  
           Dirt covered and determined like we haven’t seen.

           EXT. RENO BANK - DAY

           The soldiers march through the streets.  Armed.  
           Confident.  Led by Solomon.  

           The four remaining Willet’s cousins stand guard at the 
           bank.  They see the soldiers.

           INT. BANK PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

           Willets Cousin 3 runs into the office.

                                 WILLETS COUSIN 3
                        Soldiers coming.

           Patty pulls his guns and goes outside.  

           EXT. RENO BANK - DAY 

           The Willets are looking a bit scared.

                                 PATTY
                        Listen up boys.  They’s going to kill us 
                        all or throw us in jail for a long time.  
                        Our only chance is to stick together and 
                        fight it out.

           He takes a rifle from a cousin, points and fires at the 
           soldiers.  The soldiers stay in formation and head 
           towards them.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           Solomon, full of determination, leads the charge.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Stay this path.

           Suddenly a huge shot takes out a soldier in the middle of 
           the pack.  The Elephant Gun.  Cal.
           Solomon looks up and Cal is atop a roof ambushing them.

           EXT. RENO BANK - DAY

                                 PATTY
                        It’s Cal!  Saddle up boys.

           The Willets, now filled with confidence, start firing 
           away at the soldiers.  Walking towards them, spread out.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           The soldiers are now in a tough spot.  Flanked by one 
           gun.   Facing a small group of men to their front.   

                                 SOLOMON
                        Split it up.  Formation!

           Eight men split off and form a phalanx.  They aim up at 
           the roof and prepare to fire a volley.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Fire!

           The roof is torn by the volley, but Cal is under cover.  
           He returns another Elephant shot and kills another 
           soldier on the end.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Re-load.

           The other group of men break off and return fire towards 
           the group of Willets and Patty - now firing off pistol 
           shots.  They hit two Willets.  Their rifles are superior - 
           more accurate - longer range.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Cal re-loads his gun.  He tries to get off another shot, 
           but is met with another huge volley and can’t even poke 
           his head over the roof.

                                 SOLOMON (O.S.)
                        Re-load!

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           The soldiers quickly and efficiently reload.  And stand 
           ready.  Cal is dead if his head pokes over the wall.
           Patty is out of ammo.  All the Willets, but one, are 
           dead.  They are facing a wall of eight soldiers, armed, 
           rifles pointed at them.  Patty shakes his head and tosses 
           his gun on the ground.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You boys are done.  Cal!  Come on down.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Cal twitches and sniffles.  Unsure what is in store.

                                 CAL
                        The hell with you, Solomon.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           The men are pinned.  Suddenly three horses ride up.  Big 
           Buck leading the group.  Rifles out.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Solomon - what in gods name do you think 
                        you’re doing?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Better ask yourself that question.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        We’re the law here.  You can’t go 
                        shooting up civilians in this town.

                                 SOLOMON
                        These men ARE NOT civilians.  They stole 
                        our gun, murdered a slew of men, women 
                        and children.  If you were any type of 
                        lawman you’da handled it yourself.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Damn you Solomon.  I’m sick of hearing 
                        about you...

           <BOOM>  Solomon’s head is suddenly blown apart.  Cal 
           stands atop the roof, triumphant.

           INT. MAY’S ROOM

           May sits up quickly from bed.  She senses something awful 
           has happened.

           RETURN TO SCENE
           Everything slows down.  The men are in complete and total 
           shock.  The soldiers don’t know what to do.  One soldier 
           looks at Solomon’s headless body and instantly begins 
           weeping.  Everyone, Cal included, is frozen stiff.  
           Frozen solid.  Except the one weeping soldier.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Jesus Christ!  Everyone just stop.  I’m 
                        the law here.  Stop.  No more firing 
                        guns.  No more violence.  Stop, ya hear!

           No one moves for a long moment.  Until finally, from 
           behind Big Buck, in the distance, at the other end of 
           town, a dark figure walks towards them.

           All the men turn and look.  Big Buck is the last to 
           notice and finally, even he turns.

           You know goddamn well who it is:

           LeMay.  With his ivory handled pistol.  Black boots and 
           spurs jangling.  Bandage removed and face half-scabbed 
           over like a grotesque leper.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Oh hell.

           /CHAOS/  

           Patty drops quickly to the ground, picks up his gun and 
           reloads.  

           The last of the Willets shoots a soldier.  The soldiers 
           don’t wait for orders and fire a volley and kill the 
           cousin.  

           BIG BUCK 

           fumbles and drops his gun.  

           LAWMAN EARL

           stupidly points his rifle at the soldiers.  The soldiers 
           reload and kill Lawman Earl.  

           BIG BUCK’S CRONY

           shoots and kills one soldier.

           CAL

           runs.  A volley goes up at him, but misses.  
           A GROUP OF SOLDIERS 

           take off running in pursuit.

           REMAINING SOLDIERS 

           kill Buck’s Crony.  

           PATTY

           downs two soldiers, before getting killed himself. 

           BIG BUCK

           stands in the middle, a hopeless impotent.

           FOUR SOLDIERS - including Sergeant John 

           remain in the street.  They reload and are the last men 
           standing.

           OTHER SOLDIERS 

           chase Cal.  

           LEMAY walks steadily.  Heading right at the four 
           remaining soldiers.

           FOUR SOLDIERS 

           finish reloading.  They get in formation and aim their 
           guns.  LeMay walks straight up to them, within close 
           range.

                                 SERGEANT JOHN
                        Stop right there, fella.  You’re in our 
                        sights.  Get ridda that gun.

           LEMAY 

           halts.  He pulls his Ivory Handled Pistol slowly as if to 
           drop it and quickly rips four shots right across at the 
           four soldiers.  So quick, not a single one gets a shot 
           off.  So fast, we can hardly believe it.  The four 
           soldiers collapse onto the ground.

                                 BIG BUCK
                        Holy Christ.

           LeMay reloads as he walks past Big Buck.  He stops and 
           looks at -
           SOLOMON’S CORPSE.  He stares at it a beat and a twinge of 
           sadness comes over LeMay.  

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        NOOOOOOOO.

           END OF STREET

           May holds her hand and nub to her face as she sees 
           Solomon laying dead on the ground.

                                 MAY
                        NOOOOOO.

           She is weeping and runs to the corpse.

                                 MAY
                        No. No. No. No. No. No.

           Big Buck tries to man up and say something tough to 
           LeMay, but can’t.  LeMay ignores him.

           He puts a final bullet into his revolver and rocks it 
           back into place.  He walks...

           EXT. ALLEY BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS

           LeMay walks aggressively, looking for Cal.  A soldier 
           comes round the corner with a rifle.  LeMay shoots him 
           dead.  Two more.  He shoots them dead.

           EXT. BUILDING - DAY

           Cal jumps down off the roof.  He sees the group of 
           soldiers coming on him.  He takes one out with the 
           Elephant Gun.  And runs away, dropping the gun.  It’s 
           down to five soldiers.

                                 SOLDIER 3
                        Is this worth it?

                                 SOLDIER 4
                        Sonofabitch killed Solomon.

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM> 

           Three soldiers fall.  Shot in the back by --

           LEMAY
           The two remaining soldiers take off running.  LeMay walks 
           past them scurrying away and follows Cal.

           EXT. BANK - DAY

           Cal stops and sees the fleeing soldiers.  LeMay is 
           walking towards him.  

                                 CAL
                        IT’S YOU?  YOU’S HIM?

           Cal takes a hold of his shotgun.  He notices his own 
           hands shaking.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - DAY

           LeMay fires three shots and plucks Cal in the arm.  Cal 
           scrambles away and takes cover.  He stops in the street 
           and reloads.

           Cal fires a shotgun blast and it kicks up dirt near 
           LeMay.  

           ON CAL

           Scared shitless, he tries to reload.  He turns and runs. 
           Clumsily carrying the shotgun.

           LEMAY

           Calm, cool.  Walks after Cal.  Tracking down his progeny.  
           The last one.  The worst one.

           CAL

           Stumbling and running in alleys, between buildings, 
           unsure, unconfident, confused, lonely, scared.  A random 
           woman stands petrified by all the violence.  Cal grabs 
           her and drags her out into the street as a hostage and a 
           shield.  He points the shotgun and walks backwards.  
           Towards where?  He doesn’t know.  Just away.

           The woman gets shot in the head and collapses.  She falls 
           out of Cal’s arms.  Cal looks in horror and confusion.

           Who the fuck did he think he was dealing with?

           LEMAY

           Seeing Cal.  Pointing his ivory handled pistol.
           Cal drops his shotgun in the street.

                                 CAL
                        I give up.

           LeMay walks towards him.  Cal walks backwards, still 
           trying to get away.

                                 CAL
                        I ain’t done nothing wrong.  I’m 
                        innocent.

           LeMay smiles at the sheer absurdity of his claim.

           And that’s all it takes, Cal whips out a pistol and 
           shoots the hand of LeMay and the Ivory Handled Pistol 
           falls to the dirt.

           Cal unloads his full magazine across LeMay’s chest.  He 
           falls.

           Beat.

                                 CAL
                        You ain’t no good.

           He picks up his shotgun and notices snow beginning to 
           fall.  A lot of it.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           May walks, still crying, clutching the EAGLE FEATHER from 
           Solomon’s hat.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - DAY

           Empty.  May enters.  She walks through the saloon.  

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She enters.  Cal is sitting on a chair.  Legs crossed.  
           Hat on his head.  Powerful.

           She turns from him and places the EAGLE FEATHER on her 
           mantle next to the other one.  She softly touches it.

                                 CAL
                        I kilt him.
           She ignores.  Cal is different now.  Calmer.  More 
           composed.  More frightening.

                                 CAL
                        All of ‘em.  My daddy, the soldier...all 
                        of them.

           Her eyes well.

                                 CAL
                        Did you love him?

           She shakes her head no.  He’s talking about his father, 
           but she’s thinking of Solomon.  And she can’t help but 
           cry a little bit more.  It isn’t so much that she loved 
           him - she did - but a more existential loss - the loss of 
           all good in the world.  Of all hope.

                                 CAL
                        Well, he dead.  And I’ve decided to make 
                        you my wife.

           He stands and drops his belt (with his gun on it). 

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - CONTINUOUS

           Snow falling hard.  The storm finally coming in.  The 
           snow falls on LeMay.  Over his mouth.  He spits it off 
           his lips.  And he rises from the dead.  Impossible?  
           Yeah, he took the shots in the chest.  But this is LeMay.  
           He pulls a round out of his chest.  He limps forward.  He 
           is dying.  But he goes toward the saloon.  He ain’t 
           finished yet.

           INT. MAY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cal leans into May’s neck and smells.  She is frozen like 
           a dead fish.

           A GUNSHOT INSIDE THE BAR.  

           Cal jerks to attention.  He scrambles to the door to peek 
           out.

           <BOOM> A gunshot outside the door.  Cal runs back inside.

                                 CAL
                        It’s HIM!

           He looks at his mom pleadingly.
                                 MAY
                        Your father.

                                 CAL
                        Can you stop him?

                                 MAY
                        No.

           Cal gulps.  Even though he bested him earlier, he is damn 
           terrified of his father.  He takes his shotgun, checking 
           to see if it’s full of shells.

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - DAY

           LeMay at the bottom of the stairs.  Ivory Handled pistol 
           leading the way.

           LeMay takes the stairs.

           <BOOM>

           A shotgun blast.  LeMay takes cover.

                                 CAL
                                 (from upstairs)
                        Why can’t you just leave me be?

           <BOOM> Another shotgun blast.

                                 CAL
                        What I ever done to you?

                                 LEMAY
                        You was born.

           CAL

           wipes away a tear.  This idea hurts him.

                                 CAL
                        You’re my daddy.  ‘supposed to love me.

                                 LEMAY
                        I’m not capable of love.  Neither is you.  
                        Should know that by now.

                                 CAL
                        I am!  I am capable of love.  You don’t 
                        know.
                                 LEMAY
                        You ever been with a woman?

                                 CAL
                        Not yet.  Not yet I ain’t.  But soon’s I 
                        kill you, I’m taking one.  The one I 
                        love.

           Cal fires another shotgun blast.

                                 LEMAY
                        This seed ends here.  Ends today.

                                 CAL
                        Seed?

                                 LEMAY
                        Our seed.  
                                 (beat)
                        Boy you’re the last one of all my 
                        children.  I killed all your brothers and 
                        sisters - from all around this country.  

           LeMay starts firing his gun as he walks/limps up the 
           stairs.  Giving his monologue as he goes.

                                 LEMAY
                        A bunch of damn evil souls.  Evil eggs 
                        ready to hatch.  Most men go and spread 
                        themselves.  

           <BOOM>  Right where Cal is hiding.

                                 LEMAY
                        Teach their children what their daddies 
                        taught them.  Virtue.  Honor.  Teach 
                        their sons to be gentlemen.  Their 
                        daughters to be ladies.  

           <BOOM>  Gaining confidence in his aim, in his words.

                                 LEMAY
                        Teach them to be good. 
                                 (beat)
                        We ain’t those people.  

           <BOOM>

                                 LEMAY
                        My daddy was the meanest, saddest bastard 
                        ever lived on this planet.  He kilt men.  
                        Stole from men.  He didn’t do nothing for 
                        me, but give me his evil blood.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEMAY (CONT'D)
                        And I ain’t done nothing with that blood 
                        but gone on and done the same damn thing.  
                        Same as you.  But all this ends now.

           LEMAY

           Confident.  Bold.  Broad chested.  He is going to kill 
           this godforsaken devil.  

           <BOOM><BOOM>

           He turns the corner and <BOOM>

           Cal isn’t there.

           LeMay turns and takes a big shotgun blast to the chest 
           and flies backwards off the landing down into the bar, 
           crashing tables and everything.  Cal stands atop the 
           stairs.  The winner.  

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Cal goes down to his father.  He stares at him coldly.

                                 LEMAY
                        I once dreamed my own kin would kill me.

           Cal points his shotgun at LeMay’s face.

                                 CAL
                        Your dream come true.

           <BOOM>

           He decapitates his father with the shotgun.

           Cal drops the gun.  Wipes his nose.  No longer scared of 
           his daddy.  He spits on his body.  He sees something on 
           the ground and picks it up:

           THE IVORY HANDLED PISTOL.

           <BOOM><BOOM>  

           Two shots through his chest.  He turns.

                                 CAL
                        Ma?

           MAY 

           holding Cal’s old gun.
                                 MAY
                        This is for Solomon.

           <BOOM><BOOM><BOOM>

           He is dead.  

           MAY’S ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

           She enters, crying softly.  She reveals her naked belly 
           and touches it gently.

                                 MAY
                                 (whispering to her child)
                        I’ll do better this time.

           She holds her belly.

                                 MAY
                        Because you’re gonna know...

           INT. TWO-ONE SALOON - CONTINUOUS

           The dead bodies of LeMay and Cal are splayed out.  Next 
           to one another.  Father and Son.

           EXT. STREETS OF RENO - DAY

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        You’re always gonna know...

           Snows falls over the dead bodies everywhere.  Soldiers.  
           Willets.  Lawmen.  The snow is falling hard.

           An armed group of terrifying men ride into town amidst 
           the calm of the destruction.  These are the Slocoms - the 
           men summoned by Charlie James.

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                        Your daddy was good.

           The credits begin to roll...

           THE END
