           INT. INTERROGATION DEPT. - DAY (PRESENT TIME)

           In the halls of the CHILD ALLOCATION BUREAU (C.A.B.) we PAN 
           ACROSS a line of melancholic CHILDREN that stretches through 
           a sterile white corridor. The line bends around a corner, 
           filtering into a REGISTRATION ROOM just as...

           TERRENCE SETTMAN, mid-30’s, attractive but under duress, 
           steps in front of a white wall. 

                                 AGENT (O.S.)
                        State your name. 

                                 TERRENCE 
                        Terrence Settman. 

           A camera emits a blinding FLASH. 

           INT. INTERROGATION HALLWAY - DAY

           We TRACK BEHIND Terrence, escorted by AGENT 63, mid-50’s, 
           stocky, hardened by three decades of exhausting Bureau 
           service. 63 dabs a FRESH GASH below his eye with a SWAB. 

           They pass rows of eerily austere glass BOOTHS, in which 
           fearful children are being questioned by stern Bureau Agents. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER 

           Seated behind a sparse white desk, Agent 63 slides his TABLET 
           (the hi-tech computer du jour) into a docking bay. Opposite 
           him, Terrence sits on a solitary chair, anxious, fatigued.

           63 studies Terrence, in awe. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        Clearly there are no bounds to what your 
                        kind will endure in an effort to live 
                        among us. 
                          (beat)
                        Tell me, Mr. Settman, how were you able 
                        to operate under our radar for so long? 

                                 TERRENCE
                        How far back would you like me to go?

                                 AGENT 63
                        As far as your memory allows...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Going back in time, we RISE ABOVE a throbbing mass of 
           pedestrians, above a multi-tiered sidewalk and street to 
           reveal a metropolis flooded with hi-rises, human and 
           automotive traffic stretching far beyond the dark horizon. 

           Our fears of overpopulation have been realized.

           INT./EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 

           KAREN SETTMAN, late-20’s, strikingly gorgeous, poised and 
           refined, a consummate architect, ascends a half-finished 
           ultra-modern sky-scraper, accompanied by her ruggedly 
           attractive husband, TERRENCE SR., 20’s.

           Traversing treacherous scaffolding, Karen and Terrence Sr. 
           arrive at a look-out. Peering down from dizzying heights, 
           Karen is moved by the majesty of her grand design.

                                 TERRENCE SR. 
                        Is it what you envisioned, my love?

                                 KAREN
                        Feeling the placement on this site, the 
                        way those towers seem to caress us with 
                        their reflections...it’s too breathtaking 
                        to be ignored. Is it what I envisioned? 
                        It’s far bigger than either of us, 
                        Terrence. 

           Karen and her husband share a glance, their chemistry primal.

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME) 

           Terrence shifts in his seat as he recounts his tale for an 
           entranced but skeptical Agent 63...

                                 TERRENCE 
                        We were made the old-fashioned way...

           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ABANDONED FLOOR - DAY 

           The overdeveloped city-scape looms. Propped atop scaffolding, 
           a half-undressed Karen ecstatically rides Terrence Sr. 

                                 TERRENCE (V.O.)
                        ...in a primal act of love and pure 
                        intention. 

           CLOSE ON a PALM FROND TATTOO on Terrence Sr.’s neck. 

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

           The Palm Frond on a sign: SIBLINGS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE! 

           We PULL BACK to reveal that Terrence Sr. is leading a MARCH 
           of thousands of PROTESTORS outside a DISTRICT CAPITOL 
           BUILDING, surrounded by hundreds of armed SOLDIERS. 

                                 TERRENCE SR.
                          (leading a chant)
                        Only children are lonely children!

           Displayed on the wall of an adjacent office building is LIVE 
           FOOTAGE of a SUPREME COURT HEARING- the CHIEF JUSTICE 
           silences the court to deliver the majority decision...

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE
                        In consideration of the dearth of 
                        resources necessary to sustain a rapidly 
                        growing populace, and in accordance with 
                        similarly outlined legislation being 
                        passed the world over, this court deems 
                        constitutional the Child Allocation Act.

           Appalled, the protestors erupt in heated dissent. 

           Just then, the court entrance opens to allow passage for a 
           procession of skittish POLITICIANS, BUSINESSMEN and MEDIA. As 
           the crowd momentarily clears, we’re afforded a view of...

           NICHOLAS CAYMAN, 30’s, a regal presence, newly enacted 
           DIRECTOR of the Child Allocation Bureau. He surveys the human 
           mass below while commenting for an accompanying JOURNALIST... 

                                 CAYMAN
                        The decision was ultimately made in the 
                        interest of national security. Beyond 
                        obvious issues of scarcity, our 
                        overpopulated districts have become petri 
                        dishes- breeding grounds for a slew of 
                        bugs to run rampant. If we don’t curb our 
                        growth, disease could turn pandemic.  

           A PHOTOGRAPHER approaches Cayman as he has a private word 
           with SENATOR JOHN CHERMACK, 30’s, lanky. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Mr. Cayman, can I get a shot of you with 
                        Senator Chermack?

           Cayman places a friendly arm around Senator Chermack’s
           shoulder. The camera FLASHES. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Under police escort, the parade of politicians descends into 
           the crowd, inciting the mob. 

           Terrence Sr. leads the protestors over barricades to charge 
           the capitol building. The SOLDIERS relinquish their posts and 
           begin firing MRP’s (non-lethal, Muscle-Relaxing Pulses). A 
           PULSE of blue energy strikes Terrence Sr. in the leg. He 
           buckles to the ground and the horde of frantic protestors 
           trample him. 

                                 TERRENCE (V.O.)
                        Like the Marrakech resistance movement, 
                        our father’s days were short-lived. 

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY 

           There are PLOTS as far as the eye can see, the TOMBSTONES 
           stacked in towers, lined up woefully close to one another.

           In tears, Karen stands alone before Terrence Sr.’s crowded 
           tomb. Suddenly she hunches over, clutching her stomach. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME) 

                                 TERRENCE
                        Our mother used to tell us that the best 
                        gifts come in the form of the unexpected. 
                        And whether you embrace them or reject 
                        them, real gifts can never be returned.

           INT. CLINIC - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 

           Wearing a hospital gown, Karen reclines on an exam table.

           DOCTOR JENNINGS, late-50’s, Karen’s closest friend and 
           personal physician, squirts a layer of cool gel over Karen’s 
           bare abdomen. She places a pliable SHELL on top.

                                 DOCTOR JENNINGS
                        Let’s see what we have...

           Clearly displayed on a sophisticated MONITOR is a cluster of 
           SEVEN FETUSES floating side-by-side in amniotic fluid. 

           Karen and Dr. Jennings are speechless, in shared disbelief. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh, Terrence...

                                 DOCTOR JENNINGS 
                        Have you been taking fertility 
                        medication?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Karen hesitates, her brow furrowing with guilt... 

                                 KAREN
                        I know they’ve been banned but we tried 
                        for years without any luck. 

           Dr. Jennings fills a glass of water at the sink and downs it.

                                 DOCTOR JENNINGS
                        I don’t want to say it, but I have to. 
                        Our options are...you don’t have any 
                        options.  

           Karen looks incredulous. 

                                 DOCTOR JENNINGS (CONT'D)
                        The law says we have to terminate six of 
                        the fetuses...or abort the pregnancy 
                        altogether. 

           HOLD ON Karen, malcontent with the choices presented...

                                 KAREN
                        What if I chose neither?

                        As one of the city’s premier freelance 
                        architects our mother believed first and 
                        foremost that nothing was absolute, that 
                        the best results came from the bending of 
                        rules and the questioning of facts. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - NIGHT 

           Karen runs her hand over the smooth face of an antique 
           GRANDFATHER CLOCK, a lone relic of simpler times. The SECOND 
           HAND of the clock hammers past each Roman numeral. 

           Karen drags the clock to the center of her exquisite loft-
           style abode, adding it to an assemblage of moved furniture. 

           She pries open a crate, exposing a four-foot metal CUBE. From 
           her TABLET, she uploads a 3D-model of the unit into the cube. 

           TIME LAPSE: the cube separates into various robotic 
           components, each ‘walking’ off to- demolish & build walls, 
           drill, paint, sand, solder wires, construct shelves, 
           reassembling into the original cube at job’s end.

           SEVEN MONTHS LATER...seated at her drafting table, stomach 
           bulging, Karen tweaks blueprints for a SHOPPING COMPLEX. 
           Suddenly she feels a CONTRACTION. She rises, falters...

                                                             PAN ACROSS:

           SEVEN IDENTICAL BABIES lined up on a bed beside Karen, who 
           regards her offspring teary-eyed. Dr. Jennings approaches...

                                 DOCTOR JENNINGS 
                        Have you given thought to their names?

                                 KAREN
                        I want to name them Terrence.

                                 TERRENCE
                        In the early years, with only the most 
                        basic of needs, our duplicate names 
                        didn’t present much of an issue...

           SERIES OF SHOTS - TIME LAPSE

           Like an assembly line worker, Karen changes each of the seven 
           ONE-YEAR-OLD TERRENCES’ diapers on an elongated changing 
           station, pulls a nighty over each of their heads, inserts a 
           pacifier into each mouth, and sets each boy in his crib slot.

                                 KAREN
                        This little Terrence went to the market. 
                        This little Terrence stayed home. This 
                        little Terrence ate dim sum and this 
                        little Terrence ate none. And this little 
                        Terrence cried wee wee wee all the way 
                        home.

           Seated at desks arranged in semi-circle formation, seven 
           SEVEN-YEAR-OLD Settman siblings take notes as Karen writes 
           MATH EQUATIONS on a digital dry-erase board. 

           Two of the boys raise their hands. She points to one.

                                 KAREN
                        Yes, Terrence.

                        You, Terrence.

                        Oh. I got x equals eleven.

                                 KAREN
                        Right you are. Does everyone understand 
                        how Terrence got that?

                                 TERRENCE #3
                        No. How can a letter equal a number?

           Suddenly, Karen’s face drops, her attention drawn to a 
           MONITOR across the room...

                                 TERRENCE #4
                        What’s wrong, Mom?

           Karen nears the monitor, her children eagerly surrounding as 
           they watch a surveillance feed from outside- 

           A sleek WHITE POD is parked at the curb. (A pod is a slender 
           multi-passenger vehicle propelled by a polarized track 
           affixed to every city street.)

           Four white-suit wearing BUREAU AGENTS swiftly exit the pod. 

           Drawing stares from the dense crowd, the agents storm into 
           the apartment building, one sandwiched between countless...

                        places like we’ve practiced! Chop chop!

           We finally REVEAL the transformed unit...

           The Media Room is decked out with an amalgam of cutting edge 
           TECH TOYS- monitors, multimedia consoles, workout equipment.  

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Karen presses buttons on a CONTROL PANEL: six BUNK BEDS built 
           into the bedroom walls fold in, leaving a single bed out in 
           the open. 

           The Settman siblings slide down a pole, climb ladders, and 
           descend a chute on their speedy exodus downstairs. 

           One by one they enter a floor tunnel, a kitchen cabinet, the 
           hollowed out couch...

           One of the boys remains stationary, out in the open on the 
           couch, as the last brothers disappear into hiding.

           INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Agent 63, three decades younger, face unscathed, leads the 
           silent raid, signalling to three other Bureau agents with a 
           series of hand signals. The agents draw weapons, non-lethal 
           technology beyond our time. 

           INT. APARTMENT HALLLWAY 

           We TRACK BEHIND the agents as they clamber through the hall, 
           their footsteps a well-orchestrated show of synchronicity. 

           INT. SETTMAN HIDING SPOTS 

           In their dark sanctuaries, the Settman boys tremble in fear. 
           They listen to the encroaching FOOTSTEPS of the agents echo 
           through the hallway. Claustrophobic, crying...

                                 TERRENCE #6
                        I don’t like this...

           FOYER 

           The agents’ footsteps cease. Karen peers out the peephole. 
           From her FISH-EYED POV- Agent 63 eyes their door, suspicious. 

           Fearful, Karen peels away from the door, holds her breath. 

                                 KAREN
                        Brace yourselves. 

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY 

           Agent 63 tears a SILVER PATCH in three and affixes its now 
           sizzling metallic fibers around a door, instantly corroding 
           the frame and wall. 63 kicks in the door!
           INT. SETTMAN UNIT 

           The Settman front door remains intact. Karen drops to her 
           knees, grateful, sobbing. 

           LATER...the Settmans watch a surveillance MONITOR- their 
           hysterical NEIGHBORS trail the agents, who have apprehended 
           their four-year-old sibling- a GIRL IN A FLORAL DRESS.

                                 TERRENCE (V.O.)
                        Who would have thought that a family just 
                        down the hall from ours was living the 
                        same lie... 

                                 TERRENCE #7
                        Mom, what’s gonna happen if the Bureau 
                        finds out there are seven of us?

           The others chime in with ad-libbed pleas for an answer.

                                 KAREN
                        I suppose it’s time.

           EXT. PROCESSING CENTER - DAY

           A double-decker bullet train arrives in front of a massive 
           facility: an unmarked, gated edifice. 

           We RISE ABOVE dense smog to the top of a needle-like TOWER, 
           which peers over the land as if to proclaim ‘we see all’.

                        Our mother had a gift for simplifying the

                        explained to us that...

           Karen explains to her enraptured children...

                                 KAREN
                        The world has become too crowded, my 
                        loves. The year you were born our leaders 
                        scared us into accepting rules that 
                        forbid families from having more than one 
                        child. 
           EXT. PROCESSING CENTER

           The train’s freight doors slide open and the recent arrivals 
           disembark, the GIRL IN THE FLORAL DRESS among them. There is 
           not a sibling above the age of ten.

                                 KAREN (V.O.) 
                        Any children born beyond the allowable 
                        only child were called siblings. 

           Single file lines of hundreds of siblings make their way 
           through the gate, kept in order by masked, armed GUARDS.

                        Bureau had been created to find these 
                        siblings... 

           The parallel lines of siblings each lead into a...

           PROCESSING ROOM 

           The Girl in the Floral Dress approaches a PROCESSOR who is 
           seated beside a counter stacked with METAL CARTRIDGES.

                                 TERRENCE (V.O.)
                        ...and those who were caught were never 
                        seen or heard from again.

                                 GIRL
                        Does it hurt?

                                 PROCESSOR
                        No.

           He inserts a cartridge into an INJECTOR and pokes the girl’s 
           arm with the needle. She SQUEALS and collapses.

           Karen snugly tucks each frightened Terrence into his bunk.

           The seven hyper boys take their seats for class. Standing 
           before them, Karen SHUSHES them.

                        My little Terrences, I didn’t sleep a 
                        wink last night thinking about what 
                        happened. I’ve realized I’m causing more 
                        harm than good keeping you cooped up in 
                        this unit. The world may be dangerous and 
                        it may be flawed, but it’s still our 
                        world and you must experience it.

                        You know I’d never suggest anything that 
                        might get you into trouble, my loves.

                                 TERRENCE (V.O.)
                        What our mother proposed changed the 
                        world as we knew it. 

                                 KAREN 
                        Starting this instant, I no longer wish 
                        to hear you calling each other Terrence. 
                        Line up. Chop chop. 

           PAN ACROSS the lined up Settman seven, each wearing a unique 
           expression and outfit.

           Karen escorts Thursday down the front steps.

           Terrified and ecstatic, he experiences the outside world for 
           the very first time- pods speed past, the tops of high-rise 
           apartments disappear into grey cloud cover, a pair of mangy 
           pigeons perch on a lamp post. 

           Thursday is mesmerized by a dense swarm of pedestrians that 
           continually swims past as they arrive at an elongated yellow 
           SCHOOL BUS POD, opening its doors. Karen kneels, whispers...

           Karen kisses her son’s head and he steps inside. She has 
           trouble letting go of his hand, but does. Karen watches as 
           the pod hums away, swallowed by an ocean of traffic.

           the minute & hour hands onto the XII. BELLS chime. MIDNIGHT.

                        Was it worth risking your brothers’ lives 
                        for fleeting pleasure?! 
                          (off Saturday’s head shake)
                        I know it’s difficult to ignore your 
                        hormonal instincts, my loves, but we must 
                        all make sacrifices for this to work. One 
                        day you will realize that even a fraction 
                        of a life is better than none at all.

                          (tearing up)
                        I’m so sorry, Mom. I’m sorry everyone.

                                 MONDAY
                        Sorry doesn’t cut it. Your selfishness 
                        could have gotten us all killed. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        I honestly don’t get what the appeal is.

                                 WEDNESDAY

                        Hard as it’s going to be to miss out on 
                        one of the most beautiful parts of life, 
                        love is not some ‘thing’ to be shared, 
                        nor can it last on just a single day a 
                        week. You know if there was a solution 
                        I’d do everything I could to explore it. 

                                 SUNDAY
                        Reading the Bible once in a while

                        It’s bed time.
           BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           In the dark, the Settman siblings lie in their respective 
           bunk beds. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        I think I’m in love with Jen.
                          (sits up)
                        I can’t just stop seeing her.

                        Didn’t you hear what Mom just said?

                        Would you tell if I kept our relationship 
                        a secret?

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Not if I can make out with her on my day. 

           Some of them snicker, but Monday, enraged by jealousy, jumps 
           from his bunk and shakes Saturday by the shoulders, pleading.

                                 MONDAY
                        Why do you get to break the rules?! What 
                        makes you so special?! What about me?! 

           Friday and Thursday join the fray to pull Monday off.

                        we’re already beating each other up! 

           The brothers return to their beds, seven teenagers, cooped 
           up, confused. Thursday tries to make peace...

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        I know it sucks, but we have to face up 
                        to it. There’s no place in our life for 
                        girlfriends or lovers or marriage. 
                          (saddened by the realization)
                        Love is just too risky.

                                 THURSDAY
                        The years passed quickly and before we 
                        knew it our need for an education had 
                        given way to our want for an occupation. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - NIGHT

           Karen works at her drafting table in the background as seven 
           TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD Settman siblings sit around the circular 
           table in their end-of-the-day meeting. 

           As adults, the brothers’ differing choices in attire and hair-
           style reflect their disparate in-home personalities. Sunday 
           wears a CRUCIFIX around his neck.

                                 MONDAY
                        We should become a product designer of 
                        some sort. It’s creative, technical, it’s 
                        fast-paced and we’ll always be working on 
                        something new. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        I don’t have a lick of artistic talent, 
                        let alone Friday’s tech know-how. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        We’d have to rely on you to carry the 
                        rest of us.

           Monday is frustrated that his suggestion is discounted. 

                                 FRIDAY
                        We need to select a job that suits our 
                        overall skill-set and interests, whether 
                        we’re working at home or in an office. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        What if we opened a restaurant, ooh, or 
                        better yet how about a night club?

                        I really like the nightclub idea. A lot.

                                 SATURDAY
                        It’s social, we don’t have to answer to a 
                        boss. There’s no cap on our income.

                        indulging people’s hedonistic tendencies? 
                        I’m not comfortable with this.

                        What about becoming a banker?! 

           The brothers consider the suggestion for a moment. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Banking’s not bad. It melds creativity 
                        and management, we’ll work with clients 
                        in a variety of fields, we’ll generate 
                        more than enough income to provide for a 
                        comfortable lifestyle and at the end of 
                        the day we can still pursue our own 
                        hobbies. What do you guys think? 

           The Settman siblings all AD-LIB varying degrees of interest, 
           lone for Monday who leans back in his chair, perturbed. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

           SUPER: Wednesday

           Dressed in a suit, Wednesday bounds confidently through the 
           compact crowd, a beacon in a sea of grey. 

           He passes under a sign for the FIRST NATIONAL BANK. 

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - LATER

           Senior bank executive CLIFF PETROSSIAN shows Wednesday his 
           new OFFICE and shakes his hand. After Cliff leaves, Wednesday  
           contacts his brothers on his Tablet. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        We got the job.

           An ultra-modern twist on neoclassical architecture, a domed-
           structure composed of glass panels framed by an iron lattice. 

           Karen, greyed, emaciated, walks up a moving ramp, admiring 
           her finished work. Cutting through a faux rainforest teeming 
           with rare tropical BIRDS, Karen blacks out and collapses.

           TWENTY-EIGHT-YEAR-OLD Monday holds his bed-ridden mother’s 
           frail hand. In a drug stupor, Karen veers in and out of 
           consciousness...

                                 KAREN
                        I’ve made a grave mistake. It’s not 
                        enough to just preserve routine. To 
                        engage the world as something you’re not 
                        is a farce...a failure of my own design. 
                        I chose to bring you into this world as a 
                        testament to what your father fought to 
                        preserve and when I look into your eyes I 
                        get to be reminded of the love we shared. 
                        But it pains me to know that his legacy 
                        lives on at a cost. 

           Monday is silent, absorbing the profound confession. 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        You may have come out of me, but I fear 
                        that you’ve yet to be born. 

           Karen dozes off when the door opens, revealing DR. ADRIAN 
           KNOWLES, late-20’s, a raven-haired medical doctor. 

           Monday rises as Adrian draws near, taking note of her natural 
           beauty, her gentle mien, a rare benevolence in her gaze. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Mr. Settman?

           Adrian sits beside Monday on a bench, the sprawling sky-line 
           visible behind them, featuring Karen’s beautiful skyscraper.

                        Living on top of one another, it’s only a

                        exposed to one of the bugs--

           Eyes welling with tears, Monday looks devastated. Adrian 
           warmly rubs his shoulders.

                        ...Dr. Knowles will ensure there’s always

                        the rest of her stay. A kind gesture. 

           Monday stops his presentation, obviously preoccupied. 
           Thursday notes that something is off...

                        It’s just...at the hospital talking with 
                        Mother, all these questions came up- is 
                        this life enough to fulfill us? Are we 
                        just aging and consuming without a moment 
                        to call our own? I tried to answer 
                        questions we’ve been scared to confront.

                                 FRIDAY
                        What have we not confronted? I think 
                        we’ve been rather thorough and objective 
                        in evaluating our situation.

                        we’ve been blessed with a chance to live. 

                                 MONDAY
                        I don’t deny that. I just wonder what’s 
                        stopping us from living our lives 
                        differently, why we have to be trapped in 
                        this routine. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        You don’t think all of us fantasize about 
                        what it might be like to break from the 
                        routine, to experience something new or 
                        surprising, to have lives of our own? 

           The other Settmans nod in agreement.

                                 TUESDAY
                        Even a man as connected as Terrence 
                        Settman can’t get clearance for a border 
                        crossing. 

                                 MONDAY
                        I’m not saying we have to run away. I 
                        just think we should consider other 
                        options. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Like what?

                                 MONDAY 
                        We can use Terrence’s influence to 
                        continue the work Father was doing with 
                        Marrakech. Together we could change 
                        public policy on siblings. If we won that 
                        fight we could lead separate lives. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        You’re being a total shit, rehashing 
                        things we’ve put to rest. The resistance 
                        that father was a part of is dead. It’s 
                        gone man and nobody out there is missing 
                        it. I don’t know about the rest of you 
                        but I refuse to entertain false hope. 

           HOLD ON Monday, foiled but unwilling to press the issue.

                                 THURSDAY 
                        You’re asking us to take even bigger 
                        risks than we do now. Activism is a 
                        dangerous proposition, especially when 
                        the consequences we face are so harsh.

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME)

                        Though none of us spoke of it, something 
                        changed that day. Monday’s questions had 
                        sent a shock-wave through our family. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - DAY

           The seven Settman siblings sit around the circular table 
           eating breakfasts of eggs, bacon and toast. 

                                 THURSDAY (V.O.)
                        Each of us began to cling to what little 
                        independence we had, seeking out ways to 
                        make our day uniquely ours. 

           Tuesday notices as Wednesday doesn’t touch his meal. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        Is something wrong? Did I undercook your 
                        eggs?

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        No. I’d just rather pick up a coffee and 
                        croissant on the way to the bank.

           SUPER each day of the week as it happens...

           In an ART GALLERY...Monday peruses the modern watercolors and 
           watches enviously as the PAINTER fields an interview. 

           In a WINE TASTING...Tuesday sips a Cabernet and relishes the 
           tang on his palette. 

           In a SOCCER FIELD...Wednesday dribbles past a defender and

           SUPER: Monday

           Stoic, Monday assists Adrian in pulling a sheet over Karen. 
           He stops momentarily to regard his Mother’s visage one final 
           time. Adrian places her hand atop Monday’s, consoling. Uneasy 
           showing vulnerability, he withdraws his hand and hurries out.

           Sobbing, Saturday stands before Karen’s casket, suspended in

           Adrian, Dr. Jennings, and a crowd of former clients surround.

           In mourning, the brothers take swigs from a bottle of 
           bourbon, consoling one another. 

                                 THURSDAY (V.O.)
                        After Mother passed on, we promised one 
                        another that we wouldn’t let her absence 
                        disrupt our progress. We were committed 
                        to making sure Terrence Settman reached 
                        his full potential. 

           The seven Settman brothers work on a financial presentation, 
           each tackling a different element- conducting research, 
           assembling a slide-show, critiquing delivery.  

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Thursday finishes delivering his presentation to the BOARD. 

           Cliff turns apologetically to JERRY PERTRIDGE, 40’s, the
           gaunt vice-president of the bank.

                                 CLIFF
                        It was a tough decision, Jerry, but 
                        ultimately Terrence was the better fit. 

                                 JERRY
                        I trust the board’s judgment. 

           Jerry eyes Thursday enviously as he is shown to a brand new 
           office, the door marked PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS.  

           INT. SETTMAN’S EXECUTIVE OFFICE 

           Jerry bitterly surveys Terrence Settman’s new office- it’s an 
           architectural marvel, with a panoramic view of the city that 
           seems strangely familiar. A TICKER on a nearby building reads 
           DISTRICT POPULATION: 68,245,739. The number climbing. 

           Thursday notices Jerry snooping around, empathizes...

                                 THURSDAY
                        I’m sorry. I know how badly you wanted 
                        this job, Jerry.

                        The more successful Terrence Settman

                        Posture, poise and power. You’re all

                        doesn’t mumble. He’s the very embodiment 
                        of refinement. He should come across as

           SUPER: Monday

           Friday opens a cabinet, revealing a wired DETONATION DEVICE.

                        In the event of a Bureau entry, we agreed 
                        that all evidence of our occupancy is to 
                        be destroyed. 

           Friday presses a button on a TIMER- 4:59, 58, 57... He 
           immediately resets and deactivates it.

           We PULL BACK to reveal six Settmans crowded around Friday as 
           he mans a half-installed CONTROL PANEL, littered with 
           mechanical parts. Monday wears a business suit.

                        I’ve activated the thumb print scanner on

                        So the Tracer emits a pulse that scans 
                        for only the frequencies the Bureau is 
                        looking for. When that pulse bounces 
                        back, it registers every trace it 
                        discovered on a map. And finally...

           The siblings exit the control room and the panel closes, 
           revealing a MURAL- a gorgeous, sprawling painting of seven 
           HORSES running free on a grassy plain.

                                 TUESDAY
                        I’ll wash it. 

           Thursday hands Monday their communal briefcase.

                        We’ll see you when you get home. 

           INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - MORNING

           Monday steps out of the elevator and alters his posture and 
           expression to embody Terrence Settman.

           He passes the security desk where EDDIE, 50’s, the building’s 
           security officer, stares contemptuously. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Have a productive day, Mr. Settman.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

           Monday disappears into the mass of pedestrians. 

           INT. SETTMAN MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

           Six of the Settman siblings lounge on couches, reviewing 
           financial reports for work, snacking, watching TV. Thursday 
           browses NEWS categories displayed on the life-like FLAT-
           SCREEN on the wall. A story about CROP CONTAMINATION airs...

           We see AERIAL FOOTAGE of a blazing fire consuming hundreds of 
           acres of crops. 

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        ...the Department of Agriculture is 
                        investigating a possible pesticide-
                        resistent strain of the bug responsible 
                        for the crop contamination.

           A FARMER and his WORKERS watch stoically as DEPARTMENT OF 
           AGRICULTURE AGENTS use flame-throwers to torch their fields. 

           A HEADLINE on-screen catches Thursday’s eye...

                                 THURSDAY
                        Guys, Nicholas Cayman is giving an 
                        interview.

           He expands a video NEWS PROGRAM. Appearing on-screen... 

           Nicholas Cayman, now 60’s, sits opposite CHARLES BENNINGS, 
           60’s, the liberal, squirrelly host of a Larry King-type 
           program. The pair spar, rapid-fire... 

                                 CAYMAN
                        We’ve been posting an operating loss due 
                        to a lack of centralized management. Too 
                        many regulators, spending excesses--

                                 CHARLES
                        Somehow I fail to see how privatization 
                        has become the only viable solution. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        The Bureau requires drastic restructuring 
                        if we’re ever going to pull into the 
                        black. That’s not going to happen in 
                        government hands.

                                 CHARLES
                        And where does the backing come from for 
                        such a pricey acquisition? 

           Cayman is sweating, shifty- a sore subject. 

                                 CAYMAN 
                        It’s been a rather tough road identifying 
                        a financial partner. I won’t sugar coat 
                        it. Investors are hesitant.  

                                 CHARLES
                        Hesitant? Who are you kidding, Nick? 
                        They’re downright terrified. Who the hell 
                        wants to get into bed with a man who 
                        critics regularly describe as...
                          (reading from a Tablet)
                        ...”a two-headed, cannibalistic reptile 
                        who catches children for a living”? 

           Cayman is angered but unable to back down. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        Siblings are not children as we know 
                        them. They’re sub-human, with no rights, 
                        or futures. They are a danger and a drain 
                        on our precious resources.

                                 SUNDAY
                        That man should rot for eternity in hell. 

           The brothers react to Sunday’s outburst, impressed. For a 
           second, he’s the coolest brother in the room. 

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        I couldn’t have said it better myself. 

                                 CHARLES
                        We’ll be back in a moment with Nicholas 
                        Cayman, Chairman of Cayman Industries and 
                        Acting Director of the Child Allocation 
                        Bureau. 

           The antique clock’s second hand completes its cycle, pushing 
           the minute & hour hands onto the XII. BELLS chime. MIDNIGHT.

           Rising from the couch, Thursday implores...

                        What happened to Monday?

           Thursday opens the front door and peers out before cautiously 
           stepping into the vacant HALLWAY.

                        missed an end-of-the-day meeting. 

           INT. SETTMAN BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A lone King-sized bed is flanked by three sets of BUNK BEDS
           which protrude from the wall. A tense air pervades as the 
           Settman siblings crowd around Thursday who rifles through 
           Monday’s CLOSET, one hidden among seven. 

                                 FRIDAY 
                        What do you expect to find?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Information. A receipt. A phone number. 
                        Lint. I don’t know. There’s got to be 
                        something that’ll give us some insight. 

                                 SUNDAY
                          (Tablet pressed to ear)
                        Might as well dig through your pockets. 
                        You’re not going to find anything we 
                        haven’t already accounted for. 
                          (hanging up)
                        Still going to message. And I called all 
                        the hospitals, and the police. Nothing.

           His search fruitless, Thursday sighs, turns to the others. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Monday can be...unpredictable at times, 
                        but not coming home, not contacting us or 
                        answering his Tablet, that’s unusual 
                        behavior even for him.

                        doesn’t want to come home. 

           Wednesday, in athletic garb, sprints on a treadmill in the 
           background. HOLOGRAPHIC FOLIAGE soars past. Out of breath...

           Wednesday shuts off the treadmill, ambles over and begins 
           massaging Tuesday’s shoulders as he nervously crochets a red 
           SKULL CAP. Trying to duck out of Wednesday’s grasp...

                        It’s not. If the Bureau knew we existed 
                        we’d all be processed by now.

                        will get to live. 

           The Settman siblings share a look of dread as Thursday stares 
           out the window, fretful. 

           We PULL OUT from the Settman unit...

           ...and SOAR over rooftops towering above the still humming

                        We’ve discussed it. Our plan’s always

                        home the next in line goes out on his day 
                        to investigate.

           Tuesday steps out of the elevator. From the moment he exits 
           he becomes more composed, confident, masculine. He embodies 
           Terrence Settman. 

           He passes the security desk, where Eddie watches an 
           automotive program on his Tablet.

           Tuesday peeks over his shoulder- Eddie’s oblivious.  

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Tuesday traverses the sidewalk studying passersby, suspicious 
           of everyone. Per the norm, no one makes eye contact. 

           Tuesday notices a faint, green PALM FROND graffitied below a 
           digital AD simultaneously plastered on all buildings- “IF WE 
           ALL EAT LESS, WE ALL GET TO EAT”.

           Tuesday arrives at the... 

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK LOBBY - DAY 

           Tuesday enters, slyly speaking into his Tablet. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        I’m here. 

           Judging from the elegant decor and clientele, this is an 
           institution that clearly caters to the elite. 

           Tuesday passes TELLERS who greet “Mr. Settman” deferentially. 
           In this domain he’s a god. 

           Tuesday is intercepted by Jerry Pertridge, still struggling 
           to advance from his post as the bank’s Senior VP. A naturally 
           anxious personality, Jerry’s attempt at amiability comes off 
           strained and ingratiating.

                        there and I think it’s important that our 
                        staff feels like we’re on the same team--

                                 TUESDAY
                        What are you after exactly?

                                 JERRY 
                        Vicki said you’re clear for lunch today. 

           Focused on more important matters, Tuesday approaches a bank 
           of elevators, gives Jerry the brush off. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        You know I don’t schedule impromptu 
                        lunches. 

           Defeated, Jerry stops walking. Tuesday enters an elevator, 
           but his gentler nature can’t leave it there. He holds the 
           doors for a moment.

                                 TUESDAY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, Jerry. I know you’re just trying 
                        to get ahead. I’ll have Vicki put 
                        something in the books after next Monday. 

           The doors close. Tuesday is unaware of Jerry’s maligned, 
           leery stare.

           SECRETARY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tuesday sighs, relieved to have made it this far. His comely 
           secretary, VICKI, 20’s, rises from behind her desk, nervous 
           in his presence, but flirtatious nonetheless. 

                                 VICKI
                        Good morning, Mr. Settman.

                        Morning, Vicki. 

                                 VICKI
                        I’ll have your coffee ready in just a 
                        moment. 

                                 TUESDAY 
                        I’m in no hurry.

           Tuesday lingers awkwardly, hesitant about how to proceed...

                                 TUESDAY (CONT'D)
                        I...I have a question that may strike you 
                        as unusual, Vicki. 

                                 VICKI
                        What is it, Mr. Settman?

                                 TUESDAY
                        To the best of your recollection, did you 
                        notice anything...unusual yesterday? 

                                 VICKI 
                        Unusual? Not that I could tell, I’m 
                        sorry. Is something the matter? 

                                 TUESDAY 
                        I’m sure it’s nothing. 

           Tuesday is about to open the door to his office when...

                                 VICKI 
                        Oh, I hope you don’t mind, but your nine 
                        am arrived early. They’re waiting for you 
                        inside. 

           INT. SETTMAN’S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

           Staring out the window are JOSEPHINE “JOE” FULLER, 30’s, 
           athletic build, menacing eyes and THORIN JOHANSEN, 40’s, 
           bald, a slit for lips. Both personify cool. 

           Tuesday ambles in and stands behind them.

                                 TUESDAY 
                        Quite the view, isn’t it? My mother 
                        designed the building. Just a matter of 
                        chance that I happen to be operating out 
                        of it. 

           The pair are silent, turn to face Tuesday.

                        I’m Terrence Settman. I oversee the day 
                        to day here. I apologize for the 
                        inconvenience but I’m afraid something’s 
                        come up. I’m going to have to reschedule. 

           Thorin and Joe share a snide, knowing look.

                                 THORIN
                        We aren’t here to play games, Settman. 

           Tuesday dulls his cheer as subdued panic sets in...

                                 TUESDAY
                        I could be mistaken but...have we done 
                        business together before?

                                 JOE 
                        You’d recall if we’d met. 

                                 THORIN 
                        Nicholas Cayman wants to see you. 

           The name instantly sets off an internal alarm...

                                 TUESDAY 
                        Would you...would you mind if I excuse 
                        myself for a moment? 

           Thorin adjusts his coat, intentionally flashing a GUN with a 
           MOTHER OF PEARL grip tucked into the waistband of his pants. 

                                 THORIN
                        We mind. 

           Terrified, Tuesday eyes the piece, struggles to maintain his 
           Terrence Settman charade, his voice cracking... 

                                 TUESDAY
                        I think a mistake may have been made. Do 
                        you know who I am?

                                 THORIN
                        Cayman doesn’t want to make this Bureau 
                        business unless you force him to. 

           Tuesday analyzes the situation- two goons between him and the 
           only exit. Too much ground to cover- he won’t make it. 

                                 JOE
                        Cooperate or you’ll face the same fate as 
                        your sibling.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           HOLD ON Tuesday, petrified to discover that Monday’s absence 
           was no accident, and worse, that they know his secret. 

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Jerry Pertridge pryingly observes as Joe and Thorin forcibly 
           escort Tuesday from the premises.

           EXT. CAYMAN INDUSTRIES BUILDING - ESTABLISHING

           A Cadillac pod pulls up before a modest but elegant office 
           building overlaid with black solar panels. 

           Joe and Thorin cart Tuesday out of the pod. He discreetly 
           slips his Tablet out of his pocket and cups it in his sleeve. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Parked at the CURB, spying from the safety of his pod, Jerry 
           Pertridge watches as...

           Thorin and Joe lead Tuesday past an avant-garde sculpture of 
           a MAN, WOMAN and CHILD embossed with CAYMAN INDUSTRIES. 
           Tuesday covertly tries to snap a PHOTO of the sculpture. 

           Shoved forward by Thorin, Tuesday misses, capturing a PANDA 
           KING Chinese restaurant sign across the street instead. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        Shit.

           It’ll suffice. He hits SEND. 

           In his POD...Jerry dials on his Tablet...

                                 JERRY
                        Settman just entered...

           Jerry pulls into traffic and drives away.

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEANWHILE

           Tense and silent the brothers sit around the circular table, 
           each holding a digital HAND OF CARDS on their respective 
           Tablets. Friday uses a finger gesture to ‘pass’ a card to 
           Thursday on his left when a message indicator POPS UP...

           He clicks on it, revealing the PANDA KING PHOTO from Tuesday.

           Free-floating monitors play a constant stream of Child 
           Allocation Bureau ADS. Tuesday reads one- 

           REPORT A SIBLING AND RECEIVE A 5% DEDUCTION ON YOUR FEDERAL 
           INCOME TAX RETURN. GO TO CAB.GOV FOR DETAILS.

           ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Disquieted, Tuesday stands between Joe and Thorin as they 
           ascend. His Tablet RINGS. He looks to the two brooding goons 
           for ‘permission’ to answer. 

           CAYMAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator doors open, revealing platinum-blonde BUREAU 
           AGENT 57, who studies Tuesday, entranced. Joe and Thorin 
           escort Tuesday over the crushed remnants of his Tablet as 57 
           enters, never breaking his piercing gaze.

                        photo was taken. 

           Friday is already at work at their Desktop Tablet...

           Joe and Thorin usher Tuesday into a PARLOR ROOM. If excess 
           had a sibling this is he. What isn’t crystal is gold plated. 

           Nicholas Cayman saunters in and steps in front of Tuesday, 
           who is trembling, paralyzed with fear. 

                                 TUESDAY
                        What do you want from me?

           Cayman steps around Tuesday, awestruck, scrutinizing him as 
           though looking at some rare artifact.

                        Please...just tell me what you want. 
                        I’m...I’m really not feeling well and I 
                        fear that I may have contracted a bug. 

           Cayman can’t contain a laugh...

                                 CAYMAN
                        I assure you that what I need won’t take 
                        but a minute of your valuable time. 

           Cayman throws a nod to Thorin and Joe, who converge on 
           Tuesday and restrain him against a seat-back.

                                 TUESDAY 
                        No! What are you doing?! 

           Joe grabs Tuesday’s hand and unfurls a LASER SWITCHBLADE.

                        I’m sorry, Terrence but you have 
                        something I need. 

           In a swift motion, Joe SEVERS Tuesday’s thumb! Blood spouts 
           from the fresh nub!

           their heads in their palms. It’s the worst possible outcome 
           they could have imagined.

                        down together for a delicious breakfast 
                        Tuesday prepared and this will all get

                        dark seems stupid, even by my standards--

           Wednesday is suddenly interrupted by the quiet, pulsating 
           BEEP of an alarm. 

           Dread sweeps over the Settmans as the SOUND OF THE FRONT DOOR 
           UNLOCKING resounds from the foyer. 

                                 WEDNESDAY (CONT'D)
                        What the hell...?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Everyone...hiding places. Chop chop. 

           The brothers scramble into their designated spots: behind a 
           dresser, beneath retractable floor boards, under the cushion 
           of a couch. Thursday turns off the lights. 

           They disappear into hiding just as the front door opens. 

           As the control room panel closes, the motor malfunctions, 
           leaving the door ajar. A sliver of BLUE LIGHT leaks out... 

           Straggling behind, Friday slides into a faux cabinet in the 
           kitchen. He notices the open panel but it’s too late...

           An INTRUDER enters holding a FLASH LIGHT. He closes, then 
           locks the door quietly. He searches the unit- the kitchen, 
           bedroom, media room. All empty.  

                                 INTRUDER
                        Come on out you cowards!

           He notices the blue light emanating from within the control 
           room. Curious, he heads to investigate. He opens the panel, 
           revealing the monitors and hi-tech gadgetry. 

           In the CONTROL ROOM...the intruder presses random buttons on 
           the control panel. CLICKS and SLIDES sound from behind him as 
           the hiding spots are inadvertently opened...
           MEDIA ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The intruder steps out to discover the silhouette of a figure 
           outlined by a cavernous breach across the room. 

           He draws a silenced gun from his waist, turns off the SAFETY. 
           He timidly takes a step towards the figure. 

                                 INTRUDER 
                        Step out from the dark. 

           Struggling to stay composed, Friday steps into the faint 
           light. The intruder trains his weapon on him. 

                                 INTRUDER (CONT'D)
                        Where are the others?

                                 FRIDAY
                        I’m...alone. 

           Out of sight, Thursday climbs out from under an opened seat 
           cushion in the Media Room. From his POV- we watch the 
           intruder advance on Friday, gun raised. 

                                 INTRUDER
                        We both know that’s not true, Settman. 
                        Where are they?

           Thursday skulks silently towards the intruder.

                                 FRIDAY
                        There’s no one else. I’m telling you I 
                        live by myself. 

                                 INTRUDER
                          (to the walls)
                        Stay hidden! You’ll be found eventually! 

           The intruder is about to pull the trigger when Thursday 
           tackles him. The silenced shot splits the wall. The men fall 
           to the floor as the gun knocks free. 

           Thursday and the intruder claw over each other to reach it.

           The other siblings emerge from their hiding spots. 

           With a substantial strength and size advantage, the intruder 
           throws Thursday aside and snatches up the gun. 

                                 THURSDAY 
                        For Christ’s sake, help me!

           CONTINUED:

           Wednesday jumps on the intruder from behind, trying to 
           wrestle the weapon away. 

           The intruder’s mask is pulled off, unveiling- Thorin.

           The other Settmans stand by, wanting to engage, but unsure 
           how to assist as the gun waves wildly. 

           Wednesday and Thorin topple to the ground. The gun FIRES 
           silently, ceiling fragments crumbling atop them. 

           The lights turn on. From Thorin’s POV- we see Sunday and 
           Friday nearing from each side, Wednesday behind, and Thursday 
           advancing from the front. Viewing four Terrences...

                                 THORIN 
                        Everywhere I look I see ass-holes. 

           Wednesday punches Thorin in the kidney. The weapon 
           discharges. Wednesday again delivers a devastating punch to 
           the kidney. The gun discharges again and PULVERIZES half of 
           Thorin’s face, blood splattering across Wednesday!

                                 THURSDAY
                        Oh Jesus!

           Covered in gore, stupefied, Wednesday lets go of Thorin as he 
           rolls off, lifeless. The brothers are stunned silent. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Someone get me a towel. 

                                 FRIDAY (O.S.)
                        Ughh! Guys...

           Friday lies on the floor clutching his gut, struck by a stray 
           bullet. The siblings rush over, paralyzed with fear at the 
           sight of their fallen brother. Thursday holds Friday’s hand 
           as BLOOD drains out onto the pristine tile. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        The people who love you will take good 
                        care of you. You’re going to be fine.

                        WEDNESDAY
           I’ll get the med kit. 
                                                      SUNDAY 
                                           I’m getting water. 

           Sunday and Wednesday take off, leaving Saturday, rattled. 

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        Saturday, help me put pressure. 

           Saturday can’t stomach the gore. 
                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SATURDAY
                        I don’t know if I can do this. 

           Saturday lifts off Friday’s shirt, revealing the entry wound. 
           Gagging, he looks away as he presses the balled-up shirt to 
           the bleeding hole. 

                                 FRIDAY 
                          (semi-conscious)
                        Thursday...after Mother died...you took 
                        care of me...you kept us together...when 
                        temptation tried to pull us...apart. 

           And like that, the fire in Friday’s eyes extinguishes. 

                                 THURSDAY 
                        Friday. Friday. Hey. You’re fine. You’re 
                        going to be fine. 

           Thursday begins to shake him, gently at first and then more 
           violently. To no avail. 

           The brothers return. In shock, they kneel beside Friday and 
           begin to break down, some crying, some suppressing, all 
           feeling as though a part of themselves has died.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER...Wednesday digs through the intruder’s empty pockets. 

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        He’s not carrying identification. 

           Sunday spots the bundle nearby, unwraps the cloth, and drops 
           it when he registers it’s a THUMB he’s holding.  

                                 SUNDAY 
                        Oh god. 

           The brothers crowd around to examine it, fearful. Thursday 
           picks it up, compares it to his own. It’s identical.

                                 SUNDAY (CONT'D)
                        Could be Tuesday’s. 

                                 SATURDAY 
                        Or Monday’s. 

           Thursday becomes lost in speculation...

                                 THURSDAY
                        He knew we were siblings...

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Monday or Tuesday might have talked. 
                        Someone might be trying to blackmail--

                                 THURSDAY
                        He wasn’t here for money. Something else 
                        is going on, I’m telling you. 

           Wednesday picks up Thorin’s weapon. Savoring the weight in 
           his hand, he admires the custom MOTHER OF PEARL GRIP. 

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        Look, whoever’s behind this, they 
                        obviously aren’t working alone... 

           INT. BOILER ROOM - LATER

           Sunday and Wednesday enter carrying Friday’s body. Behind 
           them, Thursday and Saturday carry Thorin. 

           The four brothers stare into the smoldering white fire of a 
           LIQUID INJECTION INCINERATOR, melancholic.

                                 SUNDAY 
                        Go in peace, for as much as we have sworn 
                        in the name of the Lord, saying the Lord 
                        shall be between me and thee and between 
                        my seed and thy seed forever...

           Morose, they cast Friday into the fire. Clothing and flesh 
           peel away in a swirling rush of flames that atomize the body.

           The four toss Thorin inside, without any remorse or fanfare. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME)

           Agent 63 dabs the wound under his eye with a swab, sees that 
           the blood has dried. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        If this story is some desperate attempt 
                        to pull a veil over our eyes, you should 
                        know DNA traces can still be pulled from 
                        an atomizing incinerator.

                                 THURSDAY
                        I left desperate behind a long time ago.  

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - NIGHT 

           Saturday lines up three tall glasses as Wednesday pours 
           bourbon and proceeds to drain the bottle.

                          (in tears)
                        I’m scared of what’s going to become of 
                        us. 

           Thursday drapes his arms around Sunday, consoling him.

                                 THURSDAY
                        I am too. But it’s not in our nature to 
                        give in. Tempting as it is, that’s not 
                        how Mother raised us. Every day that 
                        we’ve set foot outside we’ve defied the 
                        odds by standing up to a faceless enemy. 
                        Is this really so different? 

                                 SUNDAY
                        It’s worlds different. Three of us are 
                        gone.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Where’s your faith when we need it most? 
                        You’re supposed to be the religious one, 
                        the believer.  

                                 SUNDAY 
                        Why? Because I go to church? That doesn’t 
                        define who I am. Truth be told...I don’t 
                        know who I am. 

           Though unwilling to admit it, Thursday relates...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. SETTMAN BEDROOM - MORNING

           Thursday, Saturday and Sunday follow Wednesday into the WALK-
           IN CLOSET, where he peruses their extensive collection of 
           conservative, designer suits. 

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        Every Wednesday I wear a black suit, a 
                        white shirt and a green tie. Not today.  

           Wednesday selects athletic garb from a drawer and puts it on. 

           FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Wednesday slides Thorin’s gun into the back of his waistband. 
           The other Settmans look on, concerned.

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        That’s the general idea. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        If you get Terrence Settman arrested or 
                        killed, it’ll completely cripple us. 
                        We’ll be forced to leave the unit, we’ll 
                        have no access to the money we’ve saved. 
                        Do you have any idea how hard life off 
                        the grid is? Coming from this 
                        micromanaged bubble we won’t last a 
                        minute out there.

           Thursday looks at Saturday strangely, the severe comment out 
           of character for him. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        How come Tuesday didn’t get this lecture?

                                 SATURDAY
                        Because we weren’t concerned he’d be 
                        cocky and reckless.

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        I understand what’s at stake. I’m looking 
                        for answers not trouble. 

           In turn, Wednesday pulls each brother in for a hug. 

                                 WEDNESDAY (CONT'D)
                        I can’t imagine having grown up without 
                        you guys. I don’t care that our life was 
                        bizarre and illegal and overwhelming most 
                        of the time. I feel sorry for a world 
                        that won’t know the love of a sibling. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        I love you, Wednesday. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        Love you.

           Wednesday stops. Thursday lowers his voice...

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        Forget what they just said. Break our 
                        rules if you have to. Do what needs to be 
                        done. You’re going out there so last 
                        night never happens again. 

           Smiling, charged from Thursday’s permission to let loose...

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Now we’re talking. 

           INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - MORNING

           The moment Wednesday exits the elevator he alters his 
           posture, livens his expression. He embodies Terrence Settman. 

           He walks past the security desk. From his POV- Eddie is not 
           visible at his station. 

                                                                 PAN TO:

           Behind the security desk, Eddie lies in a pool of blood, a 
           bullet lodged in his temple. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEANWHILE

           Thursday and Sunday assemble SANDWICHES from an alluring 
           selection of artisanal FOOD STUFFS stocked in their FRIDGE. 
           With each item used, a DISPLAY updates consumption levels. 

           Thursday watches as Saturday speaks into his Tablet, his 
           voice hoarse, congested. A skillful performance. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        No no, I’ll be fine, Vicki. It’s one of  
                        the milder bugs. But the doctor insisted 
                        I remain in home-quarantine for two days.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Determined, Wednesday moves across an overcrowded crosswalk, 
           each step a chore, and arrives in front of a PANDA KING with 
           three trees out front. 

           A digital sign on the door reads CLOSED FOR FUMIGATION. He 
           peers inside at a restaurant covered in plastic tarps.

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        They weren’t even open.

           CONTINUED:

           Wednesday regards the adjacent storefronts- a SHOE REPAIR, a 
           SPECIALTY VIDEO GAME SHOP, a PHARMACY, a BAR. 

           Stumped but eager to solve the quandary, Wednesday pulls up 
           the Panda King photo on his Tablet. He switches to CAMERA 
           MODE to ‘recreate’ the photo. He crosses the street, backing 
           up until his vantage point finally matches Tuesday’s photo. 

           He spins to behold the TICKER seen earlier- DISTRICT 
           POPULATION: 71,501,043. The number climbing. It’s mounted 
           prominently over a sign for the Cayman Industries Building.

                                 Saturday
                        Nicholas Cayman? 

           While on the vid-phone, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday are 
           swept by a wave of fear, interrupting their meal. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        There’s no question. Tuesday was here. 

                                 SUNDAY
                        We have to assume this is connected to 
                        the man who broke into our unit. Which 
                        means Cayman may know our secret. 

                                 SATURDAY
                          (skeptical)
                        If Nicholas Cayman knows we’re siblings, 
                        why wouldn’t he just send his Bureau 
                        agents?

                                 THURSDAY
                        We must have something he wants. 

           EXT. CAYMAN INDUSTRIES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Wednesday notices as a wave of MEDIA and BUSINESSMEN pass him 
           and enter the building. 

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        Wait. Something’s going on inside. I’ll 
                        be in touch.

           The Vid-phone screen goes BLANK. About to take a bite of his 
           SANDWICH...

           INT. CAYMAN INDUSTRIES LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Wednesday enters the bustling lobby to observe the controlled 
           chaos- hundreds of JOURNALISTS mingle within rows of seats 
           facing a STAGE and PODIUM. 

           Wednesday does his best to keep his cool as he passes a 
           gaggle of BUREAU AGENTS. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MOMENTS LATER

           On his Tablet, trailed by Saturday and Sunday, Thursday heads 
           to the entertainment center and turns on the monitor. He 
           tunes in to the Cayman Industries PRESS CONFERENCE. 

           INT. CAYMAN’S INDUSTRIES HALLWAY - MEANWHILE

           Wearing his finest attire, Cayman swaggers purposefully down 
           the corridor, accompanied by a team of EXECUTIVES.

           Joe intercepts Cayman, who is displeased to see her. He 
           informs his stuffy entourage...

                                 CAYMAN
                        I’ll be there in a moment. 
                          (following their departure)
                        You had clear instructions to not return 
                        until after the conference. 

                                 JOE
                          (anxious)
                        Thorin never came home last night.

           Cayman pauses for a moment before sharing insensitively...

                                 CAYMAN 
                        There was an incident at the Settman 
                        unit. Thorin was killed. 

           Joe appears rattled, a rare glimpse of her vulnerability. 

                                 JOE
                        What? Who told you that? How can you be 
                        sure?

                                 CAYMAN
                        I have a contact on the inside. 

           Joe suppresses an anguish that speaks of more than just 
           losing a partner.

                        Listen to me, Joe. You need to remain 
                        focused. If the Settmans aren’t 
                        dispatched by the end of the week, this 
                        conference is for naught. Do you 
                        understand me? 

           Joe takes a deep breath to center herself, on a mission to 
           avenge Thorin. 

                                 JOE 
                        I’ll have the matter resolved by end of 
                        day.  

           INT. CAYMAN INDUSTRIES LOBBY - MEANWHILE 

           Wednesday takes a seat in the back. Feeling eyes on him, he 
           turns, surprised to find Jerry Pertridge studying him from 
           across the room. Jerry nods, confirming that he’s watching.

           A hush travels through the crowd as Cayman takes the podium.

                                 CAYMAN
                        Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

           Cayman sips a glass of water, calm, relishing the attention. 

           Eyes still locked with Wednesday, Jerry points to Cayman on-
           stage, non-verbally telling his boss to “pay attention”. 

           Wednesday diverts his gaze to...

                                 CAYMAN (CONT'D)
                        For over three decades, the Child 
                        Allocation Bureau has been relied upon to 
                        combat the most severe problem our nation 
                        has ever faced- overpopulation. In that 
                        time, we’ve expanded our infrastructure 
                        from a single office to 518 branches 
                        nationwide, providing employment to a 
                        force of over 43,000 and processing over 
                        12 million siblings to date. 

           A clashing series of BOOS and CLAPS resound from the crowd.

                        But success has come at a significant 
                        financial burden to our government, one 
                        they can simply no longer shoulder alone.

                        In the name of preserving the very agency 
                        I helped build, it’s with great honor 
                        that I announce that Cayman Industries is 
                        acquiring the Child Allocation Bureau, to 
                        be privately owned and operated. This is 
                        in large part possible because of our 
                        burgeoning relationship with a major 
                        bank, whose identity I cannot reveal at 
                        present due to the terms of our non-
                        disclosure agreement. 

           Wednesday appears disturbed by the news, his mind whirling.

                        Do you think someone at First National

           Joe, who is astonished that Settman is right in their midst.

           Just then, Wednesday spies out of the corner of his eye- a 
           pack of five SECURITY GUARDS carrying TAZER BATONS and MRP’s
           exiting, eyeing him like a hawk.

                                 JERRY

           EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Wednesday bursts free of the drove and finds himself on a 
           SINGLE PASSENGER VEHICLE (SPV) LANE, a walled-in half-width 
           road used by VERTICAL SCOOTER and ELECTRIC BICYCLE RIDERS. 

           We see Wednesday’s reflexes on display as he nimbly side-
           steps, ducks under, and spins around oncoming SPV riders. 

           Determined, the guards give chase against the flow of 
           traffic. They open fire with their MRP’s. The faint spheres 
           of electrical energy barely miss their target, hitting 
           riders’ limbs which twitch before going numb. A series of 
           SPV’s collide in a perilous pile-up.

           An oncoming SPV rider is struck in the neck by a pulse. Numb, 
           his head droops. He veers wildly before scraping the wall, 
           sparks flying on his collision course with Wednesday, who 
           sees the vehicle within striking distance. 

           Wednesday fleetly runs up the wall to avoid impact. 

           The rider PLOWS into a tailing guard, sending him soaring 
           over the wall...SPLAT into the windshield of a speeding pod, 
           stopped dead in his tracks. 

           A GUARD stops to catch his breath. Into his headset...

                                 GUARD
                        He’s running south on Benson. And the guy 
                        can move. 
           EXT. CAYMAN INDUSTRIES BUILDING - MEANWHILE

           Receiving word on her headset, Joe climbs into the Cadillac
           pod to join REGGIE, the lanky driver, and two guards. 

           The Cadillac pod rockets out onto the track. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - MEANWHILE

           Wednesday leaps from the narrow wall and grasps onto the edge 
           of a MOVING WALK-WAY, suspended above pedestrian traffic on 
           the sidewalk. 

           He dangles by one arm, a mass of panicked pedestrians below 
           clearing out for fear of being toppled. His Tablet slips out 
           from his pocket and shatters on the ground. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        No! 

           Wednesday pulls himself up to discover the walk-way is 
           carrying him towards guards waiting at an upcoming LOADING 
           PLATFORM. 

           The guards open fire with their MRP’s, dropping obstructing 
           pedestrians like flies. 

           Wednesday runs against the ‘grain’, forcing his way past 
           annoyed pedestrians until he reaches the next platform. The 
           guards fight through the crowds to follow.

           EXT. CITY STREET - MEANWHILE

           On an upper-level RAMP, the Cadillac pod weaves through 
           traffic.

           INT. CADILLAC POD - CONTINUOUS

           While Reggie drives, Joe scans the streets and picks up 
           Wednesday jogging into an alleyway on the level below. 

                                 JOE
                          (into radio)
                        Got him. He’s entering Chinatown!
                          (to Reggie)
                        We need to cut over! 

           Reggie stabs a button. 
           EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We RISE ABOVE the Cadillac as the interior cabin swivels 180 
           degrees, steering wheel, pedals and all, to allow the pod to 
           merge horizontally into opposing traffic and drive in the 
           opposite direction down an exit ramp to...  

           STREET LEVEL

           Wednesday cuts through a dank passageway, where Chinese 
           PEDDLERS sell low-grade meats and produce from rustic carts. 

           He reaches a DEAD-END- a towering chain link fence blocks his 
           outlet, buttressed by shipping containers on the other side. 

           He backtracks just as the Cadillac pod pulls up. Joe and the 
           two guards exit, obstructing his only escape. 

                                 JOE
                        There’s nowhere to run, Settman. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        I’d have to disagree. 

           Wednesday runs up the fence, begins scaling, and in a matter 
           of seconds is half-way to the top.

           Joe draws one of the guard’s MRP’s and fires a pulse which 
           strikes Wednesday’s right arm, causing his bicep to twitch 
           before going numb. 

           Joe fires a second pulse which strikes Wednesday’s left leg, 
           to the same numbing effect.

                                 JOE 
                          (to guards)
                        Go get him. 

           The guards makes haste up the fence. One grabs on to 
           Wednesday’s foot. Unable to support the extra weight, 
           Wednesday begins to slide, his fingers bloodying as they 
           scrape the rusted grating. 

           We follow a stream of RED DROPLETS which rain upon the 
           guard’s face, blinding him. Wednesday delivers a swift boot 
           to the guard’s nose. He falls upon the second guard, taking 
           the two crashing into a cart below. 

           Determined, Wednesday climbs one-armed, one-legged up the 
           fence, intent on making it over when he spies below...

           Joe smugly touches a TAZER BATON to the fence. We watch the 
           ELECTRICITY spider its way up the metal mesh. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Alarmed, Wednesday frantically picks up his pace and topples 
           over the crest just as the bolts reach him.

           STORAGE DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Jolted by the shock, Wednesday drops onto a shipping 
           container, panting. He massages his limbs.  

           Quickly regaining feeling, Wednesday hobbles to his feet. 

           From his POV on high- we see a gated yard teeming with 
           shipping containers being sorted by a dozen ROBOTIC ARMS. 

           Wednesday finally catches his breath when...he’s SIDE-SWIPED
           by Joe, tackled to the metal. In one fluid motion, Joe’s back 
           on her feet, her Tazer Baton extended. 

                                 JOE 
                        You tell me how many siblings remain, 
                        where they are and I’ll ensure your death 
                        is swift and painless. 

           Wednesday springs from the container onto one being moved by 
           a robotic arm. Joe leaps after him in pursuit. Equally agile, 
           the two spring from one transported container to the next.

           Finally, Wednesday finds himself repositioned atop a 
           different tower, no more containers to aid his flight, Joe 
           advancing with her Tazer baton raised. 

           Wednesday draws the gun, aims confidently. 

                                 WEDNESDAY
                        Drop it!

           Joe instantly recognizes the custom Mother of Pearl grip. She 
           grimaces and advances, intrepid. 

                                 JOE 
                        I know where you got that weapon. Because 
                        I bought it for him!

                                 WEDNESDAY 
                        I’m warning you. I’ll shoot, I swear!

           Joe inches closer. 

                                 JOE 
                        Unless you plan on becoming a bald, 
                        Norwegian man in the next few seconds 
                        that gun is nothing but dead weight in 
                        your hand.

           CONTINUED:

           Wednesday squeezes the trigger. It BEEPS. He squeezes it 
           again. BEEP. He examines print sensors on the grip as Joe 
           deliberately advances. 

           In his periphery, Wednesday sees a robotic arm reaching for 
           an adjacent container. Defenseless, he drops the gun. He 
           throws his arms up in surrender, before darting for the edge. 
           He’s about to lunge off when Joe throws the baton. 

           We SAIL with it, spiraling end-over-end as it strikes 
           Wednesday’s calf. He shudders from the jolt and falls over 
           the edge. Gone...

           All of sudden, a container rises into view, Wednesday safely 
           sprawled out atop it. He cockily salutes Joe, who immediately 
           draws her gun and opens fire. A series of near-hits and then 
           IMPACT in his forearm. 

           Approaching ground level, Wednesday jumps from the container, 
           clutching his wound as he runs out of sight.

                        I didn’t really know Eddie. We greeted

                        that was pretty much the extent of it.

                        either of you some mineral water or a 
                        bite perhaps? I just had bittersweet 
                        chocolate flown in from Belgium and it’s 
                        quite the guilty pleasure.

           Thursday’s about to silence it when it stops. 

           He looks at the screen- CALLER UNKNOWN. Seconds later it

           runs his hand over the cabinet Sunday’s concealed behind. 

           Visible in the background, Saturday tries under great duress 
           to not be overtly distracted by Shooker’s snooping.

           Shooker examines the plate of three half-eaten sandwiches 
           resting on the counter. He presses his finger into the

                        This is going to sound ridiculous but for 
                        the life of me I couldn’t get the correct 
                        ratio of mustard to meat. I know what 
                        you’re thinking. Tragic to waste food. 

           The detectives visually confer- Settman knows nothing. 

                                 LEE
                          (to Shooker)
                        Do you have any more questions?

           Shooker shakes his head no and promptly rises. He and Lee 
           pause to be shown out and Saturday pops to his feet. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SATURDAY
                        Actually, I’m heading out myself. I’ll 
                        walk down with you. 

           We CUT TO Sunday then Thursday, both following the exchange 
           and disturbed by Saturday’s announcement. 

           Saturday steps into the bathroom doorway, leans in and grabs 
           his Tablet. Thursday is stuck -- he can do nothing but glare, 
           with the police standing there.

           As they head into the FOYER...

                                 SHOOKER
                        Why are you not at work, Mr. Settman?

                                 SATURDAY 
                        I’ve been running myself down so I took a 
                        sick day. My scrip is probably ready by 
                        now. 

           They leave. The door SLAMS and Thursday and Sunday emerge.

                                 SUNDAY
                        He just left!

           In the CONTROL ROOM...Thursday watches on a monitor as 
           Saturday enters the elevator with Shooker and Lee. He turns 
           around, rattled, withdrawn, an easy read for...

                                 SUNDAY (CONT'D)
                        I know that look.

                                 THURSDAY
                        There was a message on Saturday’s tablet.  

                                 SUNDAY
                        A message? What did it say?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Will meet you in an hour. 

                                 SUNDAY
                        That’s it? Will meet who in an hour?

                                 THURSDAY
                        The caller was listed as unknown but I 
                        think it’s pretty obvious who he’s going 
                        to meet.  

                                 SUNDAY
                        You think he’s conspiring with Jerry 
                        Pertridge.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           HOLD ON Thursday and Sunday, the betrayal cut deep.  

           INT. CADILLAC POD - EVENING

           Out of breath, Joe returns to the vehicle, joining Reggie and 
           the two injured guards. 

                                 JOE
                        Go to the Settman unit. 

           INT. SETTMAN FOYER - MEANWHILE

           Frantic, Thursday searches through the closet...

                                 THURSDAY
                        Saturday took the umbrella. Do we have 
                        any others?

                                 SUNDAY
                        We only have the one. So you’re leaving 
                        me alone?

           Thursday heads to the rear of the unit, Sunday on his heels. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        I don’t have a choice. We need answers. 

                                 SUNDAY 
                        We have our answers. Saturday just walked 
                        out on us without a word! He set us up to 
                        be killed! 

                                 THURSDAY
                        We don’t know that for sure. I have to 
                        confront him. 

           Thursday opens the COAT CLOSET and separates hanging clothes, 
           revealing the LIFT PANEL. Sunday grabs Thursday’s arm. 

                                 SUNDAY 
                        If you act with violence you’re no better 
                        than they are. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        How much longer can we sit back and wait 
                        to die? Brother, we’ve barely started 
                        living.  

           INT. ESCAPE SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

           Riding the lift, Thursday plunges into the dark void. 
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

           Saturday exits the building with Shooker and Lee. Steady 
           rainfall drums on a mass of umbrella-carrying pedestrians.  

                                 SHOOKER
                        Have a productive day. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        A productive day to you as well. 

           Saturday opens his umbrella and disappears into the mass. 

                                 SATURDAY (CONT'D)
                        Feels an awful lot like a Saturday. 

           Shooker watches him go, then heads to his Squad Pod. 

           INT. MAINTENANCE TUNNEL - MEANWHILE

           Thursday emerges from the escape shaft. The narrow tunnel 
           stretches as far as the eye can see in both directions. 

           He climbs a ladder leading to a MAN-HOLE. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER 

           Shooker nears a MAN-HOLE COVER, steps on it just as...

           BELOW GROUND, Thursday is about to push on the cover when...

           Shooker is distracted by a disheveled man staring at him from 
           down the street, a man identical to the Settman who is still 
           visible walking away in the opposite direction!  

           DOWN THE STREET...from Wednesday’s POV- we see Shooker’s 
           befuddled but knowing gaze.

           Struggling to see clearly through a sheet of rain, Shooker 
           steps off the man-hole cover just as it is propped open, 
           Thursday’s eyes peering out of the slit.

           Wednesday, frightened by the detective’s stare, flees. 
           Shooker springs into action and runs across the street!

                                 LEE 
                        What the...

           MEANWHILE...Thursday exits the man-hole, surveys the area 
           from a stoop and spies Saturday entering a SUBWAY STATION. 
           AROUND THE CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Lee catches up with Shooker as he watches Wednesday disappear 
           from view at the end of the block.

                                 SHOOKER
                        Did you see that?

                                 LEE 
                        Was that Settman? 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - MEANWHILE

           Thursday watches Saturday, desperate to confront his sibling 
           but unable to risk the two being exposed together. 

           The TRAIN arrives and the two board adjacent cabins. 

           INT. CADILLAC POD - MEANWHILE

           Reggie speeds through a dip in the road, the vehicle briefly 
           scraping the track. 

           From Joe’s POV- Wednesday sprints through an intersection, 
           perpendicular to their vehicle. 

                                 JOE
                        There he is. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - MEANWHILE

           Joe, Reggie and the two guards exit the Cadillac pod, 
           observing as Wednesday runs into a decrepit building, abutted 
           on two sides by a murky CANAL.  

           INT. DECREPIT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Littered with structural debris, the lobby is now home to 
           hordes of homeless, occupying every inch of available space. 

           Wednesday arrives at a staircase lying in a pile of rubble. 

           Joe watches as Wednesday springs off the staircase onto a 
           fallen column and leaps to the second floor.  

                                 JOE
                        He can only run for so long. 
                          (to the guards)
                        Stay with him. 

           The guards try the identical maneuver. The first barely 
           clears the jump. The second smacks into the floor and 
           struggles to pull himself up. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        There must be another way up. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe and Reggie run through a downpour to an adjacent 
           building.

           INT. ADJACENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator gate descends, sealing a drenched Joe and Reggie 
           inside. 

           INT. DECREPIT BUILDING - MEANWHILE

           Wednesday bounds up the steps, carefully avoiding a tight 
           configuration of sleeping bodies. He peers down below and 
           locks eyes with the pursuing guards. 

           The guards step right through a HOLE IN THE FLOOR COVERED 
           WITH A BLANKET. They tumble awkwardly, landing with a 
           sickening CRACK, followed by agonizing WAILS. 

           Wednesday smiles, satisfied, his trap sprung. 

           He emerges on the top floor and is immediately fired upon by 
           Joe and Reggie from the opposite end of the hall. He takes 
           cover behind a wall as the resident homeless flee. 

           Wednesday spies a lower rooftop visible through a window 
           across the way. He takes off running, bullets narrowly 
           missing his body, and breaks through the pane...

           EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Wednesday SAILS through the air, splinters of glass dripping 
           from his muscular frame, a miraculous display of athletic 
           prowess. He can make it... But gravity has other plans. 

           Wednesday falls short of the roof, collides brutally with the 
           wall, FREE-FALLS thirty stories towards the CANAL below. 

           INT. DECREPIT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe and Reggie peer down to find Wednesday splattered on the 
           concrete, blood draining into the canal, staining it crimson. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME)

           63 holds up a bag containing Wednesday’s SHATTERED TABLET. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AGENT 63
                        Recovered below a walkway six blocks 
                        south of the Cayman Industries building.  

           Thursday nods, saddened by the confirmation. 

                                 AGENT 63 (CONT'D)
                        Wednesday fell out of contact with you 
                        how long ago precisely?

                                 THURSDAY
                          (thinking)
                        That was five hours ago or so. 

           Agent 63 enters the data into a TIME LINE on his Tablet. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        At this point four of your siblings were 
                        gone. Your future was looking grimmer by 
                        the hour. Why not hide? Go to ground and 
                        cover your trail? 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Because we were close. We knew Cayman was 
                        after us. We knew Saturday and Pertridge
                        were involved. We just needed to 
                        understand why. 

           INT. SUBWAY CABIN - NIGHT

           Saturday studies the sardined-in passengers around him- 
           unawakened, silent drones. 

           We MOVE THROUGH the train to an adjacent cabin where... 
           Thursday watches Saturday, resentful. 

           The train fleetly rises from the underground on a ramp 
           crossing a murky body of water. Thursday turns to behold the 
           silhouette of a decayed SUSPENSION BRIDGE.

           We PULL OUT from the train window...

           EXT. EAST RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           ...and SOAR over black water, to arrive at the rusted 
           remnants of the BROOKLYN BRIDGE, now a dumping ground. 

           Joe and Reggie step up to a breach in the railing and roll a 
           BAGGED BODY rigged with weights over the edge... 
           INT. SUBWAY CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Saturday sees a faint black speck fall into the dark abyss 
           but thinks nothing of it. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - LATER

           The pristine TRAIN pulls into the squalid station, its first 
           stop outside the relative safety of the DOWNTOWN districts.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Thursday trails Saturday through a bustling Flea market, 
           resembling a Souq. He arrives at a PALM FROND-emblazoned door 
           that is guarded by two hulking BOUNCERS, both on high alert 
           as they scan the market and crowd. 

           Thursday watches Saturday filter forward with a group of 
           entrants. A bouncer blocks his path with his bulging arm-

                                 BOUNCER
                        Ticket?

           Saturday fumbles through his pockets before withdrawing a 
           TICKET, on which is printed a PALM FROND. We’re afforded a 
           glimpse of the back- a handwritten message reads TERRENCE, I 
           HOPE YOU CAN... But the rest is covered by Saturday’s thumb. 

           Satisfied, the bouncer allows Saturday to pass. 

           Thursday pauses, unnerved that he can’t enter for risk of 
           being spotted with Saturday. Suddenly he discovers one of the 
           bouncers eyeing him askance. He retreats into crowd cover... 

           INT. MARRAKECH - CONTINUOUS

           We TRACK BEHIND Saturday as his footsteps echo down a 
           spiraling, stone STAIRWELL into a COURTYARD, where an 
           artificial BLUE SKY is projected on the high ceiling above.

           An eccentric crowd flows through the gates of an immaculate 
           stone MINARET, a structure out of place and time. Uneasy with 
           the friendly head nods and soulful eye contact he receives, 
           Saturday passes through to...

           INT. MARRAKECH - MAIN HALL

           ...a Moroccan palace adorned with Moucharabie, ornately 
           carved wood, stone columns, and streams. Hundreds of 
           REVELERS, mingle, lounge.

           CONTINUED:

           Saturday steps between RECONNECTION CIRCLES in which patrons 
           hold hands, lounge on each other, all listening attentively 
           to those who speak. A sense of love and calm permeates each 
           and every circle, the antithesis of the outside world. 

           Saturday catches snippets of their conversations...

                                 SPEAKER 1
                        ...the more populated the world becomes 
                        the less we value individual lives. We 
                        can hide behind our anonymity...

                                 SPEAKER 2
                        ...and I told him it was okay to be 
                        scared. For me, sickness had been this 
                        major wake-up call...

                                 SPEAKER 3
                        ...when the Bureau finally came to our 
                        home and took my sibling. Guilt nearly 
                        killed my mother following my brother’s 
                        processing...

           Saturday is entranced by the speakers’ choice of topics. He 
           nears center court, where a FOUNTAIN springs from a basin. 

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - MEANWHILE

           Sitting at a FOOD STAND, Thursday sips Turkish Coffee, 
           anxiously eyeing the Marrakech entrance. Suddenly a Taxi Pod 
           pulls up, blocking his view.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Oh, come on...

           A tense pause before a door opens and out steps...Jerry 
           Pertridge.

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                          (his suspicions confirmed)
                        Saturday’s meeting Pertridge.

           Thursday abandons the cart, struck by an idea. If he can 
           intercept Jerry before he enters, he can pretend to be 
           Saturday. 

           The STAND OWNER notices his customer leaving and pursues...

                                 STAND OWNER
                        Hey! You no pay! 

           Jerry greets the bouncers as Thursday forces his way through 
           the crowd, advancing on him. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The same glaring bouncer as earlier notices Thursday making a 
           bee-line for Jerry, pursued by the angry Stand Owner. They’re 
           making a scene...

                                 THURSDAY 
                        Jerry!

           But Jerry can’t hear his name over the din of the Souq.
           Thursday nears Jerry just as he’s about to enter.

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        Jerry!

           Jerry spins just as the watchful bouncer, sensing a threat, 
           TAZES Thursday, who drops to the ground. 

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. MARRAKECH - MEANWHILE

           Saturday sits at one of the BARS and flags down a BARTENDER, 
           ogling the scene, a stranger in a strange land. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        Bourbon on the rocks. 

                                 BARTENDER 
                        We serve no alcohol here, my brother. It 
                        clouds perception. Perhaps you’d care to 
                        join me for some mint tea?

           The bartender pours fresh mint tea, lifting the traditional 
           Moroccan teapot high above the slender glass.

           Saturday is about to take a sip when he sees a vision in a 
           flowing red gown emerge from the stairwell- ADRIAN KNOWLES. 

           Heads turn as Adrian passes, drawn to her grace and beauty. 

           Entranced, Saturday sets his glass down and walks towards 
           her. She smiles, setting his heart aflutter. 

           They embrace and kiss lustfully. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I missed you, Terrence. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        You have no idea how badly I missed you.

           Saturday is momentarily distracted by a Reconnection Circle 
           that shouts at the top of their lungs- WE’RE ALIVE!

           CONTINUED:

                                 ADRIAN 
                        I know this can be a lot to take in.

                                 SATURDAY
                        So this is Marrakech... 

                                 ADRIAN
                        It means Land of God. It was built to 
                        reclaim what’s been lost- empathy, eye 
                        contact, a deeper connection between us. 
                        I’m sure you’ve felt the sickness out 
                        there, Terrence. Marrakech is the closest 
                        thing I’ve found to a cure. People come 
                        here to embrace humanity, to celebrate 
                        one another, to connect, with no fear or 
                        judgment. Where others put up walls, 
                        Marrakech opens doors. 

           Saturday is not only enchanted by the concept but by Adrian’s 
           passion in detailing it. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        It sounds like some kind of social club.

                                 ADRIAN
                        If you allow it, Marrakech goes much 
                        deeper than that.
                          (then)
                        From the moment we met I wanted to share 
                        this with you because I could feel that 
                        you were different, that you wanted more 
                        from your life. But getting you here was 
                        always such an ordeal with that schedule 
                        of yours. 

           Adrian strokes Saturday’s face with her fingers. He’s putty 
           in her hands. 

                                 ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                        But now you’re here and I’m just...I’m so 
                        thrilled you came. I wasn’t sure you 
                        would after how we left things. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        I promised you everything would work out, 
                        didn’t I?

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - MEANWHILE

           Seated at his desk, a man possessed, Detective Shooker 
           reviews the SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE. Displayed on the monitor- 
           dressed in athletic garb, Wednesday exits the building.

                        Dug through Settman’s file. Couldn’t find 
                        anything that connected him to Thorin or 
                        Cayman. You still picking that apart?

           Shooker PAUSES on the image of Wednesday. 

                                 SHOOKER 
                        It was hard to be certain through the 
                        rain and the crowd but the tape confirms 
                        it. The man we saw across the street was 
                        Settman. Look.

           Shooker FAST FORWARDS through the day. Sparse activity. An 
           elderly tenant discovers Eddie’s body. The police arrive, 
           Nina, Shooker and Lee included. But no return by Wednesday. 

                                 SHOOKER (CONT'D)
                        He was just returning home when we exited 
                        the building. 

                                 LEE 
                        Then who did we speak with in the unit? 
                        Who walked us downstairs?

                                 SHOOKER
                        It had to be a different man.

           Saturday and Adrian sit in a Reconnection Circle, amongst a

                        When I’m on-call it’s equally rough on my 
                        personal life. But I truly believe if you 
                        care about someone and you want a 
                        relationship to work, you find time. It’s 
                        just that one day a week wasn’t cutting 
                        it for me anymore.

                        starting over? 

           The members of the circle nod and smile in support. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’d really like that. 

           Saturday notices as most of the Reconnection circles filter 
           out of the hall, heading downstairs.

                        Where’s everyone going?

           DANCE HALL - MOMENTS LATER 

           Emerging into a massive club, Saturday is awe-struck to 
           behold- a Moroccan BAND blaring Arabic electronic music atop 
           a PLATFORM suspended above a raging dance floor. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You didn’t think we were going to sit 
                        around and talk all night, did you?!

           MOMENTS LATER, on the DANCE FLOOR, Saturday is a phenomenal 
           dancer, employing his musical theater training to twirl 
           Adrian like a pro. 

                                 ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                        You never mentioned you were such a good

                        There’s a lot you don’t know about me! 

           Adrian presses her body against Saturday’s. She lunges in to 
           kiss him and pulls away to get a good look at his face. 

                                 ADRIAN

           From Thursday’s POV- we see halos and a series of 
           intimidating silhouettes visible through the haze. 

           Sweating, terrified, Thursday tries to rise from his chair 
           but he’s bound to it by rope. 

           Jerry steps close, towering menacingly over Thursday.

                        the contract? Or why the loan originated 
                        from the IP address assigned to the 
                        Tablet in your office?

           Thursday follows Jerry and Hartash, surveying the organized 
           chaos around him, a hi-tech space modeled after campaign 
           headquarters, teeming with activity- 

           A cluster of REVOLUTIONARIES discuss strategy around a

           DANCE FLOOR and party below, unaware that just under his nose 
           Saturday dances with Adrian. 

           Arriving at a TABLET WORK STATION, Hartash expertly sifts

           Thursday’s eyes widen upon first glance...

                        Can you click to the signature page? 

           Hartash pulls up the final page- revealing the name Terrence 
           Settman, accompanied by his SIGNATURE and DATE. 

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        August 14th. That was...
                          (realizing)
                        ...last Monday...

           The room begins to spin as Thursday makes sense of the facts- 
           Monday generated the loan and never told them. Why? 

                                 HARTASH
                        If what you tell us is true, then you 
                        have been directly targeted.

           Thursday struggles to remain focused...

                                 THURSDAY
                        Huh? Targeted by whom?

                                 HARTASH
                        Does Cayman have something on you, 
                        information he could hold over your head 
                        that might prevent you from exposing his 
                        exploits?

                        submitted by Cayman, who ran the census 
                        bureau prior to his CAB post. You’ll 
                        notice the numbers are inflated by a 
                        margin of about 40%.

                        To ensure that the Child Allocation Act 
                        passed. The man wanted upward mobility 
                        and the Bureau post was his meal ticket. 

                                 HARTASH
                        He’s still manipulating figures to 
                        ratchet up support for his enterprise.

                        Our census data shows the District’s 
                        population has been steadily decreasing 
                        over the past sixteen years.

                        We’re just grazing the surface. We also 
                        have reason to believe Cayman was 
                        responsible for Senator Humphreys’ not so 
                        mysterious disappearance.

                        Humphreys was spearheading a campaign to 
                        overturn the Child Allocation Act just a 
                        few years back and he was gaining allies.

                        Because they didn’t want you to.

                        Do you understand the implications of 
                        Cayman running a privatized Bureau?

                                 HARTASH
                        Cayman’s just one small cog in a much 
                        bigger machine. I’m sure you’ve seen the 
                        campaign on the streets- you eat less, 
                        everyone gets to eat. It’s fabricated, 
                        complete bullshit.

                        A few days ago The Department of 
                        Agriculture scorched fields that were 
                        tainted with some vague mutant bug. We 
                        had heard this exact story before so we 
                        sent field agents out to question the 
                        farmers. No one would comment. They were 
                        scared shitless. But one called us 
                        anonymously yesterday claiming there 
                        wasn’t a pest in a hundred mile radius.

                        The Department of Agriculture destroys 
                        food to drive prices up. The more 
                        expensive it is, the fewer people can 
                        afford it and the poorest among us die.

                        which side you’re on. Because as we speak 
                        Cayman is meeting with government 
                        regulators to close the deal.

                        We can help you, but it’s going to 
                        require you to go out on a limb, to risk 
                        everything.

           Terrified, Sunday watches the MONITOR- Agent 63 exits the

           His expression darkened, Thursday hangs up and notices Jerry

           Seconds later, Jerry turns to find that Thursday is gone. 
           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - MEANWHILE

           The security desk is unmanned. At 63’s command three agents 
           split up to canvass the lobby. Signalling all clear, they 
           file into the elevator. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - CONTROL ROOM - MEANWHILE

           Hyperventilating, talking on his Tablet, Sunday opens the

                        street.

           Sunday presses the button on the TIMER, initiating the 
           DETONATION COUNTDOWN: 04:59, 58, 57... 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The four daunting agents all stare up at the digital display, 
           the floor numbers rapidly climbing. Passing FLOOR 8, AGENTS 
           38, 12 and 5 remove their weapons in sync. 

           63 pays close attention to eager Agent 5, new to the field. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        Just follow my lead. 

           Agent 5 nods. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEDIA ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sunday takes one final look at his home. He spots a digital 
           picture frame. A PHOTO cycles in- Karen holds Fourteen-Year-
           Old Terrence’s hand in front of the Central Park Aviary. 

                                 SUNDAY

           The three agents swarm in, weapons raised, and disperse 
           throughout the flat, followed by Agent 63, who conducts the 
           silent raid with a series of hand signals.  

           COAT CLOSET - MEANWHILE

           Hearing the agents clambering in the adjacent room, Sunday 
           clears aside hanging clothes, revealing the LIFT PANEL. 
           Petrified, he peers into the shaft...

                        this alive. If only to see another day. 

           Sunday climbs through the opening and steps onto the lift, 
           which dips under his weight.

           Sunday emerges from the shaft, overwhelmed by claustrophobia. 
           He climbs the ladder leading to the man-hole. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Sunday frantically emerges from the tunnel, able to breathe 
           again, cleansed by the pounding rain. 

           He looks around to get his bearings and is immediately 
           PUMMELED by a speeding DELIVERY POD.

           Trapped under the front bumper, Sunday is dragged over the 
           polarized track until the vehicle finally halts, torpedoing 
           him out. Sunday skids over the rain-slicked pavement and 
           finally comes to a stop.

           Illuminated by the headlights, the skin on his back ripped to

           before collapsing to the pavement, his crucifix dropping into 
           a puddle. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEANWHILE

           Agents 38, 12 and 5 methodically search through shelves, 
           bedding, drawers, the shower, closets, personal miscellany. 

           The evidence- clothing, furniture, toiletries for one.  

           EXT. CITY STREET - MEANWHILE

           Thursday notices halted traffic outside his building. He 
           discovers Sunday’s lifeless body resting in a puddle, 
           surrounding on-lookers more entertained than concerned.  

           Distraught, Thursday rushes to his side. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        No!
                          (paranoid of the crowd)
                        All of you clear out!

           A pedestrian notes the uncanny resemblance between the men 
           and stares, appalled, as if in the presence of a leper. 

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        Seen enough?

           Thursday picks up Sunday’s crucifix, fastens it around his 
           neck and races away from the accident. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION BOOTH (PRESENT TIME)

           Thursday grasps the crucifix through his shirt, chokes back 
           tears.

                        credible a source Detective Shooker is. 
                        Adult siblings simply do not exist.

           But Agent 5 is steadfast. He exposes the lever along the base 
           of the wall, depresses it.

           The agents turn to find a large panel in the wall opening, 
           revealing the CONTROL ROOM. 

                                 AGENT 63 
                        You were saying...

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - CONTROL ROOM - CABINET - MEANWHILE

           UNSEEN, the TIMER counts down in the dark: 01:40...

           We PULL OUT of the closed cabinet to reveal... 

           63 opens a drawer and removes a digital ALBUM. He browses 
           PHOTOS of the Settman seven as children, with Karen at birth, 
           on birthdays, graduations. In utter disbelief... 

                                 AGENT 63 
                        Septuplets...?

           He examines Monday’s whimsical PORTRAITS of the seven. 

           Agent 63 opens a cabinet, revealing: a slim TIMER. 14 SECONDS 
           and counting. A wave of dread sweeps over him. 

           63 enters the MEDIA ROOM...

                                 AGENT 63 (CONT'D)
                        We have to vacate now!

           The TIMER counts down as the agents sprint out of the 
           unit...3...2...1...

           HALLWAY 

           The Agents sprint down the hall just as the wall shatters, 
           concrete fragments spraying out. We FOLLOW a piece that 
           grazes 63’s face, cutting him beneath the eye. 
           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The Settman unit erupts in a MUTED BLAST, debris raining down 
           upon the street, pedestrians below running for cover. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jarred from the blast, 63 storms towards the Settman unit. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        I want a Tracer Kit brought up here 
                        immediately.  

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - SEPTUPLETS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Agents 5 and 38 use statically charged BATONS to retrieve 
           samples of HAIR and DEAD SKIN from the Settman’s charred 
           belongings. 

           In the MEDIA ROOM...a silver briefcase, a TRACER KIT, is 
           opened. Secured inside custom-fit padding is a 1m-long
           TUBULAR weapon, resembling a smaller, sleeker Bazooka, a 
           TRACKING TABLET and a conical cartridge- the TRACER. 

           Agent 63 withdraws the Tracer, presses his thumb to its 
           underside and the device whirs to life in a SPECTRUM OF
           LIGHTS. Agent 5 ogles the technology. 

           63 flips a switch, activating the Tracer’s lid, which rises, 
           exposing a PORT. In turn, Agents 5 and 38 insert their static 
           batons into the Tracer, which sucks up their samples. 

           Agent 12 removes a Tracking Tablet from the case and turns it 
           on, syncing it with the Tracer. A DISPLAY lists the DNA test 
           results- six unidentified humans and Terrence Settman. 

                                 AGENT 12
                        We’ve been able to track siblings in the 
                        past off a single fallen eyelash. 

                                 AGENT 5
                        Damn. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        No sibling has ever outrun the Bureau. 

           Agent 63 slides the Tracer into the Tubular Gun, turns it on, 
           creating an ear-piercing WHINE. 

           All of a sudden his Tablet rings. He looks at the ID- CAB HQ. 
           He’s about to answer but silences it, determined. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           63 fires the Tracer skyward through the blasted unit ceiling.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The Tracer rockets above rain-soaked urbanity. As it reaches 
           its apex it begins to gently pulse before sending out a SONIC 
           SHOCKWAVE that shrouds the entire area within a 5km radius. 

           We FOLLOW the pulse as it soars outward, blanketing the 
           concrete jungle until it washes over Thursday. From his POV-
           the world is momentarily bathed in a rainbow-tinged halo.

           Thursday falters, dizzy, unsure what he’s experiencing. He 
           stumbles into a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - CONTINUOUS

           Agent 63 presses a switch on the Tubular gun, triggering the 
           WHINE. The Tracer is magnetically pulled back through the 
           rain-soaked hole it created and into the barrel. 

           Agent 12 examines the Tracking Tablet- over a dozen traces 
           have been pin-pointed- everywhere the Settman siblings have 
           left a DNA trace in a 5km area. 

                                                                 PAN TO:

           The antique clock, miraculously still in working order, 
           though worse for wear. Its second hand shutters as it 
           completes its cycle, pushing the minute and hour hands onto 
           the XII. Distorted BELLS chime. MIDNIGHT.

           SUPER: Thursday

           EXT. CITY STREET - LATE NIGHT

           Soaked from the deluge, Agent 63 examines Sunday’s corpse 
           while Agent 12 analyzes the tracking grid.

                                 AGENT 12
                        One of them descended underground not far 
                        from here. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - MEANWHILE

           Thursday scans the train schedule- the next arrives in TWO 
           MINUTES. 

           Out of the corner of his eye he notices Agent 63, descending 
           steps into the station. The two lock eyes, 63 stopped in his 
           tracks as he blocks the pedestrian flow like a boulder in 
           rapids. 63 flinches. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thursday frenziedly pushes his way to the opposite end of the 
           station.

           Agent 63 forces his way through the mass on his frustratingly 
           slow pursuit after Thursday. 

           Nearing the opposite entrance just as the train pulls in, 
           Thursday spies Agent 12 making her way downstairs. Thursday 
           spins to find Agent 63 mere steps behind. He’s book-ended. 

           With no choice, Thursday bounds off the loading platform in 
           front of the slowing train. He tries to out run it. From our 
           vantage point, we’re unable to see if he made it...

                                 AGENT 63 
                        Damn it!

           Agent 63 and 12 wait anxiously for passengers to disembark 
           and board. The train departs. The Agents scan the tracks...

           Thursday’s nowhere to be seen. 

                                 AGENT 63 (CONT'D)
                          (undeterred)
                        We’re close. 

           EXT. ADRIAN’S BUILDING - LATE NIGHT

           Adrian leads Saturday up the steps of an elegant two-story 
           brownstone, a rare domicile in a district of hi-rises. 

           Adrian unlocks the door. 

                                 SATURDAY 
                        Allow me, my love.

           Saturday theatrically sweeps her off her feet and carries her 
           in his arms through the threshold. 

           INT. ADRIAN’S UNIT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Saturday undresses Adrian like the apocalypse is nigh. He 
           unfastens her dress straps, exposing her perfect breasts. He 
           kisses the nape of her neck, her mouth. 

           Adrian pulls Saturday by the belt into her...

           BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...and pushes him onto the bed. She slinks away. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        Where are you going?

                        Can’t a woman have a pee?

           BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian closes the door and tries to turn on the light but it 
           doesn’t work. In the dark, she approaches the toilet...

           CLOSE ON Adrian as she wipes herself and flushes. She turns 
           on the faucet, admires her shadowy reflection. 

           Suddenly, a HAND clasps over her mouth...

           We PAN UP to reveal...MONDAY, very much alive, though a three 
           day stubble and bags under his bloodshot eyes tell a tale of 
           sleepless struggle. 

           Horrified, Adrian screams, though the sound comes out 
           muffled. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Shhh. Shhh. Adrian, it’s me, Terrence. 

           Writhing in his arms, Adrian sees Monday’s reflection in the 
           mirror and calms, puzzlement overwhelming threat.   

                                 SATURDAY (O.S.)
                        Adrian?

                                 MONDAY 
                        I can imagine how confused you must be.

           He leads her to the door and opens it slightly, revealing 
           Saturday sitting on the bed. Adrian is rattled as Monday 
           shuts the door. 

           He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. Confounded, Adrian 
           backpedals away from him. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        What the hell’s going on, Terrence?

                                 MONDAY
                        His life is far more complex than you can 
                        possibly imagine. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Who is that man out there?

           It’s hard to say out loud...

                                 MONDAY 
                        He’s...one of my brothers.

                                 MONDAY
                        One of seven, identical in every way. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh god. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Well, maybe not every way...

                        Adrian? You okay in there?

           Adrian moves to exit and Monday steps out of her way.

           BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian emerges from the bathroom, turns on the lights.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You have to go. 

           Saturday doesn’t understand the sudden change in attitude 
           until...Monday steps out, in a daze.  

                                 SATURDAY
                        Monday, what are you doing here?

                        What did you say to her?

           Saturday approaches Adrian, desperate...

                        Adrian, I swear I’ve wanted to tell you. 
                        I planned on telling you eventually. But 
                        protecting our secret is what’s kept us

                        Oh, I’ve wondered--

                                 SATURDAY
                        Because I am Saturday. It’s the only day 
                        I’m allowed out of our unit.

                        But I met you at the hospital on a

                          (off Saturday’s guilty look)
                        You’re not the man I first met are you?

           Saturday shakes his head no, looks to Monday... 

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - FLASHBACK

           As seen earlier, Monday and Adrian are seated on a bench.

                                 MONDAY 
                        Thank you, Dr. Knowles. You have no idea 
                        how much that means...to both of us. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Please, call me Adrian. 

           The scene continues from where we left off. Monday can’t 
           resist his overwhelming attraction... 

                                 MONDAY
                        Adrian, when your shift ends would you 
                        like to join me for a drink?

                                 ADRIAN

           As seen earlier, somber, Saturday stands before Karen’s

                        refuse to let you go so easily. 

           Adrian kisses Saturday on the lips. He’s caught off-guard by

                        I had to, to protect myself. But then I

           Adrian is speechless, upset. 

                                 SATURDAY (CONT'D)
                        Well...say something. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I would have had no problem with the fact 
                        that you’re a sibling. Siblings deserve 
                        love like everyone else. But the way you 
                        deceived me and toyed with me. I’m sorry, 
                        Terrence, or whomever you are, but I 
                        can’t have any part of this.

                                 MONDAY
                        Just accept that it’s finished. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        Shut up!

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ADRIAN
                        When I return...I expect you to both be 
                        gone.

           Monday laughs as Adrian bounds for the front door, Saturday 
           following...

                                 SATURDAY
                        Adrian, please don’t do this! 

           Adrian hesitates before exiting, torn...

                                 SATURDAY (CONT'D)
                          (desperate)
                        You make me more than just a day of the 
                        week. You make me a man. 

           But Adrian feels betrayed and overwhelmed by the strange 
           reality of the situation. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I really am sorry, Terrence. 

           She kisses him on the cheek and slams the doors behind her. 

                                 MONDAY 
                        It doesn’t matter, brother. The Bureau’s 
                        coming for us. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        What? 

                                 MONDAY
                        We’ve been listed. 

           Fire raging in his eyes, Saturday charges Monday, smashes him 
           against the wall. Shaken violently, Monday relinquishes.

                                 SATURDAY 
                        You swore to me that this would work! The 
                        only reason I ever agreed to your sick 
                        plan with Cayman was so that Adrian and I 
                        could have a life together! 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEDIA ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Thursday shuts off the TV as the brothers prepare to go to 
           bed. Monday passes Saturday discretely...

                                 MONDAY
                        You and I need to talk.
           KITCHEN - FLASHBACK 

           In a dark corner, Monday hands Saturday the Marrakech TICKET
           we saw earlier. He flips it over revealing the complete note- 
           TERRENCE, I HOPE YOU CAN JOIN ME. WITH LOVE, ADRIAN. 

                                 MONDAY 
                        You’re very lucky that arrived at the 
                        bank when I happened to be there. I’m not 
                        sure how the others might react if they 
                        were to find out you’ve been having a 
                        serious relationship with a woman. 

                                 SATURDAY
                          (timid)
                        You...you went out with her first. 

                                 MONDAY
                        A lapse in judgment, true. But I never 
                        saw her again. Nor do I want to. She’s 
                        far too...good for me. 

                                 SATURDAY 
                        I beg of you, Monday, don’t tell them. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Well, that depends. Drastic changes to 
                        our routine would have to be made for you 
                        to continue seeing Adrian. How far are 
                        you willing to go for this woman?

                                 SATURDAY
                          (desperate)
                        I’ll do anything. 

           INT. ADRIAN’S UNIT - BEDROOM 

           Saturday begins to cry, a helpless child. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        You used me. You blackmailed me. We were 
                        going to have a life together. We were 
                        going to start a family.

                                 MONDAY
                        I sincerely hope you didn’t plan on 
                        having more than one child. 

           Saturday’s cries turn to sobs. He completely breaks down. 
           Monday caresses his brother with one arm. It’s forced, eerie.

                        There, there Saturday. You know as well 
                        as I do that our lives were over the day 
                        we were born. 

           Saturday breaks away, steps back. 

                                 SATURDAY 
                        You’re wrong. The others are different 
                        than you. I’m different. 

                                 MONDAY
                        How? How are you any different? 

                                 SATURDAY
                        For starters, I’m not holding the knife.

           We PAN DOWN to reveal a glimmering BUTCHER’S KNIFE concealed 
           behind Monday’s back. 

           Monday slowly advances, possessed, distressed by what he 
           knows he must do...

                                 MONDAY
                        Right of Choice. You know as well as I do 
                        that only one of us can be Terrence 
                        Settman. 

           Having lost all will to live, Saturday doesn’t put up a fight 
           as Monday lunges the knife into his stomach. Saturday falters 
           and collapses to the floor. 

                                 SATURDAY
                        You didn’t tell me Cayman was sending a 
                        man to our unit.

                                 MONDAY
                        Hmm. Did I fail to mention that?

                                 SATURDAY
                        You were never going to let me live, were 
                        you?

                                 MONDAY 
                        I’m through sharing. 

           Monday kneels over his brother and twists the knife. 

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monday opens the front door, steps into the...
           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...ready to run. From his POV- the world around him is bathed 
           in a colored HALO, the Tracer’s resonance. The door to the 
           front entrance SHAKES. He knows- it’s the Bureau.

           Monday slams the door, bolts it once...and again. He races

           Monday exits, hops over the railing, a handful of unwitting 
           pedestrians breaking his single-story descent.

           Monday shakily rises and takes off into a crowd of onlookers.

           The front door topples inside the unit with a thunderous 
           CRASH! The Bureau agents storm in, their weapons drawn. 

           Agent 63 kneels to examine Saturday’s body, retrieves his 
           Tablet.

                                 AGENT 63
                        So, Mr. Settman...which one are you?

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION DEPARTMENT (PRESENT TIME)

           Walking through an aisle separating booths, Agent 57, the 
           young, platinum blonde seen earlier in Cayman’s office, 
           escorts a five-year-old SIBLING. 

           He passes Thursday’s booth and spies Agent 63 interrogating 
           an increasingly tired ‘Terrence Settman’ in the midst of 
           sharing his story. 

           Alarmed, Agent 57 presses a small, funnel-shaped metal AUDIO 
           AMPLIFIER to the glass and hears...

                                 THURSDAY
                          (filtered)
                        I was distraught. I imagined Monday and 
                        Saturday were meeting up, gloating over 
                        their success at tearing us all apart. 

           57 withdraws his Tablet and dials.

           Cayman is camped around a conference table with a team of

           contracts sprawled everywhere...

                                 GOVERNMENT REGULATOR
                        ...which will require legal recourse to

                        decide to outsource...

           Cayman’s Tablet RINGS. He looks at the caller ID...

                                 CAYMAN
                        Pardon me. 
                          (answering)
                        What is it?
                          (souring - rising)
                        Connect me with the lead agent who was 
                        assigned the case.
                          (to the others)
                        I apologize for the interruption but 
                        Bureau duties require my attention.

           We HOLD ON the HEAD ATTORNEY as he finishes his meal, pushing 
           aside a plate containing a single piece of uneaten SUSHI.

           Cayman bounds towards a waiting LIMOUSINE POD.

                                 AGENT 63
                        This is a rather unusual development, 
                        sir, hearing from you directly. 

                                 CAYMAN (V.O.)
                        I understand you’re handling the Settman 
                        case.

                        Has Right of Choice been determined? 

           Overhearing the conversation, Thursday grows worried at the 
           mention of Right of Choice...

                                 AGENT 63
                        Not yet, sir. I’m wrapping interrogation 
                        as we speak. 

                                 CAYMAN
                          (anxious)
                        And what has Settman told you precisely?

                                 AGENT 63
                        Enough to understand why you might take a 
                        personal interest in the case. 

                                 CAYMAN 
                        Listen to me carefully, Agent, because 
                        your future depends on it. The Settman 
                        case involves a sensitive political issue 
                        we cannot meddle with at present. The 
                        Settmans have been wrongfully listed and 
                        I want you to cease and desist at once. 
                        This case is temporarily suspended until 
                        I arrive at headquarters. 

           Agent 63 peers at Thursday, having grown empathetic for his 
           helpless victim. He’s torn.

                                 AGENT 63
                        I’m afraid I can’t do that, sir. 

           63 hangs up the Tablet. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE POD - CONTINUOUS

           Cayman is livid to have been hung up on. He lowers the glass 
           separating him from the DRIVER.

                        How long until we’re there?

                        Open the booth! You’ve been given orders! 
                          (into Tablet)
                        He won’t open it, sir. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        Ignore him. Let’s get this wrapped up. 
                        Two hours ago. How’d you find Monday?

                        All it took was a simple message. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - LATE NIGHT 

           Monday scrubs blood from his hands under run-off from a 
           rooftop gutter. He’s interrupted by his vibrating Tablet. He 
           looks at the screen, a message from Thursday- 

           I KNOW EVERYTHING.

           Crouched behind a dumpster, amongst of slew of homeless,

           meeting, Cayman eagerly answers his Tablet as the Legal Team 
           and Government Regulators begin to set up around the 
           conference table in the background. 

           A secretary sets a full plate of SUSHI before the Head 
           Attorney, who promptly unwraps a pair of chopsticks.

                                 CAYMAN
                          (grim - hushed)
                        You couldn’t have picked a worse time.

                        You think I’d be reaching out if I had 
                        any alternative? There are only two of us 
                        left. You hold up your end of the 
                        arrangement or I’ll expose you.  

                                 CAYMAN
                        How will my people be able to distinguish 
                        you from your sibling?

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAWN - SPLIT SCREEN

           Monday enters CENTRAL PARK from the West. Thursday from the 
           East. Both are determined as they march into battle. 

           They cut through patches of FOREST, a rare dose of ‘nature’ 
           fueling their primal rage. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK AVIARY - DAWN 

           Monday emerges from tree cover to view the unlit, latticed 
           structure, fenced off by a construction company for impending 
           demolition and reconstruction.  

           Monday squeezes through a narrow gap in a fence to find the 
           site littered with squatters. 

           He watches a homeless man squeeze through a cracked window 
           and follows him in. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK AVIARY - MOMENTS LATER 

           A fractured shell of what Karen designed years earlier. The 
           exotic birds are long since gone, replaced with scavengers. 
           The once lush trees are dead and decaying.

           Monday passes a family warming themselves around a trash can 
           fire, one of several illuminating the overcrowded space. 

           On edge, Monday surveys the aviary. A homeless man breaks 
           into a violent coughing fit. Monday covers his mouth.

           CRASH! Monday spins, fearful, as a mangy cat springs from the 
           shadows behind him. 

                                 MONDAY
                        THURSDAY!!! 

           The name ECHOES throughout the dome, causing a colony of bats 
           to abandon their perch and circle frantically. 

                                 THURSDAY (O.S.)
                        Did you miss us, brother?!

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Monday turns to behold Thursday peering down from an upper 
           level terrace. 

                                 MONDAY 
                        Would your opinion of me change if I did?

           Monday walks parallel to Thursday as he heads to a spiral 
           walkway leading downstairs. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        If all we are is a reflection of what 
                        we’re exposed to then we should have seen 
                        this coming.  

                                 MONDAY
                        Why do you say that?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Everyone knows Monday is the worst day of 
                        the week. 

                                 MONDAY 
                        I guess you could say I’ve had a bad case 
                        of the Mondays for a while now. 

           Thursday descends the walkway, keeping Monday in his sight. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        And what about Saturday? What was his 
                        excuse?

                                 MONDAY
                        The poor sap fell in lust.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Is that where he was running off to 
                        tonight? To see a woman?

                                 MONDAY 
                        You remember Doctor Adrian Knowles.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Mother’s doctor? 

                                 MONDAY
                        He was seeing her for some time. But she 
                        gave him an ultimatum. Either he makes 
                        himself more available or she ends it. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        And you took advantage of that.

                                 MONDAY 
                        Taking a page out of our playbook, it 
                        would have been careless of me to execute 
                        a plan without a back-up. Having Saturday 
                        on the inside kept me informed if 
                        something went wrong. 
                          (bitterly laughing)
                        And this couldn’t have gone more wrong.

                                 THURSDAY
                        I don’t understand. Why not just kill us 
                        in the unit yourself? You’ve had 
                        countless opportunities...

                                 MONDAY
                        Do you think that thought didn’t cross my 
                        mind every moment of every day? But there 
                        was no way I could live with your blood 
                        on my hands. Imagining myself killing you 
                        felt strangely like suicide. So I took 
                        advantage of an opportunity that was 
                        presented to me.

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - EXECUTIVE OFFICE - FLASHBACK 

           MONTAGE: Nicholas Cayman and Monday shake hands. Cayman 
           presents a Business Proposal in the form of a slide-show. 

                                 MONDAY (V.O.)
                        Cayman came to the bank three weeks ago, 
                        making the rounds to raise funds for his 
                        new venture. He was struggling to get 
                        what he needed. 

           INT. SETTMAN UNIT - MEDIA ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Monday delivers his end-of-the-day presentation to the other 
           Settmans, seated around the circular table. 

                                 MONDAY (V.O.)
                        And I could relate. So I never mentioned 
                        our encounter in my end-of-the-day. 

           INT. CAYMAN’S OFFICE - FLASHBACK

           Cayman and Monday sit opposite each other in the PARLOR ROOM. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        You got what you wanted. We’re alone. 

           Monday waits for the elevator doors to close behind Joe.

           CONTINUED:

                                 MONDAY
                        What if I told you that a powerful public 
                        figure was actually a front for a family 
                        of seven identical adult siblings? 

                                 CAYMAN
                        Adult siblings don’t exist. 
                          (dubious)
                        Is this visit related to the proposal I 
                        laid out at the bank?

                                 MONDAY
                        I assure you this family of siblings does 
                        exist. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        Who’s your source?

                                 MONDAY
                        First things first, if the Bureau brought 
                        siblings in, can you guarantee one of 
                        them Right of Choice?

                                 CAYMAN 
                        Even if I could make that guarantee, 
                        exposing adult siblings would be an 
                        indelible stain on the Bureau’s pristine 
                        track record. It would undermine our 
                        efficacy, the technology we use, as well 
                        as my reputation. 

                                 MONDAY
                        So, in effect, you’d stand to benefit 
                        more from their disappearance than from 
                        their processing?

                                 CAYMAN
                        I think you know the answer to that. 

                                 MONDAY
                        I just wanted to hear you say it. 
                          (then)
                        Would you be willing to help facilitate 
                        these siblings’ disappearance if I were 
                        able to secure the financing you need for 
                        your acquisition?

           Cayman is more than intrigued... 

                                 CAYMAN 
                        Tell me what’s required of me.

           Monday rises to excuse himself. Cayman gets up to follow. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        How do I know you can be trusted?

                                 MONDAY
                        Because that powerful public figure, 
                        those siblings I mentioned...
                          (beat)
                        ...I’m one of them. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK AVIARY 

           Thursday arrives at the base of the walkway, finally on equal 
           ground with Monday.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Was it so horrible living with us? 

                                 MONDAY
                        Six days a week we spent locked up in 
                        isolation with six other grown men, not a 
                        shred of privacy, not a single real 
                        friend or lover or escape, playing out 
                        the same routine again and again, the 
                        ridiculous charade we had to maintain 
                        every time we left the unit. That was no 
                        life, brother. That was a slow death.

           Thursday advances, the brothers both ready to pounce. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        True our life may not have been what we 
                        dreamed for ourselves but you made the 
                        choice to dwell in the negative, to harp 
                        over what you lacked versus what you had. 
                        Despite the sacrifices we all made, I 
                        cherished the time we had together. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Of course you did. But I’ll never forgive 
                        Mother for bringing a single sibling into 
                        this world, let alone seven of us. I 
                        think I could’ve tolerated it better if I 
                        had never known what I was missing. But 
                        unleashing me into the world...that was 
                        her fatal mistake. 
                          (beat)
                        Mother once told us that a fraction of a 
                        life is better than none at all...

                        I remember. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Even she ultimately realized that was a 
                        lie. But the rest of you...you were 
                        living too deep in delusion to ever fully 
                        acknowledge it. But once you have, 
                        there’s no turning back. 
                          (beat)
                        I’m sorry Thursday, but I need Terrence 
                        Settman all for my lonesome.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Then you best come and take it. 

           The brothers circle one another, both on guard.  

           Monday throws a jab which Thursday evades. Monday throws 
           another, clocks Thursday in the jaw. He spits up blood.

           Monday charges in to tackle his brother and Thursday pummels 
           him in the gut, keeling him over. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Ahh! Try to keep it above the neck. You 
                        do enough damage, maybe the Bureau won’t 
                        recognize me. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE POD (PRESENT TIME)

           Cayman is growing restless as he peers out the window and 
           views an awaiting BUREAU POD.

                                 CAYMAN
                        Stop the vehicle!

           EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Cayman exits the limo and enters the BUREAU POD, which merges 
           into traffic, automatically forcing all stopped vehicles in 
           its path off the track as it advances, unimpeded. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK AVIARY - DAWN 

           Monday charges, swinging recklessly. Thursday counters, using 
           Monday’s momentum to throw him to the ground.  

           Monday rises, turns to find Thursday is nowhere to be seen.

           Monday picks up a jagged piece of REBAR and creeps forward in 
           a tense game of cat and mouse. He overreacts to the slightest 
           stimulus- a homeless man tosses an empty liquor bottle. A 
           cockroach scurries by his feet. 

           He spies a figure hiding behind a tree trunk. He advances, 
           rebar raised, ready to strike when all of a sudden he hears 
           footsteps from behind. He spins to behold Thursday just as he 
           smashes a half-charred plank across his chest. 

           Ash snows upon the brothers as Thursday straddles Monday’s 
           fallen body and begins to beat his face with a devastating 
           series of blows. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        You destroyed our family! You destroyed 
                        our routine! You destroyed any chance of 
                        a future!

           Monday struggles to reach for the fallen rebar, an inch out 
           of his grasp. He finally grabs it and smacks Thursday upside 
           the head!  

                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

           From Thursday’s POV- we open our eyes to find Monday atop of 
           us, strangling us with every ounce of strength he can muster. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Welcome home, Thursday. You have a 
                        productive day?

           Veins bulging, skin flushed blue, Thursday claws at Monday’s 
           hands, trying in vain to loosen his grip. But he’s becoming 
           weak, gurgling for air. He’s unable to resist much longer. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        Yes...

           With his last ounce of energy, Thursday waves his hand. 

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        ...I did.

           A SHOT rings out, piercing through Monday’s shoulder. 

           Monday falls to the side, revealing Joe, her weapon aimed, 
           Reggie by her side. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Joe hovers over Thursday as he gasps for air. 

                                 JOE
                        You should have given us more notice, 
                        Settman.

           Monday eyes Joe with disgust.

                                 MONDAY
                        You shot me. You bitch!
                          (stunned - to Thursday)
                        More notice?

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - FLASHBACK

           Thursday enters the eastern end of the park, on his Tablet. 
           The call we thought was made by Monday earlier was actually 
           made by Thursday. We see HIGHLIGHTS-

                                 THURSDAY 
                        You think I’d be reaching out if there 
                        was any alternative? There are only two 
                        of us left. You hold up your end of the 
                        arrangement or I’ll expose you.  

                                 CAYMAN (V.O.)
                        How will my people be able to distinguish 
                        you from your sibling?

           We continue the scene from where we left off...

                                 THURSDAY
                        I’m wearing a crucifix around my neck.

                                 CAYMAN (V.O.)
                        Where should my associates be sent?

                                 THURSDAY
                        The Aviary in Central Park. And be quick. 
                        Your Bureau agents are not far behind. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK AVIARY 

           Joe turns her gun on Monday, who begins to backpedal, shaky, 
           desperately searching for an escape. 

                                 MONDAY 
                        What the hell do you think you’re doing?! 
                        I’m the one who set up the deal with 
                        Cayman! Me!

                                 THURSDAY
                        He’s lying.

           CONTINUED:

           Joe presses her gun to Monday’s head. 

                                 MONDAY
                        Do it. For Christ’s sake just end it 
                        already! It’s over! 

                                 JOE
                        It’s over for the both of you. I’ve been 
                        sent to cut loose ends. 

                                 AGENT 63 (O.S.)
                        Child Allocation Bureau! Drop the weapon!

           Joe turns to find Agent 63 and his colleagues scattered on 
           the upper and lower levels, their weapons trained on her. She 
           grabs Monday, using him as a human shield until she reaches 
           cover behind a flaming trash can.  

           She and Reggie open fire on the agents. 

           MOS. Thursday crawls to cover, watching the fire fight. A 
           barrage of high impact bullets are exchanged. Reggie is 
           quickly sniped. Joe strikes Agent 5 in the leg. 

           Monday capitalizes on the distraction and slinks out through 
           the cracked window. 

           Joe stops to reload and peers up to find Agent 12’s gun aimed 
           square between her eyes. Joe gently sets her gun down. 

           Thursday walks to Agent 63, his arms raised in surrender. 

                                 THURSDAY 
                        My sibling took off on foot. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAWN 

           Terrified, fading in and out of consciousness, Monday flees 
           into the early morning light. He looks over his shoulder at 
           the Aviary just as Agent 63 calmly steps out.

           63 snaps an ATTACHMENT onto the barrel of his weapon, takes 
           sight of Monday through a scope and fires. 

           We SOAR with a large black pellet that strikes Monday in the 
           back and instantly envelops him in a NET. A neurotoxin is 
           released from the net fibers, tranquilizing Monday. 

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

                        We always knew it was only a matter of 
                        time before the Bureau caught up with us. 

                                                                FADE IN:

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION DEPARTMENT (PRESENT TIME)

           We DESCEND on the spot-lit booth where Thursday finishes 
           recounting the Settman story...

                                 THURSDAY
                        And finally you have. 

           EXT. C.A.B. HEADQUARTERS - MEANWHILE 

           Cayman trudges up the steps of the front entrance...

           INT. THURSDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH - MEANWHILE

           Agent 63 resumes working and types rapidly on his Tablet.

                                 AGENT 63
                        It was impressive to hear you relate the 
                        details of your experiences. Your 
                        recollection of people’s appearances, 
                        mannerisms, their exact spoken words, all 
                        accounted for so meticulously.  

                                 THURSDAY
                        It’s how we were taught to view the 
                        world. Communication was our life blood. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        So the other siblings shared this gift as 
                        well, this heightened sense of awareness?

                                 THURSDAY
                        Some more than others. 

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION DEPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 

           Cayman storms through aisles of booths, enraged, drawing 
           curious stares from working Bureau agents and siblings. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        Where is he? Where the hell is he?!

           Ingratiating Agent 57 intercepts Cayman...

                                 AGENT 57
                        I’ll take you there, sir. 
           INT. THURSDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH - MEANWHILE

           Agent 63 peruses the contents of his report. On his Tablet, 
           we see IMAGES, MESSAGES and a CALL LOG retrieved from the 
           working Settman Tablets- the blurry Panda King photo, WILL 
           MEET YOU AT TEN, I KNOW EVERYTHING, calls to NICHOLAS CAYMAN. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        Ultimately we’re left with two surviving 
                        siblings. You and...

           Agent 63 turns to regard an adjacent booth WE’VE BEEN UNABLE 
           TO SEE UNTIL NOW...

                                 AGENT 63 (CONT'D)
                        Monday, is it?

           MONDAY, alive, is sitting five meters away from Thursday, 
           being interrogated in an adjacent booth by Agent 12! 

                                 THURSDAY
                        That’s correct. 

           We RISE out of Thursday’s booth and descend into... 

           MONDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Monday is battered, and desperate...

                                 MONDAY
                          (points at Thursday)
                        I’m telling you my he’s a certifiable 
                        lunatic. He tried to kill me and my 
                        siblings to claim the life of Terrence 
                        Settman for himself. Can you wrap your 
                        red-tape riddled brain around that? 

           Silent, dubious, Agent 12 types into her report. 

                                 MONDAY (CONT'D)
                        Well, can you?!

                                 AGENT 12
                        If that is in fact the case, Mr. Settman, 
                        then your brother has done the Bureau a 
                        service.

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION DEPARTMENT - MEANWHILE

           Just then, Agent 57 deposits Nicholas Cayman at Thursday’s 
           booth. Cayman is seething, staring needles at 63 as he bangs 
           on the glass. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CAYMAN
                        Agent, step out of the booth now!

           Surrounding Agents begin to emerge from their booths to ogle 
           the spectacle Cayman is causing. 

           Knowing he has to exit eventually, 63 calmly rises and is 
           about to unlock the door when Thursday utters something that 
           causes 63 to stop and face his captive, his countenance 
           shifted as though he’s received bad news. 

           From Cayman and Monday’s POV’s- Thursday is inaudible. 

                                 CAYMAN (CONT'D)
                        Open the booth immediately!

           Agent 63 places a call on his Tablet. In the adjacent booth, 
           Agent 12 curiously answers her Tablet, eyes locked with 63. 

           63 ends the call and opens the booth door, whereupon Cayman 
           grabs him by the neck and slams him against the booth wall. 

                                 CAYMAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you have a mental defect Agent?! You 
                        were ordered to cease and desist!

           Agent 63 proudly takes the abuse, a subtle smirk spreading 
           across his cheeks. Is it disgust? Or is there more?

           In the background, talking on her cell, Agent 12 exits 
           Monday’s interrogation booth.

           Monday watches anxiously, unsure what’s taking place. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        This agency isn’t some weapon to wield as 
                        you see fit, sir. 

           Cayman leans in close to whisper.

                                 CAYMAN
                        That’s where you’re wrong. In a matter of 
                        days I will personally control the 
                        listings, as well as Right of Choice. 
                        Sibling or not, names might appear on 
                        that list, perhaps even Bureau agents in 
                        our very midst. 

           For a moment, it appears as though 63 is cowed. Thursday sits 
           glum, surrendering to his grim fate. 

           Cayman addresses the timid, staring Agents who surround...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CAYMAN (CONT'D)
                        Now listen to me, all of you! This case 
                        is hereby terminated! Right of Choice has 
                        been denied and both Settman’s will be 
                        processed! Is that sufficiently clear?

           The Bureau agents regard one another, uncertain but fearful 
           of Cayman. 

           In the BOOTH...Thursday looks up, defeated. Time has run out. 
           Or has it? 63 looks across to 12 just as she hangs up her 
           Tablet. She peers at Thursday, then back to 63 and nods, 
           before returning to Monday’s booth.

           With great resolve Agent 63 retorts...

                                 AGENT 63 
                        You’re too late. The wheels have already 
                        been set in motion. 

                                 CAYMAN
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 AGENT 63
                        Considering the Settman’s unique 
                        circumstances, we explored...
                          (looking at Agent 12)
                        ...other alternatives. 

           MONDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Monday scowls at his processing agent.

                                 MONDAY 
                        What sort of alternatives?

           A pregnant pause.

                                 AGENT 12
                        Your sibling has already struck a deal...

           We PULL IN on Monday as he snaps his around to look at 
           Thursday. All blood drains from Monday’s face...

                        The Aviary in Central Park. And be quick. 
                        The Bureau’s not far behind. 

           Thursday hangs up and makes a SECOND CALL... 

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERCUT - FLASHBACK

           Seated at his desk, Detective Shooker answers his Tablet...

                                 SHOOKER
                        Detective Shooker.

                                 THURSDAY
                        Detective, this is Terrence Settman.

           Shooker waves Lee over and puts the call on SPEAKER...

                                 THURSDAY (CONT'D)
                        Would it be possible for the GMPD to 
                        offer me transactional immunity from 
                        Bureau processing? 

                                 SHOOKER
                        It’s never been done. But if it were 
                        possible, what incentive would we have in 
                        assisting you?

                                 THURSDAY
                        What if I could deliver Nicholas Cayman?

           HOLD ON Shooker, beyond intrigued...

           SERIES OF SHOTS - FLASHBACK

           In the AVIARY...Agent 12 arrests Joe. Agent 38 bags Reggie.

           In the POLICE STATION...the Bureau Agents turn Joe over to 
           Detectives Shooker and Lee for interrogation. 

           In POLICE INTERROGATION...Shooker bears down on Joe. 

                                 DETECTIVE SHOOKER
                        You testify against Cayman and we’re 
                        prepared to offer you a new life. 

           Joe appears as though she is about to crack.

           INT. C.A.B. INTERROGATION DEPARTMENT (PRESENT TIME)

           Agent 63 leans in close to Cayman and whispers...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AGENT 63
                        They’re on their way now. 

           Horrified by the fate he faces, Cayman steals away, Thursday 
           smiling in the background. 

           He reaches the exit just as Detectives Shooker and Lee enter. 

           Frightened into retreat, he takes off on foot, drawing 
           intrusive, hateful stares from the child siblings he passes. 

           THURSDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH - MEANWHILE

           Thursday watches with great satisfaction as Shooker tackles 
           Cayman to the ground and cuffs him. 

           INT. MONDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH 

           Agent 12 finishes explaining to a seething Monday.

                                 AGENT 12
                        Perhaps your sibling wanted the life just 
                        a little more than you did... 

           The remark sets Monday off...

                                 MONDAY
                        You let that man walk out of this 
                        facility you’re unleashing a great evil 
                        into the world. Do you understand me? Are 
                        you prepared to be held accountable for 
                        what he’s capable of?

                                 AGENT 12
                        We’ll take our chances. 
                          (consulting her Tablet)
                        Your processing has been scheduled 
                        for...this upcoming Monday. 

           Monday begins to cackle, crazed. He charges the glass...

           THURSDAY’S INTERROGATION BOOTH 

           Agent 63 returns as Thursday watches Monday bang his hands on 
           the booth walls, throwing a tantrum directed at Thursday. 

           Upset but content, Thursday stares into Monday’s eyes and 
           tenderly presses his hand to the glass. Unwilling to mirror 
           the gesture, Monday steps back, bleak.  

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AGENT 63 (O.S.)
                        Our case analysis has concluded, Mr. 
                        Settman, unless there’s anything else 
                        you’d like to add. 

           Thursday faces Monday, as though speaking to his warped 
           reflection... 

                                 THURSDAY
                        It’s going to be strange to set foot 
                        outside, responsible for no one but 
                        myself. I’ve never known what it means to 
                        be alone. But I suppose my siblings will 
                        always be there, living on within me, 
                        their memories my memories, their dreams 
                        my dreams. 
                          (to 63)
                        It puts a lot of pressure on a man, to 
                        make each day as meaningful as the last. 

           LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Agent 63 escorts Thursday through the corridor, past the 
           obtrusive gazes of loitering agents. 

           Thursday and Agent 63 reach the entrance. Thursday is about 
           to exit when Agent 63 grabs his arm. 

                                 AGENT 63
                        One last thing, Mr. Settman.  
                          (a tense beat until...)
                        I think it’s remarkable what you guys 
                        did. 

           Thursday and Agent 63 share a moment of understanding. 

                                 AGENT 63 (CONT'D)
                        Have a productive day. 

                                 THURSDAY
                        A productive day to you as well.

           Thursday opens the door, flooding the screen with light. 

           EXT. CHILD ALLOCATION BUREAU - DAY

           Thursday exits, shielding his eyes from a rare glimpse of 
           natural sunlight piercing through the clouds. He enters the 
           ever-flowing sea of pedestrians, the only smile in sight.

           INT. BUREAU TRAIN - DAY 

           SUPER: Monday

           In RESTRAINTS, Monday is strapped upright against the wall of 
           the cabin, an anomaly in a row of frightened children.

           Peering through a small horizontal slit in the door, Monday 
           basks in the natural splendor of the CATSKILL MOUNTAINS. 

           EXT. PROCESSING CENTER - DAY 

           The Bureau train arrives beside an electrified fence 
           barricading the industrial facility. The cabin doors unlock 
           and slide open in sync. 

           Masked guards enter to release the captives from their 
           straps. Monday and the children are prodded out.

           INT. PROCESSING CENTER - CORRIDOR - DAY 

           Standing in a single file line of all child siblings, 
           frightened, identical TWINS peer behind to study the lone 
           adult- Monday, poised, accepting. He smiles reassuringly. 

           As the line moves forward, Monday gently grasps their hands. 
           They enter the dark door frame of the processing center...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

           Adrian opens the wooden door marked with the Palm Frond.

                        a family of seven identical thirty-five-
                        year-old siblings. The discovery has 
                        incited riots in the streets, as the 
                        Settmans have become something of a media 
                        sensation.

           Mass riots outside the Child Allocation Bureau HQ. A RIOTER 
           speaks to the camera- 

                                 RIOTER
                        The Settmans are a beacon of hope
                        for those siblings out there who are 
                        still living off the grid.  

           Adrian joins Jerry, Hartash, and a crew of Revolutionaries 
           surrounding a holographic city grid. 

           She recognizes the man at their helm, Thursday, and is 
           instantly flooded with conflicting emotions.

                                 THURSDAY
                        We can assemble on the southwest corner 
                        of Grand St. My contact told me police 
                        will most likely set up their barricades 
                        on the opposing intersection here and 
                        here, which should provide more than 
                        enough breathing room...

           Thursday looks up, notices Adrian and pauses. A moment of 
           profound recognition...

           Thursday extends his hand to shake.

                        It’s Thursday. 

           Adrian smiles, accepting a handshake which manifests a future 
           of endless possibility...
