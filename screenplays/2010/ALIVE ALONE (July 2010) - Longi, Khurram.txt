           EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Lots of cars. One has its lights flashing.

           INT. CAB - DAY

           ON HANDS. The car being thoroughly checked. Lights. 
           Indicators. Switches. As if not wanting to be pulled over. 

           For anything.

           Through the windshield we see what our driver is seeing. 
           Men from everywhere and anywhere. African, Arab, Chinese, 
           talking, shouting, and laughing amongst one another. You’d 
           be forgiven if you thought you were in another country, but 
           you’re not. 

           This is London. This is now.

           He closes his door and the noise of the world outside 
           disappears. The inside of the cab feels like a safe haven.

           There’s something about his eyes......something wounded.

           This is JEMAL, black, late twenties, early thirties.

           He looks at his hand, still in the air, and then it begins 
           to shake. He clenches his hand into a fist to stop it.

           He starts the engine and then pushes a tape into the deck. 

           It’s OPERA MUSIC. It’s soothing. 

           He puts the car in gear and drives off.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           JEMAL takes in the streets and everyday people going about 
           their daily lives as he drives, opera music in background. 
           The mood is calm and serene-like until...

           INT. CAB - DAY

           The real world hits us. A MONTAGE of people now.

                                 BUSINESSWOMAN
                     (on phone)
                        I don’t want her around anymore.
                     (surprised)
                        I’m not jealous.
                     (beat)
                        Why? Because she’s a complete 
                        fucking bitch, that’s why!
                                 FAT WOMAN
                     (on phone)
                        Do you think I’m fat? It’s okay 
                        if you do. I won’t mind.
                     (sad)
                        I keep eating these bars, but 
                        they just make me hungrier.
                     (sadder)
                        I don’t know what else to do.

                                 TIRED MOTHER
                     (on phone, arguing in 
                      Farsi)

           She holds a baby who sounds like he’s been screaming since 
           the day he was born.

           A couple. Young. In love. Kissing passionately, 
           desperately.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                     (on phone)
                        It’s your call, Bill. I know he’s 
                        qualified. I’m just not sure. 
                        Something about his face.
                     (beat)
                        He’s got an arsehole face.

                                 DRUNK MAN
                     (completely out of it)

           He sings Robbie William’s ‘Angels’ like most people do when 
           they’re drunk.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                     (on phone)
                        I had the test. They won’t know 
                        until the results come in. I 
                        don’t know. I hope I’ll be okay. 
                     (hesitant)
                        I’m really scared, Mum.

           JEMAL takes it all in. Silent. Invisible. He doesn’t exist 
           to his passengers, and that’s exactly the way he wants it.

           INT. 24 HOUR CAFE - NIGHT

           A Jamaican reads a newspaper, a Chinese man flicks prayer 
           beads, an Iranian messes around with an Ipod - an oasis 
           where cab drivers usually begin or end their shift.

           In the corner sits JEMAL, quiet, observing life unfolding 
           all around him. His food arrives. He begins to eat.
           INT. BEDROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Someone preparing drugs. It’s methodical, like clockwork. 
           She takes it and rolls over, the expression on her face 
           extreme bliss. It’s a nice, deep hit. She’s high now as she 
           dances to the music playing in the background, naked.

           This is SARAH, white, late twenties.

           INT. FLOWERSHOP - NIGHT

           JEMAL walks past various plants and stops at one in 
           particular. He goes to pay for it.

                                 CASHIER
                        Same one again?

           JEMAL doesn’t say anything. The CASHIER bags it for him.

                                 CASHIER
                        Try and make this one last.

           JEMAL takes the wrapped up plant and leaves.

           INT. HALLWAY. OUTSIDE FLATS - NIGHT

           JEMAL walks toward the end of the hallway with his plant. 
           SARAH comes out of her flat which is just before his. JEMAL 
           looks at the floor as he passes her. She gives him a glance 
           that tells us they’ve done this before.

           As SARAH reaches the elevator at the far end she turns and 
           looks back at JEMAL, who is standing at his door now. Their 
           eyes lock for a brief moment as JEMAL opens the door and 
           goes in. SARAH gets into the elevator.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL replaces a dead plant with the new one. But, as he 
           lifts up the dead one he takes a KEY from underneath.

           INT. PASSAGEWAY. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL opens a locked door with the key and goes in.

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           There is something on the table. We can’t see what he’s 
           looking at, just his blank expression.  
           The walls are covered in schematics and blueprints. He sits 
           down at a table and begins to work.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           SARAH working too. Cars go by, some slow down, some don’t.

           A car rolls up and stops next to her. She gets in. 

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           A knock at the front door. JEMAL stops what he’s doing and 
           looks at his watch.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL opens the door. In front of him stands RASHID. They 
           exchange salaams, wrap hands and embrace.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           RASHID drinks some tea. JEMAL opens up a shaving cream 
           canister. He unscrews the bottom and takes out something, 
           looking at it carefully. It means nothing to us.

                                 RASHID
                        Picked it up this morning.

                                 JEMAL
                        From where?

                                 RASHID
                        Out there. Floating around in the 
                        air. What did they call it when 
                        it first started? 
                     (a beat, remembers)
                        The information super highway. 
                        Amazing what you can find when 
                        you get off it and go down a few 
                        side roads.

           JEMAL puts the object into a nearby coffee jar and then 
           places the jar into a cabinet.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL and RASHID praying together.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           RASHID, putting on his coat, getting ready to leave.
                                 RASHID
                        He’s arriving tomorrow.

                                 JEMAL
                     (caught off guard)
                        They said that?

                                 RASHID
                        They want you to pick him up.

                                 JEMAL
                     (a beat, and then)
                        Are you sleeping?

                                 RASHID
                        What do you think? 

           RASHID opens the door, about to leave.

                                 RASHID
                        We missed you at the reading the 
                        other day. The brothers were 
                        talking about the angels watching 
                        over us. We all have one.
                     (beat)
                        Even you.

                                 JEMAL
                        I haven’t seen mine, yet.

                                 RASHID
                        You will.
                     (beat)
                        She’s out there somewhere.

           RASHID leaves. JEMAL closes the door, alone in the dark.

           INT. ROOM. HOTEL - NIGHT 

           EXTREME CLOSE UP of SARAH looking at us as she is getting 
           pounded by some guy from behind. He is going at her like a 
           locomotive. She looks like she can hardly breathe, eyes 
           rolling into the back of her head, pain and pleasure 
           becoming one. Then another man comes into view and 
           positions himself in front of her face. He’s naked. 

           We don’t need to see the rest.

           SOMETIME LATER  

           SARAH lying on the bed as both men dress. She’s slightly 
           dazed, maybe she knows where she is, maybe she doesn’t.
                                 MAN
                        You’re a good girl. Left you 
                        something sweet. Daddy knows you 
                        got a sweet tooth.

           Both men leave. SARAH sees the drugs by the side table and 
           smiles a warm smile.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL wakes from his sleep, frantic, breathing hard. He 
           takes a moment to realize he’s awake, his nightmare over. 

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL splashes some water on his face. He looks in the 
           mirror, searching for an answer.

           EXT. PICK UP AREA. AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           Travellers pour out of the main entrance.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB. AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL sits behind the wheel watching the sad farewells and 
           joyful homecomings. Ordinary people, ordinary lives. From 
           the milling travellers emerges a man dressed in a drab 
           suit, doesn’t stand out from the crowd. If you bumped into 
           him you wouldn’t even notice. But, JEMAL does.

           EXT. PICK UP AREA. AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL pulls up beside him and the man gets in the back. 
           This is TAREK. JEMAL drives off with his new passenger.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EARLY MORNING

           There is a long silence.

                                 TAREK
                        How long have you been here?

                                 JEMAL
                        Long enough.

                                 TAREK
                     (staring out the window)
                        What’s it like?

                                 JEMAL
                        After a while you just fade away.  
           He looks at JEMAL through the rear view mirror. JEMAL 
           notices, but does his best to avoid his gaze.

                                 TAREK (CONT’D)
                        I remember you. Never forget a 
                        face in there. I was in the 
                        infirmary when they brought you 
                        in. You won’t remember, you were 
                        out cold. 
                     (beat)
                        It took a while for them to stop 
                        the bleeding.

           His words are troubling to JEMAL, and he knows it.

                                 TAREK (CONT’D)
                     (after a beat)
                        How many of us are there?

                                 JEMAL
                        Four. You’re the last.

                                 TAREK
                        Then we must be close.
                     (beat)
                        Do you get the headaches?

           Something changes in JEMAL’S eyes at the mention of this.

                                 TAREK (CONT’D)
                        I do. I think it had something to 
                        do with the lights always being 
                        on.

           JEMAL grips the steering wheel tighter as TAREK’S words 
           hang in the air.

                                 TAREK (CONT’D)
                        It’s been over two years. But, it 
                        still feels like I never left.

           Awkward pause. A few moments pass.

           TAREK laughs at JEMAL’S silence. It tells him everything.

                                 TAREK (CONT’D)
                     (smiles)
                        I’ve learned to sleep with my 
                        eyes open. 

           JEMAL glances at him, through his rear view, to finally 
           meet his gaze. A shared connection. It quickly passes as he 
           shifts his focus back on the road.
           EXT. FRONT STEPS. CHURCH - MORNING 

           SARAH, looking the worse for wear, stands at the steps to a 
           side street church. It brings back a memory, can’t tell if 
           it’s good or bad. A priest walks past, glancing at her. 

           She turns and walks away.  

           INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

           JEMAL looking through rows and rows of CD’S. The in-store 
           music, playing in the background, changes to Bruce 
           Springsteen’s ‘Born In The USA’. JEMAL is affected, 
           something triggers inside of him. He looks exposed and weak 
           all of a sudden, as though he can’t breathe.

           FLASHBACK CAMP X-RAY. GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA

           JEMAL, blindfolded, being beaten severely as Springsteen’s 
           song plays in the background. Someone begins to strangle 
           him from behind as he starts to choke on his own blood.

           INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

           JEMAL looking as if he’s about to collapse. In-store 
           security watch from a distance, talking into radios. One of 
           them approaches him. JEMAL walks away, breaking apart, 
           needing to drown out the song. He exits the store. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           We can’t hear Springsteen anymore, but JEMAL can. His 
           wayward walk turns to a jog and then a run.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           He turns into a deserted alleyway.

           The rest of the world carries on in the distance as JEMAL 
           throws up and then sits hunched, back against a wall, 
           convulsing and shivering - his past devouring him.

           As he regains his composure, a stray DOG slowly comes to 
           him and begins to lick his hand. And it’s the first time we 
           notice the SCARS on them. He looks into the DOG’S sad eyes 
           and they share a moment, a connection. Two wounded animals. 
           JEMAL gets to his feet and walks away.
           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - NIGHT 

           JEMAL drives, his mind wandering. He doesn’t see the lights 
           change until the very last moment. The car stops abruptly 
           in front of.....SARAH. She slams her hands on the hood.

                                 SARAH
                        Are you fucking blind?!

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           SARAH walks around to the side of the car with real 
           attitude. JEMAL begins to move off. As he passes her, she 
           realizes it’s him. It’s one of those awkward moments. She 
           watches him drive away and then turns to see another car 
           come to a stop further on down the street.

           She walks her ‘walk’ towards it. She taps the window which 
           begins to roll down, revealing a man. This is BILL.

                                 BILL
                        Get in.

           She does and the car moves off.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL waters the plant. The leaves are beginning to fade 
           already. A glimpse of frustration on his face about this.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL stares deep into his own eyes. He opens the cabinet 
           mirror to reveal all kinds of pills. He takes out one vial 
           and taps some pills into his hand, resting the vial on the 
           side of the sink. He stares at the pills knowing they won’t 
           do much. He takes them and turns off the tap, knocking the 
           vial into the sink. He could save a few, but doesn’t. He 
           watches them swirl into the drain, turning off the tap only 
           when they are gone.

           INT. SHOWER. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL sits in the corner, his head against the wall. Water 
           pours down on him from the shower head above. Because of 
           the water, you can’t tell if he’s crying or not.

           INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           An explosion of NEON hits us. No people, just rows and rows 
           of parked cars. 
           INT. BILL’S CAR. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           ON SARAH’S FACE pressed against the window as BILL forces 
           himself into her. Her eyes begin to tear, taking the pain.

           SOMETIME LATER

           SARAH counts her money. BILL smokes. Their view - the city 
           at night, shimmering, like a sprawling ocean of lights.

                                 SARAH
                        I need to pee.

                                 BILL
                     (matter of fact)
                        Go on then.

           She gives him a look. And then gets out.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up or I’ll fucking leave 
                        you here.

           INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           SARAH walks away to some nearby cars and squats down 
           between them, out of sight.

           INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           The sound of tyres screeching as two cars enter the level 
           and crawl slowly past the rows and rows of other parked 
           cars. They both come to a stop near BILL’S car.

           INT. BILL’S CAR. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT

           BILL sees them in his rear view. He takes one last drag on 
           his cigarette.

                                 BILL
                     (under his breath)
                        Shit.

           INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           Some men get out. They’re serious. They advance toward BILL 
           with menace. They spread out so that he is covered from all 
           angles. One man approaches towards BILL’S car. 

           This is JACKIE. He’s young, lean and fierce. His eyes are 
           piercing. He leans in, looking at BILL.
                                 BILL
                        Alright, Jackie boy.

                                 JACKIE
                        He wants a word.

                                 BILL
                        He’s here?

           A sense of foreboding in the way he says those two words.

           JACKIE looks inside, eyes darting, it’s all clear. He looks 
           toward the car that no one has come out of yet, and nods.

           CLOSE ON the door of that car as it opens. 

           ON FOOT and moving up to reveal, MURPHY. He’s large and 
           formidable for his age, the exact opposite of his younger 
           brother, JACKIE. He has the cold, hard look of a snake. You 
           can’t tell if the look in his eyes is sudden or permanent.

           BILL watches as MURPHY approaches, wary, not expecting 
           this. JACKIE backs off as MURPHY gets into the car. 

           INT. BILL’S CAR. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           MURPHY stares straight ahead, taking in the view, in 
           silence. This silence will go on for AT LEAST an entire 
           minute. But, it will feel like an eternity.

           It’s tense, the silence becoming unbearable. A real sense 
           of foreboding fills the air. You can see it in BILL’S face. 

           And that’s when it happens.

           BILL unravels before our very eyes. It tells us everything 
           about MURPHY, his presence, his reputation and what he is 
           capable of. He is the embodiment of pure fear.

                                 BILL
                     (nervous)
                        I double checked everything. The 
                        work ups, the location. 
                        Everything. I hand picked the 
                        crew. Everyone checked out. If 
                        someone talked, I’ll find out.
                     (beat)
                        I promise.

           MURPHY doesn’t say a word, just stares straight ahead.

           SARAH stands up from between the cars to see MURPHY’S men 
           surrounding BILL’S car and MURPHY in the car with him. 
           Instinctively, she knows something’s wrong.
           INT. BILL’S CAR. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

                                 BILL
                     (desperate now)
                        Not like this. Not here. Please. 
                        I’ll put it right. 
                     (pleading, sobbing)
                        Whatever you want me to do, I 
                        will do for you. I’m yours now. 
                        Do you understand what I’m 
                        saying? I’m yours. You have the 
                        power to do whatever you want.

                                 MURPHY
                     (a beat, and then)
                        Do you know what power is, Bill? 
                        Real power, that is?
                     (beat)
                        It’s knowing that your face is 
                        the last thing in the world a 
                        person sees before they die. 
                        Because in your world, there’s 
                        you and then there’s God.

           MURPHY turns and looks at BILL for the first and last time. 
           BILL looks into MURPHY’S eyes, realizing this is it.

           MURPHY begins to repeatedly stab BILL in the face, neck and 
           stomach like a wild animal. Arterial spray hits the window.

           SARAH’S eyes, widening in horror.

           MURPHY, ferocious, like a human pit bull as he tears BILL 
           apart with his knife. His breathing becomes heavy as his 
           arms get tired from the rapid fire stabbing. All we can 
           hear now are the dull, wet thuds each time he puts another 
           hole in BILL. He stops now, exhausted, breathing hard. 

           SARAH fighting back panic, retreats. Her bag hits the side 
           mirror of one of the parked cars she’s hiding between. The 
           sound is only a feint tap. But it’s enough.

           JACKIE spinning around to see SARAH looking at them. Time 
           seems to slow down as JACKIE and SARAH look at each other.

                                 JACKIE
                     (grinning)
                        Hello sweetheart.

           SARAH does the only thing she can think of. She runs.

           JACKIE whistles and two of the THUGS go after her.

           SARAH weaving in and out of cars, frantically.
           JACKIE walks to BILL’S car as BLOOD leaks down the door and 
           forms a crimson red pool on the ground. JACKIE leans in to 
           see the inside of BILL’S car turned into an abattoir, blood 
           is everywhere. MURPHY, calmly, cleans the knife.

                                 JACKIE
                        You said you were just going to 
                        talk to him, bruv.

                                 MURPHY
                        We talked.
                     (beat)
                        What happened?

                                 JACKIE
                        One of the locals.

                                 MURPHY
                        Who?

                                 JACKIE
                        Some junkie bitch.

                                 MURPHY
                        She see anything?

                                 JACKIE
                        You turning Billy into a piece of 
                        meat.

           They look at BILL, his mother couldn’t recognize him now.

                                 MURPHY
                     (matter of fact)
                        Put him in the river. Burn the 
                        car.

                                 JACKIE
                        And the girl?

                                 MURPHY
                     (takes a moment)
                        Make sure she’s in the car when 
                        you burn it.

           A big smile on JACKIE’S face.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 

           SARAH running around a corner, turns back, stumbles, 
           catches herself and then pulls up, breathing hard.

           MURPHY’S THUGS running flat out after her.

           SARAH running again, instinctively, faster than before, 
           knowing she can’t slow down - glancing back.
           MURPHY’S THUGS pounding the ground faster, catching up.

           SARAH drops her bag, can’t go back for it, keeps moving.

           MURPHY’S THUGS closing in on her, fast.

           EXT. BLOCK OF FLATS - NIGHT 

           SARAH reaches the tower block. Looks around, catching her 
           breath. No one is around. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           A car screeches to a halt by SARAH’S handbag. JACKIE’S hand 
           comes into view, grabbing it as the car tears off again.

           EXT. ENTRANCE TO ELEVATOR. FLATS - NIGHT 

           SARAH frantically presses the button on the elevator. The 
           panel shows it’s coming down. SARAH waits, fear beginning 
           to take over from the adrenaline. She waits, helpless. 

           MURPHY’S THUGS running toward the elevator entrance. 

           SARAH panicking, the elevator taking forever, she goes for 
           the stairs.

           INT. STAIRS. FLATS - NIGHT 

           SARAH running, falling, stumbling up for her life.

           The THUGS running past the elevator and up the stairs.

           EXT. OUTSIDE BLOCK OF FLATS - NIGHT 

           A car screeches to a halt in front of us. JACKIE emerges 
           with the other THUG. As they both walk through the estate, 
           he rifles through her handbag, throwing things away. Then 
           he looks at her ID - name and address.

                                 JACKIE
                        Gotcha’

           INT. HALLWAY. FLATS - NIGHT

           SARAH stumbles from the stairs into the hallway, exhausted.

           MURPHY’S THUGS charging up the stairs.
           EXT. ENTRANCE TO ELEVATOR. BLOCK OF FLATS - NIGHT 

           JACKIE and the THUG walk straight into the opening elevator 
           doors. They turn to face us, as the doors close in. 

           INT. CORRIDOR. FLATS - NIGHT

           SARAH, in the neon lit corridor, realizing - no bag, no 
           key. She can’t go back the way she came. She’s too high to 
           jump. She staggers back, trying to figure out what to do. 
           She starts knocking on the other doors for help. 

           For someone, anyone.

           INT. STAIRWELL. FLATS - NIGHT 

           The THUGS coming up the stairs.

           INT. ELEVATOR. FLATS - NIGHT 

           JACKIE and the other THUG waiting in silence.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           SARAH stumbling back along the hallway. Either no one is 
           in, or no one wants to help. And then she turns and looks 
           toward the last door at the end of the hallway.

           To the one person in the world she knows is in.

           SARAH, frantic, knocks on JEMAL’S door and rings the bell.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL looks through the peephole. She stares back at him, 
           pleading with her eyes. She’s on her knees now, her head 
           against the door. It all comes down to now, this moment.

                                 SARAH
                     (pleading, softly)
                        I know you’re in there. Please. 
                        Let me in. I know you can hear 
                        me. Please.
                     (beat)
                        Just open the door.

           JEMAL’S face as he thinks, he’s not prepared for this.

           SARAH, all but given up, resigned to her fate.

           THUGS coming up the last flight of stairs, hard and fast.
           JEMAL’S DOOR opening, slightly.

           SARAH looks up at JEMAL, her only hope.

           We partly see him through the doorway. Half in. Half out. 
           Light and dark. It sums up everything we’ll ever need to 
           know about JEMAL.

                                 SARAH
                     (desperate)
                        Please. Let me in.

           He looks like he’s about to close the door, he wants to, he 
           has to. He isn’t prepared for this. The door slightly 
           closes on her as it feels like this will be the blow that 
           actually kills her. 

           ON JEMAL as he does what everything in his body is telling 
           him not to. He opens the door. And he pulls her in. 

           The two THUGS come into the hallway, catching their breath. 
           They look down the hallway. It’s empty.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

                                 SARAH
                        Thank -

           JEMAL grabs her and slaps his hand across her mouth. He 
           puts his finger to his lips and his head against the door.

           INT. HALLWAY. FLATS - NIGHT 

           ELEVATOR DOORS opening. JACKIE and the THUGS walk out 
           swiftly, we move with him as he walks along the corridor. 
           The THUGS follow, in formation, like a military unit.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           HOLD on door for a second. Then it EXPLODES in on us. 
           JACKIE, followed by the thugs pour in.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JACKIE looks around. No sign of her. Better make sure.

                                 JACKIE
                        Give it a clean.

           They begin to tear the place apart, JACKIE leaves them to 
           it.
           INT. HALLWAY. FLATS - NIGHT 

           JACKIE steps out into the neon lit corridor. Lights up a 
           cigarette. Takes in the view from where he is. After a few 
           moments he looks like he’s about to go back in. But, he 
           looks at the end of the hallway to the last door after 
           SARAH’S. JEMAL’S door. JACKIE walks toward it and stands in 
           front of the door, leaning in to listen. No sound.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL can feel his presence in front of him. They are 
           literally inches apart. If it wasn’t for the door, they’d 
           be looking right at each other. JEMAL doesn’t even breathe.

           JACKIE leaning in, waiting to hear something.

           JEMAL’S hand on SARAH’S mouth - she looks like she’s about 
           to pass out.

           JACKIE, listening intently.

           JEMAL looking into JACKIE’S eyes through the peephole.

           A moment.

           JACKIE turns to look down the hallway, something catching 
           his eye. An OLD MAN has come out of his front door and 
           stares at JACKIE. JACKIE stares right back at him as if he 
           doesn’t exist. One of the THUGS comes out of SARAH’S flat.

                                 THUG
                        She ain’t here, Jack.

           JACKIE walks past the thug, frustrated.

                                 JACKIE
                     (as he passes)
                        Go back to sleep, old man.

           The THUGS follow JACKIE down the hallway, and they’re gone.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL lets out a breath, takes his hand away from SARAH’S 
           mouth. She falls to the floor, taking in deep breaths.

           She looks at him, standing over her, at the person who has 
           saved her life. She should be dead. She knows it. And it 
           becomes too much as she passes out.

           JEMAL stands there for a few moments, taking her in. 

           And then wondering what the fuck to do now.
           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH lies on the bed. JEMAL looks at her, it’s been a 
           while since he’s been this close to a woman. He brushes her 
           hair gently away from her face. There’s something striking 
           about her that we’ve never seen before.

           He looks at her bare arms. Needle marks. He lightly touches 
           them. She has her own scars too.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - SOMETIME LATER

           JEMAL sits on a chair at the opposite side of the darkened 
           room. He has his phone on a table next to him. He just sits 
           there, in silence, watching her sleep peacefully. 

           He wishes he could sleep like that.

           FLASHBACK GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA

           BLACK ON BLACK

           Glimpses of light piercing through the screen before we CUT 
           TO bright daylight. We don’t hear any sound.

           ON handcuffed wrists, cutting deep into the skin. MOVE UP 
           to reveal JEMAL, we can just about make out it’s him.

           He’s wearing a surgical mask, blacked out goggles and 
           earmuffs. He’s deaf and blind. He looks like something out 
           of a sci-fi film, something very unsettling about it.

           He’s wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and swaying from side 
           to side with the movement of whatever vehicle he is in. You 
           get the feeling he’s somewhere hot and humid.

           We PULL BACK to reveal that JEMAL is not alone, he’s 
           sitting with many men, sitting cross legged, chained 
           together, rocking back and forth. They are all sitting on 
           the floor of what seems to be some kind of bus. The seats 
           have been removed. We only hear what JEMAL hears which is 
           nothing until someone leans in wearing a military uniform 
           and lifts up one side of his earmuffs.

                                 SOLDIER
                     (deep southern drawl)
                        You are now the property of the 
                        US marine corps. Do you 
                        understand?

           JEMAL nods.
                                 SOLDIER
                     (explodes)
                        This motherfucker speaks English!

           He lets go of the ear muff and we hear nothing again as the 
           soldier begins kicking JEMAL in his side, repeatedly. As 
           JEMAL is being pummelled we hear the gradual sound of 
           buzzing, the sound of the real world, as we CUT BACK TO:

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL sitting up from the chair, startled, in a sweat. His 
           mobile phone vibrating, he picks it up.

                                 JEMAL
                     (on phone)
                        Hello.
                     (beat)
                        Now?
                     (longer beat)
                        Okay. I’ll be there.

           JEMAL walks to the doorway and looks at SARAH lying on his 
           bed. He looks unsure before closing the door.

           EXT. GOLF DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT 

           CLOSE ON GOLF BALL just as it’s smashed with a powerful 
           follow through by MURPHY. The ball disappears into the dark 
           sky. The sea of grass ahead of him lit up by flood lights.

           JACKIE walks toward MURPHY as he lines up another shot. He 
           stands behind MURPHY as he hits the ball with power and 
           pace. You can tell MURPHY doesn’t like being interrupted 
           when he’s doing this. Not even if it’s his own brother.

                                 JACKIE
                        She’s still out there.

           MURPHY doesn’t say anything, lining up another shot.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        We took all her gear. She’s gonna 
                        want a taste pretty soon.
                     (beat)
                        It’s just a matter of time.

           MURPHY readying himself, about to swing.

                                 MURPHY
                        She saw me.
                     (beat)
                        She saw me, Jackie.
                     (longer beat)
                        Find her. And close her eyes.
           CLOSE ON GOLF BALL and the sound of it being struck as we

                                             CUT TO:

           THE HUMAN EYE - SARAH’S EYE. Open and alive.

           SARAH sits up on the bed, shivering, scratching, she needs 
           a hit. And she needs it soon.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH walks around taking in the flat, or what little there 
           is to take in. She looks at the plant, on its own.

           EXT. HALLWAY. FLATS - NIGHT 

           SARAH walks out of JEMAL’S front door and down the hallway 
           toward her own. It’s slightly open and damaged from where 
           it was kicked in. SARAH looks around and then goes in.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH looks at what’s left of her living room.

           INT. BEDROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH rifling through her stuff. And then searching more 
           purposefully under the bed, behind the radiator, looking 
           for her drugs. Looking for her money. But they’re gone.

           INT. KITCHEN. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           DARKNESS - and then light pours in as we realize we’re 
           inside the fridge. SARAH’S hands searching around. Food. 
           Drink. No drugs.

           INT. BATHROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           Her hand behind the sink, feeling around. She gives up. No 
           money, no drugs. She’s fucked, and she knows it.

           She gets to her feet and looks at herself in the mirror. 
           She looks more lost now than we’ve ever seen her before. 
           And then it hits her. A sense of renewed faith washes over 
           her. The kind of optimism only junkie logic allows for.

           EXT. HALLWAY. FLATS - NIGHT

           SARAH leaves her flat and walks back toward JEMAL’S.
           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           MONTAGE of SARAH going through JEMAL’S things. 

           INT. HALLWAY. JEMAL’S FLAT - LATER

           CLOSE ON her hand turning the doorknob of the room that 
           JEMAL works in. It’s locked. She’s getting frustrated and 
           desperate now.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH goes through cupboards, erratically, knocking over a 
           coffee jar. It smashes to pieces on the floor, revealing 
           the object JEMAL had put in it earlier. 

           SARAH picks it up and looks at it. Must be worth something 
           if he hid it? She puts it in her jacket pocket and leaves.

           INT. COSMETICS WAREHOUSE - VERY EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL, RASHID and TAREK walking through rows of cosmetics, 
           bleaches and similar stuff. They stop at a pile of boxes.

           INT. COUNTER. COSMETICS WAREHOUSE - VERY EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL comes to the sales counter. RASHID and TAREK are 
           slightly behind pushing trolleys with the boxes on them.

                                 CASHIER
                        That’s quite a bit you got there. 
                        What are you working on?

           TAREK looks at RASHID.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Stripping walls. Washing some 
                        wood. We’re doing up old places 
                        like new.

                                 CASHIER
                        With all that you can strip an 
                        entire block. Cash or card?

                                 JEMAL
                        Cash. 

           JEMAL gives him the money.
                                 CASHIER
                     (counting the money)
                        I heard that’s where the money is 
                        these days. You make out good?

                                 JEMAL
                     (takes receipt)
                        Yeah.
                     (beat)
                        Thanks.

                                 CASHIER
                        You need help loading it?

                                 JEMAL
                        No. We’re fine.

           The cashier watches the three of them walk away. Something 
           not quite right, but he dismisses it with a slight shake of 
           the head. He doesn’t care, he doesn’t get paid enough to.

           EXT. OUTSIDE COSMETICS WAREHOUSE - VERY EARLY MORNING

           RASHID and TAREK loading the boxes in the back of a car.

           CLOSE on one of the boxes. It reads - PEROXIDE

           JEMAL stands away, looking at the pre-dawn sky. It’s still 
           dark, but the first cracks of light appear in the sky.

           RASHID approaches him.

                                 RASHID
                        Did I get the right piece?

                                 JEMAL
                        Haven’t checked it yet.

           RASHID knows JEMAL is always methodical about these things.

                                 RASHID
                     (personal)
                        Are you okay?

                                 JEMAL
                        Yeah.

           MOMENTS LATER - Back at the car.

                                 TAREK
                        Let’s go and eat. I’m starving.

                                 JEMAL
                        I can’t. I’ve got to get back.

           TAREK looks at RASHID and then back at JEMAL.
                                 TAREK
                        You got a woman stashed away or 
                        something?

           TAREK laughs as he gets into the car. JEMAL is caught off 
           guard by the remark, looking uncomfortable. RASHID notices.

                                 RASHID
                        He’s just jealous that you drive 
                        a cab and he has to stack shelves 
                        in a supermarket all day.

                                 JEMAL
                        See you later.

           RASHID gets into the car and they drive away.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - MORNING

           JEMAL, driving with real purpose. 

           INT. HALLWAY. TOWER BLOCK - MORNING

           JEMAL walking past various front doors toward his own.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL walks in and goes straight to the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT. - MORNING

           JEMAL opens the door to find SARAH gone. He lets out a 
           breath as if he already knew this would happen. He looks at 
           the open drawers and closet, his things strewn across the 
           floor. A look of real concern washes over his face. 

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL rushes in to the kitchen, cupboards open, to find his 
           fears confirmed. He squats down, picking up the broken 
           pieces of the coffee jar from the floor. She took it.

           INT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR. FLAT. TOWER BLOCK - DAY

           CLOSE on the OBJECT being examined by the hands of EDDIE, 
           wiry, intense, and if you need a fix, and need it fast, 
           he’s the guy to come to. SARAH stands by the door, 
           impatiently, biting her nails. Fidgeting. Needing her fix.

                                 EDDIE
                        What the fuck is it?
                                 SARAH
                        It’s like a pager. One of those 
                        new ones, you know.

           EDDIE looks at it one more time, becoming impatient.

                                 EDDIE
                        Get the fuck out of here with 
                        this plastic piece of shit.

                                 SARAH
                     (pathetic)
                        Eddie, please. I need something. 
                     (beat, leaning in)
                        I’ll suck you dry. Please, I need 
                        it. I need it now.

           He’s heard it all before, shoving the OBJECT back to her.

                                 EDDIE
                        Fucking junkies. You’d sell a 
                        hole in your fucking pocket if 
                        you could. Don’t knock on my door 
                        again unless you can afford it. 

           He closes the door on her.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           JEMAL driving, searching for SARAH. He knows the streets 
           like the back of his hand, it comes with the job. He drives 
           up beside a woman. She turns. It’s not her.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           SARAH working the streets now.

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - DAY

           JEMAL driving past the kind of places where she might be, 
           getting more and more desperate to find her. 

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EVENING

           JEMAL driving and from the corner of his eye just catches 
           the sight of a WOMAN getting into a car. She looks like 
           SARAH, same height, same build, but he’s not sure.

           EXT. WASTELAND - EVENING

           It’s an empty secluded area, no one around.
           SARAH sits next to a man we’ll call JOE. JOE looks like an 
           accountant. And it looks like this is his first time. SARAH 
           is all business, she hasn’t got time to waste.

                                 SARAH
                     (businesslike)
                        Oral without is fifty, with is 
                        thirty five.

                                 JOE
                     (nervous)
                        Alright. Just slow down.

                                 SARAH
                     (irritated)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JOE
                        I, I don’t like being rushed.

                                 SARAH
                     (frustrated now)
                        You want to do this or not?

                                 JOE
                        Alright.

           A moment. And then he unzips himself.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?

           He looks at her, not realizing what she’s implying.

                                 SARAH
                     (losing her cool)
                        The money first. What do you 
                        think this is?

                                 JOE
                     (uncomfortable)
                        Look, I’m sorry. I don’t like 
                        being told what to do. People 
                        tell me what to do all day. 
                        Everyday. I don’t like it. Okay?

           The atmosphere gets weird, very quickly.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

           He takes out his penis. She looks down at it. Her first 
           response is to laugh. Maybe it’s because of her current 
           erratic state of mind, maybe it’s because of the size of 
           it. Either way, she knows better than to do this. She 
           quickly stops as she sees a strange look wash over JOE’S 
           face. She backpedals, fast.
                                 SARAH
                        Look, I’m sorry -

           JOE punches her, hard, in the stomach. SARAH doubles over 
           in pain. Then he grabs her by her hair and tries to put his 
           entire hand into her mouth.

                                 JOE
                     (low, repeatedly)
                        Laugh at me now. Laugh at me now. 
                        Laugh at me now. Laugh at me now.

           SARAH begins to gag. Her hand hits the radio switch and 
           MARVIN GAYE’S ‘Let’s Get It On’ accompanies us to this 
           violent and harrowing struggle.

           JOE smashes her head against the dashboard, repeatedly. She 
           does her best to fight back, but he’s too strong.

           The car door suddenly opens. It’s JEMAL.

           He pulls JOE out. He straddles him on the ground and begins 
           to punch him, and punch him, and punch him. It’s as if he’s 
           letting out all his pain and rage with each blow whilst 
           accompanied by the angelic sound of Marvin’s lush voice. 

           JEMAL, lost in his anger, consumed by it, only stops 
           swinging when he realizes his fists are covered in blood. 
           He gets up, looking at his bloody hands.

           JEMAL moves around the car and opens the passenger door.

           He looks at SARAH slumped in the seat, unconscious. Her eye 
           is swelling up and her lip is bust open.  

           It hurts just looking at her.

           He ignores it and begins to rifle through her pockets. He 
           takes out the OBJECT, relieved. It looks like he’s going to 
           leave her. He wants to. But, something inside just won’t 
           let him do that. He scoops her up into his arms.

           INT. BACK OF CAB - EVENING

           He gently lies her down across the backseat and then gets 
           behind the wheel and drives away.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EVENING

           JEMAL drives, anxiously. He stops at the lights. He thinks 
           about running the red, but doesn’t. He’s exposed himself 
           too much already. A car pulls up next to him. JEMAL turns 
           to look at who is beside him. 
           It’s JACKIE. Their eyes meet. JEMAL calmly turns away and 
           stares straight ahead as they wait, side by side, for the 
           lights to change. It seems like a lifetime. 

           SARAH, lying in the back, out of sight, begins to moan. 

           The lights change. JACKIE’S car moves off with purpose, 
           never to know how close he just was to his prey.

           JEMAL, able to breathe again, drives on.

           INT. ELEVATOR. TOWER BLOCK - EVENING

           JEMAL holding a bruised, limp, SARAH in his arms.

           EXT. HALLWAY. TOWER BLOCK - EVENING

           JEMAL, SARAH slumped in his arms, walks out of the elevator 
           and down the hallway to his front door. If the whole 
           situation wasn’t so fucked up, it would almost be romantic.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL puts her down on the bed. He touches her damaged 
           face, as if somehow it will heal faster.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL washes the blood from his hands which give way to the 
           scars on them. He turns the water off, looks at himself in 
           the mirror, frozen. As though he’s in some kind of crisis, 
           as he dries his hands. And then he makes a decision.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL tends to SARAH’S wounds. He does his best to help 
           with the cuts and bruises with what little he has. And then 
           he ties her hands to the bed railings.

           The following MONTAGE happens over a period of DAYS.

           SARAH, tied up, slips in and out of consciousness.

           SARAH shaking now, as if in some kind of seizure.

           SARAH suffering from full on withdrawal symptoms. She is in 
           agony. Time is pain. Every moment feels like a lifetime. 

           JEMAL sits close by, watching, waiting.
           SARAH shakes and convulses, uncontrollably. Her eyes 
           darting around. JEMAL tries to hold her body down as he 
           watches her in this disturbing state.

           SARAH breaking apart, as if every bad memory she’s ever had 
           is flowing through her body and trying to get out. 

           It’s like we’re witnessing a resurrection.

           JEMAL watches her twist and turn as he wipes some sweat 
           away from her forehead.

           SARAH moaning in pain. JEMAL reciting prayers, from a book, 
           in an attempt to soothe both of them. 

           Her moans and his prayers produce a weird harmony. 

           But, somehow, it fits.

           END OF MONTAGE

           SARAH wakes, the worst of the detox is over now. The 
           curtains are drawn, but a ray of sunlight creeps through 
           hitting the side of her face. She tries to move and then 
           realizes her arms are tied up. She begins to struggle.

                                 JEMAL (O.C.)
                        Let me do it.

           SARAH, startled, looks to the darkened corner of the room. 
           From the shadows emerges JEMAL. She tries to back away.

                                 JEMAL
                     (softly)
                        I’m not going to hurt you.

           She relaxes, a little. He reaches over to her restraints, 
           lightly brushing her forearms with his hand. He unties her. 
           SARAH immediately backs away, he takes a step back too.

           A long silence. It’s the first time they’re looking at each 
           other, really looking at each other.

                                 SARAH
                        What happened?

                                 JEMAL
                        You were in trouble.

                                 SARAH
                        What were you doing there?

                                 JEMAL
                        You took something of mine.

                                 SARAH
                        What was it?
                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Something I need.

           SARAH looks around at the room, the state of the bedsheets, 
           the rope he used to tie her up with. And then feels her own 
           arms. As if checking herself. JEMAL just stares at her.

                                 SARAH
                     (after a long beat)
                        What did you do to me?

                                 JEMAL
                        What do you mean?

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        Did you touch me?
                     (matter of fact)
                        Did you fuck me?

                                 JEMAL
                        No.
                     (beat)
                        I just watched you.
                     (longer beat)
                        You can leave when you’re ready.

           JEMAL walks out of the room leaving SARAH, alone, affected 
           by his words, and unsure what to make of him.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           JEMAL sits at the table, dipping some bread into a bowl of 
           soup. SARAH comes to the doorway. She watches him eat. He 
           knows she’s watching, but carries on eating anyway, 
           expecting her to leave. She looks over toward the front 
           door. After a few moments, she walks to the table and sits 
           opposite him. He stops eating and looks at her.

                                 SARAH
                        My name’s Sarah.

           Long, awkward pause. Then he takes some bread off his plate 
           and puts it in front of her. He carries on eating.

                                 JEMAL
                     (not looking at her)
                        I’m Jemal.

           SARAH breaks a piece of bread and dips it into the bowl of 
           soup that’s between them. They eat in silence, together.
           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           As with most of the flat, the curtains are drawn. They’re 
           always drawn. JEMAL waters the plant. It’s still withering 
           away, regardless. SARAH stands by the doorway watching him.

                                 SARAH
                        I kept hearing something. Voices 
                        in my head. Like whispers.

                                 JEMAL
                        That was me.

                                 SARAH
                        What were you saying?

                                 JEMAL
                        I was reciting verses from the 
                        Koran. Prayers.

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        I liked the sound of it.

           Her response catches him unexpectedly, he takes a moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        Why are those men after you?

                                 SARAH
                        I saw something.

                                 JEMAL
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        Something bad. I saw someone die.

                                 JEMAL
                        There’s worse things than dying.

           His response catches her off guard now, and makes her 
           somehow more drawn to him. JEMAL senses it too.

                                 JEMAL
                        You should leave now.

                                 SARAH
                        I can’t.
                     (beat)
                        I don’t have anywhere else to go.

           JEMAL turns away from the plant and looks directly at her.
                                 JEMAL
                        You can’t stay here.
                     (beat)
                        I’m sorry.

           He turns his back to her and then starts picking up the 
           dead leaves from around the plant. SARAH looks at the drawn 
           curtains, stifling out the natural daylight.

                                 SARAH
                        You need to let the light in so 
                        that it can grow.
                     (beat)
                        Or it’ll just die.

           SARAH’S words seem to affect him in some way. He turns back 
           around to face her. A long, quiet moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        Come with me.

           EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

           CLOSE ON a sea of green in front of us. Trees. Lots of them 
           swaying in the direction of wherever the wind takes them. 
           It’s the sound of the leaves moving to the wind that is 
           most alluring. We stay on it for a while and then see that 
           is what JEMAL and SARAH are looking at too.

                                 JEMAL
                        I come here sometimes to listen.

           SARAH looks at him, confused.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you hear it? The trees and 
                        the wind. They’re talking.

           After a few moments, SARAH listens more intently.

                                 SARAH
                        What are they saying?

                                 JEMAL
                        I don’t know.
                     (beat)
                        But I don’t think it’s good.

           A pause.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        Those men who are looking for 
                        you.
                     (beat)
                        They won’t stop will they?
                                 SARAH
                        No.

           Another moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        If I let you stay, you must do as 
                        I say. You can’t get in the way 
                        of my work. And when I’ve 
                        finished, there will come a time 
                        when I will ask you to leave. And 
                        you must. No matter what happens.
                     (beat)
                        Because then they’ll be looking 
                        for me. 

                                 SARAH
                        Who?

                                 JEMAL
                        Everyone.

           There’s a certain finality about the way he says that word 
           as they both look on together, listening to the 
           conversation between the wind and the trees.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL putting down some sheets and a pillow on the couch. 
           SARAH watches him. JEMAL notices, and looks at her.

                                 JEMAL
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        Why did you help me?

           JEMAL sits next to her as if the question weighs a ton.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I don’t know.

           A moment.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted....

           JEMAL struggles to find the words.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        .....to do something.....

           After a moment, he gets up and leaves.
           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, going through the motions of prayer. His door is 
           half open. SARAH watches him through the gap, a ritual 
           see’s never seen up close before. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH finds the TV remote. She points it at the TV, nothing 
           happens. She goes to switch it on herself. Nothing happens. 
           She begins looking behind the TV at the connections. 

           JEMAL appears, walking across to the table with the plant 
           on it. He takes the key from underneath the plant base. 
           SARAH turns around from behind the TV.

                                 SARAH
                        Something’s wrong with your TV.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s not plugged in.

                                 SARAH
                        Why?

                                 JEMAL
                        I don’t watch it.

                                 SARAH
                        Why not?

                                 JEMAL
                        Because they lie.

           SARAH takes a moment, thinking about it.

                                 SARAH
                        You mean the news people?

                                 JEMAL
                        No. The soap operas.
                     (beat)
                        How can all those things happen 
                        on one street?

           JEMAL walks away. SARAH, smiles, as she follows him.

           INT. PASSAGEWAY. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL unlocks the door and goes in. He looks at SARAH 
           standing, watching him.

                                 SARAH
                        What’s in there?
                                 JEMAL
                        My work.

                                 SARAH
                        Can I see?

                                 JEMAL
                        No.
                     (beat)
                        You can’t come in here.

           He closes the door on her, leaving her standing alone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           SARAH comes back into the living room. She plugs in the 
           television and switches it on. She huddles up into a ball 
           on the couch as she watches the screen flicker to life.

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL surrounded by text books, schematics, tools and a 
           laptop, makes adjustments to the OBJECT. Something cold and 
           detached about the way he goes about his work.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL walks into the darkened living room. SARAH is asleep. 
           The TV is still on, he switches it off. He walks to the 
           plant and looks at it, lightly touching one of the leaves. 
           Then he walks to the curtains and opens them ever so 
           slightly to allow a beam of morning light in. He turns to 
           see the light fall directly onto the plant. Then he leaves.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. EDDIE’S FLAT - MORNING

           A knock on the door. EDDIE comes to the door.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah, who is it?

           No reply. He looks through the peephole. No one is there. 
           He turns away and then there is another knock.

                                 EDDIE
                        For fuck’s sake.

           He opens the door, half way, while it’s still on the latch. 
           And just when he can get a decent look we CUT TO:

           The door smashing into EDDIE. He falls back, his nose 
           taking the full force of the door.
           JACKIE storms in with two of his thugs. He picks EDDIE off 
           the floor by his ears and throws him into the living room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EDDIE’S FLAT - MORNING

           EDDIE stumbling back onto the couch. 

           JACKIE hauls him up so they are face to face. Blood pouring 
           out of his nose, he tries to protect it.

                                 JACKIE
                        Don’t touch it. Let it bleed.

           His eyes are watering up from the immense pain now.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        It hurts, doesn’t it?
                     (beat)
                        Take the pain. Fucking take it.
                        Put it in a box. Close it. Lock 
                        it. And then put that box in the 
                        corner of your mind and throw 
                        away the fucking key.

           JACKIE takes out SARAH’S ID he took from her bag. He holds 
           it up to EDDIE’s face.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        She was here. You didn’t call me?

                                 EDDIE
                        Fuck! All this cause’ of her.

                                 JACKIE
                        Why didn’t you call me.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m busy, I didn’t think it was 
                        important.

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re busy because of us.

                                 EDDIE
                        She came and went. She had no 
                        money, so I told her to fuck off.

                                 JACKIE
                        Where did she go?

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know, Jack. I don’t know.

           EDDIE’S pain is swallowing him up now.
                                 JACKIE
                        Your nose is broken.
                     (beat)
                        Here, let me help.

           JACKIE grabs EDDIE by what’s left of his nose and squeezes 
           as hard as he can. EDDIE begins to scream. He looks like 
           he’s going to black out, but the taste of his own blood 
           won’t let him get off that easy. And JACKIE knows it.

           And then something catches JACKIE’S attention from the 
           corner of his eye. And he lets go of EDDIE’S bloody nose. 

           Standing in the doorway, looking at them, is EDDIE’s 7 year 
           old daughter, BIANKA. She is holding her beloved pet cat.

           EDDIE looks on in horror as things go from bad to worse in 
           an instant. The fear of what may happen now makes him feel 
           like his internal organs are all shutting down at once. 

                                 EDDIE
                     (horrified)
                        Go back to your room, babe. 
                        Daddy’s okay. Daddy’s fine.

           JACKIE smiles at BIANKA. There is something very unsettling 
           about a young child amidst this violence and intimidation.

                                 EDDIE
                        Jack, please, I’m sorry.
                     (beat)
                        It won’t happen again.

           JACKIE ignores him, his gaze fixed firmly on BIANKA.

                                 JACKIE
                        What’s your name then?

                                 BIANKA
                        Bianka.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s a pretty name. Is that 
                        your cat, Bianka?

                                 BIANKA
                        Yeah.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s a nice cat.

                                 BIANKA
                        He’s my best friend in the whole 
                        wide world.
                                 JACKIE
                     (child like)
                        Is he? He’s your best friend in 
                        the whole wide world? You must 
                        take extra special care of him?

                                 BIANKA
                        Yeah.

           A moment. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Do you know what they say about 
                        best friends, Bianka?

           She shakes her head ‘no’. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Let me show you.

           INT. KITCHEN. EDDIE’S FLAT - MORNING

           EDDIE, nose and shirt bloodied, stands next to BIANKA while 
           the thugs watch on from the doorway.

           KITCHEN SINK, filling up with water. 

           JACKIE slowly rolls up his sleeves.

           KITCHEN SINK, filling up more.

           JACKIE puts on washing up gloves, it looks surreal.

           KITCHEN SINK, almost full.

           JACKIE gently takes the cat from BIANKA.

           KITCHEN SINK, water begins to spill over.

           JACKIE walks to the sink, gently stroking the cat.

           JACKIE hits the tap and the sound of pouring water stops.

           There is a foreboding silence.

           EDDIE, covered in blood, looks on, helpless. He holds his 
           little girl’s hand, tightly, as her innocence is about to 
           be shattered. Forever. 

           JACKIE smiles at BIANKA, she smiles back. 

           And then the silence is broken as JACKIE plunges the cat 
           into the sink, immersing it fully into the water.

           The cat struggles, violently. It begins to writhe and hiss. 
           JACKIE applies more pressure, as the water splashes and the 
           cat struggles to breathe. There is a sickening gurgle and 
           then there is nothing. No sound. No movement. Nothing. 

           After a few moments, BIANKA starts to cry.

           JACKIE lifts up the dead cat and throws it across the 
           kitchen floor like a wet rag. He peels off the gloves. 
           Rolls down his sleeves. JACKIE walks to BIANKA, kneeling 
           down beside her.

                                 JACKIE
                        Best friends will come and go.
                     (beat)
                        Get used to it.

           He stands up and looks at EDDIE. No need for words. JACKIE 
           and the thugs leave the kitchen. EDDIE drops to his knees 
           and consoles BIANKA who will be affected, in some way or 
           another, by this moment for the rest of her life.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           SARAH awakes. She looks at the angled stream of light 
           cutting a swathe across the darkened room and illuminating 
           the plant. A feint trace of a smile on her face.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           SARAH looks at herself in the mirror. She touches the 
           bruises on her face, still hurts. She opens the cabinet 
           mirror to reveal many vials and bottles of pills. She looks 
           at a few of them, way too much for any one person.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL’S bedroom is a bit of a mess. She walks around it and 
           stops at a shelf filled with books.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           SARAH runs her finger across the shelf full of books. All 
           varied. All different - The Koran, Harry Potter And The 
           Sorcerers Stone, A collection of Nursery Rhymes, Arabic 
           Poetry and Agatha Christie Murder Mysteries. As she flips 
           through one of these, she finds something odd. The pages, 
           at various points, have been ripped out.

           Then she picks up the KORAN, opens it and runs her fingers 
           across the beautiful, complex and sacred text. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           CLOSE ON JIHADI VIDEO  

           A montage of excerpts from seminal JIHADI videos showing 
           Chechen rebels attacking Russian soldiers, roadside 
           bombings, weapons training, martyrdom messages from some of 
           the 9/11 hijackers, Bin Laden walking through the mountains 
           and prisoners at Guantanamo Bay - Hell on Widescreen TV. 

           The video ends with the beheading of a western hostage in 
           Iraq. The blindfolded, orange jump suit wearing, hostage 
           sits in front of us. Five masked men wearing black shalwar 
           kameez stand behind him as one reads from a scripture in 
           Arabic. They begin to recite ‘God is Great’ over and over 
           as one of the men pushes the hostage over to his side and 
           takes out a large carving knife.

           WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, but JEMAL does. 

           JEMAL, RASHID, TAREK and for the first time, a younger man 
           who we’ll call OMAR, watch on in complete silence.

           The horrible images reflect on JEMAL’S face. There’s an 
           ever so slight sense of him being uncomfortable by the way 
           he squints his eyes in response to the inhuman act 
           unfolding before his very eyes. He gets up to leave.

           As JEMAL leaves, TAREK shakes his head in disappointment.

                                 TAREK
                     (muttering, to Omar)
                        Weak.

           INT. BATHROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           JEMAL throws up in the toilet. RASHID, appears by the door.

                                 RASHID
                        Are you okay?

                                 JEMAL
                        I think it was something I ate.

           RASHID knows he’s lying and leaves him alone.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           SARAH looks around. Opens up cabinets. Opens up the fridge. 
           An egg. Half an onion. Some milk. Not much to work with. 
           She cracks the egg into a bowl and gets to work on the 
           onion with a knife. You can sense it’s been a very long 
           time since she’s had to make food for two people.
           INT. LIVING ROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           TAREK and OMAR are gone. JEMAL and RASHID sit together. 
           RASHID takes out a camcorder and lays it in front of JEMAL.

                                 RASHID
                        It’s pretty easy to use. The 
                        instructions are in the box if 
                        you have any problems.

                                 JEMAL
                        How long should it be?

                                 RASHID
                        Just make sure you’re done before 
                        the tape runs out.

                                 JEMAL
                        Who is yours going to?

                                 RASHID
                        My brother.

                                 JEMAL
                        What did you say?

                                 RASHID
                        What I had to.

                        Who will you send yours to?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I don’t know.

           His own words seem to affect him, a glimpse of his 
           loneliness.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           SARAH lays the table. A sense of pride in how she does it.

           EXT. WOMEN’S CLOTHING STORE - EVENING

           JEMAL looks at dresses on mannequins in the shop window.

           INT. WOMEN’S CLOTHING STORE - EVENING

           JEMAL looks completely out of place amongst all the styles 
           and designs of the clothes. An assistant comes up to him.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Do you need any help, Sir?
                                 JEMAL
                        No.

           He walks toward another assistant, who catches his eye.

                                 ASSISTANT 2
                        Hello, Sir. How may I help?

           JEMAL gives her the once over.

                                 JEMAL
                        I’m fine, thank you.

           He walks away from her. And then he finds another assistant 
           who is already with another customer.

                                 JEMAL
                        Excuse me. Could you help me?

                                 ASSISTANT 3
                        I’m with a customer, Sir. There’s 
                        other sales assistants available.

                                 JEMAL
                        No.
                     (beat)
                        I’ll wait for you.

                                 ASSISTANT 3
                     (surprised)
                        Okay. I’ll be with you shortly.

           SOMETIME LATER

           The assistant finishes with her sale and walks to JEMAL.

                                 ASSISTANT 3
                        How may I help you?

                                 JEMAL
                        I’m looking for some clothes for 
                        my....my sister.

                                 ASSISTANT 3
                        Do you know what size you’re 
                        looking for?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        She’s about the same as you.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL comes through the front door. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           The living room is empty, he moves toward the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL comes in and stops, frozen.

           SARAH stands by the table, putting down glasses.

           JEMAL takes in what he sees. The table set. Food on a 
           plate. Some kind of normalcy. SARAH looks at him.

                                 JEMAL
                        What’s this?

                                 SARAH
                     (after a beat)
                        It’s all you had left.

           JEMAL, taken aback. The way he looks at everything, it’s 
           obvious it’s been a very long time, if any, since someone 
           has done this for him.

           SOMETIME LATER 

           They sit at the table. Whilst they eat, they steal glances 
           at each other. Tension and awkwardness still fills the air.

                                 SARAH
                        How is it?

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s good.

           He carries on eating.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                     (beat)
                        Thank you.

           She smiles slightly, JEMAL doesn’t notice. But, it made her 
           feel good anyway.

                                 SARAH
                        I looked at that book. The one 
                        you read to me.

                                 JEMAL
                        The Koran.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. I don’t know what the words 
                        mean, but I like how they look. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH(cont'd)
                     (beat)
                        It’s pretty.

           JEMAL, slightly surprised.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s Arabic. I have one in 
                        English, too.
                     (beat)
                        Do you want it?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. I’d like that.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL takes out a KORAN from the top of a cabinet. SARAH 
           sits on the bed, watching. He sits down next to her.

                                 JEMAL
                        Before you touch it, you must 
                        wash and be clean. And before you 
                        read it you must do this.

           He kisses the KORAN and then gently presses it against his 
           forehead. SARAH looks on, intrigued. JEMAL opens it up.

                                 JEMAL
                        The Arabic is here, and the 
                        translation next to it here.

           SARAH isn’t looking at the book, her focus is solely on 
           him. He looks at her, catching her gaze. A silent moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        Okay?

                                 SARAH
                        Okay.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           CLOSE ON plant, JEMAL waters it. He takes out the key from 
           underneath. SARAH appears behind him wearing one of the 
           dresses he bought. She looks different, she looks alive. 

                                 SARAH (O.C.)
                        What do you think?

           JEMAL turns around. She does a twirl.

           He looks at her, taken aback. There is a tension and hint 
           of attraction between them.

                                 JEMAL
                        You look....good.
                                 SARAH
                        Really. I thought it looked like 
                        the kind of thing a guy would buy 
                        for his sister or something.

           JEMAL doesn’t know what to say. Awkward silence.

           It was a joke, but a sense of embarrassment swallows him 
           up. Sarah knows it, but charmed by it too.

                                 JEMAL
                        I’ll take them back tomorrow.

                                 SARAH
                     (back pedalling)
                        It’s okay. I was just kidding. 
                        The clothes are fine, Jemal. 
                        Really. They’re fine.

           He relaxes, slightly.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I thought I’d make myself useful 
                        and clean up around here.

                                 JEMAL
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        There’s shit all over the place.

                                 JEMAL
                        There’s shit all over the world.

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        I’ve only got two hands, I can’t 
                        clean up the whole world.

           JEMAL smiles slightly. Another moment.

                                 SARAH
                        You want to watch some TV.

           Then the moment fades, quickly.

                                 JEMAL
                        No.
                     (beat, cold)
                        I have to get back to work.

           JEMAL leaves and SARAH is alone. She looks at him unlocking 
           the door to the room from the couch. He looks back at her 
           through the doorway. The moment lingers for longer than it 
           should, as he goes inside and closes the door.
           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH, asleep whilst the television is still on. A loud 
           KNOCK on the door. She awakes, startled. The KNOCK comes 
           again, even harder this time.

           SARAH stands up as JEMAL comes in , putting his finger to 
           his mouth as he peers through the peephole.

           HIS POV: TAREK is standing outside, looking agitated. JEMAL 
           walks up to SARAH.

                                 JEMAL
                     (low)
                        You have to hide.

                                 SARAH
                        Where?

                                 JEMAL
                        Bathroom.

                                 SARAH
                        Is it them?

                                 JEMAL
                        No. 
                     (beat)
                        It’s someone else.

           The knocking even louder this time.

           SARAH hurries toward the bathroom. JEMAL takes a moment, 
           composes himself, and then opens the door.

           RASHID walks in straight past JEMAL. OMAR is standing 
           behind him. TAREK goes straight to the window, peering 
           through the curtains. JEMAL looks at OMAR as he comes in.

                                 JEMAL
                        What happened?

                                 OMAR
                        He thinks we were being followed.

                                 JEMAL
                     (to Tarek)
                        And you came here?

                                 TAREK
                        Relax. We just needed a place to 
                        stay out of sight for a while. 
                        Just to be sure.
           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT = NIGHT

           SARAH, by the door, trying to hear what is being said.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL sits with OMAR as TAREK stands looking out of the 
           window. He glances at the television. And then at JEMAL.

                                 TAREK
                        What’s that?

                                 JEMAL
                        What?

                                 TAREK
                        Rashid told me you never watch 
                        television?

           JEMAL, doesn’t say anything. Awkward pause. TAREK’S phone 
           rings. He still looks at JEMAL, suspiciously, before 
           answering his phone. He begins talking in Arabic. JEMAL 
           looks down the passageway at the closed bathroom door, on 
           edge. He then moves closer to OMAR, who is watching the TV.

                                 JEMAL
                        How are you doing?

                                 OMAR
                        Okay. Just tired.
                     (after a beat)
                        Of being scared all the time.

           JEMAL looks at OMAR, the youngest out of all of them.

                                 JEMAL
                        I know.
                     (softer)
                        Me too.

           It’s the only thing JEMAL can say to make OMAR feel less 
           scared than he already is. 

                                 OMAR
                        Soon, inshallah, we won’t be 
                        scared anymore, though. Will we?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        No, we won’t.

           TAREK finishes his call.
                                 TAREK
                        That was Rashid. He said we 
                        should dump the car.

           TAREK walks past OMAR and JEMAL toward the front door.

                                 TAREK
                        Wait. I need to use your toilet.

           A look of real concern washes over JEMAL’S face. OMAR sits 
           back down looking at the TV. JEMAL stands there, frozen, 
           looking at TAREK walk down the hallway toward the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           TAREK opens the bathroom door and enters. It’s empty.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           ON JEMAL’S worried expression. Expecting the worse. But, it 
           doesn’t come. Just the feint sound of TAREK relieving 
           himself. JEMAL’S face changes from concern to confused.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           TAREK relieving himself. We slowly MOVE back across to the 
           drawn shower curtain to reveal SARAH standing behind it.

           TAREK finishes, after what seems an eternity. He then 
           washes his hands. There’s nothing to dry his hands with. He 
           looks around. And then pulls across the shower curtain a 
           little bit to find a towel on the rack. SARAH watches his 
           arm reach in and grab it. If he was to pull the curtain 
           back more, he would be able to see her. He dries his hands 
           and then leaves. SARAH lets out a deep breath, relieved.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           TAREK appears. He motions to OMAR.

                                 TAREK
                        Let’s go.

           OMAR gets up and walks past JEMAL. 

                                 OMAR
                        See you soon.

                                 JEMAL
                        Bye.

           TAREK looks to JEMAL.
                                 TAREK
                        Rashid said he’ll call when he 
                        needs you. 

           A moment between them.

                                 JEMAL
                        Okay.

           TAREK and OMAR leave through the front door. After a 
           moment, JEMAL makes his way toward the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL looks around and then walks to the shower curtain and 
           pulls it away fully, to reveal SARAH cowering in the corner 
           of the bathtub. She is startled, but relieved it’s him.

                                 JEMAL
                        They’ve gone.

                                 SARAH
                        Were they your friends?

                                 JEMAL
                        No.

                                 SARAH
                        You don’t have many friends do 
                        you?

                                 JEMAL
                     (after a beat)
                        I have a plant.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL makes some tea. SARAH sits down. She touches the 
           bruise around her eye, its gone down a bit. JEMAL notices.

                                 JEMAL
                        Does it still hurt?

                                 SARAH
                        A little. It feels weird.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s healing.

           He takes out some ointment from a cabinet and moves next to 
           her. They are really close to each other, it slightly takes 
           SARAH by surprise.

                                 JEMAL
                        This will make it hurt less.
           It’s a closeness we haven’t seen before. Intimate. SARAH is 
           uncomfortable as no man has ever done this for her since 
           she can remember. She looks deeply into his eyes, trying to 
           figure him out. Both drawn to him as well as fearful.

           JEMAL rubs ointment on her bruise and cuts. His fingers 
           touch her gently. She’s surprised by this act. Every touch 
           feels like electricity. It’s undeniable now. Something is 
           happening between them, whether they know it or not. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Do you feel better without the 
                        junk inside of you?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know if I feel better, 
                        but everything hurts a lot more.

                                 JEMAL
                        You not on it makes me feel 
                        better.

                                 SARAH
                        Right. That makes sense.

           He carries on applying the ointment cream, gently caressing 
           her skin. SARAH focuses on his eyes now. Her gaze lingers 
           on his for a moment. It makes JEMAL Slightly uncomfortable.

                                 JEMAL
                        What are you doing?

                                 SARAH
                        Looking at you.
                     (beat)
                        Is that OK?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Depends on what you’re seeing.

           An uncomfortable moment between them. He turns the 
           conversation back on her.

                                 JEMAL
                        What’s it like? When you put it 
                        in your arm?

                                 SARAH
                        It takes you away. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Where?

                                 SARAH
                        A warm place, deep inside. No one 
                        can get to you. Nothing matters. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH(cont'd)
                        No pain. No hurt. It’s like I’m 
                        on the moon, I’m in the stars. 
                        I’m not dead anymore, I’m just 
                        floating. 

           A moment. They look at each other. SARAH can see JEMAL’S 
           own pain lurking beneath his eyes.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you should try it.

                                 JEMAL
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe it’ll take your pain away.

           After a moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        No.
                     (beat)
                        Pain is the only thing I have 
                        left that’s real anymore.

           JEMAL gets up and leaves. SARAH, alone, runs her finger 
           over her bruise becoming both intrigued and fearful of his 
           pain, wanting to understand it, wanting to know it.

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL looking at schematics of what look to be some sort of 
           explosive device on his laptop. He’s writing things down. 
           As he works his eyes are cold, indifferent.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH finds the video camera that RASHID gave to JEMAL. She 
           begins fiddling with it, switching it on. She aims it 
           around and then points it at herself, making faces into the 
           camera. Then, more serious, looks into the camera.

                                 SARAH
                     (to camera)
                        What are you so afraid of?

           She switches it off. Not knowing if she’ll ever know.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           Moaning. JEMAL twists and turns. His nightmare all too real
           FLASHBACK CAMP X-RAY. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA

           JEMAL sits, looking at us. Bound to a chair. His expression 
           vacant. Someone crosses past our view, wearing a military 
           uniform. We will never see them fully.

           CLOSE on JEMAL’S FACE as we see a dripping, wet towel 
           slowly wrapped around his entire face and head. After he’s 
           completely covered, there is silence. It’s unsettling. 

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL’S memories are choking him. His heart beats faster to 
           the rhythm of his struggle.

           FLASHBACK CAMP X-RAY. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA 

           JEMAL begins to jerk violently, struggling to breathe. 
           Whoever is doing this to him, is simulating what it feels 
           like to drown.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, suffocating, dying in his sleep in the worst 
           possible way imaginable.

           A HAND comes into FRAME. It’s SARAH. She touches him on his 
           chest. She is fearful, not for herself, but for him. She 
           touches his sweat drenched face. His eyes open, startled.

           He backs away, cowering in the corner, looking around 
           frantically - not knowing where the nightmare ends and 
           reality begins. She comes to him.

                                 JEMAL
                     (as intense as we’ve 
                      ever seen him)
                        Get away! Get away from me! Get 
                        out of here! Get out! 

           SARAH backs away and leaves the room. JEMAL is alone, 
           crumpled in the corner, breathing deeply.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           JEMAL walks in. He looks in the mirror. Opens the cabinet. 
           Takes out a vial of pills and pops a couple into his mouth. 
           He closes the cabinet mirror. SARAH appears at the doorway, 
           watching him, tentatively. He looks at her through the 
           mirror. Neither say a word until....
                                 SARAH
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 JEMAL
                        I have trouble sleeping.

           A long pause.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you do when you can’t 
                        sleep?

           He turns away from the mirror, and looks at her.

           EXT. AERIAL SHOT : CITYSCAPE - NIGHT 

           Straight down from above. JEMAL’S cab is the only thing 
           moving. A single spec of light against the darkness. The 
           OPERA MUSIC we heard at the beginning plays over this.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, driving, smiles slightly, as he watches SARAH lean 
           her head back, listening, closing her eyes. We stay on them 
           for a moment - two very lonely people, connected by music 
           the way people sometimes just need to be able to.

           VARIOUS SHOTS of them driving through the city at night.

           SOMETIME LATER

           JEMAL looks at her from the mirror, something on his mind.

                                 JEMAL
                        Do you think I’m weird?

                                 SARAH
                     (surprised)
                        What?

                                 JEMAL
                     (sad)
                        You think I’m weird, don’t you?

           We’ve never seen JEMAL like this before, open, vulnerable, 
           self aware. SARAH is equally affected by his words, as 
           though no one has ever asked her for her opinion of them 
           before, ever needed it, or ever wanted it.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                     (sadder)
                        It’s been a while....since I’ve 
                        been around someone.
           Something essential inside both of them is beginning to 
           change.

                                 SARAH
                     (beat, careful)
                        I’ve been with men who 
                        have.....who do things 
                        that....you’re okay, Jemal.
                     (beat)
                        You’re okay.

           They stare at each other through the rearview mirror.

           EXT. RIVERBANK. DOCKLANDS - NIGHT 

           JEMAL leaning against the car whilst SARAH sits on the 
           bonnet. They take in the sprawling ocean of lights in front 
           of them - the city at night.

                                 SARAH
                        You always lived here?

                                 JEMAL
                        I grew up in Uganda. My parents 
                        were killed in the civil war when 
                        I was seven. I was raised by my 
                        Aunt. Then I came here to live 
                        with my Uncle while I studied 
                        engineering.
                     (beat)
                        You have family?

                                 SARAH
                        Only thing worse than not having 
                        a father was probably having 
                        mine. My Mum died when I was 
                        young. After that, he did a bunch 
                        of stuff to me until one day I 
                        decided it would be better if I 
                        didn’t come home anymore. 
                     (beat)
                        What’s Uganda like?

                                 JEMAL
                     (remembering)
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 SARAH
                        This is home now?

                                 JEMAL
                        I don’t know.
                     (sad)
                        I don’t know where home is 
                        anymore.
                                 SARAH
                        It’s the place where you remember 
                        being happiest.

                                 JEMAL
                        Then I haven’t been home for a 
                        very long time.

           SARAH senses the sadness in his words.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you always want to be an 
                        engineer?

                                 JEMAL
                        When I was young I loved to build 
                        things. I was always good with my 
                        hands. In the village where I 
                        grew up, if something needed 
                        fixing, they’d call for me. It 
                        always made sense. To put 
                        separate things together and make 
                        something complete. Because of 
                        you it becomes something else. 
                        Something that works.

                                 SARAH
                        I used to draw. I was pretty 
                        good. I remember I would draw my 
                        father while he was asleep. That 
                        was about the only time he 
                        wouldn’t be angry at me. 

           The memories hurt and haunt her. She changes the subject.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        So, what’s an engineer from 
                        Uganda doing driving a cab around 
                        London and living one door away 
                        from me on the edge of nowhere.

           JEMAL, uncomfortable. A moment passes.

                                 JEMAL
                        One time I was playing near the 
                        well in my village. I saw the 
                        harness was broken so I tried to 
                        fix it. I lost my footing and 
                        fell in. I broke my leg. I tried 
                        calling for help but no one could 
                        hear. I spent the whole night 
                        down there.
                     (beat)
                        That’s when I knew bad things 
                        happen in the world. And 
                        sometimes there’s nothing you can 
                        do about it.

                                 JEMAL(cont'd)
                        It’s just the way it is.
                     (beat)
                        I’m not the kind of person you 
                        think I am, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Then who are you?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I don’t even know, anymore.

                                 SARAH
                        I do.
                     (beat)
                        I see you.

                                 JEMAL
                        What do you see?

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        I see the good in you.

           He looks directly at her, he hasn’t heard such words for a 
           very long time and they seem to affect him deeply.

                                 JEMAL
                        I just opened a door.

                                 SARAH
                        You saved my life.

                                 JEMAL
                        I didn’t save anyone.

           JEMAL looks out at a world that doesn’t make sense to him 
           anymore. And it never will.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        All I know is that I don’t have 
                        much time left.

                                 SARAH
                        Me neither.

           It’s a very sad moment between them.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Then I guess we’re both living on 
                        borrowed time.

           We leave them both looking out across the city lights, on 
           the run from their past and heading toward a future that 
           seems as bleak as it does inevitable.
           EXT. TOP OF MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - NIGHT 

           JACKIE looking at the city lights, shimmering.

           In the background, a drug deal is going down involving some 
           of JACKIE’S thugs and a local dealer and his crew. It all 
           looks serious until they start shaking hands as money and 
           merchandise is exchanged smoothly. One of the thugs come up 
           behind JACKIE, tentatively.

                                 THUG
                        Jack?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah.

                                 THUG
                        We’re done.

           JACKIE, distant, still staring out at the city.

                                 JACKIE
                        She’s here.
                     (beat)
                        She’s still here.

           JACKIE turns away and walks toward a car.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT

           On SARAH’S hands as she washes them, carefully.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH sits on the couch holding the copy of the KORAN that 
           JEMAL gave her. She takes a moment before kissing the holy 
           book and then pressing it gently against her forehead. She 
           opens it and begins to read. 

           From the doorway stands JEMAL, watching her, mesmerized by 
           her. Something is stirring deep within him, something 
           unexpected, something he is unable to comprehend at this 
           moment in time. He slowly moves back, out of sight, 
           swallowing up into the darkness of the passageway.

           MONTAGE SEQUENCE

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           SARAH, focussed on reading the words of the Koran.
           INT. WORK ROOM - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, focussed on what he is building.

           SARAH, her fingers trace the words as she reads the Koran.

           JEMAL, his fingers running along various colored wires.

           SARAH, locked in some kind of deep thought as she reads.

           JEMAL, trying to keep away from whatever thoughts he is 
           having as he works.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH, asleep on the couch, awakes to some kind of sobbing.

           INT. PASSAGEWAY. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           At the end of the passageway, the bathroom door is slightly 
           open. Light and heat pierces the shadows. SARAH approaches 
           as the sound of pouring shower water grows, as do the sobs.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH enters, the room is filled with steam. She looks 
           around, confused, then focuses on:

           Her POV: Across from us, sitting, naked, in the bathtub is 
           JEMAL. His head resting against the wall as water streams 
           down on him like silver, from the shower head above. He 
           looks like a child who is lost. SARAH watches him, the man 
           who saved her life, sobbing like a baby. 

           A moment.

           And then, with her clothes still on, she gets into the 
           bathtub and sits with him. The water engulfs her too. But, 
           she doesn’t care. She pulls him into her, and he lets 
           himself be pulled. She holds him like a child. And for the 
           first time in so long, they both feel something else other 
           than pain, loneliness and desperation.

           We slowly pull back from this image.

           Two lonely souls holding on, together.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL sits alone at the table, deep in thought. SARAH comes 
           in and sits down opposite him. She pours herself a cup of 
           tea. You can tell JEMAL wants to say something.
                                 JEMAL
                        Last night, I....

           He struggles to find the words. She makes it easy for him. 

                                 SARAH
                        You don’t have to say anything. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Why did you do that?

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        You looked like you needed 
                        someone.

           She knows he’s uncomfortable, changes the subject.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I read a couple pages last night.

                                 JEMAL
                        What did you think?

                                 SARAH
                        I like the stories.

                                 JEMAL
                        Yeah, me too.

           A warm moment between them fades as his phone rings.

                                 JEMAL
                     (on phone)
                        Yeah.
                     (beat)
                        What do you need? 
                     (beat)
                        Alright. 

           He ends the call and looks at her. 

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        I have to go.

           SARAH not sure how to quite respond, something ever so 
           slightly reluctant about the way he says those words.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay.

           JEMAL hesitates slightly, as if he doesn’t want to leave.

                                 JEMAL
                        Bye.
           He gets up from the table and leaves. SARAH, alone, left to 
           think about what is happening between them.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL walks to the drawn curtain and opens it slightly so 
           that the early morning light hits the plant at an angle. He 
           then makes his way to the front door. But, stops halfway. 
           He looks at the plant, illuminated by the single beam of 
           light and then at the rest of the living room covered in 
           darkness. He walks back to the curtain and opens them fully 
           in one swift motion. JEMAL and the room is flooded with 
           early morning light. He stands there for a moment, 
           illuminated, as the sunlight pours in. It’s like some kind 
           of silent awakening for him. After a few moments, he walks 
           back toward the front door and leaves the flat.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           SARAH comes out from the kitchen and looks at the room, lit 
           up for the first time. No dark, just the light now. She 
           looks taken aback by what he’s just done.

           EXT. HALLWAY. TOWER BLOCK - MORNING

           JEMAL walking through the estate with a grocery bag.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - RASHID’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL knocks on the door. RASHID opens it. JEMAL takes a 
           quick double take before he goes in.

           INT. KITCHEN. RASHID’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL walks in to see OMAR in an apron, wearing gloves and 
           a bandana over his face. He watches over two large 
           saucepans and a frying pan which contain a liquid substance 
           that is simmering away. There are quite a few bottles of 
           PEROXIDE lined up on the kitchen table and a few empty ones 
           lying on the floor. The kitchen looks like some kind of 
           mini factory now. It’s very unsettling on the eye.

                                 RASHID
                     (to Jemal)
                        Boiling down the peroxide 
                        increases its strength. It’s all 
                        we’ve been doing last few days.

           JEMAL takes in the chemical process being conducted.

                                 RASHID (CONT’D)
                        Help me with the flour.
           INT. LOCAL SUPERMARKET - DAY

           SARAH walks through the aisles, picking up cleaning 
           products. She looks like an everyday shopper, only thing 
           making her stand out is the slight bruise on her face.

           INT. BATHROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           Heavy bags of CHAPATI FLOUR being slammed onto the floor.

                                 RASHID
                        Easy, Jemal. Or they’ll break.

                                 JEMAL
                        No they won’t.

           He brings another one in, slamming it on top of another bag 
           of flour. The seal splits. A white cloud of flour fills the 
           air. They both let it settle and then look at each other. 
           Their faces covered in flour, they look like ghosts. 

           After a moment, they both begin to laugh.

           INT. HALLWAY. TOWER BLOCK - DAY

           SARAH with bags and a broom under another arm walks toward 
           the flat. The OLD MAN comes out of his flat just before she 
           passes. He looks at her, affected, in some strange way. And 
           then we see why. SARAH smiles at him, a full smile. He’s 
           never seen it before and neither have we. As she walks past 
           him and toward us, we see him turn to look back at her 
           again in the background.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           OMAR asleep on the couch. RASHID pulls up a sheet over him 
           which has slipped off. JEMAL stands by the doorway. 

                                 JEMAL
                        How is he doing?

                                 RASHID
                        Wakes up to the sound of his own 
                        screams. But, at least he’s 
                        stopped wetting himself the last 
                        few days.

           They both look on at OMAR, asleep, with sad eyes.

           INT. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           SARAH cleaning up the flat.
           KITCHEN - washing dishes.

           LIVING ROOM - sweeping the floor.

           BEDROOM - washing the windows.

           HALLWAY - up and down with the vacuum.

           JEMAL’S BEDROOM

           SARAH cleaning the floor. She gets on her hands and knees 
           to clear up a stain just beneath the bed. Instinctively, 
           she peers further underneath to find an old and frayed 
           suitcase. She pulls it out and opens it. It’s filled with 
           newspaper articles and cut outs. She sifts through them.

           One headline grabs her attention and ours, she stares at 
           it, it reads - GUANTANAMO DETAINEES FREED

           SARAH POV: FRONT PAGE - it shows mug shots of detainees 
           released from Guantanamo Bay. One of the men is JEMAL.

           SARAH is frozen by the image of JEMAL’S face amongst those 
           freed. She touches the image of him, not quite believing 
           it’s him. We slowly move out as she sits, reading, 
           surrounded by the articles and cuttings.

           INT. BATHROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           RASHID and JEMAL both wearing aprons. The bath tub is 
           filled with the peroxide and flour mixed together.

                                 JEMAL
                        Is that how it’s supposed to be?

                                 RASHID
                        Yes. Seventy per cent mix.

                                 JEMAL
                        Won’t people notice the smell?

                                 RASHID
                        Not when it’s sealed and packed.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        It’s nearly time, isn’t it?

                                 RASHID
                        They want a run through by the 
                        end of the week. Make sure the 
                        timings and locations correspond.
                     (beat)
                        Have you finished?
                                 JEMAL
                        Yes. It’s ready.

                                 RASHID
                        Are you ready?

           JEMAL looks at him, doesn’t answer.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           SARAH walks into the living room, deeply affected. A look 
           of sadness washes over her face as she looks at the plant. 
           She goes to it, gently touches the leaves and then picks it 
           up out of its base and puts it on the window ledge. As she 
           passes the plant base, she sees the KEY lying there. She 
           picks it up already knowing what it’s for.

           INT. KITCHEN. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           JEMAL and RASHID sit at the table, drinking some tea.

                                 JEMAL
                        Are you scared?
                     (beat)
                        I keep thinking about things?

                                 RASHID
                        What kind of things?

                                 JEMAL
                        What the last thing I ever think 
                        about will be. Or, who it’ll be. 
                        Sometimes, I think I know. 
                        Sometimes, I don’t.

                                 RASHID
                        I used to be scared. But, then I 
                        realized something. Every time I 
                        closed my eyes, a little piece of 
                        me would die. I stopped living a 
                        long time ago, Jemal. So did you, 
                        Tarek, Omar and everyone else 
                        they put in that god forsaken 
                        hole.

           A look between them. RASHID has tears in his eyes now.

                                 RASHID (CONT’D)
                        I’m ready to die.
                     (sad)
                        I can’t wait.

           For the first time we see the pain in his eyes, a pain that 
           JEMAL knows and understands all too well.
           INT. DOORWAY. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           CLOSE ON KEY as it’s put into the keyhole and turns until 
           we hear a click, and the door is unlocked. SARAH takes a 
           moment before opening the door, as if afraid of what she 
           might find. 

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           She walks in and stops in front of the table that we have 
           seen JEMAL work from. She just stares at what’s on the 
           table in front of her. We don’t see what she sees. We just 
           stay on her face as all kinds of thoughts race through her 
           mind at once, and then we move down to see her hand 
           beginning to shake.

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - SOMETIME LATER

           SARAH, looking at diagrams, schematics and layouts. Holds 
           up the object she took at the beginning, still not quite 
           sure what to believe, lost in thought until....

                                 JEMAL (O.S.)
                        I told you not to come in here.

           SARAH, turns, looks at him, not knowing what to say. JEMAL 
           walks away, toward the living room. She follows him.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL walks to the far wall and then leans with his back 
           against it. He allows himself to slowly slide down until 
           he’s on the floor. SARAH stands by the doorway, watching. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is that a bomb in there?

           She doesn’t take her eyes off him, wanting an answer. Her 
           question hangs in the air for what seems like forever.

           JEMAL, on the floor, back against the wall, open, wounded, 
           drained, emotionally, morally and physically. 

                                 JEMAL
                        No. It’s not in there.
                     (points to his head)
                        It’s in here.

           A frozen moment. The truth. Everything out in the open. He 
           looks like a broken, lost soul. SARAH backs away, slightly. 
           She looks at the front door, he notices. Most people would 
           run away. But, SARAH isn’t like most people. After a 
           moment, she walks to him and sits down next to him.
                                 SARAH
                        What did they do to you, Jemal?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I can’t remember everything they 
                        did to me....only some of it.
                     (beat)
                        Things around me seem to shrink. 
                        It’s like the whole world’s 
                        closing in on me. Sometimes, it 
                        feels like there’s not enough 
                        room for me to breathe. When it’s 
                        quiet and I’m still, I begin to 
                        shake. I get sharp pains in my 
                        head from time to time that make 
                        me feel like my head is in a 
                        vice. I get blind spots. I see 
                        things that sometimes aren’t 
                        there. I haven’t slept properly 
                        since I came out. When I do 
                        sleep, it’s like I’m drowning and 
                        I have to wake up or I’ll die. 
                     (beat)
                        I’m out of step, out of rhythm 
                        with the world I used to know. I 
                        walk along crowded streets, 
                        between buildings full of people, 
                        living lives that are like a 
                        distant memory to me now.
                     (beat)
                        There’s something burning inside 
                        of me. It feels like my heart’s 
                        been set on fire and the flames 
                        keep growing with every beat.
                     (beat)
                        I have to stop it.
                     (beat)
                        I will stop it.

           She looks at him, tears are streaming down his face. 

           SARAH doesn’t move, taking it all in. After a few moments.

                                 SARAH
                        When?

                                 JEMAL
                        Soon.

                                 SARAH
                        Where?

                                 JEMAL
                        Somewhere public.
                                 SARAH
                        What about the people?

                                 JEMAL
                        What about them?

                                 SARAH
                        They’ll die.

                                 JEMAL
                        I know.

           SARAH is visibly shaken.

                                 SARAH
                        They didn’t do anything wrong.

                                 JEMAL
                     (sad)
                        What did I do wrong?

           JEMAL looks at her as he wipes away his tears.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a monster. That’s what 
                        they’ll call me. But, they did 
                        this. Or, maybe I always had this 
                        thing inside of me.
                     (beat)
                        I should never have let you in.

                                 SARAH
                        You did.

                                 JEMAL
                        I have to be on my own now.

           SARAH looks away from him, struggling to digest the news.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        Go. And never come back here.

           SARAH gets up and walks to the front door. She looks back 
           at JEMAL, sitting, slumped against the wall, looking 
           desperate and defeated. It looks like she’s about to say 
           something, but she doesn’t, and then she leaves.  

           EXT. HALLWAY. OUTSIDE FLATS - EVENING 

           SARAH, shocked, confused, numb, needing to get away from 
           the one person and place that has been her safe haven.
           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - EVENING 

           VARIOUS SHOTS of SARAH, walking, thinking, trying to make 
           some sense of it all.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL sits against the wall, something stirs within him. He 
           can’t leave it like this. He gets up and leaves the flat.

           EXT. FRONT OF POLICE STATION - EVENING 

           SARAH outside the entrance of the police station. A few 
           police cars are dotted around and some officers pass her 
           by. She looks unsure about what she is about to do.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EVENING

           JEMAL, driving, trying to find her.

           EXT. FRONT STEPS OF CHURCH - EVENING 

           SARAH stands outside the last place in the world she 
           thought she’d ever be going to. She walks up the steps.

           INT. CHURCH - EVENING 

           The inside is candle lit, dark. The church is old, run 
           down, but faithful. One or two people are about. She walks 
           to the front and looks at the altar, the images and statues 
           of things she lost faith in a long time go.

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        Hello.

           SARAH turns to see the PRIEST standing behind her. He sees 
           the difference in her from the last time he saw her.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        You look....better.

           SOMETIME LATER

           SARAH and the PRIEST sit together.

                                 SARAH
                        I’ve seen things, people do 
                        things that always made me think 
                        everyone asks the question wrong.
                                 PRIEST
                        What question is that?

                                 SARAH
                        Do you believe in God?
                     (beat)
                        They got it the wrong way around. 
                        If they saw what I’ve seen, what 
                        I’ve done, they’d be asking if HE 
                        still believes in us.
                     (beat)
                        Can people really save each 
                        other?

                                 PRIEST
                        I believe so. I hope so.

                                 SARAH
                        I think I’m the only person who 
                        can help someone. I just don’t 
                        know if I can, I don’t know how.

                                 PRIEST
                        You’re not on your own.

                                 SARAH
                        Somebody’s hurt. And they’re 
                        going to do something bad.  
                     (beat)
                        My whole life is about people 
                        closing doors on my face.

           She hides a flash of pain, somewhere deep inside.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t. He opened one. 
                     (beat)
                        And he let me in.

                                 PRIEST
                        If he’s lost, God will help him 
                        find his way. If he seeks his 
                        help, he will be there for him.

                                 SARAH
                        God can’t help him.
                     (beat)
                        Maybe I can.

                                 PRIEST
                        And why is that?

                                 SARAH
                        We share something.
                     (beat)
                        Pain.
                     (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH(cont'd)
                        He’s alive and I’m alone.
                     (longer beat)
                        And neither of us want to feel 
                        like that anymore.

           Silence. SARAH realizing what she has just said, as if her 
           own words have hurt her, the saddest and truest words she’s 
           ever said in her entire life.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - DAY

           Jemal, driving, concentrating on the road.

           UP AHEAD we see a car pulled over on the side with its 
           hazards on. Steam rising from its bonnet, the hood is up.

           JEMAL is about to pass when someone steps out from behind 
           the car and in front of him. JEMAL breaks heavily and comes 
           to an abrupt stop. 

           We look at the man in front of us, it’s JACKIE. 

           They take each other in, knowing they’ve seen each other 
           before, but JACKIE just can’t quite place it.

           EXT. SIDE OF MAIN ROAD - EVENING 

           JACKIE walks around the side of the car to JEMAL, who 
           lowers his window.

                                 JACKIE
                        You on the job?

                                 JEMAL
                        Yes.

                                 JACKIE
                        Wait here.

           JEMAL watches from his side mirror as JACKIE opens the back 
           door of the other car and speaks to someone. JACKIE looks 
           animated, as if in some sort of argument. He then motions 
           his head in JEMAL’S direction. And then after a moment, 
           JACKIE walks back toward JEMAL.

                                 JACKIE
                        Get him to where he needs to go.

           The back door opens and in gets MURPHY. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’ll sort the car out, bruv.

           JACKIE slaps his hand down on the hood twice and then JEMAL 
           puts the car in gear and drives off.
           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EVENING 

           JEMAL driving as MURPHY looks around the cab. It’s 
           immaculate. He then turns his attention to JEMAL.

                                 MURPHY
                        Pretty clean cab.
                     (beat)
                        You been doing this long?

                                 JEMAL
                        A few years.

                                 MURPHY
                        You like doing it?

           You can sense JEMAL doesn’t want to be having this 
           conversation, so can MURPHY.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s okay.

                                 MURPHY
                        You doing it because you want to, 
                        or because you have to?

           JEMAL hesitates, not used to being asked questions.

                                 JEMAL
                     (dismissive)
                        I’m doing it because it’s what I 
                        do now. 

           MURPHY doesn’t like the tone. He takes a moment, staring at 
           JEMAL through the rearview with a look that could kill.

                                 MURPHY
                        I like to gamble. I like the idea 
                        of risk versus reward. You want 
                        to gamble?

                                 JEMAL
                     (reluctant)
                        On what?

                                 MURPHY
                        On you.
                     (beat)
                        By the time you get me to where 
                        I’m going, I’ll tell you 
                        everything there is to know about 
                        you.

           JEMAL meets MURPHY’S cold stare through the rearview.
                                 JEMAL
                        And if you’re wrong?

                                 MURPHY
                        Then I’ll give the term ‘keep the 
                        change’ a whole new meaning.

                                 JEMAL
                        And what do you get out it?

                                 MURPHY
                     (smiling)
                        Peace of mind.

                                 JEMAL
                     (dismissive)
                        You want to waste your time, go 
                        ahead.

           MURPHY looks out the window, distant, as the world goes by. 
           A very long pause. JEMAL, glances at him through the 
           mirror, slightly anxious. After a while, MURPHY turns his 
           attention back to JEMAL.

                                 MURPHY
                        You like to fade into the 
                        background. To not be seen. You 
                        sit there, all day, everyday, as 
                        people come and people go while 
                        you listen to their pathetic, 
                        little lives. And they don’t 
                        notice you because you don’t 
                        exist to them. But, I see you.

           JEMAL focuses on the road, MURPHY just looks like his stare 
           is going to burn a hole in the back of JEMAL’S head.

                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        I see people like you every 
                        single day. Just trying to 
                        fulfill your potential, be the 
                        best that you can be. You 
                        probably came over here from some 
                        god forsaken place for a better 
                        life, right? But, here’s the 
                        thing, after a while, you come to 
                        that point that we all come to. 
                        That moment that will change the 
                        course of your life. Do you have 
                        what it takes to turn your dreams 
                        into reality? Because, all of a 
                        sudden you find yourself in a 
                        place where whatever you do, it 
                        doesn’t matter, it doesn’t make a 
                        difference. Nothing changes. You 
                        are the same. Inside and out.

                        And bit by bit, day by day, that 
                        dream of yours turns into a daily 
                        struggle, a living nightmare that 
                        you will never, ever, wake up 
                        from.

           MURPHY’S words fill the cab like some kind of poison.

                        Your place in the world. You’re 
                        to be eaten up by others. You’re 
                        to be used up until there is 
                        nothing left. You’re a fucking 
                        employee, stuck in that place of 
                        quiet, painful, regret between 
                        what could have been and what 
                        you’ve become.

                        God, I would hate to be you. Wake 
                        up everyday, blaming everyone and 
                        everything else for what you’ve 
                        become, who you are, the person 
                        you can’t stand to look at in the 
                        mirror anymore. You’re weak. 
                        You’re pathetic. Avoiding 
                        responsibility, assigning blame. 
                        You never got to know your 
                        parents, maybe that’s your way 
                        out. Never got to kick a fucking 
                        ball around with Daddy, so he’s 
                        to blame. Never got to suck on 
                        your mother’s nipple for just 
                        that little bit longer, so she’s 
                        to blame. Or, maybe they just 
                        died and left you sitting alone, 
                        in the dark, where you blame God 
                        for taking them away from you. 
                        And the only comfort, the only 
                        thing that you can hold onto, 
                        that keeps you warm at night, is 
                        the knowledge that at the end of 
                        the day we’re all going to die.

                        the next one you ask yourself, 
                        you ask yourself, what the fuck 
                        am I still doing driving a cab?

                        That’s you.

           JEMAL, soaks up every word, like daggers to his heart.
                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        Me? You know what I believe? Fuck 
                        natural selection, fuck your 
                        place in the world. If you want 
                        it, make it happen. You can get 
                        anything you want from this 
                        world. All you have to do is take 
                        it. No one ever gave me nothing I 
                        didn’t bleed for.

                        You want to know why an old man

                     (beat)
                        Underestimated from day one. No 
                        matter how good you are, never 
                        let them see you coming. And when 
                        they least expect it, you make 
                        your move. Hard, fast, blunt 
                        force trauma. What was it the 
                        yanks called it? Shock and Awe 
                        tactics? Fuck that. I’m the 
                        shock. I’m the awe. Because, 
                        that’s what makes the world turn, 
                        what keeps people going. Not 
                        money, not power.
                     (beat)
                        But, pain. And trying to get rid 
                        of it by inflicting as much of it 
                        as you can onto others. 

           He looks out the window, distant, as if remembering 
           something from deep within.

                                 MURPHY (CONT’D)
                        Everyone remembers where they 
                        were when those towers came down. 
                        When the whole world was 
                        connected for that moment when 
                        the sky fell and everything 
                        turned to dust. People like you, 
                        you cry, you weep, you see the 
                        horror. But, how many of those 
                        people were already dead before 
                        those planes hit? Walking through 
                        their lives on auto pilot, ground 
                        down by what they’ve become, 
                        floating through the emptiness of 
                        their existence and surviving on 
                        the false promise of fading 
                        dreams.

                        You know what I thought? What

                        happened?

                        Always be prepared.

                        Because, it’s going to be the guy 
                        you least expect, the one you 
                        never see coming that will take 
                        everything away from you.

                        I won’t let that happen to me.

                        And maybe all this probably means 
                        nothing to someone like you. 
                        Because you’ll never be like 
                        those people, the ones that have 
                        that smile, like a veil coming 
                        down across their face. They’re 
                        shining. Because they own the 
                        world, not the other way around. 
                     (beat)
                        I can pretty much bet on my life,

                        smile. 
                     (beat)
                        That shine.
                     (beat)
                        You’ll never even come close. 

           Their eyes meet in the mirror. MURPHY smiles, shows him his 
           shine.

                                 MURPHY
                        Now tell me. 
                     (beat)
                        Am I wrong?

           JEMAL doesn’t say a word as MURPHY begins to laugh.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

           JEMAL’S CAB pulls up in front of the warehouse. Another man 
           is waiting with a phone. He gets off it and opens the door 
           for MURPHY to get out.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - EVENING 

           MURPHY takes out a wad of cash and passes it forward to 
           JEMAL. It’s way too much. Murphy smiles.

                                 MURPHY
                        Keep the change, anyway.

           MURPHY gets out and is given the phone immediately by the 
           other man. He starts talking as he makes his way toward the 
           warehouse entrance. JEMAL looks as though MURPHY has 
           drained the very life out of him as he drives away.
           INT. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL comes through the door. He stands by the living room 
           doorway looking around the empty flat. The TV is still on, 
           he goes and turns it off. Then he walks toward the window 
           and draws the curtains. He’s alone now, in the dark, just 
           how he used to be.  

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, dying in his sleep again. His body, drenched in 
           sweat. His breathing, quick and ragged.

           FLASHBACK CAMP X-RAY - GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA

           Another place, another time. We start to see terrible 
           images that are coming together in glimpses.

           The only sound we hear are quick, anxious, breaths and 
           JEMAL’S heartbeat pounding away like a drum.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL’S eyes roll back onto his head and start to flutter.

           FLASHBACK CAMP X-RAY - GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA

           JEMAL’S POV: As his eyes open. We’re at a low ground level, 
           as if lying down, awakening from a sleep. We hear the sound 
           of creaking, and then something moving from side to side, 
           just above the ground, in front of us.

           As the blurred vision becomes clear, we realize we are 
           seeing someone’s feet hanging in the air, swaying.

           JEMAL’S eyes widen in horror. The detainee in the next cell 
           has hanged himself. 

           JEMAL gets up and begins to bang his metal wire prison with 
           a cup as he screams for help.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH’S hand comes into FRAME about to touch his face. She 
           moves in close, leans in, stares at him for a 
           moment.....and then gently touches his face. JEMAL’S eyes 
           burst open as he grabs her arm, startling her.

           JEMAL, awake, scared and disorientated. He begins to sob, 
           some of his words makes sense, some of them don’t. 
                                 JEMAL
                        Don’t matter.....I don’t matter 
                        anymore....don’t matter......

           She meets his wide-open eyes, now filled with tears.

                                 SARAH
                     (scared)
                        What can I do? Tell me, tell me 
                        what to do?

                                 JEMAL
                     (sobbing)
                        Read to me.....read to me.

           SARAH runs out of the bedroom and.....

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           ....looks around frantically. And then she finds it. The 
           KORAN that JEMAL gave to her.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL, struggling to breathe, his memories choking him to 
           death. SARAH kneels beside him, as he writhes around on the 
           sweat drenched bed in this possessed-like state. SARAH 
           kisses the KORAN and touches it against her forehead. She 
           opens it and begins to read.

                                 SARAH
                     (from the Koran)
                        On the Day when their tongues, 
                        their hands, and their legs or 
                        feet will bear witness against 
                        them as to what they used to do. 
                        On that day Allah will pay them 
                        the recompense of their deeds in 
                        full, and they will know that 
                        Allah, He is the Manifest 
                        Truth...... 

           As SARAH reads we CLOSE ON JEMAL’S hand holding onto 
           SARAH’S as if his life depended on it.

           We slowly move out as SARAH, by the bed, reads the KORAN to 
           JEMAL who is sweating, struggling, breaking apart.

           SOMETIME LATER

           JEMAL is awake. He’s calm but in a completely raw, 
           emotional state. An open wound. SARAH runs her fingers over 
           the scars on his wrists and up his arms.
                                 JEMAL
                        Some scars aren’t meant to heal.

           SARAH looks at him.

                                 SARAH
                        Hey.

                                 JEMAL
                        You came back?

                                 SARAH
                        You did for me.

                                 JEMAL
                        What do you want?

                                 SARAH
                        I want you to want to live. 

                                 JEMAL
                        We all die.

                                 SARAH
                        Not like this.

                                 JEMAL
                        Bit by bit, day by day until 
                        we’re finished. You. Me. 
                        Everyone.

                                 SARAH
                     (desperate)
                        I just want to help you.

           A long moment. Then he looks at her.

                                 JEMAL
                        Give me the stuff.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 JEMAL
                        Give me the stuff. That you take.

           She know’s what he means.

                                 JEMAL
                        Take my pain away. Just for one 
                        night. So I can float, I can go 
                        to the moon. I don’t want to 
                        remember anymore. Help me take 
                        the pain away. Please, Sarah.

           SARAH knows she’ll be lost forever if she does this for 
           him.
                                 SARAH
                        It’s like you said, it not real. 
                        It won’t be real.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Real hurts too much.

                                 SARAH
                        Jemal, I can’t.

                                 JEMAL
                        Then what can you do? What can 
                        you for me?

           A moment. And then she leans in, completely 
           unexpected......and kisses him as if it’s the only thing 
           she wants to do, ever. 

           JEMAL’S body plays catch up to his mind. His eyes widen 
           after a few moments and he pushes her away. Then he grabs 
           her by her hair and drags her on her knees out of the 
           bedroom.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           They stumble into the living room as they struggle with 
           each other. She’s pleading with him. They fall, rise, fall 
           and then rise again. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Go! Go back to your world of 
                        sucking and fucking!

                                 SARAH
                        I want to stay here!

                                 JEMAL
                        Leave me! Leave me alone!

                                 SARAH
                        Fuck you! You let me in!

           Struggling against each other.

                                 JEMAL
                        What do you want! Just go!

                                 SARAH
                        They’ll find me!

                                 JEMAL
                        I dont care!

                                 SARAH
                        Yes, you do!
                                 JEMAL
                        No, I dont!

                                 JEMAL
                        Yes, you do!

                                 JEMAL
                        Stop! Stop it!

           They’re on the floor, on top of one another, close, 
           intimate, face to face. Nothing between them now.

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        I love you.

           It feels like the whole world has just stopped turning. 

           JEMAL looks at her pleading with his eyes - stop it, don’t 
           say it. Her eyes plead right back saying it’s true.

           JEMAL in a raw, emotional state trying to comprehend these 
           feelings, emotions and words. Good feelings. Good emotions. 
           Good words. Things he never thought he’d ever feel or hear 
           again. He looks like he wants to tear himself inside out.

           And then he SPITS at her full in the face. SARAH SPITS 
           right back at him, they carry on and then seamless the 
           spitting turns into kissing.

           They assault each other with a passion that is desperate, 
           painful and of two people who are running out of time. It’s 
           as though this act, for this moment, puts their lives and 
           their world back into some kind of balance. It’s not sex, 
           it’s not making love......it’s just pure need. A reminder 
           of what it’s like to feel like a human being again.

           JEMAL cries as their bodies become one.

           It’s as though SARAH wants him to take out all his pain, 
           rage and fear out on her rather than the rest of the world. 
           JEMAL is like a man reawakened, with each thrust it’s as if 
           his soul is filling up with life again.

           CLOSE on the plant, as JEMAL and SARAH continue to devour 
           each other in the background, alive, growing, surviving.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL and SARAH in bed together. She is asleep. He looks at 
           her, ethereal in her stillness.

           SOMETIME LATER 
           He sits on the edge of the bed a bit perplexed. He’s in a 
           completely raw state as conflicting waves of terror, 
           uneasiness, peace and even a sense of joy runs over him. 
           What has just happened has shaken him to the very core of 
           his entire being.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT = NIGHT

           JEMAL looks at himself, something stirring from within. His 
           face contorts, anger, pain, humiliation, fear. It’s as 
           though the beast inside all of us is taking him over.

           He looks like a caged lion silently roaring. The battle 
           between his head and his heart is raging and it seems all 
           too much for him.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           CLOSE ON a drawer being opened. JEMAL takes out a KNIFE.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           SARAH asleep on the bed. JEMAL walks up to her and stands 
           over her. The KNIFE by his side. He then leans in CLOSE to 
           look at her. He knows what is happening between them, will 
           happen between them and it’s tearing him apart. Afraid of 
           his rising emotion, he backs away a little. 

           And then it stops. Just like that.

           SARAH’S eyes open and she smiles at him. She leans up into 
           him and kisses him. JEMAL starts to kiss her right back, 
           unable to stop himself. He joins her on the bed. We MOVE 
           DOWN to see the KNIFE, lying on the floor.

                                 SARAH
                        I want to feel you inside me 
                        again.

           They make love now. 

           SOMETIME LATER -

           SARAH wakes up next to JEMAL. We look down at them from 
           above. A shaft of sunlight cuts across their bodies from 
           the crack in the curtains. SARAH looks at the light on 
           JEMAL’S face, he looks different, he looks at peace.

           She traces her fingers over the scars on his chest, as if 
           somehow they’ll heal properly, trying to imagine what must 
           have caused them. JEMAL opens his eyes.

                                 SARAH
                        Hey.
           JEMAL wakes up with a start, then sees her and relaxes. She 
           runs her fingers through his hair and kisses his forehead.

                                 JEMAL
                        Hey.

           He closes his eyes again. SARAH looks at him closely.

                                 SARAH
                        How did you end up there?

           JEMAL opens his eyes again. SARAH just stares at him.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        How did this all happen?

           He turns away showing his back to her as if he can’t look 
           her in the eye, it’s too painful. She stares at the scars 
           on his back. His stare is vacant, empty. A moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        I was travelling when I got 
                        picked up. I took some time off 
                        before I was to start an 
                        internship as an electrical 
                        engineer. I had never been 
                        anywhere else since I arrived 
                        here. I wanted to see what the 
                        world looked like. I was in 
                        Northern Pakistan when the towers 
                        fell. The Americans were coming 
                        so we knew we had to get out, 
                        fast. Everything was chaos. The 
                        Americans started dropping 
                        thousands of leaflets in the sky 
                        from planes. I’d never seen 
                        anything like it before. They 
                        promised a reward for anyone who 
                        turned in Taleban or Al Qaeda 
                        fighters. Anyone who stood out, 
                        anyone foreign became a target.
                     (beat)
                        I laid low for a few days before 
                        I paid a truck driver four 
                        thousand rupees to give me a safe 
                        passage out. He was going into 
                        Iran and then through to Turkey. 
                        I figured I could make my way 
                        back through Europe easy after 
                        that. So, I hid in the back of 
                        his truck and we drove away from 
                        all the madness.
                     (beat)
                        But, he had other ideas. He 
                        pocketed an extra thousand rupees 
                        when he drove me right into the 
                        hands of the Americans.

                                 JEMAL(cont'd)
                        At first, I was relieved it was 
                        them. But, then they started to 
                        ask questions and I knew I 
                        wouldn’t be coming back.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry, Jemal.

                                 JEMAL
                        When we arrived in Guantanamo, 
                        the beginning was the easiest 
                        part. It was a couple days after 
                        when they started doing things. 
                        To make us talk. Make us confess 
                        to things we knew nothing about. 
                        What they did, I didn’t know 
                        grown men could make such sounds. 
                     (beat)
                        It was like I held my breath for 
                        three years. I was buried alive.  
                        Then it became about time, 
                        hearing it, feeling it, watching 
                        it slip away. 
                     (beat)
                        We stopped being people in there.
                        They called us ‘packages’. They 
                        reduced us to nothing, our 
                        existence, our entire being 
                        became nothing. We were meat. 
                        They made us feel, think, speak, 
                        behave, dream and shit the way 
                        they wanted us to. All you can do 
                        to survive is to withdraw, to 
                        look within, somewhere deep down 
                        inside yourself for a safe place 
                        to hide.
                     (beat)
                        When I came out, it took me a few 
                        months before I could turn the 
                        light off when I went to bed. 
                        They always had the lights on. 
                        Always. And I had to remind 
                        myself, that I was free and that 
                        I could turn it off myself now.

           A tear runs down his eye. He wipes it away. SARAH looking 
           at the scars on his back. The pain inflicted. Not knowing 
           how to respond.

                                 SARAH
                        Isn’t there some other way to 
                        stop the pain?

                                 JEMAL
                        No. You’re lucky. You own your 
                        own pain. I don’t.
                     (beat)
                        They make me pay with mine.
                                 SARAH
                        You really want to die?

                                 JEMAL
                        Yes.

                                 SARAH
                        Like this?

                                 JEMAL
                        Yes.

           She’s bowled over by the calmness of his words, losing all 
           color in her features.

                                 SARAH
                     (voice cracks)
                        Take me with you.

           JEMAL turns his anguished face around to face her.

                                 JEMAL
                     (a beat)
                        You know I can’t do that.

           SARAH buries her face in his neck. Wants to be swallowed 
           up. JEMAL holds her. He breathes her in. Delicate, soft, 
           safe. She looks up.  Her mouth suddenly finding his.  A 
           kiss, hungry, urgent, desperate.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL putting on clothes. SARAH watches him dress.

                                 SARAH
                        Those books. Why are some of the 
                        pages torn out?

           JEMAL sits next to her. A moment.

                                 JEMAL
                        That’s what they’d do. Whatever 
                        they gave us to read, they would 
                        rip out the pages....I don’t 
                        know, maybe it was to mess with 
                        our heads. I got used to it. I’d 
                        fill in the blanks of what 
                        happened in the story myself. 
                        But, now I still do it. I have to 
                        tear out some of the pages. 
                        Otherwise, it doesn’t make sense.

           A flash of pain on his face about it.
                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        That’s everything I read while I 
                        was there. Except for one.

                                 SARAH
                        What was that?

                                 JEMAL
                        King Kong. I just started it when 
                        I was released. Have you read it?

                                 SARAH
                        I remember seeing the film.

                                 JEMAL
                        What happened to the big monkey?

                                 SARAH
                        He was killed.

                                 JEMAL
                        How?

                                 SARAH
                     (beat)
                        It was his love for her that 
                        killed him in the end.

           A moment.

           They look into each other’s eyes, Sarah hopeful. He begins 
           to shake his head, gently, knowing what she’s thinking. 

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        I have to do this. No matter 
                        what.

           JEMAL looks out the window, the sky is grey and dark now.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        Looks like a storm’s coming.

           She looks at him, aching.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           SARAH brushing her teeth, hard. 

           SARAH taking mouthwash. She gurgles and then spits it out 
           into the sink. CLOSE on the mouthwash. She touches it with 
           her finger as most of it disappears down the drain. She 
           then looks at herself in the mirror as if something 
           becoming painfully aware to her. In some kind of crisis.
           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT = MORNING

           SARAH - in bath tub. Her stare is empty, vacant. She slowly 
           begins to slip under the water. She holds her breath for 
           what seems like an eternity. She then begins to scream as 
           air bubbles fly at us.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. RASHID’S FLAT - DAY

           CLOSE on watches. Four of them on a table. JEMAL takes one. 
           RASHID, TAREK and OMAR are all together. We see RUCKSACKS 
           near them that look full.

                                 RASHID
                        This is about timing and weight. 
                        The watches are set to go off at 
                        the same time. We’ve checked the 
                        schedules and calculated where 
                        we’ll all be when the time comes. 
                     (beat)
                        Each bag is the exact weight that 
                        you will be carrying on the day.  
                        Get a feel, get comfortable. 
                        After this, we won’t have a 
                        chance to go through it again. 

           JEMAL sitting with the others, taking it all in.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           SARAH reading the KORAN, more purposefully than before. As 
           if the answer to her prayers are within the sacred text 
           somewhere.

           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

           The hustle and bustle of the city in the afternoon.

           CLOSE ON footsteps, we MOVE UP to reveal JEMAL wearing the 
           rucksack. His eyes are raw. More than fear or concern is 
           the grim determination that covers his face.

           He walks amongst the many citizens of London going about 
           their everyday lives. He follows the busy flow of people 
           heading down into the entrance of an underground station 
           until he is gone.

           INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE. UNDERGROUND - DAY

           A MONTAGE OF SHOTS as passengers come and go.
           JEMAL sitting on the train trying not to feel or think and 
           failing at both. 

           He looks at a young boy with his mother sitting nearby. The 
           boy could easily have been JEMAL when he was that age. Full 
           of life, full of possibility. The boy gets off the train 
           with his mother. JEMAL continues to watch him as the train 
           begins to move off.

           CLOSE on JEMAL as the alarm on his watch begins to go off.

           He closes his eyes.

           From a distance, we see JEMAL sitting there, eyes closed, 
           amongst the other passengers in the train carriage. 

           We still hear the alarm until...

           INT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           JEMAL throwing up.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL comes through the front door, looking drained. He 
           glances at SARAH sitting in the living room, on the couch. 
           She gets up, staring at him. He can’t look at her, while 
           that’s all she wants him to do. He walks into the kitchen. 

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING

           JEMAL has a drink of water, sits down at the table. SARAH 
           sits down opposite him, on edge.

                                 SARAH
                        I thought you’d be back earlier.

                                 JEMAL
                        My last fare was a long one.

           A moment. Awkward.

                                 JEMAL (CONT’D)
                        What did you do today?

                                 SARAH
                        I finished.

                                 JEMAL
                        Finished what?

                                 SARAH
                        The Koran. 
           JEMAL, surprised by this sudden revelation.

                                 JEMAL
                        That was fast.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Just want to understand better 
                        why you’re doing this.

                                 JEMAL
                        You know why.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s where you’re going to end up 
                        that I’m trying to understand.

                                 JEMAL
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        I’ve read what you’ve read. What 
                        you believe. You do this, I don’t 
                        think you’ll go to a better 
                        place.

                                 JEMAL
                        Sarah, please, you don’t 
                        understand. How can you?

                                 SARAH
                        I read it. I read the words.

                                 JEMAL
                        Then you read it wrong. It’s a 
                        translation.

                                 SARAH
                        That you gave to me. I read what 
                        you gave to me.

                                 JEMAL
                        You don’t know what you read.

                                 SARAH
                        Do you?

           A moment. JEMAL taken aback by the question. She looks like 
           she’s staring through his soul now.

                                 SARAH
                        It says a lot of other things 
                        too, Jemal. Good things. Things 
                        that make sense to me. I don’t 
                        know what other people are 
                        telling you or what they believe. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH(cont'd)
                        But, if you do this, you won’t 
                        find that peace you’re looking 
                        for. You won’t go to that better 
                        place.
                     (beat)
                        You’ll be lost forever.

           Her words forcing him to think hard.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Then tell me? Where is this 
                        better place? Tell me? Where will 
                        I find it? How will I get there?

                                 SARAH
                        It’s here, Jemal. With me. 
                     (beat)
                        We can matter again you and I. We 
                        can matter again. 

                                 JEMAL
                        You say these words, these 
                        things, but what do you know? 
                        You’re just...you’re just....

           She knows.

                                 SARAH
                        A whore? A fucking junkie whore? 
                        Yeah, I know. I am. 

           It hurts, it stings , she takes it.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        And then I met you. And I’m 
                        scared. You look at me like I’ve 
                        got something to say. You listen. 
                        And now I can taste something 
                        else other than the mouthwash 
                        that I use to get rid of the 
                        taste of the cum in my mouth 
                        every night. You.
                     (beat)
                        But, maybe I should just go back 
                        to using, fucking, sucking until 
                        there’s nothing left of me, until 
                        I can’t even remember my own 
                        fucking name anymore. Because, 
                        anything is better than what I’m 
                        feeling right now. This ache 
                        inside of me, it’s the worst 
                        feeling in the world. And you’ve 
                        put it there.
                     (beat)
                        You own my pain now. 
           A moment. She feels awkward. So does he. Her words hang in 
           the air. She’s an open wound and JEMAL’S lost for words.

                                 SARAH
                     (struggling)
                        I just, you came back late, and I 
                        didn’t know what to think. I just 
                        got....worried. I was worried.
                     (beat)
                        When you do it, you aren’t even 
                        going to tell me are you? Or say 
                        goodbye. You’ll just be gone and 
                        I’ll switch on the TV and find 
                        out on the news or something, 
                        right?

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Sarah

           JEMAL gets up and walks past her. She’s alone now.

                                 SARAH
                     (low)
                        Yeah. Me too.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL in the shower. Contemplative. Hoping the water 
           streaming off his body will wash away whatever feelings and 
           emotions are stirring from deep within. Then SARAH enters, 
           she takes her clothes off this time. And then gets into the 
           shower with him. They begin to make love under the water. 
           Time isn’t on either of their sides. And they both know it.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL and SARAH lying together, relaxed, on the verge of 
           falling asleep.

                                 JEMAL
                        Do you think there’s a place for 
                        people like us in heaven?

                                 SARAH
                        I’m starting to think maybe.

                                 JEMAL
                        Why?

                                 SARAH
                        We never got a chance here.
                        We just never got a chance.

           A moment.
                                 JEMAL
                        Been so long since I just slept.

                                 SARAH
                        Close your eyes.
                     (beat)
                        I won’t let anything happen to 
                        you, tonight.
                     (beat)
                        I promise.

           He looks at her, and he believes her. JEMAL closes his eyes 
           and sleeps. SARAH watches as the calm spreads over him.

           INT. JEMAL’S BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           He wakes. She smiles. She watched him the whole night.

           They kiss.

           She gets off the bed and leaves JEMAL alone, thinking.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           RASHID, carrying a container, walks down the hallway.

           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           JEMAL in the shower, water streaming off him.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           RASHID looks around and then takes out a set of keys. He 
           puts one into the keyhole and opens the door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           RASHID puts down the container on the floor. He can hear 
           the shower. He looks around and notices the change - TV on, 
           curtains pulled back - a woman’s touch. He walks up to the 
           plant on the table and touches the leaves, still alive. 
           Then he sits down on the couch. A few moments pass. Then he 
           notices the camcorder he gave to JEMAL. He takes it and 
           switches it on. He looks at the view finder and sees SARAH 
           on the screen, making faces at the camera.

           JEMAL appears at the doorway, looking at RASHID with the 
           camera. RASHID looks at him.
                                 RASHID
                        They called.
                     (beat)
                        They want us to do it tomorrow.

           They stare at each other for a long moment.

           SOMETIME LATER 

           JEMAL and RASHID sitting together, it looks as though 
           they’ve been in deep, serious conversation for a while now.

                                 RASHID
                        You know those people who sit in 
                        the back of your cab. You listen 
                        to them don’t you. Everyday 
                        people. Everyday lives. We’re not 
                        like them. We never will be. We 
                        won’t have families, or wives, 
                        because we’re not like them 
                        anymore. Because of what they did 
                        to us. Because of what they did 
                        to all of us. No one can change 
                        that.
                     (beat)
                        Not even her.

                                 JEMAL
                        I know.

                                 RASHID
                        Then, please. This woman. Whoever 
                        she is.  Whatever it is that 
                        you’re doing. Stop it.

                                 JEMAL
                        Remember what you said about the 
                        angels that are out there, 
                        looking over us.
                     (beat)
                        What if she’s mine.

                                 RASHID
                        Jemal, we have to be focussed 
                        now. Your head and your heart 
                        must be clean of all of this. 
                        You’re just making it harder for 
                        yourself when the time comes.

           His words forcing him to think for a moment.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Did you sleep last night, Rashid?

                                 RASHID
                        No.
                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        I did.

           RASHID looks at him, completely taken aback. JEMAL gets up 
           and leaves him alone in the room.

           EXT. FRONT OF BOOK SHOP - DAY 

           SARAH walking into the book shop.

           INT. SHELVES. BOOK SHOP - DAY

           SARAH walks amongst rows and rows of books. And then she 
           stops, she’s found what she’s looking for.

           SARAH POV - we’re looking at a book, it’s KING KONG.

           She takes it, looks around, and then puts it in her bag.

           She walks down the aisle and as she’s about to turn for the 
           exit, a hand spins her around. It’s the store manager.

                                 MANAGER
                        What do you think you’re doing?

           SARAH looks at him, thinking with her eyes.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 SARAH
                        Wait. Let’s figure something out.

           He looks at her, intrigued despite himself.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE. BOOK STORE - DAY

           CLOSE on SARAH bent over a desk, pinned down, as the store 
           manager thrusts into her from behind. Her head on the 
           table, her focus on one thing only - the KING KONG book 
           lying at the end of the desk. Nothing else matters.

           EXT. BENCH. LOCAL PARK - DAY 

           SARAH sitting on the bench. She opens the book and then 
           starts to tear out pages at various different sections. 
           Then she closes the book. And smiles. 
           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - DAY

           JEMAL cutting tape with his teeth. He’s sticking things to 
           something. We slowly MOVE back to reveal the EXPLOSIVE 
           DEVICE. It is covered in nails, screws and bolts. It’s 
           unsettling just looking at it. 

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - DAY

           SARAH, walking back, holding onto the book. She passes the 
           OLD MAN who lives on the same floor. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hello.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Hello.

           We stay on the OLD MAN as SARAH walks away from him. He 
           smiles to himself. Then, in the background, a car comes to 
           a screech in front of SARAH, cutting her off.

           The OLD MAN turns to see JACKIE and one of his thugs grab 
           hold of her.

           CLOSE UP - SARAH struggling as she is violently bundled 
           into the back of the car. Once they’re all in, the car 
           screeches away. The only thing left to show what has just 
           taken place is the KING KONG book, lying on the ground. 
           After a moment, it’s picked up off of the ground by the OLD 
           MAN.

           INT. KITCHEN TABLE. RASHID’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL, RASHID, TAREK and OMAR all eating together. There’s 
           something almost spiritual-like about it, the last time 
           they will all be together again.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB. - EVENING 

           JEMAL pulls up by a rundown TOWER BLOCK. OMAR is with him. 
           Awkward pause, awkward goodbye. 

                                 OMAR
                        The middle carriages.

           JEMAL looks at him.

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Go for the middle carriages. 
                        That’s where most people will be. 
                        There won’t be that many at the 
                        front or back. 
           JEMAL sees the fear in his eyes, and tries to hide his own. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Okay.

           OMAR looking at his hands now, remembering something.

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when we first 
                        arrived there and they told us we 
                        had a few minutes to write a 
                        letter to our families. I 
                        couldn’t.
                     (beat)
                        My hands were numb from the 
                        handcuffs they used. I couldn’t 
                        write anything. They thought I 
                        was dead while I was in there. 
                        They buried me while I was still 
                        alive.
                     (sad)
                        I guess they were right to do 
                        that.
                     (sadder)
                        Goodbye, Jemal.

           They embrace. OMAR holds onto JEMAL for a moment longer 
           than he knows he should. JEMAL doesn’t mind.

                                 OMAR
                        See you soon, Inshallah. 

                                 JEMAL
                        Inshallah.

           JEMAL fights off a wave of sadness as he watches OMAR get 
           out of the car and walk away from him.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING 

           A car pulls into the warehouse. JACKIE gets out and pulls 
           SARAH out from the car. She has a large bruise on her face, 
           JACKIE already started. He pulls her by her hair, her knees 
           scraping the floor.

           MURPHY comes out of an office. SARAH on her knees, in front 
           of him. His men all around. The outlook is bleak.

                                 MURPHY
                        Where was she?

                                 JACKIE
                        She was right outside her place, 
                        must’ve been there all along.
                                 MURPHY
                        Silly little girl.

                                 JACKIE
                        Finish it, bruv. 

                                 MURPHY
                        Be a shame to waste such a pretty 
                        thing, straight away.

                                 JACKIE
                        Do what you want then, I’m out of 
                        here.

           JACKIE begins to walk away.

                                 MURPHY
                        Jack.

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah.

                                 MURPHY
                        Good job.

                                 JACKIE
                     (smiling)
                        Yeah, I know.

           MURPHY gets down on her level. Gently strokes her hair away 
           from her face, nothing but absolute fear in her eyes.

                                 MURPHY
                        It’s okay. I’m not going to kill 
                        you straight away. Some of the 
                        boys have been getting frustrated 
                        looking for you the last couple 
                        days. So, here’s what’s going to 
                        happen. They’re going to take you 
                        into that room over there and 
                        take out that frustration on you. 
                        They’re going to fucking turn you 
                        inside out. 
                     (after a beat)
                        What do you think about that?

           SARAH spits directly into his face. MURPHY touches the spit 
           with his finger and then puts it into his mouth.

                                 MURPHY
                        You taste good.

           He then punches her full force in the face and she drops 
           like a ton of bricks.
           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL sits at the table, staring at the plant. Healthy, 
           alive and he knows the reason why. A knock at the door.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. JEMAL’S FLAT - EVENING 

           JEMAL opens the door. In front of us is the OLD MAN.

                                 OLD MAN
                        They took her.
                     (beat)
                        The ones that came here before.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL sits opposite the OLD MAN at the table.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I’ve lived here for as long as I 
                        can remember. I’ve watched people 
                        come and go. I knew the ones that 
                        lived in this flat before you, 
                        and all the others that came 
                        before them. Everyone’s got their 
                        own story. All the time since 
                        she’s been here, I never saw her 
                        smile before. That was her’s. 
                        But, she’s smiling now.
                     (beat)
                        She’s got a beautiful smile.

           The OLD MAN puts KING KONG on the table.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        When they took her, she dropped 
                        this.

           JEMAL picks it up and looks at the book, lost for words.

           JEMAL opens the book and flicks through the pages. The ones 
           which have been torn out are clearly visible by the tears. 
           He closes the book and looks at the OLD MAN, his face a 
           mass of conflicting emotions as it hits him - no one will 
           ever understand him the way she does now.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Are you okay?

           A wave of sorrow hits JEMAL like a punch in the stomach. He 
           tries to breathe as he struggles to hold back the tears.
           INT. BATHROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JEMAL looks at himself in the mirror. Identity crisis. 
           Morality crisis. Human crisis. And then it’s over. He’s 
           made his decision. And it is something that will propel him 
           towards his final destiny. 

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - NIGHT  

           JEMAL driving, searching. Like a hunter tracking down prey.

           INT. ALLEYWAY. RUNDOWN BUILDING - NIGHT 

           The alleyway and area in general is the ‘drug store’ of 
           choice for those looking for something harder. Junkies and 
           dealers conducting business as usual. JACKIE comes out from 
           a run down building with a pretty black girl on his arm. He 
           kisses her hard then slaps her on the ass as she walks 
           away. JACKIE looks like he’s just coming down from his 
           ritual high of cocaine and sex. He slaps hands with a drug 
           dealer as he passes the dealers and junkies.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           JACKIE walks down the street toward his car. No one around. 
           Deserted. JACKIE opens the door and is about to get in when 

                                 JEMAL (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           JACKIE turns and before he can react is hit, full on, in 
           the face with something hard. He’s down. JEMAL stands over 
           him. Then he hits him again to make sure he stays down.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

           JACKIE, sitting at the kitchen table, his eyelids flutter, 
           he begins to twitch. And then he regains consciousness. The 
           first thing he sees is the PLANT on the middle of the 
           table. And then that his hands are taped down onto the 
           table with his fingers exposed. He tries to move, but 
           can’t, he’s tied to the chair from below. 

           JEMAL sits opposite him. JACKIE stares right back. A 
           moment. Then he looks to the cooker beside them, an IRON is 
           resting over the naked flame......warming up.

                                 JACKIE
                        What the fuck are you doing?

                                 JEMAL
                        The girl. Where is she?
           JACKIE begins to laugh. JEMAL gets up and punches him in 
           the face. His laugh turns to a cough as he spits out blood 
           and some teeth onto the table. JEMAL sits by his side now.

                                 JACKIE
                        Fucking bitch is dead already.

                                 JEMAL
                        Where is she?

                                 JACKIE
                        Fuck you.

                                 JEMAL
                        I know all kinds of ways to make 
                        you talk. Make you say things 
                        that you don’t want to. 
                     (beat)
                        You could say I’m an expert.

                                 JACKIE
                        You have no idea what you’ve 
                        done. You’re fucking dead 
                        already. You just don’t know it.

           JEMAL stands up, and we now see that he’s holding a HAMMER. 
           He brings it down hard on one of JACKIE’S fingers. His 
           finger crumbles to a flat mixture of skin, bone and blood. 
           JACKIE begins to scream. 

                                 JEMAL
                     (leaning in)
                        Nine more to go.

           JACKIE tries to maintain some control, master his own fear. 
           He looks angry, and like he could cry at the same time.

                                 JACKIE
                     (struggling)
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 JEMAL
                        No. I don’t.

           Without warning JEMAL brings down the HAMMER again. Another 
           of JACKIE’s fingers is reduced to a mashed pulp of skin and 
           bone. JACKIE howls, he starts to buck in the chair.

                                 JEMAL
                     (calm)
                        I hope you’re not right-handed.

           JEMAL looks devoid of all emotion. He motions to the plant.

                                 JEMAL
                        Look at it.
           He doesn’t. JEMAL slaps the side of his head, hard.

                                 JEMAL
                        Look at it.

           JACKIE looks at the PLANT, breathing hard now.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s beautiful isn’t it? It’s 
                        alive because of her. And you’ll 
                        die because of her if you don’t 
                        tell me what I want to know.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m going to fucking kill you. 
                        I’m going to eat your fucking 
                        heart out!

           JEMAL lets go of his head and brings the HAMMER down again 
           as another of JACKIE’S fingers bites the dust. Nearly all 
           of his right hand is nearly unrecognizable now. JACKIE eyes 
           tearing up as the pain becomes blinding.

                                 JACKIE
                     (whimpers)
                        What....what do you want?

                                 JEMAL
                        Whose got her? I want to speak to 
                        them. Now.

                                 JACKIE
                        She’s already dead.

                                 JEMAL
                        That’s not your concern. What you 
                        should be worried about is what 
                        I’m about to do to your feet.

                                 JACKIE
                     (terrified)
                        My phone. My phone.

           JEMAL is already one step ahead. He takes out JACKIE’S 
           phone, opens it and moves down his list of numbers. JACKIE 
           looks like he is about to lose consciousness. And JEMAL 
           knows it.

                                 JEMAL
                        Stay with me. Which one is it?

           JEMAL highlights the numbers.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s it. That’s the one.
                                 JEMAL
                        Is he the one I picked up? 
                     (beat)
                        Your brother?

                                 JACKIE
                     (low, defeated)
                        Yeah. Yeah.

           JEMAL hits the call button on the phone.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           We see MURPHY come out of a door, sweating, his shirt out, 
           some blood on it. We can’t even begin to imagine what he 
           and his men are doing to SARAH.

                                 MURPHY
                     (on phone)
                        I’m busy, Jack.

           INT. KITCHEN. JEMAL’S FLAT - NIGHT 

                                 JEMAL
                     (over phone)
                        In my car you told me that pain 
                        makes the world turn around.

                                 MURPHY
                        What? Who the fuck is this?

                                 JEMAL
                        You told me pain is what makes 
                        the world turn around. Remember?

                                 MURPHY
                     (remembering)
                        You?

                                 JEMAL
                        Your brother wants to talk to 
                        you.

           Puts the phone to JACKIE’S ear.

                                 JACKIE
                     (a mile a second)
                        I’m at his place, bruv. I don’t 
                        know where I am. He wants her 
                        back! He want’s that fucking 
                        bitch! He’s out of his fucking 
                        mind!
           JACKIE doesn’t see JEMAL reaching for the IRON on top of 
           the cooker until he places it on what is left of his right 
           hand. JACKIE screams, his eyes bulging from the pain.

                                 MURPHY
                        JACKIE! JACKIE!

                                 JEMAL
                        He can’t talk right now because 
                        he’s about to pass out. Is your 
                        world turning, yet?

                                 MURPHY
                        What do you want?

           JEMAL lifts up the IRON, steam rises from the bloody mess 
           that used to be JACKIE’S right hand. The vein’s bulge in 
           JACKIE’s head, as he grits through the pain.

                                 JEMAL
                        I want you. Your life for his.

                                 MURPHY
                        No.

                                 JEMAL
                        A life for a life. The only way. 
                        You took hers, now I want yours.

                                 MURPHY
                        No.

                                 JEMAL
                        What?

                                 MURPHY
                        Her life, for your life.

                                 JEMAL
                        Whose?

                                 BOSS
                        Your fucking girlfriend’s.
                     (beat)
                        She’s still here.

                                 JEMAL
                        You’re lying. She’s dead.

                                 MURPHY
                        Not yet. But, that’s down to you. 
                        You think you’re in control of 
                        this situation, you’re not. I am.

                                 JEMAL
                        Prove it, prove it now.
                     (thinks fast)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEMAL(cont'd)
                        What did she do when her father 
                        was asleep? 

                                 MURPHY
                        What?

                                 JEMAL
                        What did she used to do when her 
                        father was asleep? Call me back 
                        in thirty seconds or I cut off 
                        his head.

           JEMAL ends the call. He then takes out the kitchen KNIFE 
           from the drawer and sits back opposite JACKIE. He places 
           the phone and the knife on the table, in front of him. And 
           he waits. The thirty seconds feel like a lifetime. JACKIE 
           is semi conscious, mumbling, whimpering, sobbing. Time’s 
           up. Nothing. A moment. JEMAL’s hand goes for the knife.

           And then the phone rings. He picks up the phone instead.

                                 MURPHY
                        She drew him.
                     (beat)
                        She fucking drew him.

           Relief on JEMAL’S face. Time stands still. The emotion 
           fills his face. Nothing else matters now. Nothing.

                                 MURPHY
                        You and my brother for her.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        We’re coming.

           JEMAL takes out a ROLL of DUCT TAPE. He then begins to 
           cover JACKIE’S mouth with tape as he tries to resist.

           INT. BEDROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           MONTAGE of JEMAL going through the movements of Prayer and  
           reading from a book, it’s not the KORAN, it’s KING KONG.  
           And he savors every word, because of her.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL sits, looking at the video camera.

                                 JEMAL
                     (to camera)
                        If you’re watching this, then it 
                        means I’m dead......
           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           JEMAL opens the curtains, early morning light pours in. It 
           looks like it’s going to be a beautiful day.

           JEMAL waters the plant. He touches the leaves as if somehow 
           saying goodbye. A moment. Then he puts an envelope down on 
           the table next to the plant.

           INT. WORK ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - EARLY MORNING

           CLOSE ON JACKET ZIP being pulled up as we reveal JEMAL 
           standing alone. He puts the OBJECT in one of his pockets. 

           We stay with him for a moment.

           EXT. JEMAL’S CAB - MORNING

           CLOSE UP of JACKIE in the boot, bound, gagged, terrified. 
           JEMAL slams the boot shut on him.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - MORNING

           ON HANDS. The car being thoroughly checked. Lights. 
           Indicators. Switches. As if not wanting to be pulled over. 

           For anything.

           It’s routine for JEMAL, habit. What he does at the start of 
           everyday. But, today is different. It’s the last time he 
           will ever do this again.

           He looks at his hand, closely. Firm, steady, still. It’s 
           not shaking anymore.

           A moment.

           He starts the engine and then pushes a tape into the deck. 

           It’s the OPERA MUSIC. 

           He puts the car in gear and drives off.

           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - MORNING

           TAREK, steely eyed, RUCKSACK on his back, walking 
           effortlessly through the early morning hustle and bustle of 
           people trying to get to work on time.
           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - MORNING

           OMAR, walking with his RUCKSACK amongst the early morning 
           crowd. CLOSE ON his eyes, he looks terrified, as we see 
           just how much of a young boy he really is.

           EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - MORNING

           Another crowded street, too many people, not enough 
           pavement as RASHID, RUCKSACK on his back, follows the mass 
           flow of people into the entrance of an underground station. 

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - MORNING

           JEMAL drives through LONDON for the very last time. 
           Something spiritual about it, his final drive, like a 
           pilgrim about to complete his journey. 

           We see what he sees through his dreamlike POV - The city of 
           London and its people roll by as JEMAL looks at the world 
           differently, as if trying to take everything in. The city 
           at its best, the people at their best -  all faiths, 
           backgrounds, colors and religions. Someone’s father, 
           someone’s mother, someone’s son, someone’s daughter, 
           someone’s friend.....someone’s lover.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL SITE. ABANDONED WAREHOUSES - MORNING

           We see the cab moving along the completely deserted area, 
           looking lost and alone beneath the clear early morning sky.

           INT. JEMAL’S CAB - MORNING

           JEMAL’S face locked away from all emotion now. And then he 
           sees them in the distance. Other men. Other cars. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING 

           JEMAL rolls to a halt and gets out of the car. MURPHY and 
           his men stand in front of him. 

                                 MURPHY
                        Where is he?

                                 JEMAL
                        Not until I know she’s safe..
                     (beat)
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           MURPHY nods to one of his men who goes inside the 
           warehouse.
           They wait for a few moments. JEMAL stands there, looking at 
           them, reading the odds. He’s completely outnumbered. But, 
           this was always going to be a one way ticket. It had to be.

           And then SARAH appears at the entrance, bruised, battered, 
           whatever they did to her will stay with her for the rest of 
           her life. She sees JEMAL, not quite believing it’s him for 
           a second - like it’s a dream. Then she runs toward him.

           SARAH wraps herself around JEMAL, nearly knocking him off 
           his feet. They look into each other’s eyes. Her face has 
           been savaged, her clothes torn and bloodstained. Tears of 
           relief, fear and sadness stream down her face.

           JEMAL looks at her, for the first time, with a sense of 
           peace. There is no more fight, no more inner turmoil, he’s 
           completely given in to her. It’s not tearing him apart 
           anymore, it’s something divine, something beautiful, that 
           will be his salvation in his final moments.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JEMAL
                        It’s okay.
                     (beat)
                        I have to go now.

           She knows what he means. His words are like daggers. The 
           thought of being alone again fills her with dread. Her fear 
           is palpable as JEMAL holds onto her.

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t leave me.

                                 JEMAL
                        I have to go away now, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        But....

           She doesn’t finish - because it’s too hard. He wipes her 
           tears away and kisses her gently, for the last time.

                                 SARAH
                        I love you. I do.

           JEMAL nods, it’s all he can do not to break apart.

                                 JEMAL
                        Goodbye, Sarah.

           It’s looks like the most painful thing he’s ever had to 
           say. And with those words, SARAH begins to break down. 
           JEMAL forces her away and she falls to her knees, realizing 
           what is about to happen. 
           He turns his back on her, knowing her life lays ahead of 
           her with all kinds of possibilities because of what he’s 
           about to do. 

           It soothes him, it calms him.

           SARAH gets up off her knees and runs after him. He stops, 
           turning to face her.  

           They embrace and then look into each other’s eyes.

                                 JEMAL
                     (beat)
                        Live for the both of us.

           And then he leans in and says something, whispers it into 
           her ear. Maybe it’s those ‘three words’ we all yearn to 
           hear in our lives. Or, maybe it’s something else. We’ll 
           never know. She moves back and looks at him for the very 
           last time. A trace of a smile on his lips as he looks into 
           the very depths of her soul.

                                 JEMAL
                        Go. Don’t stop, don’t look back. 
                        Just go.

           After a moment, SARAH turns and half runs, half stumbles 
           away, tears streaming down her face.

           JEMAL turns and looks at MURPHY’S men approaching. He holds 
           up the car keys. One of the thugs takes the keys. The other 
           hits him across his head, knocking him to the ground.

           INT. CAR BOOT - MORNING

           ON JACKIE, bloody, tied up and terrified. The men help him 
           out and carry him back into the warehouse. MURPHY shows no 
           emotion as his younger brother is taken past him. He nods 
           at the other thugs and they grab JEMAL and drag him into 
           the warehouse. Once everyone is inside, the door closes 
           with a final brutality.

           EXT. STREETS - MORNING

           SARAH running, weeping, stumbling, losing it completely.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING

           The blows rain down on JEMAL. His face covered in blood as 
           he takes the hits. He seems impervious, numb to the pain, 
           in a haven all of his own. He’s free now, because of her, 
           not because he’s haunted by the demons of his past anymore.
           She’s like a light shining through the dark caverns of his 
           mind, lulling him into an all consuming calm. He’s finally 
           at peace now.

           MURPHY leans in CLOSE to JEMAL, looking directly into his 
           eyes. A moment passes between them.

                                 MURPHY
                        Time to die.

                                 JEMAL
                        I know.

           Then the ALARM on JEMAL’S watch begins to BEEP. He pulls 
           down his coat zip in one fluid movement to reveal the 
           EXPLOSIVE DEVICE wrapped around his chest. In his other 
           hand, the OBJECT we’ve seen before, the DETONATOR. 

           MURPHY frozen. His men look on astonished.

           JEMAL smiles, like a veil coming down across his bloodied 
           face. He’s shining now.

                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           JEMAL’S last ever thought.

           SARAH, asleep, looking radiant, looking beautiful.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING

           CLOSE ON JEMAL, smiling, as he presses the DETONATOR. 

                                 MURPHY
                        What are -

           MURPHY’S last ever words cut short.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING

           As the front of the warehouse EXPLODES in a gigantic 
           eruption of fire, glass and metal. The windows from the 
           upper floor shatter onto the cars parked nearby, setting 
           off the alarms. A huge fireball rolls out, shooting upward 
           into the early morning sky.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. JEMAL’S FLAT - MORNING

           SARAH comes into the living room. The TV is on, showing the 
           breaking news. SARAH looks on, absolutely distraught.
                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        We can confirm that there have so 
                        far been three large explosions 
                        reported on the london 
                        underground transport system. The 
                        explosions occurred at Warren 
                        Street, Baker Street and 
                        Embankment stations at just after 
                        eight thirty this morning. 
                        Reports coming in of a high 
                        number of fatalities and 
                        countless others injured. And 
                        we’re also receiving unconfirmed 
                        reports of another explosion that 
                        took place around this time at an 
                        abandoned warehouse, which seems, 
                        at the moment, as if it’s being 
                        treated as an unrelated incident 
                        to what is happening in central 
                        london right now. Again, these 
                        are unconfirmed reports and we’ll 
                        bring you up to date as soon as 
                        we have more news during this 
                        horrific time when all our 
                        thoughts and prayers are with 
                        those caught up in this unfolding 
                        tragedy.  

           SARAH somehow manages to make it to the table and slumps 
           onto the chair. She begins to weep, quietly. Her head 
           resting next to the PLANT and the envelope which we see has 
           her name scrawled upon it.

           EXT. RESERVOIR - DAY

           CLOSE ON dirt being dug up by SARAH. We’re back at the 
           first place JEMAL took her to. She places the PLANT in its 
           new ‘home’. She looks over at the sea of green trees in 
           front of her. A gust of wind picks up, the trees begin to 
           sing, the leaves begin to dance. And she begins to cry.

           FADE TO BLACK - TITLE CARD - 8 MONTHS LATER

           INT. SUPERMARKET CHECKOUT - DAY

           SARAH, sitting at the checkout, pricing up items, we can’t 
           see her full body. She looks different, full of life, full 
           of health, full of hope.

                                 JEMAL (V.O.)
                        If you’re watching this, then it 
                        means I’m dead. I never thought I 
                        would ever be scared of dying....
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           We see SARAH from the waist up, walking, happy, content 
           with herself, her place in the world. Her eyes look more 
           open, more kinder, a lot different to how we last saw her.

                                 JEMAL (V.O.)
                        ....but, death only really began 
                        to  make me feel that way with 
                        the knowledge of life. You did 
                        that. That it can all end, even 
                        when you don’t really want it to. 
                        Life after my death will be a 
                        better one now. Because of you. 
                        And maybe there’s a chance I will 
                        see you again.....

           INT. LIVING ROOM. SARAH’S FLAT - DAY

           SARAH sits watching the end of JEMAL’S taped message on TV. 
           We see him addressing the camera, looking directly at us.

                                 JEMAL - ON SCREEN.
                        ......I always thought that I 
                        would die alone. But, I was 
                        wrong. Now when I close my eyes 
                        and sleep, I won’t be lost.
                     (beat)
                        I’ll be dreaming of you.

           And then his grainy image is swallowed up by static.

           SARAH switches the TV off with the remote, affected by his 
           last words. And then she stands up and we MOVE OUT to see 
           her pregnant, full belly. 

           She stands by the window and places her hand on her stomach 
           as the sunshine pours in. She looks at the world outside, 
           less suspicious of it, less devastated by it, toward a 
           brighter future. 

           Maybe, just maybe.
