          "Come away, O human child: To the waters and the wild with a 
          fairy, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you 
          can understand." -William Butler Yeats
           Once upon a time...

           FADE IN:

           EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

           The moon floats across the sky like a milk-white 
           cataract.  Silver light shoots over a dense fog melting 
           past the red-brick walls of a long, INDUSTRIAL ALLEYWAY.  

           Swollen storm clouds begin swirling overhead.  A deep 
           peal of thunder RUMBLES in the distance.

           Suddenly, a brilliant pin of EMERALD LIGHT flits into 
           frame.  

           It darts past rotted trash cans, sagging clothes lines 
           and graffitied CAMPAIGN POSTERS plastered everywhere.

           A gust of wind shoots the bright object

           SKYWARD  

           where it whirls through the air, coming to a rest inside 
           the toothed maw of a concrete GARGOYLE overlooking the 
           alley.  

           We are now able to make out the light’s hair-thin legs, 
           gossamer wings and insect-like features.  

           It’s a PIXIE.  

           The creature pushes off the gargoyle and makes its way to 
           a shattered

           WINDOW

           on the upper level of a dilapidated APARTMENT COMPLEX.

           The pixie carefully navigates through the opening, 
           entering 

           INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           An eerie silence.  Pitch black, save for the pixie’s 
           incandescent glow.  Intermittent SHOCKS of lightning 
           momentarily clarify the room’s grimy insides.  

           It houses some sort of complex, bronze and glass 
           STEAMPUNK LAB.  

           Shattered objects and chemicals are spilled everywhere.  
           The front door has been slashed to splinters.

           CLOSE ON 
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The pixie shooting to the ground, carefully stepping 
           across the cold linoleum floor toward something cloaked 
           in shadow.  

           The pixie’s delicate feet finally stop.  Ahead of them is 
           thick pool of 

           STEAMING BLOOD, slowly spreading across the floor.

           Another jolt of lightning reveals someone in a grimy 
           labcoat, cheek down, splayed across the ground.  

           It’s a woman.  Piercing blue eyes with lustrous, short 
           cropped flaxen hair.  Beautiful, sad, DEAD.  

           Her body has been torn to pieces.  Bone deep burgundy 
           slashes are etched across her otherwise flawless skin.  A 
           star-like SYMBOL has been BURNED into her forehead.

           As we slowly pull back from the corpse, more pixies 
           appear out of the ether.  A small SWARM hovers on her 
           body like bees to a honey trap.

           Outside the window, a white hot arc of lightning slices 
           through the sky.  

           A loud BOOM finally gives way to a torrential downpour.

           SUPER-UP:  “THE EVER AFTER MURDERS”

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. GRIMM CITY (AERIAL VIEW) -- NIGHT

           A storm has erupted over the city, a crumbling metropolis 
           of oxidized steel skyscrapers stretching to infinity.  

           We drift above the chimneys and smokestacks, where POLICE 
           ZEPPELINS keep vigil, shooting spotlights over rain 
           soaked cobblestone streets.

           A thick forest of impossibly high conifers surrounds the 
           city, each one shivering in the ice-cold wind.

           SUPER-UP:  “GRIMM CITY”

                                 THUMB (V.O.)
                        Grimm City:  a metropolis at the 
                        edge of forever.  A sideshow, 
                        where man and monster have been 
                        cursed to roam.  Where dark 
                        secrets kept by strung out fairies 
                        and doped up dwarves have rotted 
                        the apple to its core.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We move through the city, settling on the outside of a 
           moving, unmarked POLICE CRUISER.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER -- CONTINUOUS

           Driving is DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT TOM THUMB, lean, 
           powerful, human sized.

           He carefully removes a prescription bottle from his 
           leather coat and pops MEDICATION into his mouth.  

           A white glint plays across a silver DETECTIVE’S BADGE 
           fastened to his lapel.  He speaks in a British accent. 

                                 THUMB (V.O.)
                        People like to say this place is 
                        filled with two kinds of people -- 
                        sippers and gulpers.  As a cop, 
                        there’s only one thing you need to 
                        know about policing an enemy who 
                        can turn metal cuffs into 
                        macaroons: a sip and gulp can be 
                        the difference between a splash...

           Thumb gets a call on the radio.

                                 THUMB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and a tsunami.

           He picks up a receiver on the dash.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.

                                 RADIO
                        Break-in’s been reported at the 
                        Cottage Apartments.  Downtown.

                                 THUMB
                        I’ll be right there.

           Thumb slams the gas, shooting his cruiser into the night.

           EXT. COTTAGE APARTMENTS -- LATE NIGHT

           Red-brick and mortar.  Forty stories high.  A stairwell 
           inside illuminated by the soft glow of amber lanterns.

           Thumb’s cruiser glides through the rain and settles at 
           the base of the building.  He parks, checks his weapon 
           and walks toward the entrance.

           Hundreds of ADVERTISING BILLS for the race for mayor, 
           some defaced, have been pasted onto the front of the 
           building.
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           On his way to the door, Thumb tilts his head up, taking 
           note of several dozen pixies drifting through the air 
           above him.

           An OLD BEGGAR in rags suddenly appears out of nowhere.  
           Pearl white skin, intense blue eyes and long, thin ears.  

           He’s an ELF.  Raving mad.

                                 OLD BEGGAR
                        I saw it!  The whole thing!  Ten 
                        stories tall with a dark cloak!

                                 THUMB
                        Calm down.

           Thumb notices a thin film of GOLD DUST rimming the elf’s 
           nose and mouth.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        You’re high.  Get lost.

           The elf waves Thumb off, muttering as it disappears into 
           a nearby alleyway.

           Thumb cautiously approaches the complex’s entrance, when 
           there’s a

           Blood curdling SCREAM from above!  

           Just as he looks up -

           BANG!

           The door in front of him SHOOTS open, throwing him off 
           his feet and onto the curb.  

           A FIGURE, whose face we can’t see, sprints out of the 
           opening, past Thumb and into the street.

           Thumb shakes off the cobwebs, grits his teeth and 
           explodes into a sprint.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

           Thumb huffs and puffs through the rain, darting between 
           TRAFFIC and neon lit SHOPS, inching closer to his suspect 
           with each labored step.

           Just ahead, a crowd has formed in front of the window to 
           an 

           ELECTRONICS SHOP

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           where dozens of televisions are all turned to a local 
           NEWS REPORT on the city’s ongoing MAYORAL ELECTION.

           Thumb watches the figure quickly approach the crowd, 
           plowing through it like an out of control locomotive.  

           People scatter in every direction, just as the suspect 
           disappears into a

           DARK ALLEYWAY

           filled with rats, burning cars, fire escapes and tangled 
           telephone wires.  

           Thumb unholsters his gun, points through the slums.  
           Nothing.

           Then, he sees a dark figure climbing up a rusted FIRE 
           ESCAPE.

                                 THUMB
                        FREEZE!!!

           Thumb unloads a few rounds at the fire escape.  Bullets 
           skitter around the alley with a PING-PANG-PONG.

           He hoists himself onto the escape ladder and quickly 
           climbs hand over hand to the building’s

           ROOFTOP

           where the night is illuminated only by shafts of 
           moonlight, filtered through fog and steam.

           The shadowy figure is waiting for Thumb.

           Thumb pulls his weapon, out of breath and surprised.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        You’re fast.  
                                 (a beat)
                        Get on the ground.

           The figure stands motionless, breath frosting.

           Thumb CLICKS back the hammer on his gun.  

           The noise SCARES a flock of cooing pigeons, distracting 
           him.

           The figure suddenly appearing out of nowhere! 

           He kicks Thumb’s gun out of his hands, then delivers a 
           sickening PUNCH to his ribs with a CRACK!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Thumb’s body goes sailing across the roof and through an 
           old wooden door, SHATTERING it to splinters.

           Just as Thumb recovers, the figure leaps off the roof, 
           descending through the endless murk without trace.

           EXT. COTTAGE APARTMENTS -- LATER

           Sheets of rain smack and plop onto the backs of BEAT COPS 
           taking down witness statements.

           Thumb is sitting on the hood of his car getting bandaged 
           up by an EMT, staring off into space.

           A young, intense woman with bright ruby hair, a crimson 
           hood and pince-nez glasses, goes to greet him.  DETECTIVE 
           RACHEL RIDING.

                                 RIDING
                        Lieutenant Thumb?

           Thumb’s still day dreaming.

                                 THUMB
                        It’s detective... 
                                 (making eye contact)
                        ...Thumb.

           The two shake hands.  Thumb looks Riding over.  He likes 
           what he sees.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Have we met?

           Riding rolls her eyes.

                                 RIDING
                        I’m Detective Rachel Riding.  

           Thumb isn’t listening.  

                                 THUMB
                        So that’s a “no” to having met 
                        before?  Or at least, remembering 
                        the great time we may or may not 
                        have had?

           A beat.  Riding’s immune to his charms.

                                 RIDING
                        You’re taller than I expected.

           Thumb goes quiet.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THUMB
                        What can I do for you?

                                 RIDING
                        I’m your new partner.

           Thumb can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 THUMB
                        You asked to be transferred here?

                                 RIDING
                        Yes.

                                 THUMB
                        From where?

                                 RIDING
                        The suburbs.

                                 THUMB
                        And the captain assigned you to 
                        me?

           He begins laughing.

                                 RIDING
                        Is there a problem?

                                 THUMB
                        I’m sure there will be.

           INT. STAIRWELL, COTTAGE APARTMENTS -- NIGHT

           Thumb charges ahead.  Riding begins reading notes from a 
           pad of paper.

                                 RIDING
                        No I.D. on the guy you ran down, 
                        but the owner of this apartment 
                        complex is Happy Zwerg.

                        Dwarf brothers who co-manage these

                        the victim. 

                                 THUMB
                        Knew a few dealers when I was a 
                        narc.  They like to run farms in 
                        this area for local traffickers.

           Thumb seems annoyed.

                                 THUMB
                        Next time, try coming to class 
                        prepared dear.

                                 (off her look)
                        Farms are brew houses for the

                                 THUMB
                        Oh you’ve heard of him?  Great.

           EXT. BUILDING HALLWAY DOOR -- NIGHT

           Dozens and dozens of pixies drift through the air, 
           blowing past Thumb and Riding like lightning bugs as they 
           make their way to the scene.

           Strips of yellow crime scene tape are being put up by ELF 
           COPS.

           Two CSIs sprinkle silver powder across the wooden boards 
           of the hallway, illuminating on them dozens of CLAWED and 
           HUMAN footprints.  One above the other.

           Thumb quickly stops by one of the CSIs.

                                 THUMB
                        Anything?

           One CSI looks up, disgruntled.

                                 CSI
                        A hundred people have walked down 
                        this hallway.  Half of them 
                        Otherkin.

                                 RIDING
                        Otherkin?

                                 (to Thumb)
                        Where’d you pick up the rookie?  

           Thumb turns to Riding.

                                 THUMB
                        Boy, we’re gonna have to get you a 
                        tutor or something.

           Thumb and Riding continue walking, settling at the door 
           to the apartment in question.  It’s been torn to 
           splinters.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Anyone been inside?

                                 RIDING
                        Not since it happened.

           Thumb snaps on a pair of green latex gloves and 
           cautiously opens the door. 

           He moves to flip a light switch.  Nothing. 

           Riding hands him a flashlight, which he clicks on 
           revealing the

           GRISLY CRIME SCENE

           an apartment whose contents have been violently shredded 
           to scraps.  

           Thumb sweeps his flashlight over the kitchen floor, 
           casting an eerie blue glow over cockroaches skittering 
           across a chilled linoleum floor.

           Thick smears and spatters of BLOOD lead to a common area, 
           where what remains of a body lies motionless.  

           The once recognizable corpse we saw earlier, has been 
           reduced to a leather-skinned, bone-dry husk of a human 
           being.

           Hundreds of pixies buzz about it.  Flies on a rotting 
           piece of meat.

           Riding looks sickened.  She continues reciting 
           information from her notepad.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        Victim’s name was Golda Locke.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Thumb approaches the body, bating away pixies from her 
           skeletal face.

           He sees the burned SYMBOL on her forehead.

                                 THUMB
                        Witch’s pentacle.

           Thumb notices a series of deep marks torn across the 
           victim’s neck and arms.  

           Riding impatiently waits for Thumb to say something.

                                 RIDING
                        So?

           Thumb removes a small GLASS VIAL with blue liquid in it 
           from his coat.  He traps one of the pixies, corking the 
           top.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        Detective?

           The light desperately thrashes and SQUEALS inside.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing?

           Thumb motions to the dots of light all around them.

                                 THUMB
                        Pixies.  Like to feed on the 
                        blood.

           Thumb nods to the test tube which suddenly glows a 
           brilliant RUBY RED.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Killer was cursed.  That 
                        complicates things.

                                 RIDING
                        Meaning?

                                 THUMB
                        Whoever did this could have been a 
                        human, elf, dwarf, fairy...

                                 RIDING
                                 (sarcastically)
                        That narrows it down some.

           Thumb points to the scar on the victim’s head.

                                 THUMB
                        Witches curse thousands of people 
                        a year.  Expensive, but not 
                        uncommon.

                                 RIDING
                        What sort of curses?

                                 THUMB
                        Usually things like an ex-wife 
                        wanting revenge on her husband.  
                        Curses him to an eternity of 
                        blisters and body hair.  Things 
                        like that.  Takes skill to turn a 
                        person into something capable of 
                        doing all this though.

                                 RIDING
                        Well no offense, but it seems 
                        pretty obvious whatever was cursed 
                        wasn’t human.

           Thumb tosses the vial in her direction.  She catches it, 
           quickly inspecting its contents.  

           Inside floats a small, pale-skinned, humanoid looking 
           INSECT with paper-thin gold leaf wings.

           Glass crunches under Thumb’s feet.  

           A large COMPLEX LAB has been smashed to pieces.  

           Orbs and beakers filled with odd liquids are splashed 
           across the floor.

           Riding anxiously pushes up her glasses.

           To Thumb, this sort of thing is fairly routine.

                                 THUMB
                        Is it hot in here? 

           He picks and prods at what remains of the experiment, 
           noticing a few dozen NOTEBOOKS filled with scribbles.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Expensive equipment.  

           Thumb picks up a notebook, flips the pages.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Definitely looks like she was 
                        doing a cook.

           CONTINUED: (4)

           A small amount of SHIMMERING BLUE POWDER lines the 
           outside of one broken beaker at his feet.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Not sure this is Z though.

                                 RIDING
                        So she was dealing out of the 
                        house.  Maybe an exchange gone 
                        wrong?  

           Thumb pinches the blue powder between his fingers, 
           quickly bottles a sample.  He doesn’t answer back.

           Riding’s annoyed.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I don’t wanna get off on 
                        the wrong foot here, but...

           Thumb moves into the

           KITCHEN

           where he notices a dusty, candy-filled GIFT BASKET 
           sitting on a countertop.  He removes a GREETING CARD 
           stapled to its outsides.

           A portly CORONER waddles into the room, slapping Thumb on 
           the back.

                                 CORONER
                        Hey Tommy.

           Riding motions to the fat man.  

                                 RIDING
                        I’ll need a few more minutes with 
                        the scene.

           The coroner takes one look around, doesn’t like what he 
           sees.

                                 CORONER
                        Eeesh.  I’m sorry, but a clean-up 
                        crew’s gotta get in here right 
                        away.

           He points to the pixies.

                                 CORONER (CONT’D)
                        Before the body attracts something 
                        bigger.
           EXT. COTTAGE APARTMENTS -- MOMENTS LATER

           It’s stopped raining.  

           Thumb’s briskly walking to his car, Riding a few steps in 
           tow.

                                 RIDING
                        I don’t know what the problem is 
                        here.  I understand you aren’t 
                        used to working with newly 
                        promoted detectives, but I earned 
                        mine.

                                 THUMB
                        Judging by how knowledgeable you 
                        seem to be, I kind of doubt that.

                                 RIDING
                        Listen, I’m not asking for special 
                        treatment, but if this is your 
                        idea of breaking me in, I --

           Thumb become impatient.

                                 THUMB
                        Just...
                                 (finding the words)
                        ...stay outta my way.

           Riding stops walking, offended.

                                 RIDING
                        Like hell I will.  This is our 
                        case detective.

           Thumb turns to her, removes his pills and slams a few 
           down.

                                 THUMB
                        Make contact with Happy Zwerg.  
                        See what he knows about Locke and 
                        who she may have hung out with.  
                        I’ll meet you at the station when 
                        I’m done.

           Riding isn’t satisfied.

                                 RIDING
                        That’ll take 15 minutes Thumb. 

           Thumb buckles into his cruiser.

           CONTINUED:

           Thumb slams his car door shut and speeds through the 
           cold.

           EXT. OLD MARKET, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

           Ten ramshackle blocks of the city cut from wood and 
           cobblestone.  A living antique, covered in rusted green 
           metal siding and twinkling orange lanterns.

           Thumb’s cruiser idles in front of HANSEL & GRETEL’S CANDY 
           SHOPPE - a city landmark and confectionery literally 
           constructed out of every sweet ever conceived.

           Thumb eyes a strung out TEENAGE ELF, gold around his 
           mouth, suspiciously pacing in front of the store.  

           Suddenly, the elf pulls a chisel from his coat, chips off 
           a large chunk of a candy cane buttress and disappears 
           into an alleyway.

           INT. HANSEL & GRETEL CANDY SHOPPE -- NIGHT

           Clogged wall to wall with shimmering sweets and chromed 
           soda fountains.  

           Lemon drop lanterns swing above floors crafted from 
           mahogany peanut brittle.  Walls of swollen ginger bread 
           are ornately decorated in frosting murals of Hansel & 
           Gretel’s famous exploits.

           Thumb makes his way to the counter, but there’s no one 
           there.

           He searches through the shop, finding an open door to a 
           small 

           MANUFACTURING PLANT

           dimly lit, save for a large furnace at its core.  The 
           furnace feeds power to sizable STEEL MACHINES crowding 
           the oversized room.  

           Each machine quickly pumps liquid candy onto molds 
           sliding over long conveyor belts.

           Thumb takes a look around, notices someone in greased 
           overalls, gloves and a welder’s mask feeding wood into 
           the furnace.

                                 THUMB
                        Excuse me.

           The fire feeder turns, flipping up her mask.  GRETEL 
           CASSEL, a graceful but homely looking young woman with 
           coral eyes and a thick German accent.

                        We’re closed for the night.

           Thumb pulls out the GREETING CARD he swiped from the 
           crime scene.

                                 THUMB
                        Golda Locke.  You know her?

           Gretel shoots him a concerned look.

                                 GRETEL
                        Who’s asking?

                                 THUMB
                        I’ll get to that.

           Gretel takes off her gloves, knowingly looking over 
           Thumb’s shoulder.

                                 GRETEL
                        How do you know Goldie?  Is she in 
                        some sort of trouble?

                                 THUMB
                        Yes.

           Gretel’s voice begins trembling.

                                 GRETEL
                        What happened to her?

           Her face tightens up, eyes now intensely focused on 
           someone standing behind Thumb.

           A nickel plated MAGNUM clicks at Thumb’s head.  

           HANSEL CASSEL, a shock of tawny hair sitting atop a 
           heavily muscled frame, has his finger on the hammer.  
           Hansel too looks like he’s been working the machines.

                                 HANSEL
                        You’ve got about five seconds to 
                        get outta here before I turn your 
                        head into pie filling.

           Thumb pulls back his leather coat.  He’s had his gun 
           pointed at Hansel’s groin the entire time.

                                 THUMB
                        You’ve got three to decide if you 
                        ever wanna have kids.

           Gretel notices Thumb’s badge and calls Hansel off.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        He’s a cop.

           Breathing a sigh of relief, Hansel clicks the safety on.

                                 HANSEL 
                        Thought you were a dealer.

           Gretel turns to Thumb.

                                 GRETEL
                        Is she alright?

                                 THUMB
                        No.  We found her murdered earlier 
                        tonight.  

           Gretel breaks down, crumpling into Hansel’s arms.  Hansel 
           does his best to console her, turning to Thumb.

                                 HANSEL
                        You always break good news to 
                        people like this?

           Thumb motions to the greeting card.

                                 THUMB
                        You two were arrested for doing Z 
                        cooks in your candy shop.  Sent 
                        out baskets laced with product.  I 
                        know because I trained the narco 
                        who pinched you.

                                 HANSEL
                        I think you’d better go now.

                                 THUMB
                        I think you’d better listen to 
                        what I have to say.

           Hansel and Gretel are both taken off guard.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        This’ a nice shop.  Expensive 
                        equipment.  
                                 (a beat)
                        I remember reading about that 
                        sicko who took you as kids.  How 
                        she tortured you for weeks in 
                        those cabins.  Did it to dozens of 
                        others, but you two escaped.  
                        Memories like that, I guess it 
                        makes sense you two turned into a 
                        couple of junkies.

           Gretel looks disturbed.

                                 GRETEL
                        What do you want?

                                 THUMB
                        To explain it seems obvious you 
                        were still slumming it with Locke.

                                 GRETEL
                        What’re you talking about?

                                 THUMB
                        We found her lab.  The basket you 
                        sent her.  What were you trying to 
                        do, go into business for 
                        yourselves?

           Hansel tenses.  He removes a large wrench from his side 
           and begins tuning up a broken piston.

           Thumb moves to him.

                                 HANSEL
                        The truth is we were all hooked.  
                        But that was a long time ago.  
                        After Gretel and I got busted, 
                        Goldie helped clean us up.

           Thumb notices a few smears of blue powder on the 
           machinery.  The same kind he saw at Golda’s apartment.

                                 THUMB
                        What do you mean?  Like, she was 
                        on bathroom duty?  You don’t think 
                        I’m dumb enough to buy she turned 
                        Mother Goose when you two tried to 
                        kick the habit?

           Hansel looks to Gretel, who looks to Thumb.

                                 GRETEL
                        You are an asshole.

           Gretel storms off.  Thumb watches her go.

                                 THUMB
                        I’m used to it.

           Thumb turns to Hansel.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        So you don’t know who could’ve 
                        done this to her?

                        So you wouldn’t know if she was 
                        seeing someone?  

           Hansel goes back to work on the piston.

                                 HANSEL
                        She had an on again off again 
                        boyfriend.  Not sure if she was 
                        still seeing him.

                        Who?

                                 HANSEL
                        Some dealer.  Otherkin.

                        I dunno.  Hard to keep up.

           A tense beat.  Thumb slips his card into Hansel’s 
           overalls.

                                 THUMB
                        You get your memory back, gimme a

           EXT. HAPPY ZWERG’S LODGE -- LATER, NIGHT

           The fringes of Grimm.  A thick pall of ice fog has 
           settled around GIGANTIC PINES standing guard over the 
           timberland.

           A metal gate clinks behind Riding’s cruiser.  It coasts 
           past a mailbox, tires crunching gravel before coming to a 
           rest.
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The LODGE is something out of a storybook.  Heavy raw 
           logs stacked one over the other, branches uncut.  Melted 
           candles lit inside large cast iron lamps.

           Riding exits her vehicle and slowly approaches the house.  

           Suddenly, the cottage begins to 

           SHAKE and RATTLE.  Something enormous is moving around 
           inside. 

           Riding quickly pulls her weapon and heads for an open 
           window, curtains fluttering.

           At the window, rasping HISSES, bones CRACKING and a 
           SIZZLING noise.  Screams inside dwindle to a hoarse MOAN.

           Riding sums up the courage to quickly peek inside of the 

           COTTAGE WINDOW

           where the hulking, cloaked silhouette of something 
           TERRIFYING is hunched over HAPPY ZWERG, its back turned 
           to us.  

           Happy’s on the floor, mouth agape, stocking cap torn 
           above eyes rolled deep into his head.  A PENTACLE 
           suddenly BURNS itself into his forehead.

           The creature drops the dwarf with a THUD, revealing blood 
           splashed everywhere.  Bookshelves.  The fireplace. 

           Riding quickly looks away, green with sickness.  She 
           tries to sum up the courage to enter through the window 
           just as -

           Something GROWLS through the opening.  Hot breath 
           shooting smoke just above her head.  

           She is absolutely petrified.

           The creature releases a deep, spine tingling GROWL.  
           Riding covers her mouth, desperately muffling her own 
           terror.

           Then, the growling stops.  A sense of relief washes over 
           her.  

           An emerald pixie floats down from the window.

           Carefully backing up from the lodge, Riding notices a 
           trail of pixies leading from outside the cottage to the 
           forest behind the house.

           She decides to follow the trail into 
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           THE FOREST

           dark, primordial, brimming with life.  The burping of 
           toads and cooing of owls slowly fills the air.       

           Riding navigates through the maze, following hundreds of 
           pixies now drifting through the trees.  

           A torn YELLOW RIBBON flutters off a low hanging branch.  
           A few smears of blood on the trunks of saplings are thick 
           with feeding pixies.  

           Riding passes a SMALL POND, gun pointed.  

           There’s a SPLASH.

           The forest goes silent.  A predator is nearby.

           Riding tries to stay strong.  A twig CRACKS a few feet 
           from her ahead of a small 

           CAVE

           which Riding cautiously approaches.  There are no pixies 
           here. 

           She aims her gun into the cave, when there’s a LOUD 
           growl!

           Something races toward her out of the darkness!

           Riding reacts, CRACKING gunfire into the cave, 
           illuminating what may be the creature in full view, but -  

           It’s a BEAR.

           Bloodied from gunfire, crashing to the ground mere feet 
           from Riding where it sadly MOANS in its death throes.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. HAPPY ZWERG’S LODGE -- EARLY MORNING

           A HELICOPTER hovers like a buzzard overhead.

           Black and white POLICE CRUISERS now line the perimeter of 
           the lodge, each one casting red and blue winks of light 
           over the forest.  

           Thumb is talking to his older, Irish POLICE CAPTAIN JOHN 
           MACCOOL.  

           A GIANT.  Tall and thick with pulsing veins snaking 
           across his bumpy skin, MacCool’s colossally muscled 
           presence seriously intimidates.
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Almost had the bastard.   

           Thumb seems annoyed with MacCool.  He looks over to 
           Riding, who’s breaking the news to Happy Zwerg’s SIX 
           BROTHERS.  Wrinkled old men in wool hats and buckskin 
           boots.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Pixies around the body?

           Thumb tosses MacCool a vial filled with one.

                                 THUMB
                        Same kind.  Same pentacle scar. 

           MacCool exhales with concern.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Listen Tom, been meaning to have a 
                        chat with you.  Election’s in 
                        three days.  Department’s already 
                        getting calls from the mayor’s 
                        office.  Wants to look tough on 
                        crime ahead of the vote.  Word on 
                        the street is there’s a fat prize 
                        for whoever gets this wrapped up 
                        neatly.

           Thumb looks regretful, pulls out a bottle of pills and 
           downs a couple.

                                 THUMB
                        Just let me do my job.

           Riding finishes with the dwarves and walks to meet Thumb 
           and MacCool.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        How’d they take it?

                                 RIDING
                        Still in shock.

           Thumb turns to Riding.

                                 THUMB
                        What’d you find?

                                 RIDING
                        Blood.  Lots of it.

           MacCool lets out a sigh.

                        Guy looked pretty healthy to me.

           Riding tosses Thumb a baggy.  Inside is a laced RIBBON.

                        Found it on one of the branches.

                        Yeah.  Hide and go seek.  With a 
                        bear.

           Captain MacCool breaks things up.

                        Nothing unique about the ribbon.  
                        It’s sold in a thousand shops

                        This is a waste of time.  There’s 
                        nothing here.

           Thumb begins walking to his cruiser.  Riding quickly 
           follows him.

           MacCool shouts out.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Where are you going Thumb?

                                 THUMB
                        To check on something.

           Thumb prepares to get in his car.  Riding puts her hand 
           on his shoulder.  

                                 RIDING
                        Listen to me.  We have to work 
                        together on this.  These people 
                        deserve justice.  

           Thumb looks at Riding’s hand on his shoulder, thinking.

                        All I want is stop whoever’s doing 
                        this.  Why can’t you understand 
                        that?

           Thumb sees something in her eyes.  A look he once had.

           He opens his car door and signals for her to get into the 
           CRUISER.

           INT. THUMB’S CRUISER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Where he explains himself.

                                 THUMB
                        So do I.  

           Thumb buckles in and turns to her.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        You really want to find out who 
                        did this, we have to keep MacCool 
                        and anyone else asking questions, 
                        out.  

                                 RIDING
                        I think we can trust the captain.

                                 THUMB
                        We can’t trust anyone.  Not when 
                        these sort of forces are at work.

                                 RIDING
                        So what do we do?

                                 THUMB
                        Fly under the radar.

           Riding looks confused.

                                 RIDING
                        How?

           Thumb takes a moment to think.

                                 THUMB
                        I’m gonna do something I don’t

                                 RIDING
                        What’s that?

                        here.

           Thumb removes a bottle from his pocket.  Inside is a 
           shimmering BLUE POWDER.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Recovered it from Locke’s lab.  
                        Found some at Hansel and Gretel’s 
                        candy shop and just took a sample 
                        from Happy Zwerg’s cabin. 

           Riding rolls the bottle in her hands.

                                 RIDING
                        What is it?

                                 THUMB
                        Dunno.  It’s what Golda Locke was 
                        cooking at her lab.  Could be a 
                        new, more powerful form of Z she 
                        and Stiltskin were planning to 
                        roll out.

                        So we run it through forensics.

                                 THUMB
                        No.  It turns out to be something 
                        big and we’ll get dropped from 
                        this case.  We need to take it 
                        somewhere else.  

                                 RIDING
                        Where?

           Thumb hesitates for a moment.

                                 THUMB
                        The Black Market.

           Riding shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 RIDING
                        You’ve got to be joking.  You know 
                        how many people get killed there a 
                        day?  Even in the suburbs we know 
                        about that place.

           Thumb shakes his head “yes.”

                        How badly do you want to solve 
                        this case detective?

           EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY

           A golden sun meanders through jade clouds drifting 
           overhead.  This city hall is as Gothic as they come, even 
           during the day.  Huge spires jab into the sky, sandwiched 
           between baroque frescos.  

           There’s a sizable CAMPAIGN RALLY underway.  Humans and 
           Otherkin stand side by side, holding political posters of 
           their beloved incumbent, MAYOR ADAM PRINCE.

           Both the mayor and his wife, BELLE PRINCE, step out from 
           behind a satin curtain to cheers and applause.

           The mayor, a ROSE on his lapel, approaches the podium.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Thank you!  Thank you all!

           He turns to Belle.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        Belle and I can’t tell you how 
                        much your support means to us.

           Someone begins chanting “FOUR MORE YEARS.”

                                 MAYOR PRINCE (CONT’D)
                                 (smiling)
                        Help us make that a reality!

           A group of supporters quickly hoist signs in opposition 
           to the mayor’s opponent, SNOW WHITMORE, who we’ll see 
           later.  

           We move down from the posters, past the supporters feet, 
           below the steam floating above manhole covers, into the 
           INT. SEWERS BENEATH GRIMM -- DAY

           We’re deep underground.  A maze.  Endless concrete 
           tunnels rimmed with rust.  Honeycomb metal grating and 
           lead piping on all sides.  

           A few shafts of daylight shoot down onto a shallow river 
           of murky runoff. 

           Thumb and Riding are moving down the side of a tunnel.  
           Riding does not look pleased.

                                 RIDING

                        Just a little bit further dear.

           Thumb pulls a pill bottle from his coat, pops a few.

                                 RIDING
                        What are those anyway?

           LONG CORRIDOR

           leading to a circular enclosure.

                        No.  This guy’s much stranger.  
                        Even for me.

                                 RIDING
                        That’s comforting.

           Thumb motions for Riding to stop at the enclosure.  

           They’re at the feet of a perfectly calm, ink-black POOL 
           OF WATER.

                                 THUMB
                        Alright, ready for a swim?

           Riding looks to the filthy surroundings.  A dead rat 
           floats across the surface.  She turns to leave.

                                 RIDING
                        Forget it.  I’ll meet you back at 
                        the station.

           Thumb shrugs his shoulders.

                                 THUMB
                        Your loss.

           Without hesitation, he leaps off a concrete walkway to 
           the center of the pool, sliding into the water and 
           disappearing with effortless grace.

           Riding hesitates for a moment, staring into the depths.  

                                 RIDING
                        Thumb?

           Only echoes.  

           She watches the pool, waiting for an answer.  Nothing.  
           Riding pinches her nose and leaps in.

           INT. WATER -- MOMENTS LATER

           We swim along with Thumb and Riding, into an impossibly 
           beautiful 

           UNDERWATER SANCTUARY  

           Pockets of light filter in through walled grating.  
           SEAWEED sways in the current.  FISH move with ethereal 
           elegance past SUNKEN SHIPS lit up by glowing JELLYFISH.

           CONTINUED:

           Something quickly swims past Riding.  She stops in the 
           water for a moment, face to face with a 

           MERMAID - more fish than human.  Super reflective scales 
           catching the light, shimmering like buried treasure.  

           Riding blinks, and the haunting creature is gone as 
           quickly as it appeared.

           She sees Thumb swim up to the surface and follows.

           EXT. THE BLACK MARKET -- CONTINUOUS

           Thumb and Riding both bubble up to the surface of a large 
           well.  Thumb swims out and helps Riding to her feet, 
           revealing 

           THE BLACK MARKET  

           impossibly huge and totally cramped.  The Kowloon slums 
           of Hong Kong on acid.

           Hundreds and hundreds of people are buzzing about.  
           Humans.  Trolls.  Goblins.  Everything.  

           Thumb signals for Riding to walk with him down an aisle.

                                 THUMB
                        Be very careful here.  Eyes 
                        forward.  

           Riding is shell shocked.  Awestruck.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to meet a man named 
                        Oscar Zoroaster.  Owns a shop a 
                        few stalls down.

           Riding looks to her side, sees a stall selling ornate 
           GOLDEN EGGS.  

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We get to this guy, get what we 
                        need, then get the hell out of 
                        here.

           An outrageously ugly, WARTED HAG thrusts one of the eggs 
           into Riding’s face.

                                 WARTED HAG
                        Freshly laid from a Golden Goose!  
                        Two for one!

           Riding waves her off, turning to Thumb.

                        Was an engineer.  Built zeppelins 
                        for the department.  Accidentally 
                        crashed one right into city hall.  
                        Hard not to know him. 

           Riding gets distracted again, this time by a shopkeeper 
           selling bloodied UNICORN HORNS.  She points, thinking 
           she’s misunderstood what they are.

                        Umm... Those aren’t...?

                        oil or turn your head into a 
                        lollypop.  Very powerful 
                        alchemist.  Not to be trifled 
                        with.

           Thumb stops ahead of an  

           EMERALD TENT

           being guarded by a heavily muscled, LION-FACED OTHERKIN.  
           He’s tall and imposing, golden fur and primrose eyes.

           Both Riding and Thumb approach the beast.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We’re here to see Oz.

           The creature snarls, puffing up its chest.

                                 GUARD
                        No one sees Oz.

                                 THUMB
                        We have business with him.

           Thumb flashes his identification.  The creature slaps his 
           clawed hand at the badge and enters the tent.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Waiting, Thumb turns to Riding.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Remember when I said I knew this 
                        guy?

                                 RIDING
                        Yeah?

                                 THUMB
                        I knew of him.

                                 RIDING
                        Great.

           The guard parts the curtain to the tent and motions them 
           in.

                                 GUARD
                        Come with me.

           INT. OZ TENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Polished brass and glass tubing curved around every 
           surface, like MECHANICAL INTESTINES.  Things bubble and 
           churn.

           The guard leads Thumb and Riding over to a LAB STATION.  

           Sitting with his back to us is man in a lab coat and 
           Victorian clothing, soldering a half completed TIN ROBOT.

                                 MAN
                        Leave us.

           The guard disappears behind a curtain.  The man’s head 
           lifts, his back still turned.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        What business do we have?

           Thumb removes the blue powder from his coat.

                                 THUMB
                        I need an alchemist.  Someone 
                        skilled.

           The man swivels around in his chair, revealing himself to 
           be DR. OSCAR ZOROASTER.  The Wizard of Oz.  Skin pale and 
           purple veined.  Emerald eyes, heavily magnified by 
           phoropters.  

           Oz looks crazy.  A man lost and confused by his own 
           madness.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           (NOTE: Oz continually mumbles when he’s not speaking, his 
           mind seeming to operate in two different realities.)

                                 OZ
                        Then you’ve come to the right 
                        place.

           A smile creeps across his face as he recognizes Thumb.

                                 OZ (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Thumb.

           He turns to Riding.

                                 OZ (CONT’D)
                        And Little Red Riding Hood.  
                                 (winking)
                        Both grown up I see.

           There’s something unsettling about Oz.  Riding becomes 
           visibly uncomfortable.

           Oz looks to the vial in Thumb’s hand.

                                 OZ (CONT’D)
                        What’ve you brought me today good 
                        sir?

           Thumb hands over the bottle.

                                 THUMB
                        Need you to tell me whatever you 
                        can about this substance.

           Oz jiggles the blue powder inside the bottle.

                                 OZ
                        An interesting find indeed.  Let’s 
                        see what we can learn, shall we?

           He straps on a pair of ORNATE GOGGLES, hands Thumb and 
           Riding each a pair of the same.

           Oz moves to middle of the room, placing the bottle at its 
           center.  There, it LEVITATES, as if held by some 
           invisible force.

           Oz moves to a handle on a brass GENERATOR.  The generator 
           is connected to a HIGH-TECH ORGAN.  He flips it to the 
           “ON” position.

           In a flash, fingers of EMERALD LIGHTNING appear from the 
           ether, stabbing spidery jolts of electricity at the 
           bottle, now GLOWING with all the colors of the rainbow.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Different SYMBOLS drawn from smoke begin forming inside 
           the glass tubes of the organ.  Oz carefully reads them, 
           noting each.

           Thumb and Riding watch in amazement.

                                 THUMB
                        What can you tell us?

           Oz strokes his chin.

                                 OZ
                        Curiouser and curiouser.  Elusive 
                        compound you have here.

           Oz moves to the generator and turns it off.

           The lightning at the center of the room dissipates, the 
           smoky symbols inside the organ vanishing.  

           Oz removes his goggles, makes some calculations to 
           himself, then turns to them.

                                 OZ (CONT’D)
                        It appears you’ve discovered a 
                        very rare antidote.  Its primary 
                        component: keratin.

           Riding’s confounded.

                                 RIDING
                        Hair?

                                 OZ
                        Correct.

                                 THUMB
                        You said it was an antidote.  To 
                        what?

           Oz stares the floating bottle, inspecting it as if some 
           long lost treasure.

                                 OZ
                        Zaubertrank of course.

           The news hits both Thumb and Riding hard.  Thumb’s 
           suddenly in a big hurry.

                                 THUMB
                        Thank you very much for your help 
                        doctor.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 OZ
                        It’s been a pleasure.  Life is all 
                        swings and roundabouts.

           Thumb waits for Oz to return the compound.  An awkward 
           beat of silence passes between them all.

                                 THUMB
                        I’ll just take the antidote, then 
                        and...

           Oz smiles.

                                 OZ
                        I’m afraid that will not be 
                        possible Thomas.  

           Thumb and Riding look confused.

                                 RIDING
                        Why not?

                                 OZ
                        What you have here is very 
                        valuable.  An important find to be 
                        sure.  I thank you for bringing it 
                        to my attention.  
                                 (a beat)
                        Now, it’s time for me to 
                        apologize.

                                 THUMB
                        For what?

                                 OZ
                        My associate.

           Oz motions to his Otherkin guard behind them, who Thumb 
           accidentally backs into.  The creature lets out a DEEP 
           GROWL.

                                 OZ (CONT’D)
                        He’s not been fed.

           Thumb’s eyes dart around the room.  

           Without hesitation, he pulls his sidearm and FIRES!

           Right into the HIGH TECH ORGAN.

           Chaos ensues.

           Oz SCREAMS in horror, rushing to his machines.

           Smoke shoots across the room.  Sparks fly.  
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           The antidote falls to the ground, about to shatter until 
           Riding snatches it from the air.

           Thumb double punches the guard who ROARS in pain, just as 
           he and Riding escape into

           EXT. BLACK MARKET -- MOMENTS LATER

           Thumb takes Riding by the hand.  Both detectives sprint 
           through the market, running for their lives.

           AT OZ’S TENT

           The injured Otherkin guard EXPLODES through the curtains, 
           bellowing.  People scatter.  Take cover.  

           The guard leaps about the market, desperately searching 
           for Thumb and Riding, swiping its clawed hand at anyone 
           and everything in its way. 

           Thumb and Riding move to a

           MARKET STALL

           The owner is long gone.  Riding is panicking.

                                 RIDING
                        What the hell do we do now!?!

                                 THUMB
                        Don’t panic!

           They can both hear the guard fast approaching.  Shrill 
           SCREAMS and the sounds of destruction getting nearer.

           Thumb sees what looks like a SPICE CART beside them.  One 
           of the jars on it is labeled “WINTER WIND.”  He grabs the 
           bottle and prepares to toss it like a grenade. 

           Things go quiet.

                                 RIDING
                        Where is that thing?

           In a startling instant, the crazed, toothed jaws of Oz’s 
           guard 

           BURSTS out of a nearby wall!

           Thumb SHATTERS the winter wind into its face, FREEZING 
           the creature’s terrifying muzzle rock solid.  

           The creature YELPS in horrifying pain, icicles falling 
           from its jowls.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thumb grabs Riding and runs toward the WATER WELL they 
           came from.  It’s only a few dozen yards away.

           AT THE MARKET STALL

           the Otherkin guard slowly becomes unfrozen, chunks of ice 
           CRASHING to the ground as its pupils dilate with absolute 
           rage.

           OTHER SIDE OF THE MARKET

           Thumb and Riding are almost to the well.  Suddenly, the 
           Otherkin guard appears, sprinting quickly behind them.

           Riding jumps feet first into the well, disappearing in a 
           SPLASH of bubbles.  Thumb is fast behind her, just about 
           to do the same when he 

           SLIPS!

           The Otherkin tackles Thumb, desperately pounding its 
           razor clawed fists at anything it can hit.  Thumb 
           struggles to free himself.

           The creature gets a hold of Thumb, slowly lifting him by 
           the neck, positioning the detective just above the well.  

           The Otherkin prepares to deliver a lethal blow to him, 
           just as Thumb unexpectedly begins 

           Laughing.  

           The creature looks confused, following Thumb’s eye-line 
           to his gut.

                                 THUMB
                        Surprise.

           Thumb’s clutching his gun.  

           A CRACK of fire gives way to a bright FLASH!

           The Otherkin guard is thrown off its haunches and into a 
           stall, releasing Thumb feet first into the well.

           EXT. STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

           A manhole cover lifts from the asphalt.  Riding and Thumb 
           both appear, soaking wet and out of breath.  

           Thumb turns to Riding, relieved.

                                 THUMB
                        Hungry?
           EXT. DOWNTOWN -- LATER, NIGHT

           Just outside a historic diner, THE MOTHER GOOSE GREASE 
           PIT.

           A newspaper vendor unloads bundles of TABLOIDS from a 
           truck.  The papers have a front page headline that reads 
           “DWARF DEATH: EVER AFTER MURDERS CONTINUE.”

           INT. THE MOTHER GOOSE GREASE PIT -- NIGHT

           STUBBY WOMEN in lard stained bonnets sling hot pancakes 
           and steaming cups of sludge across the room.  FAIRIES no 
           larger than the palm of your hand zip about taking 
           orders.

           Sitting at a red leather booth beside stacks of Locke’s 
           notebooks are Thumb and Riding.

                                 RIDING
                        So Golda Locke made an antidote.  
                        That explains the weird equipment 
                        in her apartment.

           Thumb’s looking through the books.

                                 THUMB
                        Yep.

           Riding sighs, looks around. 

                                 RIDING
                        This place have good food?

                                 THUMB
                        Imp who runs it used to traffic.  
                        Owes me a favor.

           Thumb looks up from a notebook and sees a MOHAWKED FAIRY 
           buzzing through the booths.  

           As if by instinct, he plucks her directly from the air, 
           pinching tightly onto her butterfly wings.

                                 MOHAWKED FAIRY
                        Hey!  Watch it asshole!

           The fairy squirms uncomfortably between his fingers.

                                 THUMB
                        I’ll take a pot of coffee and...

           Thumb awkwardly dangles the fairy to face an embarrassed 
           Riding.

                        Oh!  No!  We’re not... 
                                 (stumbling)
                        ...definitely not that.

                                 THUMB
                        Sure you don’t need a drink to go 
                        with that toast, Detective Riding?

           The fairy’s harsh demeanor softens as she notices who 
           she’s speaking to.

                                 MOHAWKED FAIRY
                        Oh, Detective Thumb.  Didn’t 
                        recognize you.

           Thumb lets go of the fairy.  She quickly streaks through 
           the air and over to her rotund, profusely sweating 
           manager, COBB.

                                 RIDING 
                        You can’t do stuff like that.

           Cobb saunters over to their table.  He’s a fully grown 
           IMP.  Pink rutted skin.  Beady METALLIC eyes.  Pinched 
           off ears.

                                 COBB
                        Detective Thumb.

           Cobb extends his hand for a shake.

                                 COBB (CONT’D)
                        Great to see you again!  Can’t 
                        thank you enough for catchin’ that 
                        chump who held us up.

                                 COBB
                        Yeah, but that crazy bastard was a 
                        madman.  Came in guns blazin’. 
                                 (to Riding)

                        Talk about goin’ the extra mile.

                                 THUMB
                        That’s not exactly what happened.

                                 COBB
                        You don’t see me complainin’.

           A beat.

                                 THUMB
                        Need some information Cobb.

                                 COBB
                        I don’t do that anymore.

                                 THUMB
                        You do for me.  Heard anything 
                        about the Locke killing?

           Cobb hushes Thumb.  He awkwardly stuffs himself into the 
           seat next to Riding, obnoxiously rattling silverware in 
           the process.

                                 COBB
                        What do you need to know?

                        Whatever you can tell us.

                                 COBB
                        Knew a guy who used to date her.

           Cobb grabs a handful of napkins and begins frantically 
           dabbing his forehead.

                                 COBB (CONT’D)
                        Why so interested?  I’m not in

                        Relax.  He might know something 
                        about a case we’re working on.  

                                 COBB
                        This about the dwarf too?  Heard 
                        you’re gunnin’ for Otherkin now.

                                 RIDING
                        We can’t talk about that.

                                 COBB
                        Sure, sure.  Last time I seen him 
                        was a few days ago.

           Riding shifts uncomfortably.

                        Used to make deliveries for the 
                        underground, back when I was still 
                        into that sort of thing.

                        Stiltskin’s joints waitin’ it out.

                                 THUMB
                        You remember which one?

           Cobb becomes visibly uncomfortable.

                                 COBB
                        I can’t really...

                        Give me what I need and we’ll call 
                        it even.

           Cobb hesitates for a moment, then moves close to Thumb, 
           speaking in whisper.  A small bead of sweat hangs from 
           the tip of his nose.

                                 COBB
                        The Three Little Pigs.  Corner of 
                        7th and Bower.

           Cobb quickly peels himself out of the booth and reverts 
           to his more bubbly, managerial persona.

                                 COBB (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, order’ll be right up guys.

           Cobb waddles away.

           EXT. 7TH AND BOWER -- LATE NIGHT

           A seedy area of town.  Shifty eyes.  People everywhere.  
           Trash clogging the gutters.

           A group of OTHERKIN, some in rags, stand around a bank of 
           TVs glimmering through a window display.  

           A re-run plays of Mayor Prince’s news conference.  He’s 
           surrounded by dozens of REPORTERS, Belle by his side.

           REPORT BEGINS.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        I’ve just come from a meeting with 
                        law enforcement officials and they 
                        assure me Happy Zwerg’s killer 
                        will be brought to justice.

                                 REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
                        How do you address rumors that 
                        your office hasn’t been 
                        cooperating with the 
                        investigation?

           The question takes the mayor off guard.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        That’s preposterous.  And I can’t 
                        comment on any specifics except to 
                        say Captain MacCool expects to 
                        have those involved apprehended 
                        any day now.

                        personal interest in this case 
                        ahead of the coming election?

                        so.

           The press pool lets out a nervous chuckle.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Belle doesn’t like excuses.  And 
                        frankly, neither do I.  This city 
                        has continued to place its trust 
                        in me and I don’t take that 
                        responsibility lightly.  We will 
                        get to the bottom of this.  I 
                        promise you all.

           REPORT ENDS.

           Suddenly an unusually large, blacked out ARMORED TRUCK 
           pulls past 7th and Bower, dispersing the onlookers from 
           the front of the shop.

           INT. ARMORED TRUCK -- LATE NIGHT

           A group of MERCENARY GIANTS, GOL, ELLU, VOTAN, and their 
           commander, BROB, are dressed in full TACTICAL GEAR.  Each 
           man is 10FT tall.  Furrowed brows.  Thick arms.  

           VOTAN removes a series of super-powerful, SILVER WEAPONS 
           from a weapons cache and begins distributing them.

           Thumb and Riding pull bullet-proof vests over their 
           coats.  

                                 RIDING
                        You know a lot of people.

                        shit sometimes.

           Commander BROB approaches them.

                        Lucky I owe ya one.

           Brob points to the firearms.

                        Hemming’s a lycan.  It’s why we

           The air is sucked out of the van.  Everyone goes quiet.

                                 BROB
                        Remember hearing about that.  
                        Arbor killings.  I’m sorry.

           Thumb turns to Riding.

                        You’ve got an edge then.  Use it.  

           Brob chucks Riding one of the weapons as Thumb addresses 
           them all.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Just remember, he’s to be brought 
                        in alive.  We can’t question 
                        pieces of him guys.

           The vehicle comes to a rest in front of the club.

                                 BROB
                        Lycans aren’t what worries me.  
                        Rumpel Stiltskin’s not a guy you 
                        mess with.

                        You ready?

           Riding cocks her gun.  Thumb shoves a silver clip into 
           his.

           Brob signals his men to move out.

           EXT. THREE LITTLE PIGS -- LATE NIGHT

           The doors of the vehicle clank open.  The truck’s axel 
           creaks as each giant STOMPS onto the cracked sidewalk.

           Thumb motions the team to follow him to the

           CLUB ENTRANCE

           bathed in the warm glow of classy signage.  A pair of 
           LYCAN OTHERKINS with name tags stand guard over the door. 

           The first is SWIFT.  He has fur in the pattern of a 
           husky, white skin, tapered blue eyes.  

           The second is LON.  He has a brown and black coat with 
           dark skin and round yellow eyes.

           Lean and tattooed, with thick tufts of hair pushing 
           through openings in their clothing, the men stare into 
           the team with eyes like burning embers.

           Thumb produces a badge.

           Swift reads over the warrant.  Lon turns to Thumb.

                                 LON
                        Y’all ain’t supposed to come 
                        ‘round here man.

                                 THUMB
                        Tonight’s an exception.

           Swift looks up from the warrant, barring his sharp, 
           rotted teeth at Riding.

                                 RIDING 
                        Pee you!  Somebody ate shit for 
                        dinner.   

           Swift lunges at Riding.  She puts her weapon to his 
           temple and chambers a round.  The side of Swift’s head 
           SIZZLES.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        You open these doors or my friends 
                        will.

           The giants cock their weapons and grumble.  Swift signals 
           Lon to open the door.

           Thumb looks to the giants, impressed with Riding.
           INT. THREE LITTLE PIGS -- LATE NIGHT

           Loud music.  A bar.  Dozens of fully grown trees reaching 
           to the ceiling.  Tables and stools whittled from the 
           redwood stumps.  Small fires kick up swirls of embers.  

           Dozens of female employees are costumed as sexy woodland 
           RABBITS, each in skimpy costumes serving drinks.

           A pair of ENORMOUSLY FAT MEN, identical triplets, are 
           crammed into a booth, each shoveling plates of food down 
           their throats.  These are the THREE LITTLE (BIG) PIGS.

           Thumb and Riding go to greet a beautiful, clueless 
           HOSTESS.

           Riding looks her up and down, scoffing in disgust.

           Thumb can’t resist.

                                 THUMB
                        Nice outfit.

           The giants all roll their eyes.

                                 HOSTESS
                        How many?

                                 THUMB
                        We’re here to see the owners.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Oh.  Please follow me.

           The hostess leads the team over to the Pigs.  Thumb 
           address the men collectively.

                                 THUMB
                        We’re here to see Alexander 
                        Hemming.

           No answers.

           One of the men BELCHES.  None of them are worried enough 
           to look up from their seafood plates.

                                 PIG #1
                        Don’t work here no more.

           Thumb notices an IRON DOOR across the room being guarded 
           by an Otherkin.

           Riding gets impatient again, shoves her warrant into Pig 
           #1’s mouth.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 RIDING
                        We’ll take a look all the same.

           Thumb leads the team toward the iron door across the 
           restaurant, weaving in and out of tables, drawing 
           concerned stares and whispers from CUSTOMERS.

           AT THE DOOR

           A FOX-FACED OTHERKIN with grass green eyes, refuses Thumb 
           entry.  He puts his clawed hand to Thumb’s chest, tearing 
           at his shirt, hissing his words.

                                 FOX LYCAN
                        Can’t let you in here...  

           The creature looks down to Thumb’s detective badge.

                                 FOX LYCAN (CONT’D)
                        ...dick.

           Riding grabs the Fox’s fingers and twists them with a 
           sickening crunch.

                                 RIDING
                        Step aside asshole.

           Brob kicks down the door and the group hurries down

           A CORRIDOR

           covered in leaky rusted pipes and light bulbs swinging 
           from chains.  The vestibule stretches for several meters, 
           dead-ending into a viridescent door.

           The team reaches it.  Locked.  

           Votan heaves his body into the door, which EXPLODES off 
           its hinges, shooting through

           THE ZAUBERTRANK LAB

           where one of Rumpel Stiltskin’s own drug manufacturing 
           farms has been hidden.

           Scum ridden counters have on them thousands of small 
           glass GLOBES emblazoned with cursive Zs.  

           Each is connected to thin clear tubing pulsing with a 
           viscous METALLIC LIQUID.  ZAUBERTRANK.  

           Once the liquid enters a globe, it’s vaporized, instantly 
           transforming into glittery gold mist.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           A dozen SMALL ELVES in soiled lab coats and GAS MASKS 
           collect and package the globes.  Others move about the 
           operation, twisting KNOBS and checking READOUTS.  

           SIX LYCAN ENFORCERS in suits and GAS MASKS stand guard 
           over the operation.  

           One of them is ALEXANDER HEMMING.  Trim.  Gelled back 
           hair.  Pink and yellow speckled eyes.

                                 THUMB
                        Hemming!?!

           Hemming immediately bolts out of an exit.  The wolves 
           pull weapons grade PLASTIC PISTOLS and open fire on the 
           team.

           Workers scream and scatter as bullets rip into a few 
           hundred orbs.  Large puffs of GOLDEN GAS begin spiraling 
           through the room.

           Thumb and Riding try to bat the vapor away, but it’s too 
           late.  

           Both of them are deeply under the influence of the drug.

           BEGIN MONTAGE -- THUMB’S HALLUCINATIONS

           Time slows.  The laws of physics bend.  Pockets of golden 
           haze permeate a terrifying vision.

           -- Bottles of Zaubertrank glow like light bulbs.  Each 
           float to the ceiling as if balloons.

           -- The giants and Otherkin transform into macabre 
           exaggerations of themselves.  Colossal leviathans 
           swinging metal battle axes at four-legged wolves who 
           smack chops thick with drool.  

           -- Both groups of creatures crunch together in a 
           sickening show of violence, howls and screams mixing into 
           a symphony of horrors. 

           -- A group of elves cackle, eyes pulsing with energy.  
           Their gas masks dissolve into rotting caterpillars.  
           Hands clapping.

           -- Blood spills from the neck of a giant, splashing onto 
           the floor and mutating into thousands of red ants, which 
           quickly scatter in every direction.

           -- Riding’s body morphs into bright ribbons of flame.  
           She screams.  Points a fiery finger to the exit, glowing 
           like an emerald.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           -- The green door becomes larger.  A small fissure grows 
           at its center then spiders before shattering it to 
           pieces.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Thumb looks like he’s in a fog.  He pulls the ANTIDOTE 
           BOTTLE from his pocket and takes a taste, quickly 
           bringing him down from the high.  

           ALLEY BEHIND THE THREE LITTLE PIGS

           It’s drizzling.

           Thumb stumbles out of an exit.  He shakily wrenches a 
           SILVER PISTOL from his waist and points down the 
           alleyway, vision blurred.  

           Sanity returns.

           He calls into the night.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Hemming!  Come out!

           Thick droplets of rain smack hard onto the pavement.  

           Quick shadows play across the brick sides of both walls.  

           Thumb unloads an entire clip at the them.  Chips of 
           mortar SPLASH into rain puddles collecting on the street.

           Thumb quickly shoves another clip into his gun when -

           He’s suddenly thrown off his feet!  

           A deep gash opens up across his eye, gushing red.

           Lex Hemming stands over him.  Tall, imposing, rain 
           soaked.  A body backlit by silver moonlight pushing 
           through shifting clouds.

           Thumb has a FLASH of the night he chased someone on Golda 
           Locke’s roof.  It was Hemming.

           Hemming crouches to meet Thumbs face.  Grimacing, the 
           lycan snarls at Thumb, eyes wild, pupils constricted to 
           pinpricks.  

                                 HEMMING
                        Time to die.

           Hemming bares the pink of his gums and tightly wraps a 
           pair of clawed hands around Thumb’s neck.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           Thumb throws a punch and both men roll through the rain, 
           each fighting to stay alive.  

           Thumb pulls his gun.  Hemming grabs the weapon in a fit 
           of rage, the silver finish SEARING into his hand.  

           Hemming’s fingers SIZZLE and STEAM in the rain.  He 
           tosses the gun down the alley and HOWLS to the pale moon 
           overhead.

           Thumb desperately throws a series of jabs directly across 
           Hemming’s face, but it does little good.

           Hemming thrusts Thumb’s head into a pothole now filled 
           with water.  Thousands of bubbles float to the surface as 
           Thumb struggles to breath.

           He’s mere moments from dying when -

           A SILVER BULLET rips through Hemming’s shoulder, throwing 
           him to the ground!

           As the lycan howls in pain, Riding pulls Thumb from the 
           pothole, gun smoking, eyes wild.  She collapses into a 
           ball on the ground.

           Thumb gasps for air.  He takes a moment to recover, then 
           approaches Hemming, who’s badly injured and fading fast.

                                 THUMB
                        Why’d you kill her!?!

           A runnel of black blood pours from Hemming’s mouth.

                                 HEMMING
                        I didn’t.

                                 THUMB
                        Bullshit!  I saw you on the roof!

           Hemming winces from the pain.

                                 HEMMING
                        I loved her once.  Made a mistake.  
                        Told Stiltskin what she was doing.

                                 THUMB
                        The lab?

                                 HEMMING
                        I went to her apartment.  Tried to 
                        warn her what I’d done.  She was 
                        already dead.

           CONTINUED: (5)

           The revelation hits Thumb hard.  He watches the exit 
           wound left by Riding’s bullet start to CRACK and CRUMBLE 
           the flesh around it.

                                 THUMB
                        Who killed her!?!

           Hemming’s whole body begins slowly decomposing.  The rain 
           washes away tufts of hair from his face, revealing the 
           gaunt and pathetic visage of a broken man.  

           Hemming’s once commanding voice turns hoarse.

                                 HEMMING
                        The powerful...

           Hemming passes out.  Thumb shakes his body in 
           desperation.

           The lycan’s corpse suddenly wilts, transforming into a 
           lifeless frame of leathery flesh and bone.

           EXT. THE THREE LITTLE PIGS -- LATER, NIGHT

           AMBULANCES flash crimson light over the front of the 
           club, now cordoned off in police tape.  

           OFFICERS in rain slickers lead a group of badly wounded 
           lycans from the entrance into HEAVILY FORTIFIED patrol 
           cars.

           Thumb’s eye is getting stitched up by a TRAUMA NURSE when 
           Riding brings Captain MacCool over to see him.  He’s 
           pissed.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        What the hell did you do Thumb!?!

           Thumb flinches as the nurse cuts the thread from a final 
           stitch.

                                 THUMB
                        What I do best.

           MacCool can’t believe his arrogance.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        You destroyed half the club!  
                        Where the hell did you get a 
                        warrant this time of night?  

           Two EMTs load what’s left of Hemming’s body into the back 
           of an ambulance.

           Riding turns to MacCool in disbelief.

                        Zaubertrank lab.  This could give 
                        us the leverage we need to get 
                        answers from Stiltskin.  Maybe 
                        even get Z off the streets for 
                        good.

           MacCool isn’t having it.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Point is you conducted an illegal 
                        search and seizure of a private 
                        premises.  Nothing you found’s 
                        gonna stick!

           Thumb gets a call on his cell phone.  He answers, talks 
           to someone quickly, gets off.

           EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM, POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHT

           Thumb and Riding stand behind a thick plate of two way, 
           mirrored glass.  

           Both patiently wait, peering into a BRICK ROOM.  A metal 
           table and a chair sit, empty.

                                 THUMB
                        Nice work back there Riding.

                        Well, you’re getting good at 
                        saving my ass.

           Thumb pulls the antidote from his pocket.

                        I need you to have this delivered 
                        to the address on this paper.

           He hands Riding the bottle along with a note.

           Just then, the DISTRICT ATTORNEY, a bronze skinned, blue 
           eyed ELF in a pinstripe suit, enters the room.

           He straightens his tie, nervously slicking back his hair 
           before turning to Thumb and Riding.

                        It was a nightmare arranging this 
                        detectives.  The Pigs fingered 
                        Stiltskin and everything checks 
                        out.  They were getting kickbacks 
                        for letting him use their club as 
                        a farm.

                        Stiltskin’s well connected, so 
                        make every moment count.

                                 THUMB
                        When will he be here?

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        His lawyer said to flip the lights 
                        on and off three times.  Between 
                        the second and third he’s promised 
                        to show.

           Riding watches Thumb quickly enter 

           THE OBSERVATION ROOM

           where he moves to a light switch.  He flips the lights on 
           once, twice and on the third time -

           Thumb disappears.

           The D.A. and Riding look on in shock.

                                 RIDING
                        Where’s Thumb?

           The D.A. sighs in disappointment, pinching the bridge of 
           his nose for relief.

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        Shit.

           EXT. CITY DOCKS -- MOMENTS LATER

           An abandoned THEME PARK, the beam of a lighthouse 
           intermittently bathing it in ghostly halo.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           An oily tide slaps the rotted planks of a dock where a 
           glossy LIMOUSINE is idling.  

           Detective Thumb stumbles down the dock toward the limo, 
           fighting against motion sickness.  Out of luck, he hurls 
           down to the curling waves below.

           The car door opens.  Out step two imposing GOBLINS in 
           suits and earpieces.  Yellowed teeth and oily skin.

           Thumb wipes the vomit from his mouth and turns to see -

           RUMPEL STILTSKIN step a gilded foot onto the dock.  He 
           pulls his slight frame from the inside of the vehicle 
           revealing himself in full glory.

           Short and lean, the goblin is dressed in elaborately 
           designed formal wear spun from golden thread.  

           His cracked face, hooked nose and gold teeth catch the 
           moonlight as he calmly walks toward Thumb - cane in hand.

           Stiltskin offers his handkerchief and speaks in a 
           mellifluous, perfectly calm Welsh accent.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Dear boy, you will accept my 
                        apologies.

           Thumb takes the handkerchief and empties his nose.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        Someone in my position must keep 
                        ever vigilante.  

           Thumb goes to hand it back to Stiltskin, who politely 
           declines.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        Yours.  I’ve many more.

           Stiltskin recognizes Thumb.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        Say, I remember you.  Thomas 
                        Thumb. 
                                 (winking)
                        Good to have a man on my side.

           Thumb goes to place the scrap of cloth into his coat 
           pocket.  He notices his weapon is missing and turns to 
           the little man.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        It will be returned when our 
                        business is concluded.

           Thumb gets right to the point.

                                 THUMB
                        You killed Golda Locke.

           Stiltskin pulls back, offended.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Dear boy, is that what you think 
                        of me?

                                 THUMB
                        The evidence is pretty hard to 
                        refute.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        You and I both know if you had 
                        anything substantial linking me to 
                        these horrible crimes, I would 
                        be... 
                                 (thinking)
                        ...well, more than likely still 
                        here.  Point taken.  But I tell 
                        you, I had no hand in what 
                        happened to dear Ms. Locke.

           Thumb becomes impatient.

                                 THUMB
                        Why am I here?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        To listen to the information I 
                        have to share with you.  
                        Information which could, if used 
                        correctly, help put you on the 
                        right track.  

           Stiltskin claps his hands together, delighted.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        And since you know I had no part 
                        in these horribly unfortunate 
                        events, let us get on with it!

           He snaps his fingers.  Two body guards remove an enormous 
           CRYSTAL HOOKAH from the trunk.  

           The men quickly place a glass ORB inside the hookah’s 
           center chamber. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 THUMB
                        What’re you doing?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        A sordid little detail I must 
                        confess.  My memory is not what it 
                        used to be.  

           Stiltskin hesitates for a moment.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t separate an old man 
                        from his pipe, would you?  Helps 
                        me to think.  To gather those 
                        precious facts which you so 
                        desperately require.

           Thumb looks skeptical.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        No different from those little 
                        pills you pop from time to time.

           Thumb thinks for a second, nods the “okay.”

           A bodyguard uses a jet torch to heat the outside, of the 
           hookah, SHATTERING the orb at its center and releasing 
           the Zaubertrank gas into the pipe.

           Stiltskin pulls a long, flexible tube to his lips.  He 
           draws a large drag of smoke into his mouth.

           Thumb patiently waits for him to finish.

           Fingers of gold Zaubertrank vapor creep from the little 
           man’s mouth.  His eyes glaze.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        Proceed with your line of 
                        questioning detective.

                                 THUMB
                        How did Alexander Hemming come 
                        into your employ?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        He was Otherkin.  Creatures, like 
                        men, have a way of being drawn to 
                        that which runs counter to their 
                        own interests.

                                 THUMB
                        How did you know Locke?

           A twisted smile curls across Stiltskin’s face.

           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Whatever are you implying?

                                 THUMB
                        What was your relationship?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Strictly professional.  I supplied 
                        her with the tools necessary to 
                        climb through the ranks of my 
                        little organization, and in 
                        return, she helped attract her 
                        constituents to my potion.  
                                 (smiling)
                        Starting with her closest friends.

                                 THUMB
                        And I’m assuming Hemming 
                        introduced you two?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Because of their romantic 
                        relationship, Mr. Hemming was 
                        indeed the first to arrange for us 
                        to meet.

           Thumb lets what he’s discovered settle.

                                 THUMB
                        Hemming said he told you about 
                        Locke’s experiments.

           Stiltskin takes another long drag from his pipe.  He 
           stays silent for a moment, then decides to speak.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Indeed.

                                 THUMB
                        So you knew what she was trying to 
                        create?

                                 STILTSKIN
                        What she was attempting, yes.  
                        Experimented with the very friends 
                        she first addicted.  All with 
                        fruitless results.  

           Stiltskin looks up at the sky, star twinkling in the 
           night sky like a diamond canopy.

                                 STILTSKIN (CONT’D)
                        What you must understand is, once 
                        such a magical elixir takes hold 
                        of you...

           He exhales a long cloud of smoke across the sky, 
           obscuring its beauty.

                        ...few other things become of 
                        interest.

           Thumb thinks to himself.

                                 THUMB
                        How do you explain her getting 
                        clean? 

                                 STILTSKIN
                                 (coyly)
                        Magic.  I suppose.

                                 THUMB
                        What if I told you I’d found an 
                        explanation a little more real.

           Stiltskin’s demeanor shifts.  He becomes more serious.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Then I would say you are in over 
                        your head, detective.  The 
                        Zaubertrank potion helps my own 
                        constituents keep a watchful eye 
                        over this city.  Who are you to 
                        disrupt such a delicate balance?

           Thumb knows Stiltskin’s right.

                                 THUMB
                        Why should I believe anything 
                        you’ve just told me?

           Stiltskin puts down his pipe and moves to within a few 
           inches of Thumb’s face.

                                 STILTSKIN
                        I’m afraid our time is just about 
                        to expire, and because I do not 
                        wish to join those savaged at the 
                        hands of your killer, I will pose 
                        a final question to you detective.  
                                 (a beat)
                        What sort of secret would drive a 
                        sheep to dress in wolf’s clothing?

           Stiltskin sees a line of POLICE INTERCEPTERS speeding 
           down the dock toward them.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I believe in your search for the 
                        answer, you will find what I’ve 
                        said to hold considerable truth.
                                 (a beat)
                        It’s been a pleasure catching you 
                        up detective.

           Stiltskin smirks and a bodyguard opens the rear of the 
           limo which he carefully hops into.  

           Before closing the door, the guard aims a REVOLVER at an 
           overhead light and SHOOTS!  

           SPARKS shower the dock, forcing Thumb to shield his eyes.

           A dozen CRUISERS pull up moments later, guns drawn.  

           Riding runs to Thumb, who is searching the darkness for 
           Stiltskin.

           He’s gone.

                                 RIDING
                        Stiltskin’s lawyer said you’d be 
                        here.  Everything alright?

           Thumb’s in a trance.

                        Thumb, you okay?

           He snaps out of it.

                                 THUMB
                        We’ve gotta take a trip. 

                                 RIDING
                        Where?

                                 THUMB
                        Upstate.

           EXT. CAMPAIGN RALLY -- EARLY MORNING

           Mayoral candidate SNOW WHITMORE is in the midst of 
           wrapping up a speech.  Raven hair.  Blue eyes.  Skin as 
           white as snow.  Stunning.  

           She’s addressing a large crowd of CHEERING supporters.

                                 WHITMORE
                        What I promise, is to rid this 
                        city of the crime and corruption 
                        which has plagued it for too long.

           CONTINUED:
                                 WHITMORE (CONT'D)
                        To those leeches endlessly feeding 
                        on the lifeblood of Grimm, I say 
                        this:  A harsh winter is coming.

           The crowd ERUPTS!

           Whitmore is ushered off the stage by her SECURITY to an 
           area

           BEHIND THE RALLY

           There, an AIDE hands her a PACKAGE with a note which 
           reads:

           “KEEP THIS SAFE.  WE NEED TO BE READY. --TT”

           Whitmore opens the package.  Reflected in her eyes is the 
           shimmering blue bottle of Z ANTIDOTE.

           EXT. HIGHWAY -- AFTERNOON

           The sun is just cresting over the horizon, spilling light 
           onto highway twisting through a desert dotted with large 
           SAND DUNES.  Pine trees slowly fade into palm trees.

           INT. THUMB’S CRUISER -- CONTINUOUS

           Thumb’s at the wheel.  

           Riding’s staring out the window, hypnotized by swirls of 
           sand dancing across the road.

                                 THUMB
                        So what’s your story Riding?

                                 RIDING
                        What do you mean?

                                 THUMB
                        I mean, what’re you really doing 
                        here?

           Riding shrugs.

                                 RIDING
                        Outgrew the suburbs I guess.  
                        Graduated the academy.  Made 
                        detective.  Grimm seemed like the 
                        next logical step.

                                 THUMB
                        What about your family?  Anyone 
                        left?

           Riding exhales, disappointed.

                                 RIDING
                        No.

           Thumb feels bad.

                                 THUMB
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to...

           Riding looks to him, surprised by the softness in his 
           voice.

                                 RIDING
                        Don’t be.

                                 THUMB
                        If I’d recognized you from the 
                        papers, I never would have had you 
                        go on the Stiltskin raid.

                                 RIDING
                        Thumb, it’s fine.  Dealing with 
                        these things is part of my job.

                                 THUMB
                        Takes a strong woman to decide she 
                        wants to help people after a thing 
                        like that.  Lycans killed my 
                        entire family, you better believe 
                        I’d be gunning for every one of 
                        ‘em.

           Riding changes the subject.

                                 RIDING
                        What about you?  Why’d you become 
                        a cop?

                                 THUMB
                        Left the airforce and needed work.

           Thumb removes his pill bottle, downs a few.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Got it in my head that anyone, 
                        even the smallest person, could 
                        make a difference.

           Riding smiles.

                                 RIDING
                                 (sarcastically)
                        That why you take those pills?

           Thumb chuckles.

                        everyone listens to a guy three 
                        feet tall.

           Something comes over Riding, attraction.

                                 RIDING
                        You’re a good man Thumb.

           Something stirs in Thumb, but not before Riding can 
           change the subject.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        So where are we?

                                 THUMB
                        Flats.  Hundred miles outside of 
                        town.  There’s an asylum not far 
                        from here.

                                 RIDING
                        What did Stiltskin say at the 
                        docks?

                                 THUMB
                        Double-talk.  Mostly bullshit, but 
                        one thing he said stuck with me.  
                        Made an obvious reference to Peter 
                        Shepard, “A sheep in wolf’s 
                        clothing.”

                                 THUMB
                        Shepard’s been known to consult on 
                        active cases.  I want to see what 
                        he knows.

           The cruiser ZOOMS past the dunes.

           EXT. POLICE AIRSHIP HANGAR -- AFTERNOON

           Enormous.  Skeletal metal insides.  No windows.  Six 
           helium-filled POLICE ZEPPELINS the size of football 
           fields cast long shadows onto a concrete floor.  

           The ships form a ring around a STEEL BRIEFCASE.

           Captain MacCool enters the hangar, makes his way to its 
           center.  Even he appears dwarfed by the large ships.

           MacCool gets to the briefcase, looks around.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Hello?

           Echoes.  

           He notices writing on the briefcase’s LUGGAGE TAG.  It 
           reads:  “SOMEONE NEEDS TO FALL FOR EVER AFTER.”

           MacCool twists around the center of the hangar, looking 
           for someone.

           A CLOAKED FIGURE, obscured by the shadows, steps forward.  
           We don’t see their face, only MacCool’s reaction.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Won’t be a problem.

           MacCool opens the briefcase.  Inside are stacks and 
           stacks of CASH.  He smiles, snaps the case closed and 
           walks off.

           EXT. GRIMM FORENSIC ASYLUM -- NIGHT

           Sand sweeps across an ARABIAN PALACE.  A tall, alabaster 
           fortress with golden spires cutting through a twinkling 
           sky. 

           Thumb’s Lincoln pulls across a sandstone driveway and 
           rests at the entrance.

           INT. DIRECTOR’S OFFICE, ASYLUM -- NIGHT

           Parchment walls with gold leaf molding.  Satin red 
           curtains.  Ivory floors covered in richly detailed 
           Persian rugs.

           Thumb and Riding sit across from hospital director, DR. 
           ALAH-DIN MUSTAPHA, dignified and sleek with smooth sand 
           skin, drawn back black hair and square glasses.  

           Around his neck hangs a bronze LAMP MEDALLION.

           Standing behind Alah-Din is a 7FT TALL MAN dressed in a 
           suit and turban, royal blue skin so dark it’s nearly 
           black.  Around his entire body hang feet of gold chain 
           connected to piercings on his face.

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        I understand you’ve come to 
                        question Peter Shepherd.

           Thumb is distracted by the large man, whose frozen stare 
           looks dead ahead.

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        Please, call me Alah-Din.

           The doctor turns around, regarding the man behind him.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        How rude of me.  

           He calmly motions to the man.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        This is my Djiin.

                                 RIDING

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        You’d call him a genie.  He makes 
                        what we do here possible.  
                                 (a beat)
                        You must understand this facility 
                        houses the area’s most dangerous 
                        minds. Only the power of my Djiin 
                        can restrain the horrors contained 
                        within it.

                                 THUMB
                        Is he alright?

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        You’ll have to pardon his stare.  
                        Right now my Djiin is monitoring 
                        the inmates, patrolling the fences 
                        and preparing meals for the day.

           Thumb’s impressed.

           Alah-Din chuckles to himself, then turns to Riding, more 
           serious.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been made aware of how 
                        dangerous a man Shepherd is?

                                 RIDING
                        We understand.  We’re not looking 
                        to upset his rehabilitation.

           Alah-Din laughs to himself.

           INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY, ASYLUM -- NIGHT

           Torch sconces illuminate a long limestone hallway dotted 
           with several shimmering rose gold PRISON GATES.  Each is 
           attended by a ghostly, ethereal manifestation of Alah-
           Din’s Djiin.

           Alah-Din, Thumb and Riding walk down the Arabic inscribed 
           hallway, moving through each locked barrier.

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        I’m curious what aspect of 
                        Shepherd’s crimes most interests

                                 THUMB
                        His string of killings were unique 
                        in their execution.

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        Yes of course.  The wolf skin he 
                        wore.

                                 THUMB
                        That, and the care he exercised in 
                        staging and arranging each murder. 

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        He’s a very knowledgable man when 
                        it comes to that.

           They get to a heavily reinforced steel door with a 
           HANDPRINT SCANNER.

           Thumb jokingly motions to the pad.

                        Before you question him I should 
                        warn you, Peter’s appearance may 
                        startle you.

           Riding looks concerned.

                                 RIDING
                        What do you mean?

                                 ALAH-DIN
                        You remember he was badly scarred 
                        the night police apprehended him.  
                        As I said before, our goal here is 
                        containment.  However, that 
                        doesn’t preclude us from doing 
                        what we can for the inmates.  
                        Peter has been with us for over a 
                        decade.  With that comes certain 
                        privileges.  He requested my Djiin 
                        remake his appearance into 
                        something more comforting to him.  
                        We obliged.

           Riding looks nervous.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        Not to worry.  

           He places his palm on the scanner and the door CLANKS 
           open.

           Alah-Din smiles reassuringly.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll do fine.  Go down the 
                        hallway, past the first two cells 
                        and Peter will be on your left. 

           He points to a series of CCTV cameras affixed to the 
           ceiling.

                                 ALAH-DIN (CONT’D)
                        My Djiin and I will be watching.
           INT. INMATE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           The door clinks closed behind Thumb and Riding, revealing 

           THE PRISONER GALLERY

           a series of glass, concrete enclosed boxes, each 
           illuminated by a shaft of overhead light.

           Bronze NAME PLAQUES have been affixed to the outside of 
           each room.

           Thumb and Riding pass the first cell.  

           Inside is GILLES DE BLEUE aka BLUE BEARD.  Enormously 
           overweight with a shaved head, milk white eye and 
           braided, azure facial hair grown to his feet.  He sits on 
           a metal chair, catatonic.

           Thumb and Riding pass over his cell and hear SCREAMS 
           coming from the next.

           Inside is CLAUDIA GRIMHILDE aka THE QUEEN.  Thin and 
           utterly plain looking, Grimhilde paces, muttering to a 
           floor littered with half eaten apples.  

           Festooned to a wall is a beautifully ornamented, cracked 
           MIRROR.

           Riding stops for a moment to watch her.  Grimhilde 
           explodes into a rage, shouting at the mirror.

                                 GRIMHILDE
                        Show me the fairest or nothing at 
                        all!

           She bolts in front of the mirror, which reflects a 
           HORRIBLY DISFIGURED rendering of herself.

           Thumb pulls Riding to the next cell.

           PETER SHEPHERD aka THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF is inside.  
           Back turned, body laying on a cot mostly obscured in 
           shadow.  

           The inside of his room is wallpapered with macabre 
           CHARCOAL DRAWINGS of wolves.  A faucet drips, echoing 
           through the silence.

           Thumb cautiously approaches the glass.

                                 THUMB
                        Mr. Shepherd?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Peter gets up.  The shadow of his head is unexpectedly 
           large.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We’re detectives Thumb and Riding.  
                        We’d like to speak with you.

           Peter picks up a piece of charcoal and begins sketching 
           on one of his walls.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Peter.

           The charcoal briquet SNAPS in Peter’s hands.  He turns to 
           face them, still in shadow, then slowly moves toward the 
           glass.

           The light above spills over his body revealing -

           Peter’s face.  A horribly stitched, awkward merging of 
           JACKAL AND HUMAN.  Eyes, snout and ears belonging to an 
           animal.  Mouth and neck of a man.

           Riding is deeply unsettled.  Thumb remains calm.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We need your help.

           Peter’s ears fall back, his amber eyes squinting as he 
           whines a high pitched snicker.

                                 PETER
                        What is it you think we can help 
                        you with detective?

                                 THUMB
                        We?

                                 PETER
                        The wolf and I.

                                 THUMB
                        Oh...

           Thumb looks to Riding, confirming things.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        ...right, both of you.  We want to 
                        talk about the crimes you two 
                        committed together.

           Peter scoffs, waving Thumb off.  He turns his back to 
           him.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 PETER
                        Of what interest could they 
                        possibly be to you?

           Riding decides to speak up.

                                 RIDING
                        We’re working on a case we hoped 
                        you’d help us with.  Maybe give us 
                        your expert opinion?

           Peter turns to face Riding, intrigued.

                                 PETER
                        What sort of case?

                                 THUMB
                        Involves a cursing.

                                 PETER
                        Have the killings continued?

                                 THUMB
                        Yes.

           Peter smiles.  He points his snout into the air inhales a 
           deep breath in Riding’s direction.

                                 PETER
                        And they’ll keep going.  ‘Till the 
                        spell has run its course.  

                                 THUMB
                        We’d like to get your thoughts on 
                        the evidence.  See who you think 
                        this cursed person could be.

           Riding removes a MANILA FILE from her bag.  She places it 
           into an EXCHANGE WAY inside the cell and pushes it to 
           Peter.

           He flips through the folder, casually inspecting EVIDENCE 
           and PHOTOGRAPHS.  

           Riding examines Peter’s drawings while they wait.  Each 
           more surreal and horribly violent than the next.

           Peter uses his snout to sniff the documents.

           Suddenly, his eyes widen.  He carefully places the file 
           down and moves to his drawings.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Peter?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Nothing.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

           Another long beat of silence passes between them.

                                 PETER
                        Witch is involved.

                                 THUMB
                        Yes, we know that.

           Peter turns to face them again, eyes wild.

                                 PETER
                        But do you know this one placed a 
                        hex on her cursed?  

                                 THUMB
                        A hex?  Are you sure.

                                 PETER
                        Absolutely.  A brand.  Helps her 
                        to control the cursed after she’s 
                        transformed it.  Keeps them from 
                        knowing they’ve ever been damned.

                                 THUMB
                        You think the witch used the 
                        cursed to commit murder?  Two 
                        killers?

                                 PETER
                        One cursed to slaughter, the other 
                        to cast the spell.  

                                 THUMB
                        How can you be sure?

                                 PETER
                        When the wolf and I committed our 
                        crimes we tried to show the city 
                        something.

                                 THUMB
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        That I was right to cry wolf.  It 
                        was the city’s fault for failing 
                        to recognize what was inside me.

           Peter removes a photograph from his envelope.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make the same mistake with 
                        these two.  They’re trying to show 
                        you something.  

           Peter motions to the photos.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        See the burn?  

           Peter slaps onto the glass a photograph of the PENTACLE 
           burnt on Happy Zwerg’s forehead.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Transfers from the cursed to its 
                        victims.  The witch and her damned 
                        are marking their territory.  
                        Signing their work.  Warning you 
                        not to pursue them like you are.

                                 RIDING
                        How will we find who she cursed?

                                 PETER
                        A hex on the hands.

                                 THUMB
                        How do we stop them?

                                 PETER
                        This black widow?  Only spilling 
                        her blood can undo the damage 
                        done.

           Peter turns to Riding and yawns, exposing a long tongue 
           and terrifying rows of SHARP TEETH.  

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Tired.  Time to count sheep.

           He strokes his long ears and winks at Riding.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Good luck to you both.

           Peter disappears into the shadows and returns to his cot.

           INT. THUMB’S CRUISER -- NIGHT, CONTINUOUS

           Deep in the forest.  The very fringes of the city.  High 
           beams shine onto a road twisting through dense pines.

           Thumb switches the RADIO on, turns through static until 
           something registers.  A news program.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Ahead in the polls and with only a 
                        few hours left until Grimm’s race 
                        for mayor is decided, the Whitmore 
                        campaign has been on the 
                        offensive.

                                 WHITMORE (V.O.)
                        “The mayor’s continued lack of 
                        cooperation with the Ever After 
                        Murders is just one item on a 
                        laundry list of failings which 
                        seem to sum up his 
                        administration.”

           Riding speaks up.

                                 RIDING
                        Race is getting pretty intense.

                                 THUMB
                        Prince has been running things for 
                        a long time.  My guess is, a few 
                        dozen ballot boxes get dumped into 
                        the river before the night’s over.

                                 RIDING
                        I don’t know, Prince seems like a 
                        pretty nice guy.

                                 THUMB
                        That’s what they count on.  Truth 
                        is those people are nothing like 
                        the rest of us.  They’ve run this 
                        city into the ground and we all 
                        gave them the tools they needed to 
                        do it.

           Thumb stays quiet.  He goes to check his mirror and sees 
           a BLACKED-OUT SEDAN racing up fast behind them.

           Squinting hard, Thumb sees a CHERRY TOPPER begin twirling 
           above the car.  SIRENS wail.

           The car pulls up next to them, it’s a GRIMM POLICE 
           CRUISER.  There are two officers inside.  GOBLINS.

           Thumb waves.  They don’t wave back.

           One of them suddenly pops out of the sunroof, TOMMY GUN

           Both he and Riding hit the deck as the shooter BURPS a 
           line of ammunition in the direction of Thumb’s cruiser.

           Thumb SLAMS the gas with just enough time for the shooter 
           to miss.  

           The shots sail through the air, SKINNING huge chunks of 
           bark from surrounding trees.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Get out your gun Riding!

           She’s embarrassed.

                                 RIDING
                        I left it in my sock drawer.

           Thumb rolls his eyes, tosses her his.

           The road merges into a  

           ONE WAY STREET

           The pursuing cruiser pulls back, and both cars twist down 
           a

           STEEP DECLINE

           ZOOMING past more trees, small cottages and red 
           woodsheds.

           Thumb pushes the car to 90MPH, it’s engine screaming.

           The shooter behind them SPRAYS gun fire in every 
           direction, splintering trees to sawdust.

           Riding rolls down her window and takes turns delivering 
           return fire.  

           A series of BULLETS spider through Thumb’s windshield.

                                 THUMB
                        How we doing back there?

                                 RIDING
                        We’re screwed.  They have a Tommy 
                        Gun!

                                 THUMB
                        Check the center console!

           Riding flips the console up, pulls out a jar labeled 
           “DRAGON’S BREATH.”  Inside are thousands of small, 
           translucent orange beads.

                                 RIDING
                        What the hell is this?

                                 THUMB
                        Swiped it from the market.

           Thumb sees their pursuers fast approaching.

                                 RIDING
                        You’ve had this the whole time!?!

                                 THUMB
                        Just toss the jar out the back and 
                        make sure to hit the road.

           Riding rolls down the window, hurls the jar out of the 
           car.

           We watch the jar float through the air, end over end 
           until it finally 

           SHATTERS onto the road behind them!

           It instantly transforms into a bright, GLOWING ORANGE 
           CLOUD OF GAS.  Tiny sparks floating throughout.

           The gas quickly spreads across the road behind them, 
           setting the forest aflame and INCINERATING everything it 
           touches!

           The pursuing cruiser tries to avoid the cloud, but it’s 
           too late.  It’s occupants SCREAM in terror as the car 
           shoots into the fog. 

           Riding watches from the back window, just as the goblin 
           cruiser pulls out of the cloud, now a MELTED frame of 
           steel and glass - two glowing corpses inside.

           Thumb navigates the car past the forest and into a 

           CLEARING

           where the road straightens.  GRIMM CITY twinkles in the 
           distance ahead of them.

           OUTSIDE THE CAR

           Suddenly, a large object rises into view.  Its shadow 
           slowly obscures the city ahead.  

           It’s a POLICE ZEPPELIN.  Its SPOTLIGHTS focus on Thumb’s 
           cruiser.

           INSIDE THE CAR

           Thumb looks to Riding, concerned.

           Just then, flashes of HIGH-CALIBER AMMUNITION begin 
           shooting from the zeppelin’s TURRET, tearing ENORMOUS 
           HOLES through the asphalt ahead of them.

           The shooting continues in a straight line, directly for 
           Thumb’s cruiser!

           He SCREAMS to Riding.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Jump!

           OUTSIDE THE CAR

           Both detectives open their doors and leap out of the 
           cruiser, quickly 

           BISECTED by the zeppelin’s fire!

           On the two halves of the cruiser SMASHING to the 
           ground...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK

           EXT. GRIMM CITY (AERIAL VIEW) -- NIGHT

           Police zeppelins float just above the neon city, only a 
           few hundreds yards from the tops of skyscrapers.  Half a 
           dozen others can be seen hovering in the distance.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM, POLICE ZEPPELIN -- NIGHT

           A large open space beneath the ship’s overhead balloon.  
           Steel girders.  Rivets.  A CONTROL PANEL ahead of a wide 
           windshield.

           Captain MacCool steps out of the shadows.  One of his 
           dirty GOBLIN COPS is clutching a Tommy Gun and wearing a 
           PARACHUTE beside him.  Both stand over Thumb and Riding. 

           The detectives are tied to chairs at the center of the 
           room, mouths taped.  Thumb’s sweating bullets.  He looks 
           sick.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Wanted to have a little chat with 
                        the both of you.  Keep you from 
                        doing any more damage to 
                        yourselves.

           MacCool has the tape ripped from Thumb’s mouth.

                        He’s dirty Riding.

           MacCool signals to his officer, who PUNCHES Thumb across 
           the face.  A runnel of blood flows from his nose.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        I didn’t ask a question.

           MacCool turns to Riding.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Thumb here didn’t lead you to 
                        believe he was squeaky clean, did 
                        he?  No different than any other 
                        cop on the force I’m afraid.  Took 
                        payments from Ali Baba to enforce 
                        the docks a few years back.  
                        Almost had his badge for it, ‘till 
                        we struck a little deal.  

                                 THUMB
                        He’s lying.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        You were to stay outta things that 
                        don’t concern you.

           Thumb shakes off some stars.

                                 THUMB
                        Whoops.

           The goblin cop hits Thumb again.  MacCool gets deadly 
           serious.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Where’s the rest of the antidote?

                                 THUMB
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           The goblin officer hands MacCool a stack of PHOTOS.  He 
           flips through them in front of Thumb and Riding.  

           The photos are of HANSEL AND GRETEL CASSEL.  Murdered.  
           Pentacles burned deep into their foreheads.  Pictures 
           obscured by the glow of feeding pixies.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Neither did they.  Too bad someone 
                        else got to ‘em first.

                        Give me what you found at Locke’s 
                        place.

                                 THUMB
                        Stiltskin’s got deep pockets.  
                        Have him make you some.

           MacCool SLAMS his fist into the metal siding to the 
           zeppelin, right above Thumb’s head.  It makes a perfect 
           impression of his fist.

           Thumb doesn’t flinch.  He looks feverish.  MacCool takes 
           note.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        You don’t look so hot Thumb.

           MacCool reaches into Thumb’s coat pocket, pulls out his 
           MEDICATION.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Not so tough without your little 
                        beans.

           MacCool taunts Thumb, shaking them in front of his face.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Just like any other drug.  Stay on 
                        it long enough, you’ll grow to 
                        need it.

           We watch as Thumb’s body contracts.  His clothes appear 
           bigger.  A ring on his finger falls to the ground.  His 
           bindings loosen, but he doesn’t have the energy to move.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Or in your case, shrink.

           MacCool rips the tape from Riding’s mouth.  

           He opens an AIRLOCK, letting the wind RUSH inside the 
           cabin as he addresses Riding.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what we’re gonna do.  I’m 
                        gonna give you a chance to help 
                        your new boss, Rumpel Stiltskin, 
                        locate the antidote you two found.  
                        You know how well he’s connected, 
                        and I know you’ve got what he 
                        needs.

           Riding’s stays silent.

                                 (motions to Thumb)
                        See your partner over there?  In 
                        about ten minutes, he’s gonna be 
                        no taller than a playing card.  
                        Thick treaded boots I’m wearing 
                        will make quick work of the little 
                        shit, if you don’t tell me what I 
                        need to know.

           Riding’s attitude suddenly changes.  She looks to Thumb, 
           then back to MacCool.

                                 RIDING
                        What’s in it for me?

           MacCool softens.  Pleased, he pulls back and turns to 
           Thumb.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        You see that Thumb?  Quick study.
                                 (to Riding)
                        I untie you, we gonna make a deal?

                                 RIDING
                        Depends on what you’re willing to 
                        offer.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        That’s my girl.

           MacCool has Riding untied.  Thumb’s clothes are sagging 
           as he withers away.

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL (CONT’D)
                        Anything you want.

                        That’s a good start.  Where do I 
                        fit in?

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Simple.  We keep Z on the streets.  
                        Stiltskin gets rich and the rest 
                        trickles down.

                        No.  Had good reason to, but 
                        that’s not what the little guy 
                        does.  He just sets the stage.

                        Let’s the bigger fish know that if 
                        it doesn’t get taken care of, the 
                        water stops flowing from the well.  
                        And some people draw a hell of a 
                        lot of water in this town.

                                 RIDING
                        So who did kill her?

                                 CAPTAIN MACCOOL
                        Part of being cursed a mischievous 
                        little prick means keeping the 
                        rest of us in the dark.  Stiltskin 
                        didn’t tell me and I didn’t ask.

           MacCool looks over to Thumb chuckling to himself.  He 
           cracks his knuckles, moving toward the detective.  

           Thumb’s almost disappeared entirely into his clothes. 

           Riding uses the opportunity to unexpectedly grab the 
           goblin, twisting him into a headlock!  

           In the process, the creature SPRAYS bullets all long the 
           inside of the cabin with a PING-PANG-PONG!  

           A few dozen bullets hit MacCool in the chest.  He drops 
           Thumb’s pills and goes stumbling back into the control 
           panel, which SPARKS and FLAMES.

           The balloon above is puncture.  Air SCREAMS as it whizzes 
           out of the blimp!

           The zeppelin begins quickly descending, only a few 
           hundred yards from the spires of buildings below!

           Riding and the goblin throw a wild punches at one 
           another.  

           The goblin is positioned perfectly in front of the 
           airlock.  Riding sees a “PULL TO REMOVE” strap on its 
           parachute.  

           She immediately pulls it.

           The parachute slides right off the goblin, who she 
           mercilessly kicks out of the airlock with a WHOMP!

           BENEATH THE ZEPPELIN

           The creature tumbles through the sky, then gets SKEWERED 
           by the spires below.

           INSIDE THE ZEPPELIN

           CONTINUED: (5)

           Riding slides on a parachute, desperately searching 
           everywhere for Thumb’s pills.  

           She finds them, lodged between one of the girders.

           Thumb has now shrunk to HALF THE SIZE of a normal man!

           Moving quickly over to Thumb, Riding pops the top of the 
           bottle, shoveling pills into his mouth.  

           The pills don’t immediately take effect.

           Riding looks through the windshield.  The zeppelin is 
           hopelessly free falling! 

                                 RIDING
                        C’mon, c’mon!

           Color begins returning to Thumb’s face as he slowly grows 
           to normal size.  Clothes tightening across his body.

           He looks up at Riding, regarding the parachute strapped 
           on her back, confused.

                                 THUMB
                        You were going to try to parachute 
                        out of this thing?

                                 RIDING
                        You got any better ideas?

           Thumb immediately moves to the control panel.  MacCool is 
           slumped over.  DEAD.  Thumb pushes him off the controls.

                                 RIDING (CONT’D)
                        You know how to fly one of these?

                                 THUMB
                        How hard can it be?  I was in the 
                        airforce.  A cook, but still...

           The zeppelin is picking up speed, headed for the 
           buildings below.

           Thumb positions himself at the controls.

                                 RIDING
                                 (incredulous)
                        You’re not thinking of landing 
                        this thing!?!

           Thumb points to the long roof of a building ahead.

                                 THUMB
                        Right there.

           CONTINUED: (6)

           He pulls on the controls with everything he has, hands 
           shaking, the building coming up fast.  They need a bit 
           more clearance.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Help!

           Riding joins in.

           The zeppelin is just about to make contact with the 
           building when

           Its bottom GUN TURRET is sheared clean off!

           The airship SCREECHES across the roof, exploding away 
           cable dishes and phone lines in a maelstrom of 
           destruction!

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           We see the ship coming to the edge of the building.  It’s 
           just about to fall over the edge when

           The deflated BALLOON snags on a roof shed, bringing the 
           ship to a grinding halt - with only FEET to spare!

           EXT. BASE OF THE BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           Thumb and Riding quietly exit the building.  Thumb moves 
           toward a parked car, BREAKS the driver’s side glass.  The 
           two get into the car and speed off into the night.

           INT. THUMB’S NEW CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Thumb’s driving like a madman.  Parked cars and buildings 
           STREAK by.  No one is out this late.

                                 RIDING
                        Where are we headed now Thumb?

                                 THUMB
                        We’ve gotta keep moving.  Not sure 
                        how long it’ll take for people to 
                        notice a crashed zeppelin with a 
                        dead police captain inside.

                                 RIDING
                        Good point.

                                 THUMB
                        What we need to do is reason this 
                        out.  MacCool gave us a lot to 
                        work with up there.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RIDING
                        Well, we know Stiltskin’s been 
                        spinning his web across this whole 
                        thing.

                                 THUMB
                        Stiltskin’s involved.  But someone 
                        else is pulling the strings.  Both 
                        Hemming and MacCool made mention 
                        of something bigger.  Even 
                        Stiltskin said something about 
                        someone other than him using Z to 
                        control the city.

                                 RIDING
                        So the question is, who stands to 
                        benefit from Z staying on the 
                        streets other than him?  Who does 
                        Stiltskin have access to who 
                        would’ve wanted Golda Locke dead?

                                 THUMB
                        I don’t know.

           Thumb stops at a light, frustrated.  They both think.

           Riding’s thumbs through an evidence folder.  She’s 
           distracted by one of the photographs.

                                 RIDING
                        The pentacles are the answer.  
                        They always have been.

                                 THUMB
                        I know, but they’re not specific 
                        enough.  Witches use dozens of 
                        variations.

           Riding gets out of the car, a PHOTOGRAPH of the PENTACLE 
           in her hand.  Thumb follows.

           She slowly moves toward a brick wall, covered with Adam 
           Prince CAMPAIGN POSTERS.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        It’s too big Riding.

           The posters depict Adam Prince, bravely pointing ahead 
           into the future, his beautiful wife Belle beside him.

           Riding puts her photograph beside one of the posters.  

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        I don’t see it.

           Riding motions to Belle Prince’s NECKLACE.  

           We slowly ZOOM into the PENDANT she’s wearing.

           It’s IDENTICAL to the PENTACLE burned into each victim’s 
           forehead.

                                 RIDING
                        Belle Prince.

           Thumb immediately takes out his phone, dials someone.

                        Brob.  Meet Riding and I outside 
                        the mayor’s mansion.  Bring the 
                        heaviest stuff you’ve got. 

           EXT. MAYOR’S MANSION -- LATE NIGHT

           A Victorian GOTHIC MANOR surrounded by sprawling rose 
           thorn gardens and dribbling fountains.

           Valets hurry to park the cars of anxious, well dressed 
           party attendees waiting to get in.

           INT. MAYOR’S MANSION -- LATE NIGHT

           A wide open ballroom filled with winding staircases and 
           brass candelabras.  An enormous collection of VICTORY 
           BALLOONS have been festooned with rope to the ceiling.

           WAITERS holding silver platters loaded with rich food 
           move past silken curtains drawn past gigantic windows.

           Hundreds of GUESTS yap on, sliding hors d'oeuvres and 
           champagne down their throats.

           Adam and Belle Prince travel down a red velvet staircase.  
           The mayor is wearing a blue and gold coat and vest.  
           Belle gracefully floats about in a canary yellow gown and 
           hood.

           The crowd goes quiet.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        I’d like to thank everyone for 
                        being here tonight.  These days, 
                        it isn’t often I’m able to hold 
                        court.

           The crowd laughs.

                        But seriously, we can’t thank you 
                        all enough for the support you’ve 
                        given us over the years.  

           A DRUNK GUEST shouts out.

                                 DRUNK GUEST
                        Well deserved!

           Everyone erupts in clapping.

           EXT. ROAD -- LATE NIGHT

           A dirt road right below the mayor’s mansion, where we can 
           just see the festivities taking place about a half a mile 
           away.

           Thumb and Riding are waiting by their parked car beneath 
           the shade of an ELM.

           An ARMORED TRUCK pulls its headlights across them and 
           comes to a stop.

           Out steps BROB, GOL, ELLU and VOTAN, along with a few 
           other MERCENARIES in body armor.  Thumb moves to Brob.

                                 THUMB
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 BROB
                        You’re running out of favors.

                                 THUMB
                        Don’t remind me.  

           A beat.

                                 BROB
                        So you wanna crash the mayor’s 
                        party on the eve of the election?  

           Riding steps forward.

                                 RIDING
                        Plan’s simple.  Do whatever we 
                        have to, to capture and neutralize 
                        Belle Prince.

           Gol laughs to himself and the others.

                                 GOL
                        You had us bring all this 
                        firepower for that little lady?

                        She’s a witch.

           Everyone goes silent.

                        This isn’t going to be easy.

                        Most things in this town aren’t.

           Votan and Ellu begin removing WEAPONS from the cab of the 
           truck and passing them out.  SHOTGUNS.  GATLING GUNS.  A 
           ROCKET LAUNCHER.  

           Brob throws Thumb and Riding bullet-proof vests and a 
           couple human-sized versions of their weapons.

                                 THUMB
                        Let’s move out.

           INT. MAYOR’S MANSION -- NIGHT

           A waiter hands the mayor a champagne glass, which he 
           raises along with his guests.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        I know the results of tonight’s 
                        election haven’t been made 
                        official, but here’s to expecting 
                        another four years of... 

           The mayor’s attention suddenly shifts to Brob and his 
           team moving through the crowd - Thumb and Riding leading 
           the pack.

           Nervous whispers spread as people disperse around them.

           Thumb and Riding get to the stairwell where they confront 
           Adam and Belle.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        May I ask what you and your 
                        friends are doing here detectives?

                                 THUMB
                        You may.

           The mayor becomes uncomfortable, leans in.

                                 THUMB
                        We have a few questions we wanted 
                        to ask.

           The mayor pulls back.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Go ahead.

           Riding looks to Belle.

                                 RIDING
                        Your wife.

           The mayor looks concerned.  

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        We don’t have time for this right 
                        now.  I’d be happy to have one of 
                        my aides contact you about 
                        arranging a meeting.

                        Where were you the night of Happy 
                        Zwerg’s murder?

           The mayor takes Riding by the hand.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        I think you’d better go now.

           Belle waves her husband off.

                                 BELLE
                        It’s alright Adam.  I have nothing 
                        to hide.
                                 (to Riding)
                        I can’t recall.  With my husband

                        You two pretty avid hikers?

           The question throws the mayor off.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Please.  We hardly have time to 
                        breathe, let alone...

           The mayor watches as Riding removes an EVIDENCE BAGGY 
           from her coat.  Inside is a torn ribbon.  She lifts it to 
           Belle’s drawn up hair.  It’s an exact match.

                                 RIDING
                        Get caught when you left Happy 
                        Zwerg’s cabin?

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Just what the hell are you saying?

           Belle addresses Riding.

                                 BELLE
                        You’re being ridiculous.  I’m not 
                        the only one in the city with a 
                        fashion sense.

           The crowd chuckles.

                                 THUMB
                        True enough.  Hundreds of people 
                        could’ve worn a ribbon like the 
                        one we found.

           Thumb turns to the mayor.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what a pentacle is?

           Belle’s eyes widen.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        A what?

                                 RIDING
                        A pentacle.  It’s an ancient pagan 
                        symbol used by witches as a mark 
                        of power.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        What does this have to do with my 
                        wife?

           Riding pulls out a photo showing the SCARS on the Ever 
           After victims.

           She walks up to Belle.  She’s wearing the PENTACLE 
           NECKLACE seen in the campaign posters.

           Riding rips the JEWELRY from Belle’s neck, dangling it in 
           front of the photograph so the mayor can see.

                        Your wife is the Ever After 
                        killer.

           The crowd GASPS.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        This is outrageous!

                                 THUMB
                        Is it?  

                                 RIDING
                        How do you explain the pentacles 
                        burned into the victims’ heads?  
                        They match your wife’s necklace 
                        exactly.  The ribbon?  You keep 
                        tabs on Belle 24/7?

           Thumb turns to Belle.

                                 THUMB
                        Stiltskin told you about the 
                        antidote Locke discovered, didn’t 
                        he?  You knew he couldn’t take her 
                        out himself, so you took things 
                        into your own hands.  And you 
                        didn’t stop there.  

                                 RIDING
                        None of the victim’s looked strung 
                        out when we found them, despite 
                        being known drug addicts.

                                 THUMB
                        You had to get rid of all the 
                        evidence that she cured them, so 
                        you killed anyone she helped get 
                        clean.  
                                 (a beat)
                        Even tried to have MacCool take 
                        Riding and I out when we got too 
                        close.

           The mayor looks confused, distressed.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Why would she do such a thing?

                                 THUMB
                        Because she made a deal with 
                        Stiltskin.  He keeps Grimm voters 
                        under control with Zaubertrank, 
                        and you two keep running things.  
                        The way it’s always been.

                                 THUMB (CONT'D)
                        If Locke’s cure were to hit the 
                        streets, the stranglehold you have 
                        on the city would be lifted.

           There’s stunned silence.  Belle turns to the mayor 
           calmly.

                                 BELLE
                        They’re right.  It’s over.

           No one can believe what she’s just admitted to.  The 
           mayor’s in shock.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        What?

           Belle drops her bubbly persona, exchanging it for 
           something more menacing.

                                 BELLE
                        Don’t be so naive Adam.  You 
                        honestly think the city kept 
                        electing you because of what a 
                        great job you did?  I just did 
                        what you never had the guts to.

           Belle points around the room.

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        Look around!  There isn’t a person 
                        here who isn’t under Stiltskin’s 
                        finger.  At least I had the balls 
                        to get my hands a little dirty...

           The mayor slaps Belle across the face.  She recovers, 
           then moves in close.

                                 BELLE (CONT’D)
                        And don’t think you didn’t have a 
                        part to play, husband.

           Thumb and Riding both shoot knowing looks at each other.  

           Belle moves like a serpent around the mayor, whispering 
           something into his ear.  She finishes.

           Suddenly, his VEINS turn black, quickly twisting around 
           his entire body.  The mayor throws his head back, 
           SCREAMING in pain!  

           Everyone is thrown off guard.  

           Thumb watches the palms of the mayor’s hands as they 
           begin SIZZLING, PENTACLE SCARS identical to the ones 
           we’ve seen earlier taking shape.

           CONTINUED: (5)

           He is the hexed!

           Belle runs off, unfurling the balloons overhead.  The 
           falling decorations distract everyone as she disappears 
           up the stairs and out of sight.

           Riding pulls her weapon and immediately chases Belle up 
           the staircase.

           Adam Prince flails about, screaming in HORRIFYING agony, 
           desperate to end the searing pain shooting through his 
           entire body.  

           He raises his SMOKING hands and shouts to anyone who will 
           listen.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Help me!  I beg of you!  What’s 
                        she done to me!?!

           He runs to the center of the room and collapses.  Guests 
           look on in terror.

           Suddenly Adam’s whimpering ends.  His body calms.  

           The giants go to help him, but Thumb stops them.

                                 THUMB
                        Wait.

           The veins on the back of the mayor’s hands THROB.  Tiny 
           hairs begin sprouting from the base of his neck.  He 
           doubles over, SHRIEKING.

           His voice suddenly deepens.

                                 MAYOR PRINCE
                        Please...  Get back...  
                        Everyone...

           He cries out once more, hyperventilating, trembling as 
           the TRANSFORMATION BEGINS.

           Adam’s hands squeeze tight as tufts of hair spring up 
           across his growing body.  His clothes rip to shreds.  

           Fingers stretch to sharp nailed paws, feet doing the 
           same.

           The hair covered flesh of his face ripples as two CURVED 
           HORNS split from his forehead, curling to the contour of 
           his skull.

           CONTINUED: (6)

           Adam throws his head back.  He WAILS as each of his teeth 
           mutate into fangs - voice gargling into the bellow of an 
           animal as they do.

           The metamorphosis is complete.  Adam Prince turns to 
           reveal himself.

           Thumb looks on, petrified.

                                 THUMB 
                        Beast.

           The creature is 10FT of absolute fury.  A human body 
           transmuted into a feral amalgam of wild animals.

           He HOWLS up at Thumb and his men, announcing his arrival.  
           Slimy saliva spills from his tongue onto the floor.

           Everyone inside the mansion heads for the exits, 
           SCREAMING past the animal.  The creature looks around 
           enraged and confused.

           It runs toward Thumb and his team, violently swiping at 
           guests who get in its way - hurling them across the room.

           Thumb immediately grabs a NET GUN from one of his 
           mercenary’s backs.  

           He aims for Beast’s head and FIRES!

           A web of TITANIUM NETTING shoots across the ballroom.  It 
           envelopes the animal, wrapping tight around its ankles 
           and forcing it to the ground.  

           The creature SCREAMS and struggles, tumbling around the 
           ballroom, toppling BOOKSHELVES and shattering ANTIQUES.  

           Wrestling inside the netting, it inadvertently overturns 
           a CANDELABRA.  Candles fall onto the carpet, igniting the 
           ground and walls in bright flame.

           The remaining guests look on in horror.

           The creature watches Thumb through the holes in the metal 
           netting, SHRIEKING something primal into the air.

           Thumb signals for his men to surround the animal.  

           The team runs down the stairs and encircles Beast, flames 
           creeping up curtains around them.  

           IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (7)

           TWO MERCS pull HOSES from their backs and prepare to fire 
           into the netting.  Another aims a ROCKET LAUNCHER 
           directly for the creature.

           Thumb begins loading rounds into a BOLT-ACTION REPEATER.  
           He slowly travels down the stairs, pumping his SHOTGUN in 
           warning. 

           Beast becomes furious.  Balloons pop in the heat around 
           him.

           Thumb motions the two mercs with hoses to fire into the 
           animal.  

           They each flip on BACKPACKS and begin shooting EXPANDING 
           FOAM into the netting.  It swirls around Beast, who SNAPS 
           and CLAWS at it in confusion. 

           Thumb joins his team, brushing past balloons and debris.  
           He aims for the creature’s center and signals the 
           remaining mercs to do the same.

           Beast is completely covered in foam.  Everything locked 
           in place save for its fiery eyes.

           Things seem to calm.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        That wasn’t so bad.

           Beast summons all of its strength.  Tiny fissures begin 
           appearing in the foam encasing him.

           Thumb notices the foam CRACKING and SCREAMS at his men.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Get back!

           Suddenly the foam SHATTERS!  Beast bursts through the 
           netting, infuriated.

           Like a mad dog, the animal’s eyes dart around the room, 
           desperate to find an exit.  It turns its back to Thumb 
           and BELLOWS in frustration, raising its arms to the sky.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Fire!!!

           The team unloads everything they have.  ROCKETS and 
           BULLETS sail through the air like a weapons fireworks 
           show.

           The animal YELPS in pain, a few rounds boring bloody 
           holes into its thick skin.

           The creature leaps across the hall onto a banister, 
           pushes off and sails through the air toward Thumb.  

           Thumb jumps out of the way, but the men behind him aren’t 
           quick enough!

           Beast crashes headlong into the crowd of mercs.  The 
           animal explodes with feral rage, throwing two men across 
           the room!

           One CRUNCHES into a marble column and collapses.  The 
           other CRASHES into a chandelier overhead.  

           Beast grabs another officer and body hugs him.  The 
           pressure is so great, every bone in the man’s body SNAPS.

           Thumb shouts out to the animal.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Adam!  I know you can hear me!  
                        Stop!!!

           Beast GROWLS at Thumb.  He looks to the limp corpse of 
           the merc he’s just killed, lifts it above his head and 
           chucks it at the immense window behind them.  

           OUTSIDE

           glass shatters into a thousand pieces.  A cold wind whips 
           through the blazing inferno that was the mayoral mansion.

           The clouds outside begin rumbling.  Lightning crackles as 
           a POLICE ZEPPELIN whirls through the night, shining its 
           spotlight into the manor.

           INSIDE

           Thumb looks on as Beast howls, then leaps through the 
           fire, out of the window and down to the FOREST below.

           INT. ARMORY, MAYOR’S MANSION -- LATE NIGHT

           A vast space filled with every arcane implement of death 
           the human mind has ever devised.  

           EXOTIC WEAPONS hang from the walls beside several suits 
           of CHAIN MAIL.  A roaring FIREPLACE is set into the far 
           wall.  

           Riding carefully navigates through the room, gun drawn.

           Belle suddenly pops out of the shadows, hood drawn.  
           MENACING.

           CONTINUED:

           She waves her hands through the air and begins speaking 
           in tongues, as if calling some SUPERNATURAL FORCE.  A 
           bright pentacle BURNS itself into her forehead.  

           The air crackles.  RED SPARKS explode around her, each 
           one drawn to a GLOWING ORB forming at the center of her 
           hands.

           Riding immediately FIRES on Belle!  

           But her bullets and gun are SUCKED right out of the air, 
           all melting into the SWIRLING sphere forming inside 
           Belle’s hands.

           Finally, Belle’s work is complete.  The glowing ball of 
           SUPERNATURAL ENERGY glimmers.  A PLASMA BOLT.

           Riding has no where to go.

           Suddenly, Belle parts her hands.  The energy SURGES from 
           her palms, SWIRLING around the room and into the hanging 
           SUITS OF ARMOR around them.

           Riding watches in horror as the suits CREAK and CRUNCH, 
           coming to life as ruby SPARKS of energy CRACKLE from 
           each.

           The suits each reach to the walls, pulling MEDIEVAL 
           WEAPONS to their hands like metal to a magnet.

           Belle begins cackling, watching on as the suits of armor 
           break free of the walls and come at Riding weapons drawn!

           EXT. WOODS -- LATE NIGHT

           Torrential downpour.  Toads belching.  Cicadas singing 
           their sad songs.

           Thumb and his team navigate the dense forest, SQUISHING 
           muck underneath their feet.  

           Thumb signals to his men to follow him into a nearby

           SWAMP

           They’re all waist deep in water.  Rain PLOPS onto the 
           surface of the lake, sporadically revealing its ink black 
           contents.

           As they skim across the surface, Thumb notices a PIXIE 
           floating through the air.

           Wading further through, more pixies begin appearing.  
           More still.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Just ahead of the men, hundreds of pixies light up the 
           night, each circling above a calm section of the lagoon.

           Thumb signals for the men to encircle the area around the 
           pixies.

           Suddenly the surrounding forest goes quiet.

           Thumb removes a flashlight from his jacket and sweeps 
           across the water beneath the pixies.  A few bubbles rise 
           to the surface.  

           Each man cocks his weapon, preparing when -

           A DEAD DEER floats to the surface, the antlers and flesh 
           of its face mostly stripped clean.

           The team sighs collectively.  Thumb motions for them to 
           go back to the riverbank when -

           Beast EXPLODES out of the water behind them, eyes on 
           fire.  Pixies squeal in fear, scattering into the night.

           The animal SLASHES at the group, GNASHING at the air 
           hoping to find something to sink its teeth into.

           Giants fire their GATLING GUNS, shooting GLOWING BULLETS 
           at the creature, desperately trying to injure it.  

           Beast lunges at the remaining team, RIPPING men in half, 
           SEVERING necks and CRUNCHING bones.  A macabre dance of 
           violence.  

           During the melee, Thumb gets clipped, throwing his body 

           UNDERWATER

           where flashes of lightning illuminate the contents of the 
           lake.  FISHES dart around.  INSECTS zoom through water.

           Thumb watches in horror, dazed, as Beast’s fur-covered 
           hind legs leap about, clawing deep into the silty bottom.  

           As boots and paws SWISH and struggle around him, copious 
           amounts of crimson blood pirouette down through the green 
           water.

           Then, the water goes calm again.  Thumb can no longer 
           hold his breath.

           THE SWAMP SURFACE

           Thumb bursts forth, heaving.  He gets his bearings.  
           Looks around.  Floating calmly across the top of the 
           swamp is his ENTIRE TEAM.  Torn apart.  Bloodied.  Dead.  
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The giants are gone.

           He hears rustling from a far, a few birds CAWING.  Across 
           the swamp is a trail of displaced algae.

           Thumb unclips an ASSAULT-RIFLE from the back of a merc 
           and pushes on, following the trail.

           INT. ARMORY, MAYOR’S MANSION -- LATE NIGHT

           The suits of armor have begun encircling Riding.  Each 
           under Belle’s spell.  Puppets to her fingers.

           Riding sees the glint of two metal HAND SCYTHES hanging 
           on the wall.  

           One of the suits lunges forward, swinging a BATTLE AXE 
           right at Riding’s head.  

           She leans into the swing, guiding the weapon into the 
           oncoming suit behind her with a CRUNCH!  

           The suit goes WHIZZING across the room, SMASHING through 
           a wooden beam and CRASHING to the ground.

           In the confusion, Riding heads for the wall, grabbing the 
           TWIN SCYTHES.

           The two other armored suits begin sprinting toward her, 
           one swinging a BALL AND CHAIN, the other a SWORD!  

           Riding takes a battle stance, preparing for the 
           onslaught.

           Both she and the armored suits SLICE and JAB at one 
           another.  Metal crunches against metal as SPARKS fly and 
           artifacts are destroyed all over the room.

           One of the suits manages to land a punch to Riding’s 
           face.  She’s thrown to the ground, sliding across the 
           floor, blood pouring from her nose.

           The suits prepare to deliver the final blow, when Riding 
           pulls herself up.  

           She calls out to Belle.

                                 RIDING
                        What’s the matter Belle?  Afraid 
                        to get blood on your own hands?

           Belle flicks her wrist.  The suits of armor freeze, 
           weapons mere inches from Riding’s face.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Belle walks across the room, eyes alight.  She looks down 
           at Riding.

                                 BELLE
                        In your case, I’ll make an 
                        exception.

           Belle turns, pulling FLAMES from a ROARING FIRE across 
           the room.

           Time slows.  

           Belle manipulates the blaze, swirling plumes of flame 
           around her body with delicate precision.  A phoenix of 
           limitless power.

           Riding uses the distraction.  She leaps from the ground, 
           removes her scythes and digging them into Belle’s 
           shoulders!  

           Belle let’s out a HORRIFYING scream!

           With one pull, Riding uses her scythes to lead Belle’s 
           hands to her own face, pulling the flames to it!

           Belle’s screaming continues.  Flames and energy swirl 
           around her body, illuminating the entire room in 
           SUPERNATURAL ENERGY.

           Riding quickly backs away, watching as the energy 
           transforms Belle’s face into a shriveled, hooked nosed, 
           boil-ridden 

           WITCH - small strands of brittle silver hair peaking out 
           from her charred clothing.

           Riding looks down at the gaunt, pathetic body that used 
           to be Belle Prince, sickened.

                                 RIDING
                        Witch.

           EXT. WOODS -- LATE NIGHT

           The rain has begun to subside.  It’s drizzling.

           Thumb carefully moves across the roots of an enormous 
           redwood and passes into clearing.  He spins around the 
           muddy ground to see he’s in

           A CONSTRUCTION SITE

           for a half-built suburb community surrounded by tree 
           stumps and needled pines.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           BUILDING FRAMES jut out of concrete foundations.  A soil 
           path twists around PALLETS of COLOSSAL REDWOOD LOGS at 
           separate ends of the site.

           Thumb carefully searches the grounds.  Again he sees a 
           pixie floating in the wind.  He follows it around a junk 
           pile to see -

           BEAST, hundreds of pixies BUZZING around him like flies 
           around a rotted corpse.  Each creature TWITCHES and 
           FLUTTERS about, feasting on Beast’s gooey wounds.

           Beast digs his feet into the mud, hunched over, burying 
           his snout into the bloodied corpse of a fallen merc.

           Thumb can’t stand the sight.  He carefully flips the 
           safety off his weapon, then summons the courage to 
           confront Beast.  He turns the corner to see -

           The animal is a half foot from his face!  EYES STARING 
           INTENSELY.  Jaws dripping with blood and caked in mud.

           Thumb’s shaking.  He slowly backs up, weapon pointed into 
           the creature’s gaping maw.  The animal follows him 
           SLASHING through the air.

           CONSTRUCTION CENTER

           Beast snaps at Thumb as a warning.  Thumb moves several 
           yards away from him.

                                 THUMB
                        Don’t do it Adam.  I know there’s 
                        still some of you left in there.

           The creature bares its horrible teeth, lips trembling.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        We can help you.  It wasn’t your 
                        fault.  Belle used you.

           Suddenly the sound of weapons CLICKING can be heard in 
           the forest around them.

           Beast looks to the pines, confused, then back to Thumb 
           with a menacing grimace.

           Beast immediately charges toward Thumb, a freight train 
           of flesh and fur.  Thumb gives chase.

           Beast leaps from the ground, soaring into the air, TALONS 
           stretching from its paws, when -

           Two giants BURST out of the forest and tackle animal to 
           the ground.  BROB and VOTAN!  
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           The three creatures slide across the mud and SLAM into a 
           half-built house, shattering it to pieces.

           The two remaining giants, GOL and ELLU, trudge out of the 
           forest and into the mud, guns aimed.  Both enormous men 
           encircle Thumb.

           IN THE RUBBLE

           Brob and Votan wrestle Beast across the ground.  The 
           earth shakes and shivers.  Beast SNARLS at the giants, 
           wildly SLICING at them.  

           Brob picks up a CONCRETE BLOCK and SMASHES it over 
           Beast’s head.  The cement detonates in a cloud of rock 
           and powder, barely inflicting any damage.

           BEHIND THE CONSTRUCTION

           Thumb is at the center of a huddle of giants.  They both 
           tower over him, waiting to hear the plan.

           Thumb motions to their guns.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Might as well toss those.

           Gol cracks his knuckles.

                                 GOL
                        How do we kill it?

           Thumb looks at the two enormous PALETTES of REDWOOD LOGS 
           stacked on opposite sides of the site.

           IN THE RUBBLE

           Votan grabs Beast by the head and twists him into a choke 
           hold.  The creature struggles to breathe, wheezing and 
           gargling spit.  

           Out of options, Beast savagely claws a series deep red 
           GASHES across Votan’s back, slicing through his body 
           armor.  

           The wounds sizzle and bubble.  A PENTACLE burns itself 
           into his forehead.  Votan screams in agony, crumpling 
           into a heap.  

           Beast immediately climbs over the corpse and pushes off a 
           pile of debris toward Brob.  

           Before Brob can react, the creature sinks its jaws into 
           the flesh of his neck.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           Brob struggles to tear Beast away from him, but it’s too 
           late.  

           Beast twists his jaws and SNAPS Brob’s neck with a 
           sickening CRUNCH!  The giant’s body goes limp and crashes 
           to the ground.

           The air becomes still.  Beast’s ears perk up.  It hears a 
           voice echoing outside.

           CONSTRUCTION CENTER

           Beast emerges from the wreckage to find Thumb waiting for 
           him 50 yards away.

           Beast digs his heels into the mud, then races toward 
           Thumb.  The creature stomps across the ground, picking up 
           speed.

           Thumb turns to run, Beast eating up the space between 
           him.

           Just then, he motions overhead to -

           Gol and Ellu, each standing atop awnings on top of two 
           separate log palettes.  They tug and pull on the METAL 
           CHAIN wrapped around the logs with all their might.

           ON THE GROUND

           Beast is only a few yards from Thumb and the chains still 
           haven’t been cut!

           Thumb turns to Beast and fires quick BURPS of ammunition 
           into his chest.  The creature immediately falls to the 
           ground winded.

           Thumb sprints into the woods with what little energy he 
           has left, just as -

           Gol and Ellu successfully RIP THROUGH the metal chains 
           with a 

           SNAP!

           An avalanche of rolling timber RUMBLES across both sides 
           of the development, leveling everything in sight.

           Beast comes to, shaking off the cobwebs.  He pulls 
           himself from the ground to see -

           The MAELSTROM of destruction careening toward him!

           Beast accepts its fate, letting out one final ROAR in 
           protest!

           CONTINUED: (5)

           The logs roll over his body, the impact CRUSHING him with 
           SICKENING force!  

           His roar quickly shifts into a shrill YELP before fading 
           away completely.  He’s DEAD.

           EXT. MAYOR’S MANSION -- EARLY MORNING

           FIRE FIGHTERS douse what remains of the charred manor 
           with their powerful hoses.

           Thumb and Riding are cleaned up and bandaged next to 
           flashing AMBULANCES and POLICE CRUISERS. 

           Thumb watches Belle being loaded into an ambulance.  He 
           turns to Riding.

                                 THUMB
                        Alah-Din’s gonna have his hands 
                        full with that one.

           A LIMOUSINE cruises up in front of the detectives.  SNOW 
           WHITMORE steps out.

           Thumb gets up to shake Whitmore’s hand, taken aback by 
           her beauty.

                                 THUMB (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                        Well, mayor-elect.  Returns just 
                        came in.  Made it by a wink.

                        You get our little package?

                                 WHITMORE
                        Already have my people working on 
                        making more.  It’s a shame what 
                        happened to Locke and the others.  
                        It’s people like them who offer 
                        hope to those fighting to improve 
                        things for the rest of us.  Just 
                        like you two.

           She regards both Thumb and Riding with a smile.

                                 WHITMORE (CONT’D)
                        You make a great team.

                        So what’s next?

                                 WHITMORE
                        We’ll have plenty of time to talk 
                        about the future.  

           She winks at Thumb and Riding.

                                 WHITMORE (CONT’D)
                        I have a feeling you two have more 
                        interesting things to discuss at 
                        the moment.

           Whitmore gets back into her limo.  Thumb and Riding watch 
           her pull away.

                                 THUMB
                        So...

           Riding smirks.  She quickly kisses Thumb on the cheek and 
           walks off.  Thumb’s instantly smitten.

           The sun spills over the horizon, blanketing the area in 
           pink dawn light.  The faint beginnings of a RAINBOW 
           appear over the scene.

           We see Thumb in silhouette, Riding walking off as the 
           orange sun rises into the crisp blue sky.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- MORNING, CONTINUOUS 

           We move through different sections of the forest.  Shafts 
           of soft golden light cut through the dense foliage.  Dew 
           hangs from pinecones.  

           Deeper into the woods, a family of DEER gallops past a 
           SWAMP filled with DUCKS and GEESE.  BIRDS chirp.

           Past the pond is what remains of the HOUSING DEVELOPMENT 
           from earlier.  

           We move past the logs now blanketing it to find a glossy 
           black LIMOUSINE idling in the mud.

           Suddenly, a CARAVAN of blacked-out sedans followed by 
           POLICE ESCORTS creeps out of the woods, encircling the 
           limo.

           Out of the LEAD SEDAN steps an ELF body guard wearing an 
           earpiece.  He opens the passenger door and out steps -

           SNOW WHITMORE.  She looks around, taking in the broken 
           surroundings, then approaches the tinted window of the 
           limousine.  
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She stares deep into the glass, her reflection shining in 
           the bright light of early morning.  

           After a moment, the window rolls down, revealing -

           RUMPEL STILTSKIN inside.  

           He winks at her.  She hands him the shimmering blue 
           ANTIDOTE to Zauberktrank.  

                                 STILTSKIN
                        Oh the tangled webs we weave.

           The door to Stiltskin’s car opens and she gets inside.

           The caravan follows the limo as it glides back into the 
           forest, gray STORM CLOUDS gathering from the afar...

                                                                 TO BLACK

                                                                FADE OUT.

           THE END
