                                                                  07/01/10
           OVER BLACK:

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        I remember my 8th-grade history 
                        teacher told me, “Every revolution 
                        was first a thought inside one 
                        man’s head.”

           INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

           A sleep-deprived RICHARD BECKER welds an electromagnetic coil 
           inside a METALLIC DISC the size of a bicycle tire.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        If that’s so, then our generation’s 
                        revolution started in this 
                        particular man’s head--

           Becker finishes and--as soon as he does--the disc emits a 
           MASSIVE PULSE WAVE with enough force to send him flying back 
           from his chair and SLAMMING VIOLENTLY into the wall.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --right before it was nearly ripped 
                        from his body.

           Becker blinks back into consciousness, looking forward to see 
           the DISC is FLOATING IN MIDAIR, unassisted.  Light 
           surrounding the disc is REFRACTED BY AN OTHERWISE INVISIBLE 
           WAVE emitted from it. 

           Becker walks toward the disc, the look on his face can only 
           be described as religious transcendence. 

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Dr. Richard Becker built the first 
                        self-generating renewable 
                        superconducting magnetic repulsion 
                        system.  Fancy way of saying: 
                        powerful magnet, no batteries 
                        required.  He called it a 
                        “LevDisc”.

           INT. TESTING FACILITY 

           Becker and dozens of SCIENTISTS watch a small remote-operated 
           FLOATING VEHICLE outfitted with FOUR LEVDISCS.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        The LevDisc floated by repelling 
                        the Earth’s naturally occurring 
                        magnetic fields.  More you cranked 
                        up the power--
           A FLICK OF A SWITCH and it LIFTS 20 FEET INTO THE AIR.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --higher you went.  Put them at an 
                        angle--

           Becker TURNS A KNOB on his control--

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF FLOATING VEHICLE

           We SEE the underside of the floating vehicle, where all four 
           discs are perfectly parallel with the ground.  Then--

           --TWO DISCS ADJUST 10 DEGREES and the floating vehicle moves 
           horizontally across the testing facility ground.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --you’ve got thrust--and plenty of 
                        it.

           INT. DRY LAKE TRACK, EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE

           The floating vehicle has now evolved into something that 
           resembles a SMALL JET with a TEST PILOT inside.

           The Test Pilot gives a THUMB’S UP and--BOOM!!--takes off like 
           a BULLET over the arid soil.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        It was the greatest technological 
                        breakthrough of the 21st Century.  
                        Monetizing his invention would have 
                        made Becker the richest man on 
                        Earth.  But he had other plans.

           EXT. SLUMS OF MUMBAI - DAY

           U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL at his side, Becker stands a podium, 
           addressing a HUGE POVERTY-STRICKEN CROWD.

                                 BECKER
                        --from emission-free transportation 
                        to power turbines that generate 
                        electricity using magnetic fields 
                        like windmills use air currents, 
                        the LevDisc can and will change our 
                        world for the better.  It is for 
                        that reason, I have decided to give 
                        this technology to the world for 
                        free.

           We GO TIGHT ON: an impoverished 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL, clutching a 
           rag doll as the crowd around her ERUPTS IN CHEERS.  It’s an 
           image of HOPE.
                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Things changed quickly after that.

           INT. NYSE 

           TRADERS lose their minds on the exchange floor.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Our petroleum-based economy took a 
                        dump.

           EXT. HAMPTONS

           Seaside mansions sit idly with “FOR SALE” and “PRICE REDUCED” 
           signs in their driveways.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        People who’d made a fortune off the 
                        labors of others suddenly found 
                        themselves up a creek, sans paddle.

           INT. WAREHOUSE

           YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS retrofit LevDiscs on a traditional 
           automobile.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Soon, thousands of new companies 
                        emerged to compete on the LevDisc 
                        market.  They drove the cost down, 
                        making the LevDisc affordable to 
                        all, rich or poor. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES 

           DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES is consumed by a thick brown-hued SMOG.  
           Skyscrapers are BARELY VISIBLE through it.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        As inexpensive vehicles outfitted 
                        with LevDiscs replaced the gas 
                        guzzlers--

                                                          CROSSFADE TO:

           DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NOW  

           Smog has COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED as our view stretches all the 
           way TO the PACIFIC OCEAN.  Hundreds of zero-emission 
           HOVERCARS zoom past in MULTITIERED LANES over the previously 
           congested streets. 
                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --skies got cleaner.  People’s 
                        health improved dramatically and--

           EXT. PARIS - DAY

           We TRACK ALONGSIDE a LEVDISC TOUR BUS, side adorned in HINDI 
           CHARACTERS, as it approaches the EIFFEL TOWER.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --our world got smaller.  The 
                        internet allowed people to be 
                        anywhere, connect with anyone, 
                        virtually.  But the LevDisc allowed 
                        you to do it literally.

           We PUSH IN ON a window of the bus and see our LITTLE GIRL 
           from the Mumbai Slums.  She smiles brightly as the reflection 
           of the Eiffel Tower moves over her.  She lifts her rag doll 
           to see it. 

           EXT. NAIROBI, KENYA - DUSK

           CHILDREN CELEBRATE as a LEVDISC TURBINE provides power for 
           the shantytowns of Nairobi.  LIGHTS SHINE inside the HUMBLE, 
           IMPROVISED TIN SHACKS.  Real change is happening.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Some credit the LevDisc with 
                        bringing about world peace, 
                        balancing the scales of power, and 
                        liberating people who spent the 
                        last 2,000 years in servitude.  
                        But, personally--

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --I just like that they go fast.

           We HEAR the THUMPING BASS DRUM and DIRTY GUITAR LICKS of 
           “Black Betty” by Ram Jam.

           EXT. FILBERT STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

           We’re STARING DOWN one of the steepest streets in the western 
           hemisphere.  The fog-shrouded GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE and SAN 
           FRANCISCO BAY BELOW US.  But we barely have time to take in 
           the lovely view before--

           ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM---
           Approaching speeds of 400 MPH, STREET-RACING HOVERCARS (aka 
           “HCars”) nearly suck us up in their wake as they ROAR 
           overhead, pulling our TITLE UP:

                                    H O V E R C A R

           EXT. STREET 

           The HCars tilt at 45-degree angles to carve ‘round a corner 
           and head DOWNTOWN.

           SKYSCRAPER CANYONS begin to rise around our pack of street 
           racers as they deftly weave in and out, over and under the 
           MULTITIERED TRAFFIC LANES of the city.

           Our speeding HCars resemble not-so-distant cousins of STREET 
           RACERS.  Bright vibrant colors and heavy consumer 
           modifications.  We FLOAT BELOW them and GET A LOOK at what’s 
           underneath: 

           SIX LEVDISCS ON MOTORIZED HINGES.  Two angled discs at the 
           rear provide THRUST.  Two discs in the center, parallel with 
           the ground, provide LIFT, and two discs at the front of the 
           car pivot left and right to NAVIGATE.

           We THRUST AHEAD TO CATCH OUR LEADER:  A CLASSIC MUSCLE CAR 
           RETROFITTED WITH LEVDISCS.  “BLACK BETTY” is written in 
           cursive gold lettering on her door.  She’s a fast machine 
           worthy of McQueen.

           We PUSH THROUGH Betty’s WINDSHIELD and INTO--

           INT. BETTY 

           --what more closely echoes the cockpit of a fighter jet than 
           the interior of a car.  “Black Betty” blasts on the stereo.

           Behind the wheel is:

           JASON “JAY” COSTIGAN (28) Scruffy faced, buzz-clipped hair, 
           boyishly handsome.  Through his amber aviator glasses, we can 
           SEE his eyes are laser focused.  

           We FLIP TO Jay’s POV:

           RED LIGHTS at the precipice of a BUSY EIGHT-WAY INTERSECTION.  
           FOUR TIERS of HCAR TRAFFIC loom ahead. 

                                 JAY
                        Crap.
           INT. ROURKE’S HCAR 

           Inside the second place HCar, a heavily tattooed and scarred 
           racer, ROURKE, looks at Jay hurtling toward the intersection.

                                 ROURKE
                        You can’t be that stupid.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay stares at the CONGESTED INTERSECTION approaching, his 
           right hand SHAKING on his SHIFT STICK.  HE TAKES A DEEP 
           BREATH, then FROM JAY’S POV:

           TIME SLOWS TO 1/16 SPEED:  We quickly CIRCLE the PERIMETER 
           (”MATRIX VISION”) of the INTERSECTION:

           STOP LIGHTS, MOVING HCARS, PEDESTRIANS on the SIDEWALK, a 
           LEVITATING SEMI trying to make the LIGHT.  Distances are 
           gauged, speeds estimated and calculations made in 1/100th of 
           a second.  JAY FINDS ORDER IN THIS MADNESS.  

           Jay EXHALES and we’re back to REAL TIME.  A beat, then--

           Jay UPSHIFTS and SLAMS the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR.

           EXT. BETTY 

           WHOOOOOOOOMMMMM!!!  Betty ROARS as it double-times toward the 
           intersection. 

           INT. ROURKE’S HCAR 

           Rourke watches Betty blast full speed into this TOTAL 
           CLUSTERF%CK.

                                 ROURKE
                        Crazy mother--

           INT. BETTY

           HCARS BRAKE and HORNS SOUND as Jay navigates the 
           intersection, corkscrewing, flipping and MISSING COLLISION 
           after COLLISION BY MERE INCHES. 

           EXT. REMAINING PACK OF RACERS 

           Rourke and the other STREET RACERS opt to PULL UP AND OVER 
           the intersection, which costs them any chance of catching 
           Jay.
           INT. BETTY 

           Jay spots a LEVITATING SEMI TRUCK headed STRAIGHT FOR HIM.  
           Jay ACCELERATES and--

           WHOOSH!  Misses being hit by inches.  He clears the 
           intersection.  Jay turns around: no other racer in sight.

           Jay looks forward at a clear path to the THICK RED BEAM OF 
           LIGHT ahead.  He’s all smiles as he THROTTLES the car forward 
           and blasts through.  VICTORY!

           Jay SIGHS relief.  That was close... even for him.

           EXT. STREET ALLEY 

           The dreadlocked DAMIEN approaches on foot, carrying a LARGE 
           DUFFLE BAG.  Next to him is LOPEZ, a young streetracer who 
           just got smoked by Jay.

                                 DAMIEN
                        You out your damn mind, Jay?

           WHIP PAN TO:

           JAY, exiting a parked Betty.

                                 JAY
                        The word you’re looking for is 
                        “gifted”.

                                 DAMIEN
                        You sure there’s enough room for 
                        you and your ego in that car?

                                 JAY
                        It is getting a bit snug now that 
                        you mention it.

           Lopez looks at Jay curiously.  Then--

                                 LOPEZ
                        Hey, I know you. Aren’t you that--?

                                 JAY
                        Nope.

           Damien GRINS as he tosses Jay the duffle bag.  Jay UNZIPS it 
           and eyes the THICK ROLLS OF CASH inside.

                                 DAMIEN
                        Your winnings.
                                 JAY
                        Good morning, Mr. Presidents.

           Jay grabs a roll and tosses it to a surprised Damien.  

                                 DAMIEN
                        What’s this--I already took my cut.

                                 JAY
                        I’m feeling generous today.

                                 ROURKE (O.S.)
                        You give that money away like it 
                        was yours.

           Jay turns to see ROURKE APPROACHING.  Rourke SNATCHES the 
           roll out of Damien’s hand.

                                 JAY
                        I guess I’m just old-fashioned.  
                        Isn’t it tradition to give the 
                        money to the guy who just kicked 
                        your ass? 

           Rourke grabs hold of one of the duffle straps.

                                 ROURKE
                        I’m collecting this month’s payment 
                        to Telgano.  

           Jay’s face sinks.  Rourke pulls the duffle close, dragging 
           Jay with it.

                                 JAY
                        Thanks, but I prefer to deliver it 
                        personally.

           CLICK-CLICK.  Jay looks down to see that Rourke has a PISTOL 
           buried into his ribs.  A tense beat, then--  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        How do I know you won’t just keep 
                        it?

                                 ROURKE
                        You don’t.  But you also don’t have 
                        a choice.

           Jay reluctantly RELEASES the duffle.  

           Rourke smiles, showcasing his GOLD CHECKERBOARDED TEETH.

           SIX DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT) HCARS surround them

           EXT. RAPID TRANSIT MAGLEV RAIL STATION - MORNING

           THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS pour into the glimmering steel-and-
           glass structure that houses the city’s high-speed “MagLev” 
           commuter trains.  Among them:

           INT. RAPID TRANSIT MAGLEV RAIL STATION - CONTINUOUS

           DR. ANNA WHITE, who waits on a concrete platform as the 
           approaching train slows to a stop.  

           INT. MAGLEV TRAIN 

           ANNA TURNS SOME HEADS as she boards.  Dressed in a form-
           fitting Prada blouse and heels that could kill, Anna offsets 
           her otherwise stunning features with tightly ponytailed hair 
           and chunky glasses.

           As she takes hold of an overhead bar, we notice A THIN BAND 
           OF PALE WHITE SKIN on her finger where--until recently--A 
           RING USED TO BE.  

           HYPER-THIN LCD SCREENS cover every inch of the MagLev’s 
           futuristic interior.  Currently they show the NEWS.

                                 STAFFORD (V.O.)
                        With the passing of the “Safer 
                        Skies” bill and putting “NexGen 
                        SmartDiscs” under every HCar in 
                        America, the chances of collision 
                        or a LevDisc failure will be 
                        reduced to nearly zero percent.  

           The mention of “NexGen SmartDiscs” pricks up Anna’s ears and 
           she turns her attention to the LCD screens.

           TIGHT ON SCREEN

           REPRESENTATIVE PATRICK STAFFORD, late 50s, speaks 
           passionately at a CONGRESSIONAL HEARING. 
                                 STAFFORD (V.O.)
                        Built-in restrictors will put an 
                        end to the plague of street racers 
                        driving at deadly high speeds 
                        through our cities.

           Stafford is APPLAUDED by his fellow CONGRESSIONAL 
           REPRESENTATIVES. 

                                 MCCALE (V.O.)
                        Mr. Chairman--

           Stafford’s face sours as the television camera cuts to:

           A young Congresswoman, REPRESENTATIVE KATHERINE McCALE.

                                 MCCALE (V.O.)
                        What about the free open-patent 
                        LevDiscs?

                                 STAFFORD (V.O.)
                        They’ll be phased out in favor of 
                        this safer, better product. 

                                 MCCALE (V.O.)
                        A product for which Lyndon 
                        Technologies holds the patent and 
                        is the sole manufacturer.  Which 
                        means--
                             (beat)
                        --They can charge as much as they 
                        want for the modified design.

                                 STAFFORD (V.O.)
                        So you’re saying we should put a 
                        price on our citizens’ safety?

           Anna watches their exchange with great interest.

                                 MCCALE (V.O.)
                        Our society was built on this 
                        technology being free.  Change that 
                        one thing and we could throw 
                        everything out of balance.

                                 STAFFORD (V.O.)
                        Congresswoman McCale, we had over 
                        10,000 fatal midair collisions this 
                        past year.  All of which could have 
                        been prevented with the NexGen 
                        SmartDisc technology.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STAFFORD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Now I appreciate what you’re 
                        saying, but--I believe our society 
                        was built on the idea that we 
                        should care for and protect our 
                        neighbors.  And I can see no better 
                        way of doing it than with this 
                        legislation.

           The room erupts with APPLAUSE and we hold on a defeated 
           McCale before--THE SCREEN CUTS TO: A REPORTER standing 
           outside the Capitol.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Heated remarks during a meeting of 
                        the Transportation Oversight 
                        Committee.  With 58% of Congress 
                        polling in favor of the Safer Skies 
                        Bill, it appears a virtual lock to 
                        pass into law when put to a vote 
                        four days from now.

           INT. LYNDON TECHNOLOGIES LOBBY, SILICON VALLEY - DAY

           Anna’s heels CLICK loudly against the polished marble inside 
           the five-story lobby of this HI-TECH R&D FACILITY. 

           Anna passes TWO LUXURY-CONCEPT HOVERCARS on display, floating 
           over offset pedestals.  We NOTICE signs that tout both HCars 
           are outfitted with--

           LYNDON NEXGEN SMARTDISCS, the subject of the Congressional 
           debate.

           Anna continues toward the SECURITY GATE.  After sliding her 
           LYNDON TECH SECURITY CARD, Anna pulls EARRINGS from her ears 
           and places them on a TRAY as it goes through the X-RAY.

           An ARMED SECURITY GUARD watches her enter a BODY SCANNER.

           The scanner rotates around her.  PING!  ALL CLEAR.

                        You’re good to go, Dr. White.

           Anna retrieves her things.

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you.

           INT. ANNA’S LABORATORY, LYNDON TECHNOLOGIES 

           Anna enters her lab, teeming with LEVDISCS and PROCESSOR 
           TOWERS the size of skyscrapers.
           An eager young LAB ASSISTANT, waits for her.

                                 ANNA
                        I want to meet with doctors Roth, 
                        Davis and Chen immediately.

                        None of them are in yet.

                                 ANNA
                        Then get them in.

           The Assistant leaves and Anna takes a DEEP BREATH to collect 
           herself.  SOMETHING ISN’T RIGHT.  

           INT. DOT HCAR, HOVERING OVER JAY AND STREET RACERS

           In the passenger seat, a uniformed DOT AGENT mans a TERMINAL 
           that shows the THERMAL READINGS of the surrendering RACERS 
           below.  His fingers move quickly over keyboard and then--

           JAY’S MUG SHOT flashes across the screen.

                        One of them’s implanted with a

                        He is.

           We PAN LEFT TO SEE the driver, BRANT, a plainclothes DOT 
           SPECIAL AGENT.  The man in charge.  30s, square-jawed, fit 
           and showing a particular interest in JAY, who--

           --likewise has LOCKED EYES with Brant.  Jay offers a WRY GRIN

           Brant shifts and THROTTLES his HCar after Jay.

           Betty explodes out of the alley and tears ass down the 
           street, but--

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay checks his rearview mirror--SEES Brant is GAINING.  Jay 
           rips on the wheel and turns 180 degrees, now facing Brant's 
           DOT HCar.  Jay shifts and throttles straight at--

           INT. DOT HCAR 

           --Brant and the DOT Agent, who duck as Betty--

           The DOT Agent cranes his neck to see Betty disappearing over 
           the horizon.

                                 DOT AGENT
                        This guy’s nuts.

           The DOT Agent has to bite his tongue to keep from saying the 
           same thing about his boss as-- 

           --Brant shifts the HCar into REVERSE, SPINS, and THROTTLES 
           AFTER JAY.

           Jay cruises west over the MULTITIERED LANES of HCars merging 
           to cross the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE towering in the distance.

           Jay’s clear path over the Golden Gate Bridge is suddenly 
           BLOCKED when a DOZEN DOT HCARS appear on the opposite side.  
           Jay downshifts and slows to a STOP.

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - AERIAL VIEW 

           Betty idles in the middle of the bridge with 12 DOT HCARS in 
           front of him and Brant to the rear.  He’s TRAPPED.

                                 DOT AGENT

                        Where’s he gonna go?  His discs are 
                        too small to stabilize over water.
                             (into his loudspeaker)
                        Put the car down and--

                        --come out with your hands up.

           Jay doubletaps his dash and a TOUCH-SCREEN FLIPS UP, showing 
           diagnostics of the six LevDiscs under the car.  Jay 
           highlights three discs on the left side and CRANKS THEM TO 
           100% STRENGTH.  He SHUTS DOWN all the discs on the right.

                                 DOT AGENT (V.O.)
                             (pissed)
                        Get out of the damn car!!

           Jay puts his hand on the stick, SHIFTS INTO GEAR and gives 
           Betty EVERYTHING SHE’S GOT.  BRRRRRRR--
           EXT. BETTY

           A SONIC BOOM on Betty’s underside.  The unbalanced power 
           overload on the left side causes it to FLIP, SPINNING TWO 
           FULL ROTATIONS--

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE 

           --OVER the side of the Bridge.

           INT. BETTY 

           Still SPINNING inside the car, Jay reaches for the diagnostic 
           and redistributes the lift on all six discs.

           EXT. BETTY 

           Betty slows its spin and “lands,” floating about six feet 
           over the surface of the water. 

           INT. DOT HCAR

           The DOT Agent’s JAW DROPS, in total awe of what just 
           happened.

           Jay SIGHS momentary relief before--

           THWAP--THWAP--THWAP--BLASTS FROM THE GATLINGS RAIN DOWN FROM 
           ABOVE, SPLOSHING into the water around him.

                                 JAY
                        Damnit!!

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE 

           The DOT HCars are poised on the edge of the bridge and their 
           SPINNING GATLING GUNS unload on Jay’s car below.

           INT. DOT HCAR 

           Brant SCREAMS into his radio.

           EXT. BETTY 

           Jay careful throttles forward as Betty BUCKS over the WAVES 
           of the open water.

                        Come on, come on, come on.
           EXT. BETTY 

           Betty handles POORLY without a constantly level surface 
           beneath it.  It JERKS up and down and SKIDS side to side like 
           bare tires on ice.  All the while, the DOT’s GUNS continue to 
           pelt him.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay gets tossed around, holding on for dear life--

                                 JAY
                        Never doing this again.

           --until he finally HITS--

           EXT. SHORES OF FORT POINT 

           --LAND and is able to RESTABILIZE.  Betty regains control and 
           quickly disappears into the city.

           INT. DOT HCAR 

           Brant POUNDS his steering wheel, helpless to follow.

           EXT. ALLEY - MINUTES LATER

           Damien, Rourke and the other street racers are loaded into a 
           PADDY WAGON as Brant looks on.

           A DOT Agent walks up and hands Brant the DUFFLE BAG filled 
           with Jay’s would-be winnings.  

                                 DOT AGENT
                        Feast your eyes.  Over a quarter 
                        million.  

           Rourke--the last to be loaded into the paddy wagon--sees 
           Brant eyeing the money.  He shouts:

                                 ROURKE
                        Got away, didn’t he?

           Brant looks up at Rourke with disdain.

                                 ROURKE (CONT’D)
                        I can give him to you.  I know 
                        where he lives.

           Rourke has Brant's attention.

                                 ROURKE (CONT’D)
                        Feel like making a deal?
           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK, HUNTER’S POINT - DAY

           An ABANDONED FACTORY sits unoccupied by the shore of the Bay.  
           Not a soul in sight.

           We HEAR the characteristic BASSY HUM of an HCar as--

           --BETTY COMES INTO VIEW.  Jay exits and PULLS BACK a sheet 
           metal PANEL on the factory wall to expose--

           --A HIDDEN ENTRANCE.  Jay gets back into Betty and enters 
           through the opening.

           INT. JAY’S LOFT, FACTORY 

           Humble living space/garage.  Scattered tools, LevDiscs, 
           mattress and a microwave.  Betty pulls in and parks.

           Jay inspects Betty, spotting BULLET HOLES in her body.

                                 JAY
                        Ain’t that a peach.

           A WHIMPER.  Jay looks down to see a Great Dane, EASTWOOD, 
           nudging his nose under Jay’s hand.  Jay can’t help but smile.  
           He kneels to rub under Eastwood’s chin. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Buddy, we need a race...and fast.

           Eastwood cocks his head inquisitively.

           INT. ANNA’S LABORATORY - DAY

           Anna sits at her computer, lost in a thought.  

                                 LAB ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        Dr. White?

           Anna breaks from her trance.

                                 ANNA
                        Are they here yet?

           The Lab Assistant stands in her doorway.  His face is PALE 
           AND SULLEN.  Anna RISES, knowing SOMETHING IS WRONG.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 LAB ASSISTANT
                        There’s been an accident.
           INT. JAY’S LOFT - DAY

           Covered head to toe in grease, Jay repairs Betty as The 
           Clash’s “Police On My Back” BLASTS in the background.  
           Eastwood is half asleep on his bean bag.

                                 BRANT (O.S.)
                        Nice digs.

           Jay’s so startled, he SLAMS HIS HEAD on Betty’s hood.

           A HAND turns down the volume on Jay’s stereo--BRANT’S.

                                 JAY
                             (to Eastwood)
                        Outstanding guard dogging.

           Brant inspects Betty.

                                 BRANT
                        Driving my old car?

                                 JAY
                        It hasn’t been yours in a long 
                        time.
                             (then)
                        There an army of DOT Agents outside 
                        waiting for me?

                                 BRANT
                        I came alone.

                                 JAY
                        You know what you cost me today?  
                        Do you have any idea how much I 
                        needed that money?  I have debts to 
                        pay.

                                 BRANT
                        You said it.

           That dig sets Jay off. 

                                 JAY
                        Ten years and I was finally going 
                        to be free and clear of Telgano.  
                        But now, thanks to you--

                                 BRANT
                        This is my fault?

                                 JAY
                        Hell yeah it’s your fault.
                                 BRANT
                        Oh, that’s--that’s--you continue to 
                        screw up your life and it’s my 
                        fault--

                                 JAY
                        You just signed my death warrant!  
                        If I don’t pay Telgano by day’s 
                        end, he’s gonna kill me.

           Jay KICKS a LevDisc across the room.  It CLANGS against the 
           concrete wall.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing on 
                        street watch anyway?  I thought you 
                        were some big-shot Special Agent.  
                        Why are you bothering with me?  

                                 BRANT
                        Because you’re my little brother!  
                        And despite your best attempts to 
                        make me not, I continue give a damn 
                        about you.

                                 JAY
                        Ahhh--that’s so sweet.

           It’s all Brant can do to keep from clocking Jay.

                                 BRANT
                        You could have done anything, Jay--

                                 JAY
                        I’m happy with my choices.

                                 BRANT
                             (surveying the room)
                        Yeah.  You’re happy.  Jay, you need 
                        out one way or another.  I’ll take 
                        you kicking and screaming if I have 
                        to.

                                 JAY
                        Good luck.

                                 BRANT
                        I let you go today--

           Jay starts LAUGHING as Brant continues.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        --but next time I won’t.
                                 JAY
                        You can’t catch me.  

                                 BRANT
                        We’ll find out.

           Brant's mobile RINGS.  He doesn’t move.  IT RINGS AGAIN.

                                 JAY
                        Go ahead and answer, we’re done.

           Brant shakes his head, disappointed as places an EARPIECE 
           MOBILE DEVICE over his lobe and heads to the door.

           Jay watches Brant exit, then moves to the stereo and CRANKS 
           THE VOLUME even LOUDER than before.

           EXT. FACTORY

           We hear a FRANTIC WOMAN’S VOICE.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        All the others--everyone else 
                        involved with the study.  They’re 
                        all dead.

           Brant is very concerned, but remains calm.

                                 BRANT
                        Find a way.  Leave.  Right now.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        And what?

                                 BRANT
                        Come in.  I can protect you.  

           INT. ANNA’S LABORATORY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Anna is huddled in the corner, also wearing an earpiece.

                                 BRANT (V.O.)
                        I promise.  You’ll be safe.

           We HOLD ON Anna’s contemplative face as we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LYNDON TECHNOLOGIES LOBBY - LATER

           Anna nervously approaches the lobby.  It seems EVERY EYEBALL 
           in the building is on HER.

           Anna locks eyes with the Guard as she tries to pass. 
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Dr. White--

           He reaches to stop her, but she shakes him as--

           BEE-EEE-EEE-EEEP--THE ALARM SOUNDS.

           SECURITY GUARD #2 steps in front of Anna, BLOCKING HER PATH.  
           Anna is terrified, shaking her head in fear.  She feels a 
           HAND ON HER SHOULDER and SPINS.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Dr. White.

           Anna’s heart almost is leaping out of her chest as Guard #1’s 
           hand raises and points at Anna’s ear.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Earrings.

           Anna is too startled to understand.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        You forgot your earrings.

           Anna GULPS.  She pulls off her earrings and hands them to the 
           Guard, who NODS and WAVES HER THROUGH THE BODY SCANNER.  Anna 
           wipes sweat from her brow as she steps into the scanner.  
           After what feels like an eternity--

           PING!  The scanner reads ALL CLEAR.  A beat.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        You’re good to go, Dr. White.

           Anna collects her things and briskly walks away.  The Guard 
           watches her suspiciously as she EXITS.

           INT. DEPT. OF TRANSPORTATION, BAY AREA OFFICE - NIGHT

           Anna sits at a table across from Brant, who hands her a glass 
           of water.  She nods a “thank you”.

                                 BRANT
                        I want you to know that you have 
                        options here.  You can dictate what 
                        you know onto a signed affidavit 
                        and we can hide you.

           Anna listens and shakes her head.

                                 ANNA
                        We both know--I have to be there in 
                        person.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                        I’m the only one left who knows how 
                        they work, the decryption codes, 
                        and--
                             (looks at Brant)
                        --what they did to my friends.
                             (with resolve)
                        I need to be there.  I need to stop 
                        him.

           Brant can see that Anna is serious.

           INT. WOLFE’S OFFICE, DOT HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           DEPUTY SECRETARY VINCENT WOLFE, late 50s, distinguished, a 
           man who has spent his life in law enforcement, stares out the 
           window of his high-rise office.

                                 WOLFE
                        She’s actually willing to appear?

                                 BRANT
                        She’s determined to, sir.

           Wolfe faces Brant.

                                 WOLFE
                        If I thought she had any idea of 
                        what she was getting herself into, 
                        I’d say she’s a brave girl.

                                 BRANT
                        She’s very aware.

                                 WOLFE
                        I’ll notify Congresswoman McCale’s 
                        office that we’re en route.

                                 BRANT
                        I’d like to go with her.

                                 WOLFE
                        I’ll put a team together and we’ll 
                        convoy to the airport.  Be prepared 
                        to move in two hours.

                                 BRANT
                        Thank you, Deputy Secretary.

           ADRENALINE JUNKIES clink frothy glasses while swapping 
           stories at this STREET RACER HANGOUT.  We find JAY in the 
           midst of a HEATED CONVERSATION with TWEAKER, a rail-thin dude 
           with full-sleeve tattoos.
                                 JAY

                        I don’t know what you want from me, 
                        Jay.  No way I can get a race 
                        together.

           Jay POUNDS the bar, spins on his heels and heads out.

           INT. DOT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

           THREE DOT HCARS with AGENTS behind their wheels wait inside 
           an otherwise EMPTY ENCLOSED PARKING STRUCTURE.

           INT. DOT HCAR 

           A DOT Agent spots:

           Wolfe, Brant, Anna and AGENT MOREAU (30s, street tough) exit 
           an elevator and march toward the awaiting HCars.

                                 DOT AGENT
                        They’re here.  Look alive.

           INT. DOT PARKING STRUCTURE 

                                 WOLFE
                        Right this way, Dr. White, you’ll 
                        be riding with me.

           Anna immediately looks uneasy, Brant notices.

                                 BRANT
                        I assured Dr. White that I would be 
                        driving her personally.

           Moreau checks Wolfe for his reaction.  A beat. 

                                 WOLFE
                        Not a problem.
           Brant opens the door to his DOT HCar for Anna while WOLFE and 
           MOREAU MOVE TO ANOTHER DOT HCAR.

           INT. BRANT'S DOT HCAR 

           Anna huddles in the back seat.  

                                 BRANT (O.S.)
                        You okay?

           Anna sees Brant's eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 ANNA
                        Would you be?

           Brant shakes his head.  He understands.  But then--HE SEES 
           SOMETHING IN THE MIRROR--

           Anna SPINS to see what has caught Brant's attention:

           TWO DOT Agents in the car behind them are exiting with 
           MACHINE GUNS in hand.  

                                 BRANT
                        Get down.

           Brant THROWS his car in reverse, SLAMMING into the agents’ 
           car.  The DOT Agents dive out of the way and OPEN FIRE, 
           peppering Brant's HCar with bullets.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s happening?

                                 BRANT
                        Stay down!

           Brant puts his car into drive, but Wolfe’s car is blocking 
           him.

           EXT. DOT PARKING STRUCTURE 

           Wolfe and Moreau exit their car and OPEN FIRE.

           Brant spins 90 degrees and HOPS the railing onto the 
           ascending SPIRAL RAMP of the garage-- 

           INT. BRANT'S DOT HCAR 

           --CRASH--THUD--the car drops and hits the surface of the ramp 
           before bouncing back to normal hovering height.

           CRACK--CRACK--A BULLET SHATTERS Brant’s window, followed by a 
           SECOND that lodges--
                                 BRANT
                        Ahhhh!

           --in his shoulder.  HE’S SHOT.

           EXT. DOT PARKING STRUCTURE 

           Wolfe and the DOT Agents get into their cars to pursue. 

           EXT. SPIRAL RAMP 

           Brant hits the accelerator and--USING HIS ONE GOOD ARM--
           cranks the wheel “DRIFTING” around the DOUBLE HELIX-STYLE 
           ramp, MISSING colliding with the walls by inches.

           Brant sees CITY LIGHTS at the EXIT and--

           EXT. STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO 

           --Brant's DOT HCar explodes out the Department of 
           Transportation building and tears down the street.

           INT. BRANT'S DOT HCAR 

                                 BRANT
                        Damnit!  Damnit!  Damnit!  

                                 ANNA
                        What’s happening?

                                 BRANT
                        Lyndon must have got to my boss.  

                                 ANNA
                        Your “boss” is the Deputy Secretary 
                        of the DOT.  

                                 BRANT
                        That’s exactly why I need to get 
                        you to Congresswoman McCale.  She’s 
                        the only one we know for sure isn’t 
                        compromised.

                                 ANNA
                        Can you get us to the airport?

                                 BRANT
                        DOT runs the airports.  Forget it.  
                        They’re not safe anymore.

                                 ANNA
                        Then what are we going to do?
           Brant eyes a DUFFLEBAG with an EVIDENCE TAG on it sitting on 
           the floor.

           INT. JAY’S LOFT - NIGHT

           Jay tosses his belongings into Betty’s trunk.  He’s getting 
           the hell out of dodge.  Jay turns to Eastwood.

                                 JAY
                        How you feel about Nova Scotia?

           O.S.: We HEAR the HUM of a Hovercar.  Jay immediately tenses.  
           He grabs a BASEBALL BAT lying on the floor and holds it like 
           it was a samurai sword.

           SILENCE.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s talk about this.  I’ll get 
                        Telgano his money.  I just need 
                        another week.
                             (no response)
                        Hello?

           SMASH--CREEK--Jay’s garage door SWINGS UP TO REVEAL:

           Anna and Brant, his shirt sleeve BLOOD-SOAKED.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What the--what happened to you?

                                 BRANT
                        This is Anna.  I need you to drive 
                        her to DC.

                                 JAY
                        What!?

           Anna’s shaking her head “no”.  She’s NOT cool with this.

                                 ANNA
                        No way.  I don’t know him. I can’t-- 

                                 JAY
                        Damn right you can’t.  I’m not 
                        driving you anywhere, lady.

                                 BRANT
                        Jay--

                                 JAY
                        Take her yourself.  I have to get 
                        my ass into hiding, thanks to you.
                                 BRANT
                        I can’t.  I’m shot, my car’s made 
                        and--
                             (bitter pill)
                        --you’re faster than me.  You’re 
                        her best chance.

           Jay is unfazed. 

                                 JAY
                        All done trying to butter me up?  
                        Because I’m still not doing it.

           Jay looks defiantly at Brant.  He ain’t budging.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You know the way out.

           THUD!  Brant THROWS the DUFFLE BAG into Jay’s gut.  Jay looks 
           inside, it’s HIS WINNINGS FROM THE STREET RACE.

                                 BRANT
                        All you have to do is drive her.

           Jay can’t take his eyes off the MONEY--it’s the solution to 
           all his problems. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        The authorities are already on 
                        their way.

                                 JAY
                        On their way--here?!

                                 BRANT
                        Don’t stop for anything, don’t get 
                        pulled over and don’t get caught.  

           Jay can hear FAINT SIRENS in the distance.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Do that and the money’s yours, Jay.

           Off Jay’s bewildered face, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR - NIGHT

           THROUGH Wolfe’s WINDSHIELD, we can SEE the HUNTER’S POINT 
           INDUSTRIAL PARK.
                                 MOREAU
                        Tracking beacon on the cruiser says 
                        it’s here.

           Wolfe searches until HE SPOTS BRANT'S BULLET-RIDDLED HCAR 
           parked outside Jay’s building.

                                 WOLFE
                        Run thermal.

           Using a similar device to the one that identified Jay, Moreau 
           scans Brant's car.

                                 MOREAU
                        Two heat signatures.  They’re 
                        inside the car.

                                 WOLFE
                        I want him surrounded--

           Wolfe can no sooner say it than--

           WHOOOOOM!!!  The lights switch ON and Brant's HCar takes off.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        Move!  Move!

           EXT. HUNTER’S POINT 

           Brant's car SPEEDS through the ABANDONED FACTORIES with WOLFE 
           IN HOT PURSUIT.

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

                                 WOLFE
                        Shoot out his discs.

           Moreau nods and grips a targeting joystick as--

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           The Gatling SPINS to life--THWUMP--TWUMP--THWUMP--TWUMP--
           shooting STREAKS OF WHITE LIGHT.

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF BRANT'S HCAR 

           Several BULLETS connect with Brant's LevDiscs.  

           EXT. STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO 

           Brant's HCar loses control and rocks back and forth, 
           descending quickly until--
           CRASH!  SPARKS fly as Brant's car hits the ground, sliding 
           dangerously along the asphalt.  It finally slows to a STOP 
           and the DOT HCars descend around it.

           EXT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           Wolfe cocks his FIREARM and EXITS, never taking his eyes off 
           Brant, slumped over the steering wheel.

           INT. BRANT'S DOT HCAR 

           We SEE WOLFE--gun trained on an unconscious Brant--approach 
           and STOP in front of the passenger window.  He goes from MAD 
           to FURIOUS as he RIPS open the door.

                                 WOLFE
                        Where is she?

           Wolfe grabs Brant and PULLS HIM ONTO THE ASPHALT.

           EXT. STREET 

                                 WOLFE
                        Where the hell is she!?

           Brant's eyes open and he SMILES.  WE PAN UP TO REVEAL:

           EASTWOOD sitting in the back seat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FACTORY - SIMULTANEOUS 

           WHOOOM-ZOOOOOM!!  Betty bursts out the side of Jay’s building 
           and THROTTLES in the opposite direction of Wolfe’s pursuit.

           EXT. BAY SHORE, AERIAL VIEW 

           Betty moves along the shore and turns west onto the BAY 
           BRIDGE toward OAKLAND.

           INT. BETTY 

           Anna sits silently in the passenger seat.  

                                 JAY
                        What the hell is all this about?

           Anna remains silent.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?
                             (more frustrated)
                        Hello?
                                 ANNA
                        He trusted you.  I don’t.

                                 JAY
                        Well, aren’t you a warm, fuzzy 
                        thing?
                             (then)
                        I’m mixed up in this too, Sweetart, 
                        so I’ve got a right to know.

                                 ANNA
                        No you don’t.  People like you only 
                        care about one thing.
                             (picks up the duffle)
                        Now do what you were paid for.

           Jay is flabbergasted.  He takes one last look at Anna before 
           turning to the road.

                                 JAY
                        He didn’t pay me enough for this.

           Betty safely crosses into Oakland.

           EXT. LYNDON TOWER, MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The largest skyscraper in Manhattan, the 140-story LYNDON 
           TOWER, serves as Lyndon Tech’s corporate headquarters.

           What initially appears to be a RED CRISSCROSS ORNAMENTAL 
           DESIGN across the entire building, actually is--

           --A LASER SECURITY GRID.  Nothing gets in or out of this 
           place.  But more on that later.

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE, LYNDON TOWER

           HALF-A-DOZEN SUITS stand with their backs TO US, talking over

                        You have a call.

           A beat.  Then--

                                 LYNDON
                        Thank you, everyone.  It’s been a 
                        long day.  We can continue in the 
                        morning.

           The SUITS quickly shuffle out of the office and Jill closes 
           the door behind them.

           Lyndon becomes serious as he picks up the phone.

                                 LYNDON (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you’re not behind this 
                        accident.

                                 WOLFE (V.O.)
                        The situation has complicated.

           INT. JAY’S LOFT, FACTORY

           Wolfe speaks on the phone while DOZENS of DOT AGENTS search 
           Jay’s loft in the b.g.

                                 LYNDON (V.O.)
                        You’re damn right it’s complicated--

                                 WOLFE
                        Anna White’s been talking to a DOT 
                        agent.

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE, LYNDON TOWER

           Lyndon goes pale, completely speechless.

                                 WOLFE
                        The agent’s been handled, but she’s 
                        disappeared.
                                 LYNDON
                        Disappeared where?

                                 WOLFE
                        Headed to DC. She plans to testify--

                                 LYNDON
                        No.  No.  Anna would never--

                                 WOLFE
                        --You’re wrong.  

           Lyndon takes a beat before:

                                 LYNDON
                        Then you know what to do.

                                 WOLFE
                        It’s going to significantly 
                        increase my share.

                                 LYNDON
                        Just take care of it.

           INT. JAY’S LOFT 

           WOLFE CLICKS OFF the call as Moreau approaches from behind, 
           consulting a TOUCH-SCREEN READER.

                                 MOREAU
                        His name’s Jason Costigan.  We’ve 
                        put a department priority APB out 
                        for him.

                                 WOLFE
                        Costigan?

                                 MOREAU
                        They’re brothers.

           Wolfe is handed the reader.  Jay’s criminal record is on 
           display.  After a quick scan:

                                 WOLFE
                        It says he’s on probation.  Get on 
                        the phone with his P.O. and find 
                        out if he’s been chip’d.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY - NIGHT

           A TORTOISE drags itself across the desert floor.  It hears an 
           approaching HUM and looks up in time to see--
           --ZOOM.  BETTY FLIES OVER HIM and towards--

           --a LEVDISC TURBINE FARM.  Hundreds of 10-story TURBINES 
           tower over the desert with GIANT LEVDISCS in place of 
           windmill spokes.  Betty WEAVES in between them. 

           INT. BETTY

           Jay and Anna riding in silence.  As they clear the LevDisc 
           Turbine farm, Anna spots--

           TWINKLING CITY LIGHTS breaking through the otherwise pitch-
           black landscape.  She points to them.

                                 ANNA
                        That’s not Salt Lake City.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, so you’re talking to me now?

           Anna squints to focus as the lights GROW BRIGHTER.

                                 ANNA
                        That’s not Salt Lake City!

                                 JAY
                        No, it’s Sin City.  They do have a 
                        lake though.

                                 ANNA
                        What the hell are we doing in Las 
                        Vegas!?

                                 JAY
                        Relax.  I have to make a pit stop.

                                 ANNA
                        Brant specifically told you not to 
                        stop for anything.

                                 JAY
                        Well, Brant isn’t here now, is he?

                                 ANNA
                        I knew it--I knew I couldn’t trust 
                        you.  This was a mistake.  Let me 
                        out.

           Anna POUNDS the door of the car.

                                 JAY
                        Let you--are you crazy?  
                                 ANNA
                        Let me out!

                                 JAY
                        Listen!  I owe a very bad man this 
                        bag of money.  If he doesn’t get 
                        it, he will kill me and I think we 
                        can both agree that I drive a whole 
                        lot better when I’m breathing.
                             (trying to calm her)
                        We’ll be there five minutes and get 
                        right back on the road.  Okay?

           Anna shoots Jay an icy stare.

           EXT. VEGAS STRIP 

           TRICKED-OUT HCARS float down the Strip on six levels of 
           floating “lanes”, the neon lights of 80-STORY HIGH-RISE 
           CASINO RESORTS reflected in their windows.  At the end of the 
           Strip, sits the LARGEST of the resorts:

           THE ICARUS.  Imagine the Bellagio on steroids with a 
           WATERFALL running over the entire face of the high-rise, 
           BACKLIT by huge multicolored LCD COLUMNS.

           WE FOLLOW the cascading waterfall INTO what we thought was an 
           enormous pool but is a--

           BOTTOMLESS PIT.  We FALL THROUGH the pit and REALIZE:

           WE’RE FLOATING 4000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  The “GROUNDED” 
           Vegas Strip is below.  

           The Icarus and its surrounding resorts sit on a GIANT 
           HOVERING ISLAND.  Keeping it airborne are HUNDREDS OF 
           SUPERSIZED LEVDISCS about 25 feet in diameter.

           Below us we can SEE a 15-MILLION-GALLON MAN-MADE LAKE where 
           the water from Icarus is collected and used in a SPECTACULAR 
           WATER SHOW on the grounded Vegas Strip.

           BETTY CUTS THROUGH THE FRAME and pulls up toward the floating 
           city above Vegas.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        Ever seen this before?

           INT. BETTY 

           Anna regards the FLOATING VEGAS STRIP with disgust.
                                 ANNA
                        I’m sure it’s precisely what Dr. 
                        Becker had in mind when he invented 
                        the LevDisc.

                                 JAY
                        Mmmm-mmm.  I just want to bottle up 
                        your sweetness and put it on my ice 
                        cream.

           EXT. ICARUS RESORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Betty’s parked in front of Icarus.  Jay exits with his duffle 
           bag and hurries toward the entrance of the resort.  ANNA 
           STARTS AFTER HIM.

                                 JAY
                        Where are you going?

                                 ANNA
                        What’s stopping you from running 
                        off and leaving me?  No.  I’m not 
                        letting you out of my sight. 

           Anna’s resolved.  Jay checks the time.  Shit.

                                 JAY
                        Okay.  Fine.  Let’s go.  Now.

           Anna follows Jay into the LOBBY of the massive resort.  Jay’s 
           so focused on the task at hand that he fails to notice the--

           --SCANNER hidden inside the doorstop.  

           IN SLOW MOTION: Microscopically thin BEAMS of GREEN LIGHT 
           bombard Jay and Anna as they pass through Icarus’ doors.  One 
           LOCKS on a TINY CHIP EMBEDDED IN JAY’S NECK.  

           INT. CASINO SECURITY BOOTH 

           PING!  JAY’S MUG SHOT flashes on one of the dozens of 
           security screens.

           A SECURITY GUARD flags his MANAGER.

                                 CASINO SECURITY GUARD
                        Got a hot one.  Just came through 
                        the front.  He’s chip’d and wanted.
                             (then)
                        Should we move?

           The Manager moves over and looks at the screen.
                                 MANAGER
                        No.  Keep eyes on him and notify 
                        the DOT.

           INT. CASINO FLOOR 

           Jay and Anna pass a HIGH ROLLER on the roulette table.  The 
           High Roller sees Jay and seems to recognize him.

                                 HIGH ROLLER
                        I know you--you’re that dude--

                                 JAY
                        Go shake your dice, pal.

           Jay and Anna hurry through the casino floor and toward the 
           elevators.

                                 HIGH ROLLER
                        You know who that was?

           INT. HALLWAY, ICARUS RESORT 

           Jay raps on a dark maple door marked PENTHOUSE.  Anna’s arms 
           are folded.

                                 JAY
                        Would it kill you to smile?

           The door opens to reveal:

           ROURKE who immediately SNATCHES the duffle bag out of Jay’s 
           hand.

                                 ROURKE
                        Against the wall.

           Rourke manhandles Jay, searching him for a weapon.

                                 JAY
                        I thought you got pinched by the 
                        DOT.

                                 ROURKE
                        I made a deal.  

                                 JAY
                        What’d you give them?

                                 ROURKE
                        Your address.

           Rourke finishes with a PISSED-OFF JAY and moves to search 
           Anna with A LITTLE TOO MUCH ENTHUSIASM.
                                 ROURKE (CONT’D)
                        Your turn, cutie-pie.

           Rourke is about to reach for Anna’s hips when--

                                 ROURKE (CONT’D)
                        Ahhhhhh.

           JAY GRABS ROURKE by the PINKIE and TWISTS it behind his back.  
           With his other hand, Jay SNATCHES THE DUFFLE BAG from Rourke.

                                 JAY
                        If it’s all the same to you, I’d 
                        like to deliver this myself.

                                 TELGANO (O.S.)
                        Is that Mr. Costigan outside my 
                        door?

                                 JAY
                        Hey, Lenny.  Your new guard dog was 
                        nipping at my ladyfriend’s 
                        backside. 

                                 TELGANO (O.S.)
                        Let them in, Rourke.

           Jay releases Rourke and moves Anna into the penthouse.  

                                 JAY
                             (to Rourke)
                        Could you wait here?  The big kids 
                        are going to talk for a little bit.

           INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, ICARUS RESORT 

           Sitting on a large sectional couch we FIND:

           LENNY TELGANO.  Late 60s, Telgano is a thicker Telly Savalas.  
           He’s flanked by a DOZEN ARMED CRONIES.  Behind him, a 
           SPECTACULAR VIEW of the HOVERING VEGAS STRIP.

           Jay ZIPS OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG and DUMPS its contents on the 
           glass coffee table in front of Telgano.

                                 JAY
                        It’s all there.  $250K.

           Telgano nods, then GLANCES AT HIS WATCH: 12:30 AM.

                                 TELGANO
                        Payment’s late.  “Today” ended 30 
                        minutes ago.
                                 JAY
                        Lenny...come on.

                                 TELGANO
                        Rules are rules, kid.  I change 
                        them for you--I’ll have to change 
                        them for everyone.  It’s double 
                        now.

                                 ANNA
                        He’ll have to pay you the rest 
                        later.  

           AGHAST, Jay shoots Anna a “SHUT-THE-F%CK-UP” look.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We have somewhere to be.

                                 TELGANO
                        Is that right?  

           Jay steps in to disarm the situation.

                                 JAY
                        Give me a quick second here, Lenny.

           Jay smiles sheepishly at Telgano, then takes Anna aside.  
           Once out of earshot, Jay ANGRILY WHISPERS:

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Anna JABS Jay in the chest with a POINTED FINGER.

                                 ANNA
                        Five minutes.  You said five 
                        minutes!

                                 JAY
                        See all these gorilla-sized men 
                        with bazooka-shaped bulges in their 
                        jackets?  They’re not here to take 
                        our drink orders.  We’re not going 
                        anywhere.

                                 ANNA
                        We shouldn’t even be here!  

                                 TELGANO (O.S.)
                        You two fight like you’re married.

           To Jay’s chagrin, Anna turns to address Telgano.
                                 ANNA
                        You’re a businessman, right?  Let’s 
                        do business.  What would it take to 
                        get us out of here right now?

           Telgano chews on that thought.  To Jay--

                                 TELGANO
                        You still driving Betty?  

           Jay shifts nervously.

                                 JAY
                        I’m not selling my car.

                                 TELGANO
                        No, no, no...I wouldn’t expect you 
                        would.
                             (then)
                        Tell you what.  How about a little 
                        competition between you and your 
                        friend Rourke?  You win, I waive 
                        your late fee.  You lose, I keep 
                        your car.  Either way, you’re 
                        settled out.

                                 JAY
                        Deal.

           Jay is ALL SMILES.  Anna is PISSED.

                                 ANNA
                        You can’t gamble the one thing we 
                        need.

                                 JAY
                        I’m sorry--wasn’t this your idea, 
                        Miss “Let’s Do Business?”  Besides--
                        Rourke could never take me in a 
                        race.

                                 TELGANO
                        Who said anything about a race?

           JAY’S SMILE EVAPORATES.  OFF his face of DREAD, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF OF ICARUS RESORT - NIGHT

           Jay stands at the PRECIPICE of the high rise, staring down 
           the face of ICARUS’ 5,000 FOOT WATERFALL.
           A TELGANO CRONY hands Jay what resembles an OLYMPIC SKELETON 
           SLED, except instead of steel runners, the sled has a LEVDISC 
           welded to it.  

           There are two handles on the sled: one with a LARGE RED 
           BUTTON jury-rigged on, the other with an ALTIMETER duct taped 
           to it.  The altimeter reads: 5,150 FEET.

           Jay inspects his sled with trepidation as Rourke is handed an 
           IDENTICAL SLED.  

           The Telgano Crony raises a RADIO to his lips.

                                 CRONY
                        Hey, boss--

           EXT. MAN-MADE LAKE 

           TELGANO, ANNA and BETTY wait on the ground A MILE BELOW, next 
           to the MAN-MADE LAKE that serves as the repository for 
           Icarus’ waterfall.  Telgano holds a RADIO.

                                 CRONY (V.O., OVER RADIO)
                        --ready when you are.

           EXT. ROOF OF ICARUS RESORT 

           The Crony lifts his radio so Jay and Rourke can hear.

                                 TELGANO (V.O.)
                        Game is “Chicken”.  You both jump.  
                        First guy to hit the button, turn 
                        on their disc and stop their 
                        descent...is the loser.

           Shit!  This is really happening.  

                                 TELGANO (V.O.)
                        On three.  One--

           Jay TIGHTENS his grips.

                                 TELGANO (V.O.)
                        Two--

           Jay GULPS.

                                 TELGANO (V.O.)
                        Three!

           SLOW MOTION: Jay and Rourke LEAP VERTICALLY OUTWARD, holding 
           their sleds tight to their chests.  Then--GRAVITY STARTS TO 
           TAKE HOLD. 
           JAY’S POV: All Jay can see is RUSHING WATER and then--he 
           crests over the lip of the falls--a vertigo-inducing drop, 
           FOUR TIMES THE HEIGHT OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

           Jay begins to descend and--we’re back to REAL TIME:

           WHOOOSH--Jay and Rourke FREE FALL at 200 feet per second.

           Jay sees the EDGE of the Hovering Island’s “BOTTOMLESS PIT” 
           approaching FAST--and he’s drifting RIGHT TOWARD IT.  HE’S 
           GOT NO CHOICE--

           --Jay HITS the RED BUTTON as the ground rushes at him like a 
           freight train, but--

           NOTHING.  It didn’t work.

           Jay frantically clicks the red button, still nothing.  JAY’S 
           SLED IS RIGGED TO FAIL.

           Jay pushes his body from the sled--still holding on--using 
           the sled to CARVE THROUGH THE AIR just enough to-- 

           --ZOOOMP--clear the edge of the opening by inches.

           JAY PASSES THROUGH THE OPENING and is spit out the other 
           side.  Jay looks at his ALTIMETER:

           3,700 FEET

           Jay turns to ROURKE--it’s his ONLY CHANCE.  

           Jay steers his descent, moving toward ROURKE.  30 feet, 20 
           feet, 10 FEET AWAY--Jay reaches for Rourke’s sled.

           Rourke turns to see Jay approaching.  Just as Jay is ABOUT TO 
           GRAB HOLD of Rourke’s sled--

                                 ROURKE
                        See ya in hell.

           --CLICK.  Rourke hits his red button.

           SWOOOOSH!  WE SAIL PAST HIM at 200 miles per hour as he 
           shoots upwards and we CONTINUE OUR DEATH SPIRAL. 

           EXT. MAN-MADE LAKE 

           Looking up, Anna can see Jay continue to drop as ROURKE PULLS 
           UP.  She leaps off her feet, THRILLED.
                                 ANNA
                        The other guy pulled up!  
                             (to Telgano)
                        That means we win.

           Telgano can only LAUGH as Anna realizes: JAY’S SCREWED.

           BACK WITH JAY--SPEEDING TO HIS DEATH--

           Think fast, think fast, think--Jay DIGS his fingers into the 
           shell of his sled’s handle and PRIES, but no give.

                                 JAY
                        Come on.

           2,000 FEET

           --CRACK--CRACK--the handle splits open and Jay sees the WIRE 
           inside has been CUT.

           1,500 FEET

           The ground is RAPIDLY APPROACHING as Jay SCRAMBLES to 
           reattach the wires.  

           1,000 FEET

           JAY HOLDS THE TWO ENDS OF THE WIRE TOGETHER with one hand and 
           reaches to PRESS THE RED BUTTON with the other, now 
           COMPLETELY UN-TETHERED FROM THE SLED.

           500 FEET

           Jay FRANTICALLY HITS THE RED BUTTON--still NOTHING--he 
           readjusts his finger on the severed wires with only--

           200 FEET

           --to go--LAST CHANCE--Jay grips the wires firmly between his 
           fingers and hits the red button again.  A SPARK as Jay hears 
           a HUM and-- 

           THE LEVDISC SWITCHES ON.  Jay SLOWS substantially, almost 
           coming to a completely stop.  ALMOST.

           SPLASH!!!  JAY HITS THE SURFACE OF THE MAN-MADE LAKE, 
           generating an enormous COLUMN OF WATER.

           A long, nervous HUSH silences everyone, until--

           JAY SURFACES to the sound of APPLAUSE coming from VEGAS 
           TOURISTS WHO assume it’s all part of the show.  

           Jay offers them a WAVE, then starts toward:
           A VERY PISSED-OFF TELGANO.  Jay and Telgano’s eyes are LOCKED 
           as Jay reaches the shore.

           CLANG!  Jay throws the SOAKING-WET LEVDISC SLED on the ground 
           at Telgano’s feet.

                                 JAY
                        You may want to have someone take a 
                        look at that.

           A long tense beat.  Telgano’s Cronies reach into their 
           jackets, but Telgano stops them, gesturing towards the--

           --TOURISTS watching closely.  

                                 TELGANO
                             (to Jay)
                        You keep it.

           Jay picks up the sled and tosses it into the back of Betty.  
           He motions for Anna to get in.

           Jay never takes his eyes off Telgano as Anna moves into the 
           passenger seat.

                                 JAY
                        See you ‘round, Lenny.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay slides into the driver’s seat.  

           BIG SIGH.  It takes everything he’s got to say--

                                 JAY
                        I’m sorry.  You were right.     

           Anna nods almost imperceptibly, acknowledging the apology.  
           Jay STARTS UP Betty and TAKES OFF.

           EXT. “GROUNDED” VEGAS STRIP 

           Betty merges into the Strip’s traffic.

           A BLACK OBJECT DROPS INTO FRAME, OBSCURING OUR VIEW.  The 
           Object ACCELERATES and we are able to SEE what it is:

           A STINGRAY “HOVERCOPTER”.  Four times the size of an HCar, 
           the Stingray looks like a V-22 OSPREY with massive 
           reverberating 15-foot-wide LevDiscs on pivots flanking its 
           sides.  It’s FASTER and MORE POWERFUL than any HCar.

           “DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TACTICAL STRIKE TEAM” is 
           adhered to its side.
           INT. STINGRAY

           Wolfe rides shotgun, wearing a mic’d headset.

                                 WOLFE
                        I have eyes on the package.  
                        Tactical ground team, you are a 
                        “go” to move in.

           INT. BETTY

           Jay drives casually down the Strip when:

                                 ANNA
                        Look out!!

           A DOT HCAR speeds toward Betty to RAM him.  Jay SWERVES to 
           avoid COLLIDING, only to now face:

           DOZENS of HCars approaching from every angle.

                                 JAY
                        We’re made.

           Jay shifts and THRUSTS FULL REVERSE--

                                 ANNA
                        I told you!!  I told you!

                                 JAY
                        Let’s say we raincheck you telling 
                        me again.

           EXT. BETTY 

           SPEEDING IN REVERSE--Betty narrowly SLIPS INBETWEEN two DOT 
           HCars, heading straight for a collision with a THIRD.

           INT. BETTY 

           On his touch-screen diagnostic, Jay shuts all LevDisc power 
           OFF and--

           EXT. “GROUNDED” VEGAS STRIP 

           --DROPS through three lanes of aerial traffic.  Rushing to 
           their death, inches from hitting the ground.

           INT. BETTY 

           Anna SCREAMS before--Jay switches all six discs BACK ON--
           EXT. “GROUNDED” VEGAS STRIP

           WHUMMMMMMM!  The LEVDISCS GLOW BACK TO LIFE and Betty levels, 
           just grazing the black asphalt under it.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay shifts into high speed and ROARS underneath the lanes of 
           traffic as--

           EXT. “GROUNDED” VEGAS STRIP 

           --the DOT regroup to pursue.  

           Jay snakes in and out of traffic, making impossible hairpin 
           turns.  He leads the ARMY OF DOT HCARS on a wild goose chase 
           around the Strip, swerving into the valet of--

           EXT. MGM GRAND 

           --the MGM Grand.  Tourists hit the deck as Jay and the 
           chasing DOT HCars SCREECH through.  But when Jay emerges on 
           the other side--

           WOLFE’S STINGRAY is there blocking his path.  The stingray’s 
           SIDE DOOR SLIDES OPEN to reveal:

           BRANT.  Bloodied and bound.  Wolfe holds him at gunpoint.

           Jay swerves to a STOP, his eyes fixed on his suffering 
           brother.  Wolfe has to SHOUT over the VIBRATION of the 
           stingray’s discs.

                                 WOLFE
                        Get out of the car!

           INT. BETTY

           Jay’s hand clenches his door handle.

                                 WOLFE
                        Out of the car or your brother 
                        dies!

           Anna’s eyes go wide, “brother”?  She can no sooner process 
           this bombshell before--

           Jay pulls the handle and--

           EXT. BETTY 

           --EXITS, shielding his body behind his door.
                                 WOLFE
                        I’m going to make this as simple as 
                        possible.  Him for her.  

                                 BRANT
                        He’ll kill me either way.

           Brant WINCES as Wolfe drives the nose of his pistol into his 
           bullet wound.

                                 WOLFE
                        What say you, Jay? 

           Jay looks at a terrified Anna inside his car, to Brant, who 
           shakes his head “Don’t do it”.

           Wolfe CLICKS back the hammer.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        Last chance.

                                 BRANT
                        Jay.  Finish this for me.

           Jay can’t takes his eyes off his brother, who musters a SMALL 
           SMILE and an encouraging NOD before-- 

           Brant DIVES for the--

           INT. STINGRAY 

           --STINGRAY’S CYCLIC and YANKS IT HARD LEFT.  WOLFE IS FLUNG 
           FROM THE VEHICLE as--

           EXT. STINGRAY 

           --the Stingray FLIPS ON ITS SIDE and COLLIDES with the side 
           of the MGM Grand-- 

           BA-BOOOOM, it EXPLODES!  Debris of the Stingray RICOCHETS in 
           every direction.

                                 JAY
                        No. 

           BULLETS FLY AT JAY, compliments of the DOT Agents scrambling 
           to stabilize the situation.

           Jay is PULLED BACK into his car as--

           --a BULLET nearly takes his head off.
           INT. BETTY

           Anna PULLS Jay into his seat, having just saved his life.

                                 ANNA
                        Drive!  DRIVE!!

           Still in shock, Jay struggles to shift into drive and 
           ACCELERATE OUT OF THE FIREFIGHT.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We need to get out of the city.

           Anna points at a MAP on Jay’s diagnostic screen.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Here.  Go here.

           Jay looks at her with disbelief.

                                 JAY
                        We can’t navigate that.

           Anna reaches for the CAR DASH and looks for a SEAM.  She 
           FINDS IT and--

           --RIIIIIIP--PULLS BACK THE DASH, exposing the HIGH-TECH 
           INNARDS of Betty.  Anna plugs a HANDHELD COMPUTER into 
           Betty’s CPU and goes to work.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m handling it!! Just drive!!

           EXT. STREETS OF LAS VEGAS 

           Wolfe pushes a DOT Agent out of the way, grabs the wheel of 
           his HCar and--BOWMMMMM--takes off after Jay.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF VEGAS 

           Betty cruises through the desert outside Vegas.  It ZOOMS 
           past us and--seconds later--

           --DOT HCars appear in pursuit.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON - AERIAL VIEW - PRE DAWN

           The MORNING LIGHT creeps over the horizon as Betty approaches 
           the MOUTH of--

           THE GRAND CANYON.
           INT. BETTY

           Anna hurriedly works, entering what appears to be ENCRYPTED 
           CODE into the ONBOARD COMPUTER.

                                 JAY
                        What now?

                                 ANNA
                        Drop in.

                                 JAY
                        We’ll die.

                                 ANNA
                        We’ll die if we don’t.

           EXT. MOUTH OF GRAND CANYON

           Betty PLUNGES into the Canyon and--

           SWERVES WILDLY OUT OF CONTROL once it hovers over the rushing 
           COLORADO RIVER, the same way it did when Jay dropped into the 
           San Francisco Bay.

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

                                 DOT AGENT (V.O.)
                        He just went into the Canyon sir.

                                 WOLFE
                        Go after him.

                                 DOT AGENT (V.O.)
                        But--we can’t--the river--

                                 WOLFE
                        GO!

           EXT. MOUTH OF GRAND CANYON

           Several DOT HCars follow Jay into the canyon and IMMEDIATELY 
           LOSE CONTROL over the water.

           INT. DOT HCAR 

           A DOT Agent scrambles to steer his car and FAILS--

           EXT. GRAND CANYON

           --his out of control HCar slides into another HCar and both 
           plow into--
           --THE CANYON WALL.  The cars EXPLODE on impact.  ZOOOOOM! 
           Wolfe manages to avoid the explosion, zipping straight 
           through it UNSCATHED.

           INT. BETTY 

           Through his rear view mirror, Jay can see Wolfe and three 
           surviving HCars approaching.

           Anna’s screen reads LOADING...LOADING...LOADING...

                                 ANNA
                        Almost there.

           EXT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           Wolfe’s GATLING GUN SPINS TO LIFE, firing on Jay, who--

           EXT. BETTY 

           --is unable to maneuver around its deadly projectiles. 

           INT. BETTY

           Anna’s screen reads, “UPLOAD COMPLETE” as--

           --JAY LOSES CONTROL and SKIDS too far to the right.

           EXT. BETTY 

           SCRAAAPE!  Betty gets completely RIPPED UP.  Two of Betty’s 
           LevDiscs are SHATTERED in the collision.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay manages to pull away from the wall before the car is 
           totalled.

                                 ANNA
                        Listen.  I uploaded a program 
                        that’ll allow your discs to 
                        maneuver over water.  We need to 
                        reboot the onboard computer.

                                 JAY
                        Reboot?!  We’ll crash!

                                 ANNA
                        We should come back online before 
                        hitting the canyon floor--
                        hopefully.

           WHOOSH--WHOOSH--WHOOSH--BULLETS fly by Jay’s window.
                                 JAY
                        Do it already!!!

           Anna PRESSES the RESET OVERRIDE button.  Every light in the 
           car goes DARK.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON 

           SILENCE as the LevDiscs shut down.  Betty continues forward, 
           but it is rapidly falling down, DOWN, DOWN--

           INT. BETTY 

           The ground is rapidly approaching as Anna stares at the blank 
           diagnostic screen.

                                 ANNA
                        Oh God please...please...

           At the last possible second--the lights and screens all FLASH 
           TO LIFE and--

           --WHURRRRRRRRRR--so do the LevDiscs.  Jay LEVELS OUT the car.  
           He steers right and--surprisingly--so does Betty.  Despite 
           flying over water, Jay has FULL CONTROL.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t believe it.

           Jay shifts the car into HIGH GEAR and--

           EXT. GRAND CANYON 

           --ACCELERATES at full speed through the canyon.  Wolfe and 
           the DOT try to follow, but--

           CAN’T.  The increased speed causes them to lose control and 
           SLAM INTO THE CANYON WALLS.

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           Wolfe struggles in his damaged HCar.  He’s barely able to GET 
           PARALLEL with the ground and CRASH LAND.

           EXT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           Wolfe drags himself out of his car just in time to see Betty 
           rounding a bend in the serpentine canyon.

           Wolfe draws his FIREARM and shoots, DRAINING EVERY BULLET IN 
           THE CHAMBER, but--

           --IT’S TOO LATE.  They’ve DISAPPEARED from sight.
           FURIOUS, Wolfe hurls his gun at the Canyon wall.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay pulls up out of the canyon and ZIPS into the desert.

           EXT. GILA CLIFF DWELLINGS, NEW MEXICO - DAWN

           The RED MORNING SUN casts its light on:

           THE GILA CLIFF DWELLINGS.  A large cliff face with the RUINS 
           of interlinked MOGOLLON CAVE HOMES built inside GIANT 
           ALCOVES.  An ancient 14th-century city.

           When the DAMAGED BETTY floats into one of the larger alcoves, 
           it creates a surreal juxtaposition of past and future.

           INT. CLIFF ALCOVE

           Jay exits and COLLAPSES against a wall, physically and 
           emotionally drained.  Anna slowly follows him out.  BEAT.

           Jay stares daggers at Anna.  

                                 JAY
                        Tell me why my brother is dead.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t want you to be sorry, I 
                        want you to explain to me why your 
                        life is more important than his.

           The weight of that statement hits Anna hard.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m the chief designer of the 
                        NexGen SmartDisc.  Six months ago, 
                        your brother contacted me.  The DOT 
                        had approved the NexGen for public 
                        use, but he noticed an unforeseen 
                        problem.  You see, in order to 
                        install restrictors that would 
                        prevent speeding and aerial 
                        collisions, I had to alter the 
                        original LevDisc design.
                             (beat)
                        Your brother knew that street 
                        racers would inevitably try to hack 
                        the discs to remove the 
                        restrictors.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                        So three colleagues and I created a 
                        decryption algorithm to see if it 
                        was even possible.

                                 JAY
                        Was it?

                                 ANNA
                        Yes.  And when the hacked NexGen 
                        was pushed to full speed, it did 
                        something that none of us 
                        anticipated.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ANNA
                        The disc emitted an electromagnetic 
                        pulse--an EMP.  It fries anything 
                        electrical in its vicinity.  An 
                        HCar will fall--
                             (she snaps)
                        --like that.  The EMP that the 
                        NexGen emitted was huge.  Big 
                        enough to drop every LevDisc for a 
                        one-mile radius.
                             (beat)
                        I took this to Gareth Lyndon, our 
                        CEO.  I gave him our decryption 
                        algorithm and showed him how deadly 
                        it could be.  He promised to take 
                        care of it, personally.

                                 JAY
                        But he didn’t.

           Anna shakes her head.  This next part’s the hardest.

                                 ANNA
                        Yesterday, the three colleagues who 
                        helped me develop the decryption 
                        algorithm were murdered in what was 
                        made to look like a car accident.  
                        Lyndon paid the DOT to sweep his 
                        problems away.  
                             (then)
                        If I don’t get to DC and testify, 
                        Safer Skies will pass and every car 
                        in America will ride on NexGens.  
                        The first kid who hacks one will 
                        turn his car into a bomb.  On a 
                        busy street, the EMP blast radius 
                        of one hacked disc will kill 
                        thousands.
           Jay processes this.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t understand, if Lyndon knows 
                        this is going to happen--even if he 
                        doesn’t care about the body count--
                        he’s gotta know this’ll destroy 
                        him. Lawsuits, jail--

                                 ANNA
                        The hack is an aftermarket 
                        modification.  Legally speaking, he 
                        won’t be at fault.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ANNA
                        Lyndon’s leveraged his entire 
                        empire on the NexGen LevDiscs.  He 
                        pulls the plug--he’s done anyway.  
                        He’s desperate and that’s what 
                        makes him so dangerous.
                             (then)
                        As soon as the bill passes, Lyndon 
                        stock triples.  He could cash out 
                        for billions and run before the 
                        first disc sells.  

                                 JAY
                        He gets rich while people die.

           Anna moves to Jay, KNEELING in front of him.  Jay is deep in 
           thought.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Brant knew I would have been the 
                        first guy to try and hack one.  
                        That’s why--  

           Jay stops.  His eyes rise to meet Anna’s.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        He had my number and was looking 
                        out for me--same as he always did.  

                                 ANNA
                        He also believed you were the only 
                        person who could get me to DC.  The 
                        only person he could trust.
                             (then)
                        Was he right?
           We HOLD ON a contemplative Jay, before we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, ICARUS RESORT 

           A PISSED OFF Telgano looks right at us.  Beat.

                                 WOLFE (O.C.)
                        What you do is none of my business--

           WHIP PAN TO:

           WOLFE, seated and leaning forward.

                                 WOLFE
                        I don’t know about it, I don’t want 
                        to know about it.

                                 TELGANO
                             (beat)
                        So what do you want to know about?

           Wolfe smiles.

                                 WOLFE
                        I want to know every associate, 
                        every hideout, every asset Costigan 
                        has between here and DC.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING

           Morning light casts over this Capitol Hill office building.

                                 TRAINER (V.O.)
                        Move it, move it, move it!

           INT. GYM, RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

           REPRESENTATIVE MCCALE slumps over the handles of her BIKE in 
           a SPINNING CLASS.  LCD WALLS show a REDWOOD LANDSCAPE 
           speeding by, simulating their crusing through it.

                                 MCCALE
                        I have a heart attack, it’s your 
                        fault.

                                 STAFFER
                        Congresswoman--

           McCale looks up from her bike to see: a serious-faced  
           CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER at the front of the room.  
           INT. HALLWAY, RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

           McCale (still in sweats) and her Staffer stand out as they 
           walk quickly, passing CONGRESSMEN and LOBBYISTS.

                                 STAFFER
                        We thought it was a joke, but after 
                        about two minutes we knew the call 
                        was legit.

           McCale and her Staffer move into--

           INT. MCCALE’S CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           McCale goes straight to her desk and picks up the phone.

                                 MCCALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Dr. White?

           INT. CLIFF ALCOVE - DAY

           Anna stands at the edge of the alcove, wearing an inner ear 
           mobile device.  INTERCUT.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes.

                                 MCCALE
                        My staff debriefed me on your 
                        conversation with them.  Your 
                        testimony will swing the pendulum 
                        in our favor.

                                 ANNA
                        It better.

                                 MCCALE
                        The bill goes to vote in two days.  
                        I’d like to send someone out to get 
                        you--

                                 ANNA
                        Absolutely not.  

                                 MCCALE
                        I’m sorry--?

                                 ANNA
                        There’s no one you can send that 
                        I’ll go with.  FBI, US Marshals--
                        doesn’t matter.  Lyndon’s already 
                        got control of the largest agency 
                        in the federal government--
                                 MCCALE
                        But--

                                 ANNA
                        I made it this far without your 
                        help, I’m not about to be stopped 
                        because of it.

                                 MCCALE
                        Fair enough.  Are you alone?

                                 ANNA
                        I have a driver.

                                 MCCALE
                        And you think you can trust him?

           Anna pauses a long beat.

           INT. CLIFF ALCOVE - LATER

           Anna approaches Betty and sees JAY’S FEET sticking out from 
           underneath.

           INT. UNDERSIDE OF BETTY

           Jay shines a flashlight on the MANGLED LEVDISCS.  One falls 
           apart in Jay’s hand as he tries to piece it together.  

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        How bad?

           EXT. BETTY 

           Jay slides out from under Betty holding the PIECES OF A 
           SHATTERED LEVDISC.

                                 ANNA
                        That bad.

                                 JAY
                        Can’t make it rest of the way like 
                        this.

                                 ANNA
                             (probing)
                        The rest of the way?

                                 JAY
                             (beat)
                        I’m taking you to DC.  

           Anna sighs relief.
                                 ANNA
                        Thank you.

           Jay nods, deflecting, as he turns to Betty.

                                 JAY
                        We can’t go to a shop.  They’ll be 
                        looking for this car.  Which means--

                                 ANNA
                        What?

                                 JAY
                        There’s only one place we can go.  

                                 ANNA
                        It’s safe?

           Jay rises, dusting himself off.

                                 JAY
                        Depends on your perspective.

           EXT. DOLORES, COLORADO - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

           Betty labors over DRY GRASSLANDS covered in a light dusting 
           of SNOW.

           In the distance, we can SEE a SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN that time 
           forgot in the shadow of the towering SNOW CAPPED ROCKY 
           MOUNTAINS.  

           EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

           Smoke pours from the chimney of a humble DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER, 
           sitting nestled in the bosom of rolling hills.  In the 
           distance--

           MOUNT WILSON, a 14,000-foot behemoth and the largest of the 
           surrounding peaks.

           Next to the trailer is a corrugated metal INDUSTRIAL GARAGE.  
           Large enough to fit over a dozen HCars.  

           INT. TRAILER HOME 

           A GRIZZLED MAN in his 60s sips from a cup of black coffee as 
           thick as mud.  His mostly grey beard is long enough to cover 
           the first two buttons of his insulated flannel.

           He hears the HUM of a LevDisc and parts a yellowing curtain 
           to see:

           BETTY COMING IN FOR A LANDING.
                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Son’ bitch.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay shuts Betty down.  Anna takes a long look at her 
           Deliverance-esque surroundings as THE GRIZZLED MAN OPENS HIS 
           DOOR, exiting the trailer home. 

                                 JAY
                        Well, he doesn’t appear to have a 
                        gun.  That’s a good sign.

           Almost on cue, the Grizzled Man slings a HUGE AX over his 
           shoulder.

                                 ANNA
                        Isn’t there someplace else we can 
                        go?

                                 JAY
                        If there was--we’d be there.

           EXT. BETTY - CONTINUOUS

           Jay and Anna exit Betty.

                                 JAY
                        Harlan.

                                 HARLAN (GRIZZLED MAN)
                        ‘The hell you want?

                                 JAY
                        Sorry to do this to you, but I need 
                        some new discs and a spot to work.  

                                 HARLAN
                        How much money you got?

                                 JAY
                        I can pay you back.

                                 HARLAN
                             (dripping with sarcasm)
                        You’ve always been a man of your 
                        word.
                             (to Anna)
                        Miss, I recommend you run before 
                        you’re another casualty in his 
                        tornado of destruction.

           Anna mouthes a silent “ouch”.
                                 JAY
                        A simple ”Sorry can’t help you” 
                        would also have sufficed.  We’ll be 
                        on our way.

           Jay about to pull up stakes, when--

                                 HARLAN
                        You break my tools, I’ll kill you.

           Jay looks surprised at Harlan.

                                 HARLAN
                        And after you’re done--I don’t ever 
                        want to see you again.

           Harland returns to the trailer and SLAMS the door. 

           INT. HARLAN’S GARAGE - LATER

           Jay has Betty on lifts and has removed the damaged discs.

           The trunk is open and the LEVDISC SLED from Vegas lies on the 
           floor.

           Jay puts a BRAND-NEW LEVDISC into place, then uses a 
           FUTURISTIC PNEUMATIC RIVETER to--WRRRZIIP--THUD--SHOOT a 
           FASTENER into it.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE GARAGE

           Anna explores her surroundings.  Several HCars are covered in 
           dusty tarps.  A vintage HCar sits half assembled on the 
           floor.  Anna sees:

           The REAR WALL of the garage is covered in RACING NEWSPAPER 
           CLIPPINGS, NASCAR-style HCAR RACING POSTERS, cross-
           promotional soft drink and racing ADVERTISEMENTS.  

           All share ONE THING in common: 

           JAY’S IMAGE IS ALL OVER THEM.  He’s ten years younger, but--
           it’s definitely him.  

           Anna scans the headlines: “Rookie Jason Costigan Wins 
           Nationals”, “Costigan Youngest IHCAR World Champ Ever”, 
           “Drink Coke For a Chance To Win a Jason Costigan Poster”.

           BACK WITH JAY

           --who fits a replacement LevDisc in place. 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        You used to be a big deal.
           Jay turns to see--

           --ANNA, HOLDING A NEWSPAPER CLIPPING.

                                 JAY
                        Used to be.

           Jay fires a FASTENER BOLT into the new LevDisc.

                                 ANNA
                        And?

                                 JAY
                        And what?

                                 ANNA
                        How do you go from world champion 
                        to fugitive in 10 years?

                                 JAY
                        May I remind you, you’re a fugitive 
                        too.

                                 ANNA
                        So, are you going to tell me?

                                 JAY
                        Why are you so curious?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m a scientist--I’m interested in 
                        how things work.  How people work--
                             (little self-conscious)
                        --they’ve always been a mystery to 
                        me.

           Jay stands for a beat, thinks.

                                 JAY
                        I was making money.  A lot.  But I 
                        was a stupid teenager and spending 
                        it faster than I could earn it.  
                        Telgano came to me and offered me a 
                        bag of cash to throw a race.  So I 
                        took it.
                             (beat)
                        I got caught and was kicked out of 
                        racing.  
                             (nodding to the trailer)
                        Harlan was my crew chief.  Didn’t 
                        know anything about the bribe.  But 
                        he was finished too. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        When it was all said and done, I 
                        had no career, no source of income, 
                        no friends and--since the race 
                        never happened--I owed Telgano the 
                        money from throwing the race plus 
                        the millions he lost taking bets 
                        against me.

                                 ANNA
                        And you’re still paying him back.

                                 JAY
                        Ten years of illegal street races, 
                        living in squalor and giving every 
                        penny to him.

                                 ANNA
                        Where was Brant in this?

                                 JAY
                        We were foster kids--no money for 
                        the racing start-up costs--so Brant 
                        dropped out of school and started 
                        working to support me.  We built--
                             (re: Betty)
                        --her with a frame we found in a 
                        junkyard and some secondhand 
                        LevDiscs.  When I finally made it 
                        big, it was like he had made it 
                        too.  But then--after--
                             (this turns his stomach)
                        He didn’t have to say a word, I 
                        could see how disappointed he was.  
                        Every time he looked at me, he saw 
                        my failure.  So I stayed as far 
                        away as possible.

           Anna looks at Jay with a new light.  He’s a man who’s been 
           paying for one mistake for his entire life.

                                 ANNA
                        It could be worse.

                                 JAY
                        I doubt that.

                                 ANNA
                        You could be me.

           Jay’s puzzled.
                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I took the greatest gift ever given 
                        to this world and turned it into an 
                        instrument of death.  Try living 
                        with that.

           For the first time, we can really see how heavily this weighs 
           on her.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I thought I could help protect 
                        people.

           She half laughs at the irony, then turns somber again.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Richard Becker was my professor at 
                        MIT.  He taught us that it was our 
                        responsibility to create technology 
                        that would improve society, never 
                        exploit it.  
                             (then)
                        If he could see me now.  I’m 
                        responsible for destroying 
                        everything he built.

                                 JAY
                        No.  You tried to do something 
                        good.  Turns out it wasn’t what you 
                        thought.  I cheated.  Betrayed 
                        trust.  All you ever did was try to 
                        help.

           Anna appreciates hearing this more than Jay could know.  Her 
           eyes well with tears.

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you.

           Jay instinctively pulls Anna into an embrace.  

           We PULL AWAY from this intimate moment of trust and 
           vulnerability.

           EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAINS - DAY

           The SUN IS BLOTTED out by dark STORM CLOUDS rolling in.  

           EXT. HARLAN’S GARAGE

           Jay exits the garage as SNOW BEGINS TO FALL, quickly 
           accumulating on his head and shoulders.
           EXT. HARLAN’S TRAILER

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.  The curtain pulls back.  We SEE Harlan’s 
           eye poke out.

                                 JAY
                        Can we talk?

                                 HARLAN
                        I ain’t got words for you.

           Harlan pushes the curtain over the window.

                                 JAY
                        I got words for you.

           Jay waits and then--KNOCKS AGAIN in ONE LONG CONTINUOUS 
           KNOCK.  Finally THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.

                                 HARLAN
                        You fixin’ to get a black eye?

                                 JAY
                        I want to talk to you for a minute--

                                 HARLAN
                        Where’s the girl?

                                 JAY
                        Sleeping.  Please.  Can I come in?

           Harlan walks away from the door and takes a seat in a 
           weathered recliner, LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN.  Not a welcome, 
           but not a kick to the curb either.

                                 HARLAN
                        Well?

                                 JAY
                        I came to say sorry.  

           Jay searches for the words.  The silence becomes awkward.  

                                 HARLAN
                        You clearly don’t apologize much 
                        because you really suck at it.

                                 JAY
                        I know I let you down, I know I let 
                        my brother down.  And--I hate 
                        myself for it.  I carry my mistake 
                        with me every day.
                                 HARLAN
                        You’re not the only one carrying 
                        it.

                                 JAY
                        I know.  I’m sorry, Harlan. 

           Harlan is trying like hell not to betray any emotion while 
           Jay--not a well-practiced acknowledger of blame--isn’t sure 
           what else to say.

                                 HARLAN
                        You done?

                                 JAY
                        I guess so.  

           Jay heads toward the door.  

                                 HARLAN
                        You have to go.

                                 JAY
                        Can we wait for this storm to blow 
                        over?

                                 HARLAN
                        You don’t understand.  You have to 
                        go now.  Right now.

           Jay faces Harlan.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Guy named Wolfe called before you 
                        got here.  Told me to let ‘em know 
                        if you showed up.
                             (defensively)
                        What was I supposed to do?

           HOLY SHIT!  Jay SPRINTS FOR THE DOOR.

           INT. HARLAN’S GARAGE 

           Jay runs into the garage and LOWERS BETTY.  Asleep in the 
           passenger seat, Anna starts to WAKE.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JAY
                        DOT’s on their way.

           Anna quickly TENSES as Jay moves to the driver’s door--and is 
           about to power up Betty when--
           --he hears a LOUD HUM, growing increasingly LOUDER.

                                 ANNA
                        What is that?

           Jay exits Betty and looks out the window:  

           THREE STINGRAY HOVERCOPTERS surround the property.  THERE’S 
           NO ESCAPE.  

                                 JAY
                        Find a place to hide.

                                 ANNA
                        What about you?

                                 JAY
                        First chance you get, I want you to 
                        take off.  Get to DC.

                                 ANNA
                        Jay--

           But he’s already heading out the door.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Jay!!

           EXT. HARLAN’S PROPERTY 

           It’s now a FULL-BLOWN BLIZZARD as--  

           TWO STINGRAY HOVERCOPTERS ARMED TO THE TEETH land outside the 
           garage with the THIRD CHOPPER remaining in air to prevent a 
           potential escape.

           SNOW BLOWS in every direction from the force of the 
           Stingray’s discs.

           The doors to the garage OPEN and JAY EMERGES, hands raised in 
           surrender.

           INT. STINGRAY (ON GROUND) 

           Wolfe watches Jay exit.

                                 WOLFE 
                        Hold your fire.  Keep your weapons 
                        hot.

           Wolfe takes off his headset and exits the Stingray.
           EXT. HARLAN’S PROPERTY 

           Jay and Wolfe march toward each other like cowboys in a 
           western.  Stingrays continue to HUM LOUDLY in the b.g.

                                 WOLFE
                        Where is she?

                                 JAY
                        Probably in DC by now.

                                 WOLFE
                             (to his men)
                        Search the buildings!

           Moreau leads EIGHT DOT SWAT AGENTS out of the Stingrays.

                                 JAY
                        Wasting your time.  My car wrecked 
                        in the canyon.  We lifted another 
                        one in Phoenix and she took off.  

           INT. GARAGE 

           Anna spies through the garage window.  The Agents comb the 
           property with Moreau HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD HER.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Haven’t seen her in hours.

           There’s no escape and Anna knows it.

                                 WOLFE (O.S.)
                        If she’s really gone, then I guess 
                        I can go ahead and kill you.

           Anna spots the PNEUMATIC RIVETER Jay was using to attach the 
           LevDisc. 

           EXT. HARLAN’S PROPERTY 

           Jay continues to stand his ground.

                                 JAY
                        That’s what cowards do, right?  
                        Shoot unarmed men.  

           Wolfe moves up and gets in Jay’s face.

                                 WOLFE
                        Your brother’s blood is on your 
                        hands amigo.  You had your chance 
                        to save him.  
           WOLFE IS ABOUT TO END JAY, when he suddenly stops--

           WHIP PAN TO:

           ANNA.  She holds the pneumatic riveter tightly, POINTED 
           DIRECTLY AT THE CENTER OF--

           HER OWN CHEST.

                                 JAY
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANNA
                             (to Wolfe)
                        Tell your men to get back.

                                 WOLFE
                        Why would I do that?

           She TIGHTENS HER GRIP around the riveter. She’s serious.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m pretty certain Lyndon would 
                        have given you orders not to hurt 
                        me.

           Wolfe looks at Anna’s hand, specifically the PALE WHITE BAND 
           around her RING FINGER.

                                 WOLFE
                        I believe you lose protection 
                        rights when you call off the 
                        wedding.

                                 JAY
                        What’s he talking about?

                                 WOLFE
                        You didn’t know you were driving 
                        around Gareth Lyndon’s former bride-
                        to-be?  

           Anna CLICKS the pneumatic riveter ON and we hear it GROAN as 
           it collects compressed air, READY TO FIRE. 

           Wolfe squirms a little.  Anna’s clearly got his number.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

                                 ANNA
                        You and your men get back into the 
                        Stingrays and we’ll all leave 
                        together.
                                 WOLFE
                        Your chauffeur too?

                                 ANNA
                        He stays.

                                 WOLFE
                        What have you told him?

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing.  He has a record and he’s 
                        been paid for his trouble.  He’s 
                        got no reason to go to the 
                        authorities. 

           Wolfe and Moreau exchange a look.  

                                 WOLFE
                        We’re moving out.

           The confused SWAT crew hesitates.

                                 MOREAU
                        You heard him.  Move!

           Everyone moves into the Stingrays until all that remain on 
           the ground are JAY, ANNA and WOLFE.  

           Jay watches Anna as she passes him.  Anna won’t make eye 
           contact.  She WHISPERS to Jay: 

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t watch you die for my 
                        mistakes.

           Anna continues toward the Stingray.  

                                 WOLFE
                             (to Jay)
                        I hope for your sake I never see or 
                        hear anything about you ever again. 

                                 JAY
                             (f%ck you)
                        Don’t bet on it.

           Pneumatic riveter still to her chest, Anna boards the 
           Stingray, Wolfe following her.

           Jay watches as all THREE STINGRAYS lift and head toward the 
           ROCKY MOUNTAINS.  As soon as they do--

           JAY RUNS FOR THE GARAGE.
           Harlan exits the trailer and takes off after him.

           INT. GARAGE 

           Jay gets into Betty as Harlan enters the garage.  Harlan 
           starts into the car.

                                 JAY
                        Don’t even--

                                 HARLAN
                        Just shut up.

           Harlan gets into the passenger seat.

                                 HARLAN
                        You can’t do this without me and 
                        you know it.  

           Off Jay’s look of acceptance, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Anna holds the riveter to her chest as Wolfe sits down across 
           from her, and--

           --RIPS the riveter FROM HER HANDS.

           The Agents immediately move and restrain her.  Helplessly 
           pinned by FOUR AGENTS, she--

           SPITS in Wolfe’s face.  Wolfe SNEERS, looking into the 
           chamber of the riveter--it’s EMPTY.  

                                 WOLFE
                        Send chopper one back.  Kill 
                        Costigan.  Level the grounds.  

                                 ANNA
                        NO!

           INT. COCKPIT, STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           The STINGRAY PILOT hears his orders radioed in.

                                 STINGRAY PILOT
                        Roger that.

           EXT. STINGRAYS IN FLIGHT 

           As the SNOW FALLS thick as a DENSE FOG--
           CHOPPER ONE BANKS RIGHT and TURNS BACK to Jay while--the 
           remaining TWO STINGRAYS sail through the ever elevating snow-
           covered NAVAJO BASIN, with--

           --THE NORTH FACE OF MT. WILSON LOOMING AHEAD.

           EXT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE 

           Chopper One cruises over 300-FOOT PINE TREES.  And from the 
           cover of these trees--

           Rises Betty, JAY RIDING ON ITS HOOD.

           EXT. BETTY 

           Jay fights the winds, bitter cold and snow pelting his face, 
           as Betty closes in behind Chopper One.

           INT. BETTY 

           Harlan speeds up and gets Jay closer to the--

           --REAR HATCH of Chopper One. 

           INT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           The Stingray Pilot zeroes in on Harlan’S HOME, which begins 
           to materialize through the snowfall.  All the while he is 
           completely unaware that--

           EXT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           --Jay is poised at the edge of Betty, six feet away.  Jay 
           musters his courage and--

           --LEAPS from Betty, GRABBING the handle of the rear hatch.  
           Jay’s legs FLAP in the 400 MPH WINDS.

           Jay GROANS as he pulls himself up and PRESSES the handle door 
           button.  WHOOOM!  The DOOR SWINGS OPEN nearly throwing Jay 
           off.

           INT. COCKPIT, STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           The Pilot cranes his neck to see HIS REAR HATCH IS WIDE OPEN 
           and through it he can see--

           HARLAN PILOTING BETTY.

                                 STINGRAY PILOT
                        What the--

           HARLAN DROPS FROM VIEW, prompting the Pilot to turn the 
           hovercopter around which--
           EXT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           --gives the rear hatch the momentum to CLOSE, but--

           --not before JAY GETS HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE of it.

           INT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           The rear hatch door SHUTS, throwing Jay to the floor.

           INT. COCKPIT, STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           The Pilot searches for Betty, finally finding it.

                                 STINGRAY PILOT
                        There you are.

           As the Pilot is about to fire on Betty--

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Guess again.

           REVEAL: JAY, who DECKS the Pilot before he can react.  Jay 
           pulls the Pilot from the seat and--

           TAKES THE CONTROLS.  Jay surveys the substantially more 
           complicated diagnostics with some trepidation.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh boy.

           Jay PUSHES FORWARD on the cyclic and--

           EXT. STINGRAY - CHOPPER ONE

           --TAKES OFF like a bullet after Wolfe.

           EXT. MT. WILSON 

           The Two Stingrays move up and over 6,000 feet of FROZEN CLIFF 
           FACE.  GUSTS OF WIND have their way with both hovercopters.

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           ANNA IS HANDCUFFED to an overhead bar.  She’s jostled inside 
           the rocking vehicle.

           Wolfe looks at her satisfied as he moves into the--

           INT. COCKPIT, WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           --CO-PILOT’S SEAT.  From here we can SEE the SECOND STINGRAY 
           riding in formation NEXT TO HIM.
           Wolfe puts on his mic’d headset.

                                 WOLFE (INTO RADIO)
                        Chopper One.  Come in.  

           STATIC.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        Chopper one.  Do you read?

                                 JAY (OVER RADIO)
                        Hey, long time listener, first time 
                        caller.  Got a quick question for 
                        you.

           Wolfe is stunned.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        How much’d that thing on your left 
                        cost?

           REVEAL: the other Stingray riding in formation as--

           --BOOOM!!  A MISSILE hits one of its two MEGA LEVDISCS.

           EXT. STINGRAYS, WILSON’S NORTH FACE

           The flaming stingray SPINS OUT OF CONTROL as the DOT Agents 
           EJECT OUT to safety.

           The wounded Stingray SLAMS into the side of the North Face, 
           EXPLODING and--

           WHOOSH--Chopper One flies through the explosion and towards 
           Wolfe’s Stingray.  We SEE--

           --JAY AT THE CONTROLS.

           INT. COCKPIT, JAY’S STINGRAY

                                 JAY
                        I have to tell you, these are fun.  
                        Took a bit to get the hang of 
                        things, but--

           INT. COCKPIT, WOLFE’S STINGRAY

           Wolfe is steaming as he hears Jay’s voice over the radio.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        --think I may just keep it.

           Wolfe MUTES the RADIO.  To the Pilot:
                                 WOLFE
                        My wheel.

           Wolfe takes control of the Stingray.  

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        Get the pulse cannon.

           Moreau NODS, moving to the back of the Stingray.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Costigan.  May I remind you 
                        that destroying federal property is 
                        a very serious felony?

           INT. COCKPIT, JAY’S STINGRAY 

           JAY CLOSES IN on Wolfe’s Stingray as both choppers continue 
           to climb.

                                 JAY (INTO RADIO)
                        Whoopsidaisies.

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Moreau opens up a large chest and reveals--

           --A PULSE CANNON.  Whatever it is--this thing’ll f%ck you up.

           EXT. AIR ABOVE MT. WILSON 

           Wolfe’s Stingray crests over the 14,000-foot peak of Wilson 
           and Jay follows.  As they do--

           --both get nailed by a MASSIVE HEADWIND that almost causes 
           them to flip head over tail.

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Wolfe pushes forward on the cyclic and DROPS into--

           EXT. STINGRAYS IN FLIGHT 

           --a BASIN between two massive permafrost GLACIERS.

           The otherwise sizeable stingrays are COMPLETELY DWARFED as 
           they emerge from the basin and into--

           --AN ICY VALLEY FORMED BY A DOZEN CONVERGING PEAKS.

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           CLICK-LOCK.  Moreau snaps the pulse cannon into a tripod at 
           the rear of the stingray. 
           INT. COCKPIT, WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Wolfe turns to see Moreau giving him the THUMB’S UP.

                                 WOLFE  (INTO RADIO)
                        You know what the difference is 
                        between you and me, Mr. Costigan?

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        What’s that?

                                 WOLFE
                        I can shoot you down.

           INT. JAY’S STINGRAY 

                                 JAY (INTO RADIO) 
                        Well, I’m no expert, but I’d say 
                        I’ve got the drop on you.  

                                 WOLFE (V.O.)
                        You’re not going to fire on me.

                                 JAY (INTO RADIO)
                        No?

                                 WOLFE (V.O.)
                        You won’t risk hurting her.  Alas--
                        I have no such reservations.

           Just then--the REAR DOORS of Wolfe’s Stingray SWING OPEN to 
           reveal:

           Moreau manning the PULSE CANNON POINTED RIGHT AT JAY.

           JAY’S EYES GO WIDE as he JERKS his cyclic right and ROLLS 
           just in time to avoid--

           EXT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           --BAAAAAAOOOOOWWW--RIPPLES OF PLASMA tear through the air, 
           just missing Jay’s Stingray.

           The Plasma collides with an icy mountain wall and completely 
           SHATTERS IT.

           EXT. STINGRAYS IN FLIGHT 

           JAY significantly LOWERS HIS ALTITUDE and hovers 1,000 feet 
           below Wolfe’s Stingray in an attempt to get out of the range 
           of the pulse cannon, but--

           Jay is now less than 500 feet from the icy floor.
           EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN VALLEY

           ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM--BOOOOM!!  Both Stingrays zip through the 
           ever-narrowing mountain valley.

           The HUM of the speeding Stingrays and ECHO against ROCK and 
           ICE as--

           BAAAAAAOOOOOWWW--Moreau fires and MISSES again.  This time 
           his blast hits another icy wall and--

           CRACK--A 100,000-TON SLAB of frozen snow is JARRED LOOSE from 
           the mountain face.  RUMBLE RUMBLE--the snow moves and causes 
           a CHAIN REACTION of simultaneous--

           AVALANCHES on several peaks.  

           Snow descends like a tidal wave from all sides of the valley.  
           Rapidly approaching--

           INT. JAY’S STINGRAY 

           --JAY, who struggles with the controls of the stingray.  At 
           this speed and in these conditions, it’s like steering a 
           rocket with butterfly wings.  

           He then notices that the snowy valley is literally COMING 
           DOWN and SWALLOWING HIM WHOLE.

                                 JAY
                        Holy--

           INT. COCKPIT, WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Wolfe sees it too.  He PULLS BACK with all his might on the 
           cyclic, but he doesn’t have the strength to climb as quickly 
           as he needs to avoid the avalanche.

           The Pilot grabs his cyclic and - in stereo - both men use 
           every bit of strength they have to GAIN ALTITUDE.

           EXT. STINGRAYS IN FLIGHT 

           Stingrays rise higher and higher.  WOLFE WILL MAKE IT-- 

           BUT JAY WON’T.  It’s impossible to make up the altitude.

           INT. JAY’S STINGRAY 

           Snow closes in from both sides of Jay’s windshield as--

           EXT. JAY’S STINGRAY 

           --he is COMPLETELY CONSUMED by the converging avalanches.
           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Anna stares through the open rear hatch at Jay as--

                                 ANNA
                        No!!

           EXT. MOUNTAIN VALLEY - AERIAL VIEW

           --his stingray VANISHES beneath 100,000 tons of snow.

           Wolfe’s Stingray barely emerges UNSCATHED, escaping the 
           valley.

           INT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY 

           Heartbroken, Anna can only stare at the spot where Jay 
           disappeared, looking for any glimmer of hope, when MOREAU 
           SLAMS THE REAR HATCH SHUT.

           EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN VALLEY 

           It’s EERILY QUIET where moments ago the deafening sound of an 
           avalanche echoed through the valley.  

           We PASS OVER the newly settled snow until--

           MOVEMENT.  CRACKS appear in the snow, growing in size as they 
           rise up and down--

           AN ARM erupts from the snow and grips the ground.  

                                 JAY
                        ARRRRRRRG!

           JAY’S HEAD APPEARS and with great effort, he is able to pull 
           his other arm from beneath the snow.

           JAY COLLAPSES, his chest HEAVING the first real breath of air 
           in minutes.

           The HUM of an HCar prompts Jay to look and see--Betty 
           LANDING.

           Harlan exits and rushes to Jay.  He takes Jay’s hands and 
           PULLS the lower half of his body OUT OF THE PACKED SNOW.

                                 HARLAN
                             (beat)
                        Ain’t you gonna hit me?

           Jay shakes his head.
                                 JAY
                        If the shoe was on the other foot--
                        I would’ve done the same thing.

           This is little conciliation for Harlan, who wears his remorse 
           on his sleeve.

                                 HARLAN
                        What are they going to do with her?

                                 JAY
                        Anna was right.  Lyndon wanted her 
                        taken alive.  He’s in New York.  
                        I’d wager that’s where she’d 
                        headed.

                                 HARLAN
                        And where you’re headed.

                                 JAY
                             (hopeless)
                        The Lyndon Tower is the most secure 
                        building in the world.  How the 
                        hell’s a washed-up bum going to get 
                        in there?

                                 HARLAN
                        You mean two washed-up bums.

           Jay looks at Harlan.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        I think maybe you’ve been paying 
                        for one mistake for long enough.

           INT. HARLAN’S GARAGE 

                                 HARLAN
                        Here we go.

           Harlan opens a THREE DIMENSIONAL BUILDING SCHEMATIC on a 
           large LCD touch screen.

                                 HARLAN
                        Lyndon Tower.

                                 JAY
                        How in the hell did you get access 
                        to this?

           Not looking away from the screen, Harlan holds up ANNA’S 
           LYNDON TECH ID. 
                                 HARLAN
                        Found it in the seat cushion.  

                                 JAY
                        Give me that.

           Jay snatches it out of Harlan’s hand, considers ANNA’S IMAGE 
           for a beat before turning his attention back to the screen.

           Harlan traces his finger along the outside of the building as 
           he speaks.

                                 HARLAN
                        See this?
                             (Jay nods)
                        The whole building’s covered in a 
                        protective grid.  It’ll short out 
                        any LevDiscs coming too close. But-- 
                             (beat)
                        If you could drop in on the roof, 
                        passing through the grid with your 
                        disc powered off and then--flip it 
                        on at the last second--
                             (calculating)
                        --you might be able to get Betty 
                        through and land.

                                 JAY
                        Might.

                                 HARLAN
                        Might.
                             (then)
                        Next problem is getting through 
                        here--

           Harlan points to a ROOFTOP DOOR.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Reinforced steel and we ain’t got 
                        no key.

           As Harlan continues, SOMETHING catches Jay’s eye in another 
           part of the room.  He moves toward it.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Which won’t hardly matter, cuz 
                        there’s probably a whole buncha DOT 
                        Agents with itchy trigger fingers 
                        waiting on the other side.

           Jay STOPS in front of whatever it is he’s looking at while 
           Harlan grows more and more discouraged.  
                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, assuming you even find her and 
                        get back to the roof, I don’t see 
                        no way you could lift off with the 
                        grid still on. 
                             (with resign)
                        Hell, this is just a total cluster.

           Jay’s attention is still focused on the MYSTERY ITEM.

                                 JAY
                        You think you could install a 
                        polarity alternator on this?

           Intrigued, Harlan turns to see what Jay is looking at.

                                 HARLAN
                        Hmmp.  Well--I could surely try.

           Jay smiles and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           The LEVDISC SLED from the Vegas Hawk Dive at Jay’s feet.

           EXT. ROOF, LYNDON TOWER, MANHATTAN - DUSK

           Wolfe’s Stingray lowers for a landing, stopping short of the 
           CRISSCROSSED LASER GRID that hovers about 15-feet above the 
           roof.

           INT. SECURITY STATION, LYNDON TOWER 

                                 WOLFE (OVER RADIO)
                        Clear the grid for landing.

           A LYNDON TOWER SECURITY GUARD powers down the grid.

           EXT. ROOF, LYNDON TOWER 

           The LASER GRID DISSIPATES and Wolfe’s Stingray LOWERS, 
           landing on the rooftop helipad.  The moment it touches down--
           the GRID REAPPEARS.

           EXT. WOLFE’S STINGRAY

           Wolfe slides the door open and escorts a handcuffed Anna out 
           and toward the ROOFTOP DOOR.  

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE, LYNDON TOWER

           Anna’s led into the office and locks eyes with Lyndon.

                                 LYNDON
                        Take off the handcuffs.
           Wolfe does, before leaving the room with trepidation.

                                 LYNDON (CONT’D)
                        Anna--

           SMACK!  Anna SLAPS Lyndon HARD.  He stumbles back a step.  
           Anna is seething.

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t--don’t say a word to me.

                                 LYNDON
                        I didn’t want this--any of this.

                                 ANNA
                        You’re a murderer!

           Lyndon can’t respond.  Distressed, he’s crumbling under the 
           ever increasing weight of his transgressions.

                                 LYNDON
                        Why did you go to that agent?

                                 ANNA
                        I showed you what the discs could 
                        do--you did nothing!!
                             (beat)
                        And now people will die because of 
                        it.

                                 LYNDON
                        People who are stupid enough to 
                        hack our product.  I’m giving them 
                        something good, they’re turning it 
                        into a weapon.
                             (then)
                        If someone hits you with a car, you 
                        don’t sue the car manufacturer, do 
                        you?

                                 ANNA
                        If one person hacks a disc, it’ll 
                        kill everyone around them. 
                        Families, children, innocent 
                        people.  What about them?

                                 LYNDON
                        It’s unfortunate.  But think about 
                        it, the first time that happens, 
                        yes--it will be terrible, but no 
                        one will ever hack a NexGen disc 
                        again.
                                 ANNA
                        You’re sick.

           Anna shakes her head in disbelief.  She’s desperate.  So 
           desperate, she shifts her tact.  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We were Becker’s favorites, we were 
                        supposed to carry on his work.  He 
                        trusted us.  We had a 
                        responsibility--

                                 LYNDON
                        You’re not looking at the big 
                        picture--

                                 ANNA
                        If you ever loved me, if you ever 
                        cared for me.  I’m begging you.  
                        Stop this.  Please.     

           Lyndon shows some weakness, Anna’s made some headway.  

                                 LYNDON
                        Anna--

           Lyndon closes his eyes, his head is spinning.  It seems he is 
           going to cave.  He looks at Anna. 

                                 LYNDON (CONT’D)
                        It’s too late.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LYNDON’S OFFICE 

           Leaning against Lyndon’s door--WOLFE LISTENS CLOSELY to their 
           conversation while RELOADING his clip.

                                 LYNDON  (O.S.)
                        It’s too late.

           CLICK.  Wolfe SNAPS the clip into his gun.

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT

           EIGHT LEVELS OF HCAR TRAFFIC sail over where streets once 
           were, but now--

           GRASS, TREES and FLORA have broken through the asphalt, 
           creating impromptu parks inbetween the city canyons.  This is 
           the new New York.  

           Blending into the tiers of moving traffic, we FIND-- BETTY 
           merging UP to the HIGHEST TIER of traffic as--
           THE LYNDON TOWER appears ahead.

           INT. BETTY

           Harlan drives with a nervous Jay in the passenger seat.

                                 JAY
                        Thanks for doing this.

           Harlan nods, then SHIFTS.

                                 HARLAN
                        Don’t thank me yet.  Hold on tight.

           EXT. BETTY

           BURRRRRRRRR--HIGH GEAR.  Betty accelerates and GAINS 
           ALTITUDE, rising ABOVE the city traffic and going--

           VERTICAL, now completely parallel with the Lyndon Tower, but 
           at a safe distance from the grid.

           INT. BETTY 

           Harlan and Jay are PRESSED AGAINST THEIR SEATS, pulling about 
           4 Gs and looking like astronauts at liftoff.

           EXT. LYNDON TOWER 

           Betty summits the tower and levels out.  Hovering about 200 
           feet over its roof. 

           EXT. BETTY 

           Passenger door open, Jay reaches into the rear of the car and 
           pulls out--

           --THE LEVDISC SLED.  We TAKE NOTE OF a NEW YELLOW BUTTON next 
           to the infamous RED BUTTON.  Also--there’s a KEVLAR BELT 
           connecting the handles.

           Jay taps an INNER-EAR COMMUNICATION DEVICE--

                                 JAY (INTO DEVICE)
                        Call you when I’m set.

                                 HARLAN (INTO DEVICE)
                        Good luck.

           Jay pulls the sled tight to his chest and JUMPS.
           EXT. SKY OVER LYNDON TOWER 

           JAY BARRELS toward the grid covered roof.  His finger rests 
           on the RED BUTTON as he approaches the grid and--

           ---WHOOOM--passes through it, with ONLY 15 FEET left to drop.  
           HE’S CLEAR.   Jay quickly HITS the button---HMMMMMM--the disc 
           comes alive-- 

           --Bracing for the hit, Jay CLOSES HIS EYES--

           BLACK

           Jay pensively OPENS HIS EYES to see he--

           --is HOVERING inches from the Lyndon Tower roof.  Jay rolls 
           safely onto the roof and SLINGS the sled over his back, 
           moving to--

           --the REINFORCED STEEL DOOR. 

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE 

           Anna sits helplessly, awaiting her fate while Lyndon paces 
           nervously.

           The door opens and WOLFE ENTERS. 

                                 WOLFE
                        A word.

           Lyndon moves in closely to Wolfe, who WHISPERS.  

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        You tried to reason, but now we 
                        need to take care of her. 

                                 LYNDON
                        I can’t--I won’t--

                                 WOLFE
                        You will.  Or I will.

           EXT. ROOFTOP, LYNDON TOWER

           Using the Kevlar belt to fasten his sled to the side of 
           WOLFE’S PARKED STINGRAY, Jay HITS--

           --THE YELLOW BUTTON.  We HEAR a HUM as the disc comes to 
           life.  But--the disc is behaving STRANGELY--

           Rather than repelling, the disc is PULLING objects toward it, 
           namely--
           --the REINFORCED STEEL DOOR, which BUCKLES in the middle.  
           The DOOR IS PULLING FROM ITS CONCRETE FRAME.  POP-PING!!  

           The door FLIES from the wall and SLAMS into both the sled and 
           the Stingray to which it is attached.

           Jay looks at the GAPPING HOLE that is his way inside.

                                 JAY
                        Nice work, Harlan.

           INT. STAIRWELL, LYNDON TOWER 

           LevDisc sled strapped to his back, Jay speeds down the 
           emergency stairwell and into the--

           INT. 110TH-FLOOR LOBBY 

           A puzzled RECEPTIONIST stares at an out-of-breath Jay.  
           “Muzac” plays softly in the background.  A BEAT.  Then--

                                 JAY
                        Could you do me a favor and notify 
                        the main desk there’s a security 
                        breach on your floor?

           The stunned Receptionist is slow to respond.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You can tell them it’s Jay 
                        Costigan.

           The Receptionist picks up the phone and dials.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes.  I have a security breach in 
                        the lobby of the 110th floor. It’s--

           Jay WINKS encouragingly.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        --Jay Costigan. 
                             (hangs up)
                        They’re coming.

                                 JAY
                        You’re a doll.

           An AWKWARD SILENCE.  Jay’s waiting for something as the Musac 
           drones on.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This music’s gotta kinda get to you 
                        after a while, huh?
           The Receptionist concedes with a SHRUG as--

           BRIIIIIIIING!!  SIRENS RING and LIGHTS FLASH RED.  

                                 LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
                        This is a Class-A emergency.  The 
                        building has been breached.  All 
                        elevators are--

           The elevators simultaneously stop with a THUD.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
                        --locked down until further notice.

                        There it is.  Thanks again.

           Jay runs for the stairwell.

           EMERGENCY LIGHTS FLASH as Moreau enters the office.

                                 LYNDON
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 MOREAU
                        There’s a breach on 110.  It’s 
                        Costigan.  

           Hopeful, Anna faces WOLFE as he runs for the door.

           INT. STAIRWELL, LYNDON TOWER 

           Jay speeds down the stairs, finally stopping at: 

           THE 101ST FLOOR.  Jay pulls the sled from his back and poises 
           his thumb over the RED BUTTON.  He stands at the ready, 
           waiting for--

           CREEEAK-BANG!  

           One story below, a STAIRWELL DOOR OPENS.  WOLFE, MOREAU and 
           DOT AGENTS storm in, GUNS DRAWN.

           Jay holds steady, waiting while--

           BOOT ON METAL ECHOES through the stairwell.

           We WATCH as THE STAIRWELL FILLS UP.  There are over 30 DOT 
           AGENTS, all armed to the teeth: JAY.  IS.  F%CKED.

           Somehow, Jay manages to stay calm.  Slowing his breath.  Jay 
           is patient--waiting--waiting--waiting--until--
           WOLFE’S BARREL comes round the corner and OPENS FIRE--  

           SIMULTANEOUSLY--JAY HITS THE RED BUTTON and--the disc comes 
           to life.  In SLO MO we SEE:

           The DOT Agents’ BULLETS FLY AT JAY, then--STOP short of Jay’s 
           LevDisc before--

           --BACK TO REAL TIME, they fly back at their shooters, 
           REPELLED by the LevDisc.

           BULLETS RICOCHET and SPARKS FLY.  Several DOT Agents take 
           hits in their arms and legs.  Among them--

                                 WOLFE
                        Agh!

           --who catches a bullet in his leg.

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE 

                                 ANNA
                        It won’t stop.  It will only get 
                        worse.  

           A very conflicted Lyndon listens.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I can see what this is doing to 
                        you.  You said it’s too late, but 
                        it’s not.  Don’t let him turn you 
                        into a monster.

           INT. STAIRWELL, LYNDON TOWER 

           Wolfe clutches his wounded thigh and SCREAMS!

                                 WOLFE
                        Cease fire, CEASE FIRE!!

           Shots TAPER OFF.  Taking full advantage of the confusion--

           --Jay FLIPS over the rail, SWINGING himself--

           To the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STAIRWELL and BENEATH the Agents.  
           Before they can react--Jay OPENS THE DOOR and--

           INT. 100TH FLOOR LOBBY, LYNDON TOWER 

           --ESCAPES.  He quickly SLAMS the door shut, BRACES THE 
           LEVDISC SLED AGAINST A WALL, and trains it on the stairwell 
           door, LOCKING WOLFE and COMPANY INSIDE.
           INT. STAIRWELL, LYNDON TOWER 

           Wolfe, Moreau and company slam themselves against the door, 
           but are HELPLESS TO MOVE IT.  The door won’t budge against 
           the LevDisc’s MAGNETIC REPULSION FORCE.

                                 WOLFE
                             (to Moreau)
                        Take a team.  Go up a floor and 
                        catch an elevator down.

                                 MOREAU
                        But the elevators are locked.

                                 WOLFE
                        Well, go get them unlocked!!

           Moreau moves up the stairwell.

           INT. 100TH-FLOOR LOBBY, LYNDON TOWER 

           Jay leaves the LevDisc in place to keep Wolfe and his men in 
           as he runs into:

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LYNDON’S OFFICE 

           Jay moves toward Lyndon’s office, as--

           Anna and Lyndon exit.  It looks as if LYNDON IS HOLDING ANNA 
           HOSTAGE.  

           To Jay’s surprise - LYNDON RELEASES ANNA, who runs into Jay’s 
           arms.  Jay EMBRACES HER.

                                 LYNDON
                        Get her out of here.

           Jay and Anna back away.  Lyndon’s remorseful eyes don’t leave 
           Anna.  Anna says only--

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you.

           --as she and Jay disappear around a corner.

           INT. STAIRWELL 

           Moreau runs up the stairs, screaming into his radio:

                                 MOREAU
                        Cancel security protocol!  Get the 
                        elevators unlocked immediately!
           INT. 100TH-FLOOR LOBBY 

           Jay and Anna run straight for the ELEVATOR DOORS.

                                 JAY
                        Help me.

           Jay JAMS HIS FINGERS into the cleft between doors.

           Anna and Jay struggle to PUSH OPEN THE ELEVATOR DOORS, 
           EXPOSING:

           An ELEVATOR SHAFT with a view of: 

           DOZENS of LEVDISC PROPELLED ELEVATOR CARS frozen in space.  
           No cables.  Each car sports a LevDisc on its top and bottom.  
           Anna GULPS at the DROP.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Stay here.

           Jay sprints to the LevDisc Sled still holding Wolfe’s team 
           inside.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s your plan?

                                 JAY
                        We’re gonna jump.  

                                 ANNA
                        What?!

                                 JAY
                        It’ll be just like Vegas.

                                 ANNA
                        You almost died in Vegas.

                                 JAY
                        Okay, then, it’ll be nothing like 
                        Vegas.

                                 ANNA
                        What about the elevator cars?

                                 JAY
                        They’re frozen.  I can get around 
                        them as long as they’re standing 
                        still.  Do you trust me?

           Anna pauses for a long beat before answering:
                                 ANNA
                        Yes.

                                 JAY
                        Here we go.  One, Two--

           Jay grabs the LevDisc sled--

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Three!

           --Jay runs with the sled toward Anna, but in doing that:

           He releases WOLFE’S TEAM INTO THE LOBBY.  They train their 
           guns on Jay--as he RUNS and GRABS Anna--

           --LEAPING into the elevator shaft.

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT 

           Jay and Anna tumble through the air, FREEFALLING.  Jay spots 
           a frozen elevator car approaching.  He quickly--

           --positions Anna’s back against the sled, putting his body on 
           top of hers.  Jay TAPS the red button and they--

           --SLOW TO A STOP, just short of the frozen car--SQUISHING 
           VERY PROVOCATIVELY INTO ONE ANOTHER.  

                                 JAY
                        Sorry.

           GUNFIRE from above.

           Jay quickly points the sled at an angle and releases the 
           button.  ZOOM--

           --THEY DROP AGAIN.

           INT. 100TH-FLOOR LOBBY 

           Wolfe is apoplectic.

                                 WOLFE
                             (into device)
                        Get these elevators turned back on!

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT 

           Jay and Anna drop, floor after floor speeding by, when--

           --BRRR--the elevator cars HUM to life and begin to move.
           But they not only move up and down--LevDisc tech allows them 
           to move SIDE TO SIDE and DIAGONALLY, completely un-tethered 
           from cables, which makes the elevator cars NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE 
           TO DODGE.  

                                 ANNA
                        I thought they were frozen!

                                 JAY
                        They were.  This might be better 
                        with your eyes closed.

           DOZENS OF RAPIDLY MOVING ELEVATOR CARS crisscross, missing 
           collisions by mouse hairs as--

           --WHOOOSH!!  Jay CORKSCREWS just in time to squeeze inbetween 
           them. 

           INT. 100TH-FLOOR LOBBY 

           Wolfe, Moreau and the DOT Agents pile into the elevator.

                                 WOLFE (INTO DEVICE)
                        All available agents.  All 
                        available agents move to Lyndon 
                        Tower immediately.  Seal all 
                        entrances.  No one gets out.

           INT. CENTRAL LOBBY, LYNDON TOWER

           We’re LOOKING at the central elevator block as the doors are 
           PRIED OPEN, revealing--

           --JAY AND ANNA.  Jay taps his inner ear communication device.

                                 JAY (INTO DEVICE)
                        We’re here, Harlan.

           Jay and Anna move onto the lobby floor where--similar to the 
           Silicon Valley Lyndon offices--several NEXGEN CONCEPT HCARS 
           sit sparkling in the lobby.

                                 HARLAN (V.O.)
                        We have a problem--

           A FLEET OF DOT HCARS pull up in front of the main doors of 
           the building. 

                                 HARLAN (V.O.)
                        --nobody’s getting out the front 
                        door.

           Shit!  Jay looks the other direction to see--Wolfe’s ELEVATOR 
           IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE LOBBY. 
           Jay scans the room, looking for a way out and--HIS EYES LOCK 
           ON SOMETHING:

           The NexGen Concept HCars displays, specifically the BUGATTI 
           VEYRON-INSPIRED ROADSTER.  He starts toward it.

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 JAY
                        I’m gonna hotwire it.

           Anna runs past Jay, pushing him out of the way.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re in a hurry.  I better do it.

           Off Jay’s miffed/turned-on face, we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR 

           Wolfe watches the floor numbers COUNT DOWN.

           The digital read-out shows: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1--PING!  The DOORS 
           OPEN and WOLFE EXITS as--

           INT. CENTRAL LOBBY, LYNDON TOWER 

           BRRRRRRRR.  Jay and Anna throttle out of the lobby in the 
           NexGen Roadster.

           --CRASH!!  Breaking through 30-foot windows and--

           EXT. LYNDON TOWER/STREETS OF NEW YORK 

           --over the FIRING DOT Agents. 

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay reaches for a stick shift that--

                                 JAY
                        What the--?

           --ISN’T THERE.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s automatic.

           Jay makes a SOURPUSS as he disappears into TRAFFIC.
           INT. CENTRAL LOBBY, LYNDON TOWER 

           Wolfe is EERILY QUIET as he watches Jay and Anna make their 
           escape.  Despite the FLURRY of DOT AGENTS scrambling after 
           them, WOLFE REMAINS VERY CALM AND STILL.  Wolfe looks over to 
           the--

           --EMPTY PEDESTAL where the Roadster once was.  And then, to 
           our surprise--

           WOLFE TURNS BACK TOWARDS THE ELEVATORS.

           EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - AERIAL VIEW

           The NexGen Roadster speeds south through HCar traffic stacked 
           10 tiers high.

           EXT. NEXGEN ROADSTER

                                 JAY
                        With a little luck, we’ll be in DC 
                        in two hours.  Tunnels are out of 
                        the question, so I guess--

           Anna holds her gaze on Jay.  He feels it.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ANNA
                        I--
                             (beat)
                        I thought you were dead.

                                 JAY
                             (beat)
                        Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you.

           Anna smiles for a second, then--

                                 ANNA
                        Why did you come back for me?

           Jay squirms a little.  He steals a look at Anna before 
           turning back to the road.

                                 JAY
                        I promised to get you there--you 
                        believed that I would.
                             (then)
                        And I'm in real short supply of 
                        people who believe in me.
           We hold on this moment for a beat before we:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LYNDON’S OFFICE 

           A very anxious Lyndon stares out his office window, when--

           WOLFE storms in, PULLS OUT A GUN and points it at him.

                                 LYNDON
                        Please.  Please don’t--

                                 WOLFE
                        You let her go?

                                 LYNDON
                        I--loved her.  I couldn’t let you 
                        do it.

                                 WOLFE
                        She’ll bring us both down.

           Lyndon GULPS, knowing he’s right.

                                 WOLFE (CONT’D)
                        I want the NexGen decryption 
                        algorithm. 

                                 LYNDON
                        What?

                                 WOLFE
                        The one she wrote to hack the 
                        NexGen discs.  She gave it to you.  
                        I want it.

                                 LYNDON
                        Why?  I don’t--

           CLICK-CLICK.  Wolfe presses the gun to Lyndon’s forehead.

                                 WOLFE
                        Give it to me.

                                 LYNDON
                        You know what it’ll do--

                                 WOLFE
                        I know precisely what it will do.  
                        Now--GIVE IT TO ME!!

           Lyndon CRUMBLES under the pressure, NODDING.
           EXT. ON RAMP FOR MANHATTAN BRIDGE - AERIAL VIEW

           The Roadster approaches the Manhattan Bridges only to find:

           INT. ROADSTER

           A DOZEN DOT HCARS waiting.

                                 JAY
                        Crap.

           Jay spins the car around and THROTTLES it.  He takes a quick 
           look at the speedometer: 190 MPH.

                                 JAY
                        This really as fast as it can go?

                                 ANNA
                        Without hacking the discs, yeah.
                             (off his look)
                        The irony is not lost on me.

           INT. STINGRAY, ROOF OF LYNDON TOWER 

           Wolfe slides into the pilot’s chair with Moreau waiting in 
           the passenger seat.

                                 MOREAU
                        They were just spotted trying to 
                        cross the Manhattan Bridge.  We 
                        have cars in pursuit.

                                 WOLFE
                        Good.

           Wolfe takes the cyclic and prepares to lift off. 

                                 MOREAU
                        Did you get it?

           Wolfe hands Moreau a LYNDON TECH FLASH DRIVE, which he--

           PLUGS into his diagnostic screen.  The screen fills up with 
           COMPUTER CODE, rapidly scrolling by.  Moreau SMILES when he 
           sees it.

           EXT. ROOF, LYNDON TOWER 

           The GRID CLEARS and Wolfe’s Stingray lifts off.  Its LevDiscs 
           tilt to 45-degree angles and--

           --BOOOM!!  It takes off like a jet towards:
           EXT. TIMES SQUARE 

           TOURISTS stare at the giant ABC News screen--

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        --live from Capitol Hill where we 
                        await a vote on the “Safer Skies 
                        Bill”--

           ZOOOOOOOOOOM--Jay’s NexGen Roadster SCREAMS PAST the giant 
           screen, so close that it actually--

           --CRACKS the screen in half.

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay turns back to see GLASS from the screen rain down on the 
           now 25 DOT CARS in pursuit.

           INT. STINGRAY 

           Wolfe and Moreau look down at Times Square and the chase that 
           Jay is leading through it.

           Moreau locks a TARGETING SYSTEM on Jay and Anna’s NexGen 
           roadster.  His screen flashes:

           SIGNAL ESTABLISHED.

                                 MOREAU
                        Ready to transmit.

                                 WOLFE
                        Do it.

           Moreau hits UPLOAD on his diagnostic touch screen.

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF JAY’S NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           We HEAR the HUM of the six NexGen LevDiscs as they work in 
           harmony to navigate.

           All NexGen LevDiscs feature a GREEN LED in the center.  ONE 
           BY ONE, each LED goes from solid green to FLASHING YELLOW.

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay glances into his rear view mirror and sees--

                                 ANNA
                        They’re gaining.

                                 JAY
                        I know.
           His foot pushes the pedal to the floor and--unbeknowst to 
           him, the digital speedometer INCREASES--200, 210, 225--

           --as he begins to PULL AHEAD of the DOT HCars.

           INT. STINGRAY 

                                 MOREAU

                        Attention all agents.  This is 
                        Deputy Secretary Wolfe.  You have 
                        authorization to use deadly force 
                        on the target.  Take them out!

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Anna notices the speedometer:

           JAY’S GOING 250 MILES PER HOUR.  This should be IMPOSSIBLE on 
           a NexGen LevDisc.  Anna is puzzled, but she has little time 
           to digest that as--

           CRASH--CRASH--CRASH!!  BULLETS SHATTER the rear window.  Anna 
           and Jay both duck as--

           --the Roadster ACCELERATES to 280 miles per hour.

           INT. STINGRAY 

           Wolfe watches Jay speed through the city.

                                 WOLFE 
                        What are you clocking him at?

                                 MOREAU 
                        300 miles per hour.

           Wolfe pulls back on the cyclic, SLOWING.

                                 MOREAU (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?  We’ll lose 
                        visual.

                                 WOLFE 
                        Trust me.  When he hits 350--

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           All six LevDiscs start to uncharacteristically VIBRATE.
                                 WOLFE (V.O.)
                        --we don’t want to be around.

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay struggles with the steering wheel.

                                 JAY
                        Car’s handling weird.

           He looks at the speedometer which now reads 330 MPH.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you say we couldn’t go over 
                        190?

           PA-TING!!  BULLETS SAIL over Jay’s head.  He instinctively 
           accelerates--to 345 MPH.

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           The NexGen LevDiscs VIBRATE VIOLENTLY now--it almost looks 
           like they could shake right off their fittings.  

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

                                 ANNA
                             (realizing)
                        STOP!

                                 JAY
                        WHAT?!

                                 ANNA
                        They hacked our discs.

                                 JAY
                        How?!

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know--just STOP!!

           Jay’s eyes go WIDE as he--steps off the accelerator and 
           slows.  The speedometer drops--345, 335, 320--as--

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           The vibrations slow and the DISCS STABILIZE.

           INT. STINGRAY 

                                 MOREAU 
                        They’re slowing.
           Wolfe looks like he’s going blow a fuse.

                                 WOLFE
                        Put me down and get me a car.  NOW!

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay looks in his rearview mirror to see--

           DOT HCars gaining on him, their Gatling guns spinning to 
           life.  JAY SPEEDS UP AGAIN.

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 JAY
                        They’re shooting at us.

                                 ANNA
                        You go any faster, these discs’ll 
                        go EMP.  We and everyone in lower 
                        Manhattan will crash.  We’re riding 
                        on a bomb.

           Anna and Jay realize their situation is LOSE/LOSE as the 
           entirety of the NYC DOT closes in behind them.

                                 JAY
                        Then what am I supposed to do?!?

           Anna spots a SUBWAY STATION and points to it.

                                 ANNA
                        Take speed out of the equation.

           Jay nearly spit-takes when he figures out what Anna’s 
           suggesting.

                                 JAY
                        You should be institutionalized.

           Jay swerves out of traffic straight at:

           THE ENTRANCE TO A SUBWAY STATION.  Jay lays into the HORN as--
           PEDESTRIANS CLEAR THE WAY-- 

           EXT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           --CREEEEAKK--the Roadster is sandwiched by the impossibly 
           tight fit into the station--SPARKS FLY as metal hits metal.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION 

           BOOM!!  Jay plows through the GATES and right onto--
           THE MAGLEV SUBWAY TRACKS.

           EXT. SUBWAY STATION ENTRANCE 

           ONLY TWO DOT HCARS are crazy enough to pursue.  As hard as it 
           is to believe, their entrances are more unsightly.

           EXT. STREET 

           Wolfe runs from the grounded Stingray and jumps into a 
           waiting DOT HCar.

           BRRRMMM--Wolfe tears down the street.

                                 JAY
                        Your idea.

           Anna sees Jay is moving straight at--

           Jay THROTTLES at the car and--PEELS AWAY at the last possible 
           second into--

                                 ANNA
                        Slow down.

           Jay sees he’s speeding dangerously close to 350 MPH.  He 
           slows again, allowing--

           --the pursing DOT HCars to catch up.
           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK 

           Wolfe’s DOT HCar fishtails and throttles into an open subway 
           tunnel.

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

           The two DOT HCars follow Jay and Anna through the 
           LABYRINTHINE SUBWAY TUNNEL SYSTEM.  

           Neither DOT HCar is able to get a shot as they pursue Jay 
           through 

           HOOOOOOOOONK!!!  TWO MORE TRAINS APPROACH and, Jay dodges  
           one--the other--

           One of the two DOT HCars is struggling, it HITS THE WALL and 
           RICOCHETS--

           --BOOM!!--into a SUPPORT BEAM and EXPLODES. One car left.

           Jay regards his speedometer--325 MPH.

                                 JAY
                        Crap.

           The Roadster sandwiches inbetween the MagLev train and the

           The top of the Roadster gets SCRAPPED as it slides along the

           Jay and Anna SQUEEZE THROUGH the other side.

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Anna reaches for the diagnostic and LEVELS THE ROADSTER.  

           Jay stares at Anna in DISBELIEF.  She made his move before he 
           could.  Anna SHRUGS casually.

           Wolfe gets closer.

           RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT--the GATLING unloads--JAY AND ANNA ARE 
           SCREWED.  If they drive quickly to evade the bullets, they’ll 
           risk setting off the EMP.  Jay’s foot hovers over the

           --ZOOMS into the BLACKED SPACE.

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR 

           Wolfe pursues Jay into the tunnel, but--

           His target is no longer locked.  As Wolfe tries to reacquire--

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           Jay twists left and right to avoid  RAIL FRAGMENTS and THICK 
           COLLAPSED CONCRETE WALLS.  There’s a reason the tunnel is 
           blocked off--

           --IT’S FALLING APART and is TOO TIGHT TO NAVIGATE. The tunnel 
           grows INCREASINGLY SMALLER as they move deeper into it.    

                                 JAY
                        Any other ideas?
                                 ANNA
                        Drive as fast as you can.

                                 JAY
                        WHAT?!

                                 ANNA
                        Drive as fast as you can.

                                 JAY
                        You said if I do that, then: EMP, 
                        crash, death and destruction.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re descending into the old 
                        tunnel system.  We’re deep and 
                        under layers and layers of thick 
                        concrete.  The EMP shouldn’t affect 
                        anything.

                                 JAY
                        Except our car.

                                 ANNA
                        And any car chasing us.

           THUD-BOOM!!  Jay can’t avoid getting NICKED by a collapsing 
           GIRDER.

                                 JAY
                        We might just run out of tunnel 
                        before I get up the speed.

                                 ANNA
                        Then do it now.

           Jay nods, understanding what he needs to do.  HE PRESSES THE 
           ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN.  We SEE the SPEEDOMETER RISE: 
           250, 260, 270--

           Jay and Anna BUCKLE UP and BRACE THEMSELVES.

           EXT. UNDERSIDE OF NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           The LevDiscs VIBRATE VIOLENTLY, casting off the RIVETS that 
           hold them into place.

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER

           Jay steals a look at his speedometer: 295.  There’s still a 
           long way to go. 

                                 ANNA
                        You have to hurry.
           Jay looks ahead at the EVER-NARROWING TUNNEL and the 
           CRISSCROSSING GIRDERS, SLABS OF CONCRETE and ROCKS that 
           intersect his path.   

           In a callback to Jay’s street race in San Francisco, we SEE 
           him TAKE A DEEP BREATH, as--

           TIME SLOWS TO 1/16 SPEED:  We MOVE FREELY AROUND the tunnel 
           with our “MATRIX VISION”:

           Jay sees it all--his SPEEDING ROADSTER, a broken PIPE cutting 
           across his path, bullets flying out of Wolfe’s Gatling to 
           PULVERIZE obstacles his way,  BUT, as before--JAY FINDS ORDER 
           IN THIS MADNESS.  

           Jay EXHALES and we’re back to REAL TIME.

                                 JAY
                        Brace yourself.

           WHOOOOOOOOMMMMM!!!  300, 315, 330--The Speedometer continues 
           to rise as Jay--

           --flies through the tunnel, somehow navigating a countless 
           number of obstacles.  Each move is so quick, so precise and 
           with such an immeasurably miniscule margin of error.

           Anna glances over at the speedometer as it crests:

           350 MILES PER HOUR!

           EXT. TUNNEL

           The discs now vibrate at such a high frequency, they sound a 
           deafening high-pitch EEEEEEEEEEEE.  Then-- 

           BAH-BOOOOOOOOOOM!  SIX MASSIVE RINGS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE 
           WAVES ERUPT from beneath the NexGen Roadster.

           Every light on the Roadster is extinguished and it DROPS--
           into a DEADLY SLIDE along the subway tunnel floor.  

           INT. WOLFE’S DOT HCAR

           Wolfe’s car goes dark.

                                 WOLFE
                        No.

           It too DROPS and--
           EXT. TUNNEL 

           --BARREL ROLLS when it collides with the old subway track.  
           Unlike Jay’s car, Wolfe’s car gets completely chewed up as it 
           spins along the ground at 200 MPH.

           Just imagine the worst NASCAR crash you’ve ever seen AND 
           MULTIPLY IT BY 100--

           --BA-BOOOOOM!!!!  Wolfe’s HCar EXPLODES!

           INT. NEXGEN ROADSTER 

           FLAMES from Wolfe’s explosion lick the tail of the Roadster 
           as it continues to slide.  

           Jay sees a HUGE PROTRUDING STEEL GIRDER coming straight for 
           their heads.

                                 JAY
                        Down!

           Jay pushes Anna down as both slide under the dash and--  

           SMASH!!  The windshield is pulverized and the top of the car 
           is nearly ripped off as the girder misses the tops of their 
           heads by inches.

           The Roadster JERKS TO A HALT.  

           EXT. B/D/N/Q SUBWAY TUNNEL AT MANHATTAN BRIDGE - MORNING

           WE’RE STARING AT the mouth of the tunnel where the subway 
           lines converge onto the MANHATTAN BRIDGE. 

           TWO FIGURES holding hands appear in silhouette and emerge 
           from the tunnel.

           IT’S JAY AND ANNA.

           Jay taps a button on his inner ear device.

                                 JAY (INTO DEVICE)
                        Harlan?  We’re gonna need a pick

                        that obnoxious voice.  

           We HEAR the HUM of LevDiscs as--

           BRRRRRMMMMMMM--an HCar ZOOMS overhead and into the TIERS OF 
           AERIAL TRAFFIC hovering over the Manhattan Bridge.

           We SEE ANNA’S REFLECTION in the DOZEN TELEVISION CAMERAS 
           pointed directly at her.

                                 ANNA

                        potential, the NexGen SmartDisc 
                        must be permanently banned from

           A HAULING TRUCK dumps hundreds of NexGen LevDiscs into an 
           INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        I would also strongly encourage 
                        writing legislation to ensure the 
                        LevDisc design is never compromised 
                        again.  The risk to our security 
                        and way of life is too great.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: the Hauling Truck is one of OVER 40 
           SIMILAR TRUCKS, all overflowing with NexGen discs.

           Jay watches Anna’s testimony from rear chambers.

                                 ANNA
                        The only reason I am alive to 
                        testify today is because of the 
                        efforts of Jason Costigan, who put 
                        himself at great risk to deliver me 
                        here.  He is a man who is deserving 
                        of my infinite gratitude and 
                        unwavering trust.

           Jay GRINS ever so slightly, EXITS the chambers as--

           --Anna turns to see him go.

           EXT. CAPITOL HILL, WASHINGTON DC - DUSK

           Betty is bathed in the orange glow of the setting sun.  
           Harlan leans against it, twirling a set of keys.

                                 HARLAN
                        How’d it go?

           WHIP PAN TO:

           JAY APPROACHING.  He’s alone.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Watched it on TV.  She said some 
                        pretty nice things about you.
                             (off Jay’s nod)
                        Here.

           Harlan throws Jay the keys.

                                 JAY
                        You coming?

                                 HARLAN
                        Nah.  Don’t want to be a fifth

                                 JAY
                        What do you mean?

           Harlan starts AWAY, POINTING to something behind Jay.  

                                 ANNA
                        You gonna leave without me?

           Jay is surprised, but he tries to play it cool.  HE LOOKS 
           AROUND ANNA’S PERSON FOR SOMETHING.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                        of money, so I figured--

           Anna laughs and she moves in close to him. 

                                 ANNA
                        Do you think I could pay you back?

                                 JAY
                        We could probably figure something 
                        out.

           Jay leans in for a kiss and, as he’s about to make contact, 
           ANNA PULLS AWAY.

                        Collection on delivery.

           Anna moves to the passenger seat.  Jay shakes his head and 
           follows her into Betty.

           INT. BETTY 

           Jay slides into the driver’s seat.

                                 JAY
                        I was thinking more of a “pay-as-
                        you-go” type a thing.

                                 ANNA
                        I’ll consider it.

           Jay FIRES UP Betty, SHIFTS into drive and takes off into the 
           SUNSET.

           FADE TO BLACK.
