                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        If I hadn't fought the twelve year
                        old, or the flight attendant hadn't
                        taken pity on me, it never would
                        have happened... 

           INT. SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           From the empty causeway to a plane... 

           The lone first passenger bursts off.  It is: EMMA CORRIGAN,
           28, pretty, and utterly mortified -- moving as fast as her
           wheeled carry-on will let her. 

           In the ARRIVALS TERMINAL

           Emma dashes past travelers, apologizing, never slowing...

           Bursting through the doors

           To the TAXI STAND

           Where at last she stops. Breathless. Glancing back, scanning
           the crowd -- for the person she does not want to see.

           Anxious for a cab, Emma tries to process what's just happened.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        Or maybe it was the big fat lie on
                        my mom's sixtieth birthday. Yeah,
                        that's when it started...

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT ON WATER / SEATTLE - EVENING

           ON SCREEN: THREE DAYS EARLIER

           Carrying a wrapped gift, pulling her suitcase, Emma walks
           through an upscale restaurant toward the table where her
           parents, DALE and LINDA sit with Emma's cousin, KERRY, 29,
           and her husband, NEV, 30, an aging jock.

           Pausing a moment, Emma's face falls a little.  Even from
           across the restaurant, she can see Kerry holding court.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        But then, maybe it had been coming
                        for years.

           Bracing herself, Emma moves on...

           Reaching them, Emma hugs her mom, as they all greet her.
                                 EMMA
                        Sorry I'm late.  Had to pack.  What
                        did I miss?

                                 LINDA
                        We were just talking about Kerry's
                        article.

           As Emma sits beside Kerry, Linda hands her a copy of People
           Magazine, open to a photo of: 

           Kerry in a bustling design studio.  The headline--

                   Kerry Corrigan's Hip Office Designs

                   Woo Global Retailer Crate and Barrel

           Emma tries very hard to be happy for Kerry.

                                 EMMA
                        You look great in here, Ker.

           Kerry, smiling, is the queen of false modesty--

                                 KERRY
                        The press has been a little
                        overwhelming actually.

                                 NEV
                        I was just saying-- Remember Kerry's
                        stalker?  This might bring that freak
                        out of the woodwork again-- 

           This, a topic that makes Emma uneasy...

                                 EMMA
                        God, I haven't thought of that in
                        ages.

           Anxious to change the topic, Emma hands Linda her gift.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Happy Birthday!

           Smiling, Linda opens Emma's envelope-- 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        That's the real present. The other
                        is just a little something.

           Linda reads the contents of the envelope: a gift certificate.

                                 LINDA
                        Sweetheart, you shouldn't have!  
                                 EMMA
                        It's supposed to be the best spa in
                        the city. I thought it would force
                        you to indulge yourself.

                                 LINDA
                        Thank you so much, honey.  Really.

           Emma looks on, a bit shy, as Linda un-wraps Emma's other
           gift: an elegant PHOTOGRAPH of Linda, surrounded by kids
           from the public school where she teaches. 

                                 LINDA (CONT'D)
                        I forgot you took these!  I love it--

                                 DALE
                        It's beautiful, Em.

           On Emma, smiling.  Touched.

           As Kerry hands her gift to Linda, she whispers to Emma. 

                                 KERRY
                        Hope you're not mad. It was such a
                        good idea.

           Emma's face falls.

           Linda, who has unwrapped a luxurious robe, reads from a note. 

                                 LINDA - READING
                        For my auntie Linda, to wear at the
                        Ritz Carlton Spa-- in Paris!

           Emma looks on in disbelief. 

                                 LINDA
                        Oh Kerry, this is too much!

                                 KERRY
                        You're going to Paris too, uncle
                        Dale. But the spa's just for Linda.

           As Linda and Dale rise to hug Kerry and Nev, Emma eyes her
           picture, now covered in the wrapping from Kerry's gift. 

           Feeling very small, as she often does around Kerry, it takes
           everything in Emma to muster a smile--

                                 EMMA
                        That's really generous, guys. 

           Nev, settling back in his seat, eyes her suitcase--
                                 NEV
                        I hear you're off to New York, Em.
                        What are you doing there?

           Emma stares around at her family...

           And at Kerry's People article, on the table...

           And cannot tell the truth...

                                 EMMA
                        Meetings.  

                                 KERRY
                        With who?

                                 EMMA
                        Some big wigs from our... European
                        subsidiaries. 

                                 LINDA
                        You didn't tell us that. That's
                        exciting! 

                                 KERRY
                        I'd never send an assistant to do a
                        thing like that! Someone must be
                        grooming you.

           On Emma, annoyed. Kerry's compliments always sting a little.

           But Dale raises his glass, beaming--

                                 DALE
                        I have a good feeling about this
                        job, Em. I think you've really found
                        your thing! 

           Emma's family raise their glasses in a toast to Emma. 

           Whose smile, very forced, says it all. 

           EXT.  MANHATTAN ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           The massive, Pier 91 Convention Center on the Hudson River.

           INT. PIER 91 CONVENTION CENTER / MANHATTAN - DAY

           Where the world URBAN FREE RIDE championships are underway.  

           Teenage Boys on BMX bikes fly over obstacles: cement walls,
           stairs, railings... as Heavy Metal BLASTS. 

           And here, in the back of the 
           PANTHER COLA BOOTH

           We find Emma.  In BMX-inspired 'racing gear' covered with
           the PANTHER COLA logo, staring hatefully at an unwieldy HAT
           with a Panther 'fist' punching through the top. 

           Bracing herself, Emma dons the hat and re-joins the other
           PANTHER MARKETERS, yelling into her headset microphone:

                                 EMMA-INTO HER HEADSET
                        With double the Taurine and the immuno
                        slam of Ginseng, Panther's new Panther
                        Punch packs double the blast of any 
                        energy drink on the market.

           As Emma yells, she hands out cans of the drink to the sea of
           Teenage Boys around the booth...

           TYLER, 12, trophy in hand, stops before her. An entourage of
           sullen boys, in tow. 

                                 TYLER
                        Nice hat.

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks.  Haven't heard that today. 
                        Panther Punch, or Panther Classic. 
                        What can I get you?

           He scoffs.  Glowering.

                                 TYLER
                        Do you even know what Free Ride is?

           Emma is not unused to brats like this.

                                 EMMA
                        What we're sponsoring you to do.

                                 TYLER
                        Urban free ride is... freedom.  You
                        don't sponsor freedom, lady.  You
                        don't sponsor breaking rules and
                        kicking the ass of convention--

           Emma rolls her eyes and moves off, as Tyler yells--

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Corporate sell out.

           On Emma, for whom his words sting.

           TIME CUT -- LATER
           The crowd has thinned. The floor, a mess of Panther cans. 
           Most MARKETERS have dispersed. Exhausted, Emma packs up.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        Can I have one of your stupid drinks?

           Emma turns to see Tyler.

           She regards his beady little eyes. His sneer. 

                                 EMMA
                        Absolutely.

           Emma grabs a PANTHER COLA from a crate... 

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        One of Panther's marketing coups--
                        extra carbonation.  Kids love it. 

           She shakes the can discretely, and hands it to Tyler.

                                 EMMA-V.O. (CONT'D)
                        Because it lets you do this--

           Tyler takes the can, smiles...

           But as he pops the tab, instead of pointing it toward his
           face -- he BLASTS EMMA with a stream of the drink--

           Standing there, soda spraying her face, Emma has had enough.  

           She pops Tyler on the forehead with her palm--

           Which surprises him.  Adults aren't supposed to do that! 

           He KICKS Emma's knee.  Hard.

           Emma grabs hold of his ear. And Tyler knees her in the groin!

           And Emma is down -- but her hand on Tyler's ear brings him
           to the floor also -- and they are locked in combat -- with a
           flurry of slaps -- and hair pulling...

                                 PANTHER MARKETER-O.C.
                        What the hell's going on here!?

           Emma looks up.  A PANTHER MARKETER stares down at them.

           So do the teenage boys that have gathered, thrilled. 

           Realizing how bad this looks, Emma's words are feeble...

                                 EMMA
                        Please don't tell head office.
           INT.  AIRPLANE / ECONOMY SECTION - LATE DAY

           On a crowded flight, Emma reads a text message from her dad: 

                          We're so proud of you honey! 

           Emma turns the phone off.  Miserable.

           Her seat mates: a GIRL, 16, and her LITTLE SISTER, 3.

                                 CAPTAIN ON OVERHEAD
                        Sorry for the delay folks.  Six planes
                        need to take off before us, so settle
                        in-- this could take a while.

           Emma sighs: great. 

           Emma turns to the little girl gazing at her. 

           It warms her heart.  The kid is cute. She plays with a squeeze
           toy and sips from a can of grape juice.

           She drops the toy on the floor. The older sister rolls her
           eyes and looks at the window.

           So Emma grabs the toy for the little girl.  Who laughs.

                                 OLDER SISTER
                        Ignore it.  She'll keep doing it. 

           The little girl 'drops' the toy again. 

           Emma and the older sister eye each other.  A stand off.

           The little girl looks like she might cry...

           So Emma steps into the aisle to get the toy...

           As a passing FLIGHT ATTENDANT unknowingly kicks it further
           down the aisle.  Determined, Emma follows it...

           The little girl leans over to watch Emma in the aisle as her
           entire grape juice pours into Emma's seat...

           Emma returns, hands the girl her toy. And sits. 

           In horror.  The seat -- soaked.

           That is it.  Emma wells up...

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATE DAY

           On the back of her jeans is a giant wet spot, as Emma follows
           a sympathetic flight attendant, RITA, up the aisle.
                                 RITA
                        Good news and bad news. Bad news:
                        there are no seats left in economy.  

           Smiling, Rita ushers Emma into the FIRST CLASS CABIN

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        Good news: no seats left in economy.

           Amazed, Emma eyes the upscale passengers relaxing in the
           spacious cabin.  One seat remains empty.

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        How's that for a silver lining, huh?

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my God-- Thanks.  I've never been
                        in first before!

           Emma settles into the empty seat. 

           Her seat mate is a man, 34, who does not look up. We'll call
           him the STRANGER. He has scruffy stubble, worn jeans, a ball
           cap pulled low.  He scrolls through his iPhone.  Tense. 

           Another ATTENDANT emerges with a tray of champagne flutes. 

           Emma takes one. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        They're free, right?

           When the Attendant nods, Emma takes a second. 

           This makes the Stranger look over--

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I'm not a good flier.

                                 STRANGER
                        Fantastic.

           Unimpressed, he looks back at his phone. 

           Annoyed, Emma downs the champagne... rather quickly.

           INT.  AIRPLANE / FIRST CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

           Airborne.  PASSENGERS read, sleep, watch movies. The Stranger,
           still on his phone.  But Emma, pretty looped, nervously tracks
           the progress of the plane on the digital map before her. 

           Which is when... TURBULENCE HITS

           Emma looks around, terrified. 
                                 STRANGER
                            (not looking up)
                        Just a little turbulence.

           As the cabin really starts to shake, Rita heads to the front
           of the plane.  Closes the curtain.

           The cabin gets MORE AND MORE SHAKY.  

           THE SEAT-BELT signs light up. 

                                 CAPTAIN - OVERHEAD SPEAKER
                        We've hit a rocky patch, folks.  So
                        we have turned the seat belt sign-- 

           Suddenly -- the plane PLUMMETS!

           Now even the Stranger looks nervous. 

                                 EMMA
                        We're gonna die!  

           A BUSINESS MAN across the aisle, whose wife is clutching his
           arm nervously, glares at Emma. 

                                 OVERHEAD VOICE
                        Let's try that again.  We are going
                        to be in a bit of a rocky patch for--

           Again, the voice is cut off by another 

           ...PLUMMET!

           The front curtain flies open and Emma sees Rita -- making
           the sign of the cross. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god-- We're going down!

                                 STRANGER
                        Please stop saying that.

           The plane SHUDDERS WILDLY as Emma eyes him, welling up--

                                 EMMA
                        This can't be it! The last thing I
                        told my parents was a lie! The last
                        thing they'll know about me is how
                        good I am at making stuff up--

           An enormous bump reverberates through the cabin. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god!  This is it!
           He can't handle her hysterics. Maybe if he can calm her--

                                 STRANGER
                        Why are you so good at that?

           The cabin shakes wildly.  Emma eyes the sympathetic stranger. 

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        And that's when it happened...

           Frantic, and quite drunk, it all comes POURING out:

                                 EMMA
                        My cousin Kerry came to live with us
                        when her mom died and I had to be
                        nice to her even though she was a
                        total bitch, but in genius ways so
                        my parents couldn't see it.  And she
                        was brilliant at everything.  So I
                        got very good at... not saying things. 

           The plane rocks wildly...

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I told my folks I had a big meeting
                        in New York this weekend. I wanted
                        them to be proud of me for once.
                        Truth is-- I work for this cheesy
                        company and I hate my job.  I only
                        got it because I lied in my interview-- 

                                 STRANGER
                        What about?

                                 EMMA
                        I didn't want to say I'd spent a
                        year unemployed in my parent's
                        basement, so I said I was volunteering
                        as a youth mentor, and it turns out
                        my boss is big into volunteering-- 

                                 STRANGER
                        A youth mentor... why that?

                                 EMMA
                        When I'd buy pot from my fifteen
                        year old neighbor, sometimes I'd
                        remind him to go to college.  

           The Stranger chuckles.  But Emma is emotional--

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        There's this Hershey's Kiss under my
                        desk.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        And I look at it every day and promise
                        myself: when I have the guts to quit--
                        I will eat it. No matter how stale
                        it is, or if ants have bore into
                        it... because eating ant poo will be
                        better than another day in that soul-
                        less corporate abyss.

           On the Stranger, moved...

                                 STRANGER
                        What do you want to do? 

           Another horrifying lurch--

                                 EMMA
                        I always wanted to be a photographer. 
                        I moved to New York to try. 
                            (with regret)
                        But... that all fell apart. 

           The Stranger eyes her...  intrigued. 

           TIME CUT -- LATER

           The turbulence continues. Passengers hold each other,
           terrified.  The little digital plane is over SOUTH DAKOTA. 

           And Emma is still pouring out her heart--

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        ...I also really regret not doing it
                        with a girl in college. Especially
                        because I have these recurring sexual
                        dreams about one of my best friends,
                        which must mean something right? 

           He doesn't know how to answer that...

           TIME CUT -- LATER

                                 EMMA
                        ...This VP in my office has this
                        bulletin board she calls "Fun with
                        Friends"-- Her way of bragging about
                        all the big shots she met when she
                        was at Google. There's her and Bill
                        Gates, her and Oprah, her and the
                        bass player of the Eagles. So I photo-
                        shopped her and Hitler skiing in
                        Aspen. It's been up for months and
                        no-one's said a thing...

           The Stranger laughs.

                                 STRANGER
                        A doctor's office?

                        You know-- stern doctor, inappropriate
                        power relationship with his slutty

                        have a G-spot, and he's super
                        competitive so he took it as a
                        challenge.  We did it in all these
                        weird positions with him saying: Is
                        that it?  What about now?  Finally I
                        just said: yes that's it! And he
                        starts fist-pumping the air-- he
                        does that all the time, the completely
                        earnest fist-pump-- saying 'Describe
                        it!'  So I said: 'like a flower
                        opening up.  And he said 'what kind?' 
                        So I said 'like a Begonia!'

                                 STRANGER
                        Your G-spot feels like a Begonia?

                                 EMMA

                        didn't tell him I hate jazz. I think
                        he thinks liking jazz makes him seem
                        sensitive-- so I don't notice he
                        only calls when he's drunk. He'll
                        call from some loud sports bar and
                        say: I want to come find your Begonia.

           The screen has flickered off.  And the turbulence seems to

                        I was my cousin's stalker.

           On the Stranger -- surprised...

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Ninth grade, she caught me stuffing
                        my bra.  Told everyone. 

                                 STRANGER
                        Ouch.

                                 EMMA
                        I was too humiliated to confront
                        her, so I wrote her this anonymous
                        letter saying I was watching her--
                        and was gonna kidnap her and lock
                        her in a sound proof room under my
                        house. 

           The Stranger eyes her, amazed.
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        But she went to the police, and the
                        principal called this emergency
                        assembly.  And having a stalker made
                        her the most popular kid at our
                        school.  And for years-- whenever I
                        saw a police car, I thought I was
                        about to be arrested.

           The Stranger laughs.

           Suddenly -- the plane plummets.  Even the Stranger is tense.

           Emma throws her head against the Stranger's arm! 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        This is it!  This is it! 

           The plane makes a thunderous sound.  And the lights go off.
           And there is IMPACT!  

           This is it.

                                 CAPTAIN-ON OVERHEAD
                        We made it guys. Welcome to Seattle. 

           The lights flicker on as passengers applaud. Shell-shocked
           PASSENGERS hug one another. Emma opens her eyes. 

           Still clutching the stranger's arm.  

           Stunned, she meets his gaze. 

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        You see, I had never considered the
                        possibility that we would land.

           Then averts her eyes.  

                                 EMMA
                        Nice... chatting.

           He looks as stunned as she.

                                 STRANGER
                        Yeah.

           Emma rises, grabs her carry on. 

           And dashes off the plane.

           EXT. STREET IN CAPITOL HILL / THE GIRLS' HOUSE - NIGHT

           The taxi speeds off, leaving Emma and her carry-on before a
           pretty three story Craftsman on a leafy street.

                        Fuck you-- in the heart.

           Emma looks up. JEMIMA, 28, glamorous in D&G, is on the
           balcony, on her cell -- furious. 

                                 JEMIMA-INTO HER PHONE (CONT'D)
                        Because that's what you're about to

           She waves down at Emma.  Clearly enjoying herself.

           But into the phone, fury--

                                 JEMIMA-INTO THE PHONE
                        Then I am gonna tell my friend at
                        Gawker about the 18 year old guy
                        who's always with you when you spend
                        your wife's money on art, Senator--

           Emma wheels her bag up to the house...

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        As Jemima, who thrives in anger when
                        anyone she loves is hurt, knows all
                        too well... we all have secrets.

           INT. THE GIRLS' HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma enters the cheerful second floor apartment. Where LISSY,
           28, East Indian, a touch prim in her button-up and pearls,
           jots notes on a case -- surrounded by legal documents. 

                                 LISSY
                        Hey! How was the trip?

           Emma's looks says it all. 

                                 LISSY (CONT'D)
                        Was it the hat?  Was it as bad as
                        you thought?

           BANGING sounds above.   

                                 EMMA
                        Is it me, or is Jemima on the balcony
                        gay-shaming an elected official?

                                 LISSY
                        He owns a bunch of her client's
                        paintings and just went bankrupt--
                        so he's selling them. Which means
                        her client's market price is about
                        to tank.
           Lissy eyes her, concerned.

                                 LISSY (CONT'D)
                        You want to talk?

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks Lissy, but today... I think
                        I've said enough. 

           Emma heads for the stairs, as Lissy watches her. Concerned. 

           INT. EMMA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma enters her cluttered room. Slightly teenage, with lots
           of 'ironic' things.  Like her Barbie bedspread. 

           Throwing down her bag, Emma cringes. Then laughs a little...

           Catching Barbie's perky smile from the pillow--

                                 EMMA
                        What? You haven't done anything really
                        embarrassing? You're plastic and
                        lack sex organs. That's embarrassing.

           But Barbie smiles back.  Un-phased.

           EXT.  PANTHER COLA FLAGSHIP OFFICE - MORNING

           In a hip area of Belltown, coffee in hand, Emma gets off a
           bus and approaches

           PANTHER COLA'S FLAGSHIP OFFICE 

           In front of the building -- SKATEBOARDERS careen off ramps. 

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        Panther Cola was founded by two
                        nineteen year olds who started out
                        selling an energy drink to guys they
                        skateboarded with--

           Panther Signs reads: SKATERS WELCOME.

           INT.  PANTHER COLA / MAIN LOBBY - MORNING

           Emma enters the busy lobby.  Graffiti of the PANTHER logo
           adorns the walls.  Monitors blast concerts and extreme sports
           footage -- events sponsored by Panther.

           The arriving PANTHER STAFF are every bit as stylish.  
                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        Those two nineteen year olds grew up
                        to be moguls, known for their grass-
                        roots marketing style. 

           Emma reaches the ELEVATOR BAY. 

           Where there is a huge FRAMED PHOTO of PETE LAWSON, 34, co-
           founder of Panther: tanned, ruggedly handsome, by a Panther
           Cola Formula One race car.

                                 EMMA-V.O. (CONT'D)
                        Pete was known for his love of high
                        profile women, and Formula One racing. 

           A caption below the photo reads: PETE LAWSON, 1973 - 2009

                                 EMMA-V.O. (CONT'D)
                        Until about a year ago-- when he hit
                        a cliff on the coast of France doing
                        180 in his Maserati. 

           Emma gets in the crowded elevator among hip PANTHER STAFF.

                                 EMMA-V.O. (CONT'D)
                        The other founder is gone too. But
                        that's more complicated-- and the
                        topic of endless speculation.

           After Sportswear and R&D, the doors open onto--

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT / PANTHER COLA - DAY

           Emma enters the vibrant hub of Panther. Bold props from
           campaigns clutter the aisles.  Smiling at colleagues, she
           passes a wall of MARKETING AWARDS, making her way to a CORNER
           OFFICE.  Knocks...

           INT.  PAUL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           PAUL, 38, a big restless boy in jeans and Pumas, works at
           his laptop with his feet on the desk -- as Emma enters.

                                 PAUL
                        Corrigan-- check this out. 

           He hits a remote. On a large TV, a sleek ad plays--

           INSERT PANTHER AD:

           An urban convenience store. TWO BOYS take cans of PANTHER
           from a fridge.
                                 ANNOUNCER'S DEEP VOICE
                        With double the carbonation of any
                        energy drink on the market, Panther
                        isn't a drink. It's payback...

           One boy shakes and opens a can BLASTING a CONCENTRATED STREAM
           of the drink at his friend. Who opens his own can. They do
           battle. Race through store. Panther spraying everywhere!

                                 ANNOUNCER'S DEEP VOICE (CONT'D)
                        ...for all the times that irritable
                        Korean store owner accused you of
                        shoplifting.

           A KOREAN STORE OWNER, 50s, appears and goes ballistic in
           Korean! The frame freezes on his FURIOUS FACE.

           Paul hits stop.  Grinning. 

           Emma looks like she's just bitten a bad nut. But when she
           turns to Paul -- she's smiling.

                                 EMMA
                        It's great!  But won't it maybe incite
                        property damage? And is it racist? 

                                 PAUL
                        Racist, no-- we did white, black,
                        and American Indian store owners. 
                        Property damage-- yes. Which means
                        lawsuits.  Which means controversy. 
                        Which means market awareness you
                        can't buy.  How was New York? 

                                 EMMA
                        Fun.

                                 PAUL
                        How were the hats?

                                 EMMA
                        They went over well.

           Emma eyes a PANTHER PUNCH hat on Paul's couch. Loathes it.

                                 PAUL
                        I knew it!  I love those stupid hats.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Emma approaches a cubicle where MILO, 24, slightly heavy,
           wears a striped hand-knit cardigan.  Milo is an odd, shy
           duck among his more stylish colleagues. 
                                 EMMA
                        Morning Milo. 

           Looking around, furtively--

                                 MILO
                        I finished the video for that band.

                                 EMMA  
                        Let's see!

           Milo ushers her to his computer screen. 

           ON MILO'S SCREEN: A hard, fast rock song plays over weird,
           funny images of BOYS dressed as old men, PLAYING ACCORDIONS. 

           The video is playful and surreal, very cool--

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        It's awesome. You better be getting
                        paid for this one.

           Milo shrugs.

                                 MILO
                        I have it for my reel.

                                 EMMA
                        Your reel is already amazing. You
                        should not be temping anymore, Milo.

           Milo looks up adoringly at CASSIE, 22, gorgeous, grooving to
           her iPod, as she passes with her mail cart. 

                                 MILO
                        Morning, Cassie!

           But Cassie so doesn't notice Milo.

                                 MILO (CONT'D)
                        I hear she wants to be an actress.  

           Emma smiles sympathetically at Milo.

           A smile that dies as she sees ARTEMIS, 36, glaring at them. 

                                 EMMA
                        Later.  The Flash is sending
                        disapproval vibes my way--

           Emma heads to HER CUBICLE.  

           Where a name plate reads:  

                       EMMA CORRIGAN, MARKETING ASSISTANT
           As she sits down, Artemis speedily approaches...

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        A big hitter poached from Google,
                        The Flash is the busiest woman alive.
                        Which is why she does that.

           Coming speedily into view, Artemis has a walk that says I am
           on the go. A walk that does not look easy.  With an armful
           of files, she is black-berrying.

                                 EMMA
                        Morning, Artemis.

           On her black-berry, Artemis does not look up.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Morning, Emma.  How was New York?

           Emma peruses her email.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        There's no need to answer The Flash. 
                        She's not listening. 

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Can you pull GQ from June '06 from
                        the archives? 

                                 EMMA
                        Sure, as soon as I finish this up
                        for Paul.

                                 ARTEMIS
                            (annoyed)
                        Never mind.

           Artemis resumes her breakneck speed -- and is gone.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        That's the beauty of the Flash. 
                        Hesitate at all-- she's got it done. 

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - LATER

           Emma is on the phone with a client as she peruses a UNICORN
           WEB SITE -- putting unicorn horns on photos of Jemima and
           her parents' cat.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        I'll have to go through all the
                        reports on sales promotions from
                        2009 to look into that...

           Emma inches her hand toward the phone...
                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE (CONT'D)
                        I agree, it's very important, very--

           With a practiced motion, Emma HANGS UP. Her full attention
           back on making Jemima a unicorn...

           Until CONNOR, 30; handsome, Emma's kryptonite, appears.

                                 CONNOR
                        Corrigan.  How's your Begonia?

           Suffering the 'inside joke' long grown tired, Emma eyes the
           pretty, potted flower on her desk -- Connor gave her.

                                 EMMA
                        Fine.  Thanks.

           But Connor never tires of it.  Touches a leaf...

                                 CONNOR
                        It says on Wikipedia they require a
                        growing medium that's never allowed
                        to dry out completely.

           On Emma, burning...

                                 EMMA
                        If you're concerned, feel free to
                        have it back any time.

           Connor grins. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I mean the plant. 

                                 CONNOR
                            (quietly)
                        You around this weekend?

           Emma wills herself to say NO...

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah.  Totally. 

           Winking, Connor moves off...

           Annoyed at herself, Emma returns to typing a dull COVER
           LETTER.  Very uninspired.

           Shoving back her chair, she looks under her desk - way back
           in the corner - at a dusty Hershey's Kiss. 

           Lost in thought...
                                 PAUL-O.S.
                        People-- Listen up! 

           Emma looks up. Paul has come out of his office.  Panicked.

                                 PAUL
                        Jack Harper is in the building! 

           On Emma, surprised.  

           But RACHEL, 27, at the next desk, bolts up...

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh my god! 

           Rachel races to the crowd of MARKETERS gathering by Paul.

           Emma follows, as Artemis speeds into the fray--

                                 ARTEMIS 
                        Why didn't I know about this?

                                 PAUL
                        None of us knew.  

                                 RACHEL
                        He must be out of rehab.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        It wasn't drugs.  He's launching
                        something new.

                                 ANOTHER MARKETER
                        It was spiritual. How many times
                        does a guy have to be spotted in
                        Tibet for you people to get that?

                                 CONNOR
                        I thought he was dead too, but they
                        didn't want the stock to fall--

           Paul eyes Connor disapprovingly.  Too far. 

                                 PAUL
                        Well he's in R&D right now-- and
                        pretty life-like. Which is great! 
                            (clearly nervous)
                        Our year's been great, lots to be
                        proud of-- Let's show him that!

           The Marketers disperse... 

           Amazed, Emma watches people hurriedly tidy their desks. 
           Connor takes out a book by Stephen Hawking, and places it
           spine-out on the edge of his desk.

           Rachel takes a framed MBA, hangs it on her cubicle wall-- 

                                 EMMA
                        You have an MBA from Harvard?

                                 RACHEL
                        It's my cousin's.  She got deported
                        and I cleared out her apartment.  

           Rachel hangs her security card on a chain over the frame --
           obscuring the name.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        What do you think he'll be like now?  

                                 EMMA
                        No clue. He was gone when I started.  

           Getting a text, Connor calls over his cubicle dramatically--

                                 CONNOR
                        JH is ascending!

           Like a drum roll...

           The elevator opens and the man and his entourage emerge.  

           Before Emma can get a look at him, a THRONG of people rise
           from their desks to gather around him...

           INT.  EMMA'S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           From her desk, Emma eyes the CROWD moving through the
           department. From her desk, Rachel has a better view. 

                                 RACHEL
                        He has Pete's dog! How sweet is that?

           The mutt, WALLOP, comes into view, bounding excitedly.

           As The CROWD gets closer...

           Emma's view clears, as bodies part... 

           And she sees: JACK HARPER, 34, handsome, slightly boyish and
           cleanly shaven, in a neat sweater and jeans.

           But why does he seem so familiar?  

           It can't be.
           Emma watches, horrified, as Rachel rises and extends her
           hand to Jack, who shakes it warmly.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Welcome back, Mr. Harper!

           Panicked, Emma rises and tries to slip through the crowd...

                                 JACK
                        Good to see you, Rachel. 

           Paul turns to Emma's desk--

                                 PAUL
                        And one of the new faces-- Emma?  

           Emma -- caught, turns back...

           Which is when Jack Harper sees her. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Jack Harper, Emma Corrigan.

           In his eyes, recognition.

           He's also very taken aback.  

                                 EMMA
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Harper.

                                 JACK
                        Yes.  Nice to meet you, Emma.

                                 PAUL
                        Emma has a strong volunteer
                        background. 

           On Emma, dying. 

                                 JACK
                        How admirable. 

           Suddenly -- Wallop bounds toward Emma's desk... 

           But Jack is faster -- pulling the dog back... 

           Then he cranes down to look at the Hershey's Kiss under her
           desk.  Studies it. 

           He rises.  

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Chocolate's bad for dogs, Emma.

           Emma tries to smile.  But her heart is POUNDING too hard.
                                 CONNOR
                        How'd you see that?

           Then Jack is off and the CROWD follows him.

           Heart racing, Emma grabs the Hershey's Kiss. And puts it in
           her desk drawer. 

           Stunned.

           INT. SKY LINE DINER - EVENING

           Their homey local greasy spoon. Jemima, Lissy and Emma wait
           for their meal in a booth, as Emma vents -- mortified.

                                 JEMIMA
                        I don't get it-- What secrets do you
                        have?

                                 EMMA
                        Everyone has secrets.

                                 LISSY
                        They can't be that bad. 

           Emma considers her friends.  Cringing.

                                 EMMA
                        I told him I want to dress like a
                        nurse and be tied up with surgical
                        tubing.  That when I couldn't make
                        it doing what I love, I came running
                        home to my parents and a pretty
                        sizable dose of Lexipro. And that I
                        lied about volunteering with troubled
                        youth-- to get my job.

           All news to them; Lissy and Jemima, shocked, mull those over.  

           Lissy, the eternal optimist--

                                 LISSY
                        Well... a guy like Jack Harper has a
                        lot on his mind. He probably doesn't
                        remember half of what you said. 

                                 EMMA
                        I also said Panther is a soulless
                        corporate abyss.  And that when I
                        don't want to deal with clients I
                        just hang up on them.

                                 LISSY
                        You do that? 
                                 EMMA
                        Yes.  Thanks Lissy. And that horrified
                        look on your face-- precisely the
                        reason he's gonna fire me.

                                 LISSY
                        I just had no idea you're so unhappy.  

                                 EMMA
                        What if I end up back in my parents'
                        basement!?

           Jemima reaches across the table.  Touches Emma's arm.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Then we'll come get you again.

           Emma smiles. 

           The waiter, WAYNE, 23, brings their food. Wayne is very cute,
           pierced in many places, and his clothes -- artfully thrashed.  

                                 JEMIMA (CONT'D)
                        Thank you Wayne!

           Wayne moves off as Jemima eyes him approvingly.

                                 LISSY 
                        So what are you going to do, Em?

                                 EMMA
                        Fight for my job.  Become the best
                        marketing assistant ever. 

                                 LISSY
                        But if you don't like the job--

                                 EMMA
                        The one thing worse than a job you
                        hate, is getting fired from it.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Breaking into your ex's house to
                        steal his Xbox because you want him
                        to feel a fraction of the loss you
                        felt all summer-- but then he and
                        his new girlfriend get home and have
                        sex on the couch you're hiding behind. 
                            (pained)
                        That's also worse.

           The girls look at her, shocked--

                                 JEMIMA (CONT'D)
                        You're right. We all have secrets.
           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           Few have arrived. But in the board room -- Emma finishes
           filling BINDERS with promotional pamphlets. 

           She gazes out at the department: her Mount Everest. 

           Spotting Artemis speed in with her morning coffee...

           Emma catches up with her.  No easy task.  

                                 ARTEMIS
                        You're here early.

                                 EMMA
                        Just getting a head start. Which I
                        have, so if there's anything you
                        want help with-- just tell me.

           Artemis stops.  Eyes her oddly.

           INT.  THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT - LATER, SAME DAY

           Emma carries a HUGE pile of MAGAZINES from the archive into
           ARTEMIS'S OFFICE, as Artemis, on the phone, waves her in --
           very happy.

           INT.  BOARD ROOM / PANTHER COLA - DAY

           Emma approaches the BOARD ROOM, take-out salad in hand. 
           Taped to the door, a hand-written sign: 

                       QUALITY TEAM EXCELLENCE -- 12:00

           But she is stopped by Milo, brown bag in hand.

                                 MILO
                        They're at their stupid meeting. 
                        Wanna come outside?

                                 EMMA
                        Actually, I'm going to the meeting.

           Milo eyes her.  Dubious.

                                 MILO
                        You want to talk about 'what's new
                        in the marketing world' on your lunch
                        hour?

                                 EMMA
                            (with distaste)
                        Is that really what they do in there?

           But bracing herself, she is on the move...
           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Emma joins the table of PANTHER STAFF, eating lunch as Paul
           talks.  Rachel is here, and Connor, and Artemis; who eyes
           Emma approvingly.

                                 PAUL
                        Mercedes rolled out four long versions
                        of the ads on their web site-- with
                        really cool interactive features. 
                        Definitely check them out.

           Connor fist-pumps the air. 

           Which Emma wishes he wouldn't do.

                                 RACHEL
                        Jack Harper's on the floor!

           Everyone turns to see -- Wallop walk by the board room.

           Then Jack comes into sight, walking through the deserted
           office. Emma turns away from the glass, suffering.

                                 CONNOR
                        What's he doing at your desk, Emma?

           Emma turns.  Indeed--

           AT HER DESK

           Jack takes something from her cubicle wall.  With horror --
           Emma watches him study it.  Knows what it is. 

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Very nervous, Emma approaches Jack -- studying the 'pamphlet.' 

           Their eyes meet.

                                 JACK
                        Is this what I think it is? 

           Jack marvels at the IMAGES of TEENS playing sports.  The
           title of the organization: 

                    M.A.R.Y. -- Mentoring At-Risk Youth.

           For Emma -- this is hell.

                                 EMMA
                        Paul wanted literature when we were
                        deciding who to make the Christmas
                        donation to.  
                                 JACK
                            (alarmed)
                        Tell me he didn't--

                                 EMMA
                        No.  We gave to the ASPCA.

                                 JACK
                        Where did you get the pictures?

                                 EMMA
                        The internet.

           He eyes a small CROSS in the corner of the pamphlet.

                                 JACK
                        Mary, as in the mother of Christ?

                                 EMMA
                        I thought religious affiliation would
                        reduce the chance of our donating.  

           From a TESTIMONIAL, by one of the "Youth" -- Jack reads:  

                                 JACK
                        "Until I met my Mary mentor, my world
                        was the street.  Now I know I can
                        beat the street."

           Jack looks at Emma -- amazed.  

           Then Jack scans the nearby offices... spotting Artemis's.  

           Again, Emma knows what he is looking at...

           Stepping toward Artemis's door, Jack studies her 'Fun With
           Friends' bulletin board. Among pictures of Artemis hanging
           out with VIPs...

           Is one of her arm-in-arm, on a ski-lift, with Hitler.

           Jack turns back to Emma.  Grave.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We need to talk. 

           He eyes the BOARD ROOM: everyone is at the glass WATCHING.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        My office, 4:30.  

           Emma nods.  Grim.  As Jack heads off.
           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT / BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Emma returns to the board room.  All eyes on her.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        What did Harper want? 

                                 EMMA
                        He's just familiar with the
                        organization I volunteered with.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mary? I still want to get involved
                        with that-- seriously.

           Emma, tense, tries to smile. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma gets off the elevator in a sleek waiting room.  On the
           wall is a framed photo of Jack and Pete -- as teenagers;
           arms around each other, by a beat up van. Holding skateboards.

           At the far end are two assistants; SKY and HEATHER, both in
           their 20s.  Their desk, half way between two offices... 

           One is Jack's.  The other still has Pete's name plate on it. 

           With dread, Emma approaches the desk:

                                 SKY
                        Dropping something off?

                                 EMMA
                        No, I'm here to see Mr. Harper. 
                        Emma Corrigan. 

           Sky and Heather eye each other: yeah right.

                                 SKY
                        Aren't you in Marketing?

           Emma nods.  Dubious, Sky picks up the phone--

                                 SKY - INTO PHONE
                        Emma Corrigan from--

           Very surprised, she hangs up. 

                                 SKY
                        Go on in.

           Emma heads for Jack's door.  Walking the plank...
           INT.  JACK HARPER'S CORNER OFFICE - DAY

           Emma enters.  The office is huge, with a view of Lake
           Washington.  Filing cartons clutter the floor. Jack is at
           the window, somber. 

           Emma closes the door behind her, as he turns to her.  

                                 JACK
                        We both know this is awkward.

           Emma breaks--

                                 EMMA
                        So don't do it! Please!  Yes, I made
                        up a non-profit, no I have not been
                        the most diligent employee, but I
                        was here at seven this morning, I
                        will never drop another call-- I
                        just can't lose this job!

                                 JACK
                        I didn't ask you here to fire you.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh.  

                                 JACK
                        I probably should.  It's clear what
                        you think of what we do here.

           On Emma, dying.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        But that wouldn't be fair play.  And
                        actually... I wanted to thank you.

           Jack hands her a NAPKIN from his desk.

           Emma studies it.  It bears the insignia of the airline and
           is covered in Jack's messy scrawl...

                      ...ON A DATE AND CHAMPAGNE JUST APPEARS...

                   ...WISH I HAD DONE IT WITH A GIRL IN COLLEGE... 

                      ...WAS MY COUSIN'S STALKER...

           She is horrified.

                                 EMMA
                        You took notes?

           Emma starts to crumple the napkin.
                                 JACK
                        Can I have that back?

           Emma stares at him strangely.  Reluctant, hands it over.

                                 EMMA
                        That feels wrong.

                                 JACK
                        No-one will see it.  Promise.  I get
                        my ideas from people.  Marketing is
                        about telling a story.  Not any story. 
                        It has to affirm something
                        significant, that a lot of people
                        feel.  And on that plane-- you gave
                        me an idea for a new one.  

                                 EMMA
                        I did?

                                 JACK
                        I was up all last night working on
                        it-- so you can't imagine how it did
                        my head in, seeing you here.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I think I can. 

           Jack smiles.  Fair enough.

                                 JACK
                        Well... not to give credit where
                        credit's due-- that felt wrong.  So
                        thank you, Emma. For a lot of reasons
                        I can't get into... it's good to
                        have something to be excited about
                        right now. 

           Emma glances down at the filing boxes.  Labelled: PETE LAWSON.

                                 EMMA
                        I can imagine.

                                 JACK
                        I should get back to work. 

                                 EMMA
                        Of course.  And... thank you. For
                        not firing me.  

           Emma heads for the door.  

                                 JACK
                        Pete would have loved your fake non-
                        profit. 
           Emma turns back.  Surprised.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Even more than I did.  He would have
                        thought it was hilarious.  The
                        religious affiliation-- nice touch. 

           Emma eyes him, taken aback.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Can't the CEO of a cheesy, soulless
                        corporate abyss have a sense of humor?  

                                 EMMA
                        I didn't mean that--

                                 JACK
                        Actually, you did.  

           His direct gaze makes Emma blush.

                                 EMMA
                        I guess he can.

           INT. WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

           Very relieved to be out of there, Emma closes the door. Sky
           and Heather eye her curiously. 

           As she walks past PETE'S OFFICE, Emma sees GUYS IN SUITS
           combing through more cartons of files.

           INT.  SKY LINE DINER - EVENING

           Jemima, Lissy, and Emma eat dinner.

                                 LISSY
                        So what's this 'story' you inspired? 

                                 EMMA
                        Who cares?  A new way of selling an
                        energy drink.  I'm just glad I'm not
                        fired.

                                 JEMIMA
                        He's still not saying where he was
                        last year?

                                 EMMA
                        No.  But he seems pretty preoccupied
                        with something.  

           Wayne approaches, sets down their plates.
                                 WAYNE
                        By the way ladies-- Tenderloin. 
                        This weekend.

                                 JEMIMA
                        What's that?

                                 WAYNE
                        People bust into an abandoned
                        warehouse and play old school punk
                        rock.

                                 LISSY
                        Really?

                                 WAYNE
                        Yeah. Very underground, very word of
                        mouth.  You should come.

           Wayne moves off.  Jemima eyes him adoringly.

                                 JEMIMA
                        I love 23 year olds. Not an ounce of
                        body fat, in the full glory of their
                        sexual peak... And either charming
                        or naive enough to think we're punk
                        rock.

                                 EMMA
                        What are you talking about? Lissy
                        was very--

           Lissy kicks her under the table.  Shoots her WARNING EYES. 

                                 JEMIMA
                        Lissy was very what?

                                 EMMA
                        Nothing.

           Jemima stares suspiciously at Emma.  Then Lissy.

           EXT. SKY LINE DINER - NIGHT 

           Emma and Lissy wait outside of the diner for Jemima; who is
           still inside.

                                 EMMA
                        Jemima doesn't know?

                                 LISSY 
                        No.  And if she did-- she'd tease me
                        mercilessly. 
                                 EMMA
                        Probably true.

                                 LISSY 
                        I really don't want to relive ninth
                        grade every day for the rest of my
                        life, thanks. 

                                 EMMA
                        It wasn't that bad.

           Lissy's look says she disagrees. 

           Jemima heads out of the diner--

                                 LISSY
                        I mean it.  Not a word.

           INT. BOARD ROOM / MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAYS LATER

           Emma is in the board room -- packed standing room only with
           anxious MARKETERS -- waiting for Jack Harper's arrival. 

                                 RACHEL
                        It's gotta be that he's selling the
                        company.  What else could it be?

                                 CONNOR
                        Word is the Dublin office is selling
                        their bottling plant.

                                 ANOTHER MARKETER
                        Atlanta too.

                                 YET ANOTHER MARKETER
                        And Legal's been camped out in
                        Harper's office for days--

                                 CONNOR
                        We're screwed. Any new owner will
                        out source marketing.  

           A hush goes over the room as Jack and Paul walk in.  The
           mood, fraught.

           Jack takes his place at the front of the room.  Studies the
           faces.  The silence, his drum roll.

                                 JACK
                        Today in Times Square there are six
                        billboards for energy drinks.  Not
                        Panther.  But hell, they might as
                        well be-- the look, the message.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We've got six brands riding our ass
                        hard into a market we built. What do
                        we do?
                            (dramatic pause)
                        We tell a radically new story.  The
                        new Panther is about the secret dream
                        you haven't got up the guts to act
                        on.  Yet.

           On Emma, taken aback.  By how passionately Jack speaks.  

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Maybe it's that thing you lie in bed
                        alone at four a.m., thinking about. 

           Jack's eyes meet Emma's.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Or on the way to the job you hate.  

           She smiles a little.  Can't help it. 

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Our conceptual space-- the gap between
                        what you secretly want to be and
                        what you are.  And Panther-- your
                        promise to yourself: some day you
                        will act on that dream. 

           A lot of the Marketers are smiling.  Nodding. 

                                 ARTEMIS
                        I've said it over and over-- Panther
                        appeals to men by affirming what
                        they think they are: faster, stronger,
                        cooler.  But women buy things because
                        of what they think they aren't: pretty
                        enough, thin enough, successful
                        enough. With this-- we could finally
                        penetrate our one untapped market.  

           Connor FIST PUMPS the air enthusiastically. 

                                 CONNOR
                        JH is back!

           As applause spreads through the room...

           Jack stares at Connor oddly. Realizing. 

           Then meets Emma's gaze.  And the tiniest of smiles plays on
           his lips.  Mortified, Emma puts her face in her hand.
                                 JACK
                        What do you think, Emma-- with the
                        strong volunteer background?  

           Emma looks up, taken aback.  

           Very aware off all of her colleagues staring at her.

           But the tension of the moment... is kind of delicious.

                                 EMMA
                        I think it feels very... recognizable. 

           Connor eyes Jack and Emma.  Curious.

                                 JACK
                        Not too recognizable, though?  

                                 EMMA
                        No. Just authentic. 

                                 JACK
                        Good.  That's what it has to be. 
                        Paul-- Corona's the number one import
                        beer in America.  Why?

                                 PAUL
                        A bartender in Florida shoved a lemon
                        in one and bet his friend it would
                        catch on. 

                                 JACK
                        Exactly.  Rituals.  That's what you
                        need to be thinking about.  Simple,
                        everyday ways people remind themselves
                        of their secrets. 

           Emma, mulling Jack's words...

           Looks through the glass -- out to her desk. Actually under
           her desk.  Getting an idea...

           INT. THE JEMIMA HUNTER GALLERY / BALLARD - DAY

           Jemima's small, hip art gallery in Ballard; a leafy area of
           cafes and bars. A few PATRONS look at paintings as Emma chats
           excitedly to Jemima and Lissy at Jemima's desk.

                                 EMMA
                        I never thought marketing could be
                        inspiring.  But he's so passionate
                        about it-- it's sort of infectious. 
                        He's always been the idea guy.  In
                        2004,  Pete took over operations, so
                        Jack could focus solely on branding--
           Lissy and Jemima stare at each other.  Oddly.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Who are you?

                                 LISSY
                        A girl with a crush on Jack Harper.

                                 EMMA
                        Not a crush.

           But she is smiling.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        It's just flattering when someone
                        takes your private thoughts, riffs
                        on them and turns them into something
                        cool.

                                 JEMIMA
                        A new way to sell an energy drink?

                                 EMMA
                        A story, Jemima.  Marketing is about
                        telling a story. 

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

           From her desk drawer, Emma takes the Hershey's Kiss and puts
           it back under her desk.  

           Then replaces it with: a can of PANTHER COLA.

           From her desk, Rachel pipes up--

                                 RACHEL
                        Harper sure honed in on you yesterday.  

                                 EMMA
                        He asked me a question, Rachel. 

           But Emma smiles to herself.  Enjoying the suggestion.

           EXT. SKATE RAMPS IN FRONT OF PANTHER - DAY

           Emma approaches Milo, on a bench eating his lunch, watching
           the skateboarders fly over ramps. Specifically: Cassie --
           agile and at ease on her board, her skirt very short. 

           Emma sits beside him.

                                 EMMA
                        What if I said I want you to make a
                        video clip, cool enough people would
                        actually send it to each other. 
                                 MILO
                        I'd say I do that all the time.

                                 EMMA
                        What about one based on an idea I
                        have for the new campaign?

                                 MILO
                        I'd say I'm a temp, dream on.

           Emma eyes Cassie.  Smiling.

                                 EMMA
                        But, Milo... what's the one thing
                        you know about her? 

           Now he's listening...

           INT. PARK - DAYS LATER

           A leafy park. A 'shoot' in progress. The 'set' is an 'office'
           in the middle of the grass.  Filing cabinets, office chairs. 
           Surreal and odd.  Emma watches as Milo, very serious, moves
           with a digital camera -- toward the desk where Cassie, dressed
           in 'boring office clothes,' sits.

           Under the desk is a CAN of PANTHER COLA. 

           When he reaches the desk, Emma yells--

                                 EMMA
                        Cue Cassie!

           Cassie reaches down and grabs the can. Milo stops filming.

                                 MILO
                        That was perfect.

                                 CASSIE
                        Really? I wasn't feeling it-- 

                                 MILO
                        Okay people-- Let's go again!

           Emma grins, rolling her eyes.  

           INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           At her desk, Emma jots notes:

                        Your secret dreams.  Keep them close.

           She crosses it out.  Tries another:

                        You are not what you do.  Yet.
           Emma stops.  Sets the note pad down.

           Thinking.

           And looks below the bed...

           Pulling out a dusty portfolio she flips through photos she
           has taken; mostly PORTRAITS. Stopping at one she likes...

           She takes it out and tacks it on the wall.  

           Flipping through the portfolio, she finds another she likes.  

           Tacks it up too.  

           Then another.

           One makes her pause: LISSY, 13, tiny with tragically dorky
           glasses, a Ramones shirt, spiked hair, and a guitar nearly
           as big as her.

           Emma smiles. Grabs her pad and jots:

                     We all have secrets...

           The she looks up again at the young photo of Lissy. 

           Considering...

           EXT.  YARD OF OLD WAREHOUSE - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

           Emma and Lissy walk through an unlit industrial yard by an
           abandoned warehouse, where PUNK ROCK KIDS make their way
           toward a door that's been torn open.

                                 LISSY
                        I can't believe you dragged me here! 
                        I have court in the morning.

           They reach the door.  PUNK ROCK KIDS disappear into the
           darkness beyond, as Emma and Lissy eye each other.  

           INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma and Lissy emerge in the MASSIVE INNER ROOM -- scattered
           with industrial debris.  In the center, a HUNDRED PEOPLE
           CLUSTER around a band.  

           As a hard, fast Punk song begins-- 

                                 EMMA 
                        This is pretty amazing.

           Wayne emerges from the crowd.  Yells over the music--
                                 WAYNE
                        You came!?  You want drinks?  My
                        friend sells booze at the back.

                                 EMMA
                        In a bit.

           Wayne moves off.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I steal your clothes, Lissy.  I've
                        seen the CDs in the back of your
                        closet.  So the Iron and Wine on
                        your iPod-- not fooling me.

           Emma starts to walk toward the crowd.  But Lissy hangs back.  

                                 LISSY
                        I'll watch from here.

           Emma turns back--

                                 EMMA
                        If you do not get your ass up here--
                        I will play Jemima your cover of
                        'Anarchy in the U.K.' at the freshie
                        talent show.

           On Lissy, cringing.

                                 LISSY
                        Such a miscalculation.

           Reluctantly, Lissy follows Emma 

           And they push into THE CROWD.

           Emma smiles -- as Lissy starts to move to the music, edging
           to the band... 

           Until Emma loses her to the crowd completely.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Emma, very nervous, is with Milo at his computer. 

                                 MILO
                        Ready?

           Emma nods. Milo hits PLAY.

           INSERT VIDEO: 

           Cassie, demure, works away in her 'office.' 
           She looks under her desk and grabs the can of Panther Cola. 
           Drinks it down, and HURLS the desk on its side.  Goes
           ballistic. Files scatter.  As cool, joyful music plays! 
           Then she storms off--

              On screen: For your secret rebellion. Whatever it is. 

           Now the image is REVERSED. Cassie returns to her desk, freaks
           out, and puts the can of Panther Cola under her desk.  Back
           to normal.  At work.  Sounds of a busy office resume...

              On screen: Keep it close.   

                                 MILO (CONT'D)
                        What do you think?

           On Emma, excited.

                                 EMMA
                        I think it's great, Milo.

                                 MILO
                        Yeah?

           Emma walks through the busy aisles to PAUL'S OFFICE

           Knocking, she pops her head in.  Paul looks up.

                                 EMMA
                        I just sent you something. 

                                 PAUL
                        Okay. 

           Paul goes back to work, and Emma walks out of the room. 
           Returns to her desk. Eying Milo at his.  

           Anxious...

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - END OF DAY

           Emma packs up her stuff, eying Paul's office -- where he is
           on the phone.  Having not said a thing about the clip.  

           Disappointed, Emma heads for the elevator.

           EXT.  PANTHER COLA - END OF DAY

           A little down, Emma heads toward the bus stop.

                                 JACK-O.C.
                        Emma!

           Emma turns to Jack, very handsome in a TUX, with Sky, on the
           phone, as they head from the building.
                                 JACK
                        The viral approach is smart.  I think
                        you really might have something there.

                                 EMMA
                        I thought Paul hated it. He hasn't
                        said a thing. 

                                 JACK
                        He likes it. But I wanted to be the
                        one to tell you. I also want to
                        commission some more.
                            (to Sky)
                        Can you give us a minute?

           Nodding, Sky moves off--

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Pretty above and beyond for a person
                        calling it in at a job she hates.

                                 EMMA
                        It was mostly Milo.

                                 JACK
                        You put the can under the desk. 
                        It's a ritual. And it's good.  

                                 EMMA
                        I'm trying to turn over a new leaf.

           Jack stares at her oddly.

                                 JACK
                        What a shame.  I thought we'd skipped
                        that.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        The making a good impression stage.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay.  The campaign speaks to me for
                        obvious reasons.  But mostly-- I
                        didn't want you to think I'm a write
                        off.

           On Jack, very taken aback.  The silence between them loaded.

           Into which -- Sky approaches.  

                                 SKY
                        You have to get in the car now, Jack-- 
                                 JACK
                        I have this chamber of commerce thing. 

                                 SKY 
                        He's the key note speaker!

                                 JACK
                        Walk with me--

           They head toward Jack's car.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I already know the company I want to
                        work on the clips. They rep the best
                        commercial directors in the city. 

                                 EMMA
                        What would they be doing?

                                 JACK
                        Directing them! 

           Emma's face falls.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        They're supposed to be bare bones, I
                        know-- but we can pump some production
                        value into them. 

           And with that, Jack is in the car.  And so is Sky, and they
           are off.  

           As Emma watches them drive off. Dejected.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

           Emma is with Milo in his cubicle, as Connor approaches.

                                 CONNOR
                        Love the clip, guys.  

           Emma smiles, half-heartedly.

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks.

           Connor lingers, but Emma and Milo are preoccupied.

                                 MILO
                        It's not a big deal. I'll have it
                        for my reel.

                                 EMMA
                        It is a big deal, actually.  
           Gathering courage, Emma rises and heads for the elevator.

           On Connor -- disturbed.  Where's the love?

           INT.  WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE JACK HARPER'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emerging from the elevator, Emma finds the waiting room
           outside Jack's office empty.  She looks in Jack's office.

           Empty.

           Then she hears his voice from the office that was Pete's. 
           She peeks in.

           At the desk, Jack has just ended a call, and is staring off
           into space, the phone still in his hand. 

           Emma is about to speak, when--

           Jack SMASHES the receiver down onto the phone. 

           Then Jack picks up the phone and throws it at the wall.

           Very weirded out, Emma backs away from the door... and walks
           quickly to the elevator.  Hits the button.

           Cringing -- when the elevator bell rings in the silence of
           the waiting room.  Dying for it to open...

                                 JACK-O.C.
                        Emma?

           Emma turns.  Jack, flushed, is at the door of Pete's office.  

                                 JACK
                        You saw that, didn't you?

                                 EMMA
                        What?  No.  Yes. 

           On Jack, awkward.

                                 JACK
                        If you don't mind-- please don't
                        mention that to anyone.

                                 EMMA
                        Of course not.

                                 JACK
                        You must have come up here for a
                        reason. 
                                 EMMA
                        Now's not the time.  Clearly you're
                        dealing with something--

                                 JACK
                        There probably won't be a better
                        time for a while.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. 
                            (bracing herself)
                        This production company thing seems
                        unfair. And kind of lame.

           On Jack, surprised.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        You and Pete were known for not
                        relying on outside firms.  Your
                        campaigns were what you thought were
                        cool and funny and relatable. Which
                        this is. A guy messing around with a
                        camera. A guy with a ton of talent,
                        who did it on his own time. So don't
                        you think you owe him a look at his
                        reel-- before you hire someone else?

           Jack is disconcerted.  In fact... angry.

                                 JACK
                        I'll take that into consideration.

           Jack turns into Pete's office.  Closing the door.

           Leaving Emma alone. Very weirded out.

           INT. EMMA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Arriving home, a little defeated, Emma flips on the lights
           in the living room.  To see -- a massive new TV and SPEAKERS. 

           As Emma puts down her purse, she spots -- on the floor, THE
           LARGE BOX they came in.  

           Emma stares at the box strangely.  

                                 EMMA
                        Lissy!  Jemima!

           Getting no response, Emma kneels down and looks INSIDE THE
           BOX. Then crawls inside it. 

           Staring up at the corrugated cardboard 'roof.'

           Her phone rings.  She pulls it from her pocket.
           It reads: PRIVATE NUMBER.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE 
                        Hello?

                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE
                        You were right.

                                 EMMA
                        Mr. Harper!?   

           The following is INTERCUT between Emma in the cardboard box
           and Jack in his spacious living room.

                                 JACK 
                        Pete would've said exactly what you
                        said today.  We always caught each
                        other-- when we were being idiots.

           On Emma, amazed.

                                 EMMA
                        I thought you were mad at me.

                                 JACK
                        I was.  It scared me. How off my
                        instincts were.  Very few people are
                        candid with me since I got back. 
                        Except you.  So can you call me Jack? 
                        We are colleagues. 

                                 EMMA
                        Colleagues, yeah. You took your
                        company public at twenty seven--
                        that milestone year I was in my
                        parent's basement hitting up a kid I
                        used to baby sit for pot.

           Jack chuckles--

                                 JACK
                        Most people have a problem with truth
                        if it makes them look bad.  Not you. 

                                 EMMA
                        Just not with you. You know every
                        embarrassing thing about me. Why
                        lie? 

                                 JACK
                        So you can tell me anything?

                                 EMMA
                        Sure.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Right now, there's this big box in
                        my living room, and I sort of want
                        to crawl into it.  

                                 JACK
                        I did that!  A dishwasher box. I was
                        six.  It was great in there.

                                 EMMA
                        Right?  Don't you wish lying in a
                        box still could make it all better?

                                 JACK
                        Lately.  All the time.

           In the pregnant pause by both of them... 

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Emma--

                                 EMMA
                        What, Jack?

                                 JEMIMA-O.S.
                        Why the hell are you in a box?

           Jemima, just home, is staring down at Emma.

                                 JACK
                            (laughing)
                        Are you actually in the box?!

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks so much for your feedback!

           Emma hangs up the phone.  Annoyed. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I was on a work call.

           Gets out of the box.  Trying for dignity.  

                                 JEMIMA
                        Guess what closeted gay Senator is
                        not selling my client's work, and
                        sent me that.

                                 EMMA
                        You gay shamed a Senator, and he
                        sent you a TV?  That's messed up. 

           Jemima smiles at the massive TV.
                                 JEMIMA
                        So is lying in a box, all giddy,
                        talking to your boss.

           On Emma, caught out--

                                 JEMIMA (CONT'D)
                        I knew it!  I so called it!

           Emma walks out, hiding her very giddy smile.

           INT.  PANTHER LOBBY - MORNING

           This morning Emma enjoys arriving for work. 

           Passing Cassie giving a tour, she high-fives her...

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT / PANTHER COLA - MORNING

           Getting off the elevator, Emma is all smiles.  

           Beams at Rachel as she reaches her desk.

                                 EMMA
                        Morning Rachel!

           But Rachel looks uneasy.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        What?

           Emma follows Rachel's gaze to PAUL'S OFFICE: filled with
           Marketers.  Laughing. 

           INT. PAUL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma enters.  The Marketers are watching the large screen on
           Paul's office wall.  

           And Emma's face falls...

           Because they are watching a YouTube clip, titled: 

                           PANTHER GIRL GOES MENTAL

           Set to Eye Of The Tiger... Emma, in her 'Panther Punch' hat,
           fights the kid, TYLER, at Pier 91.  The footage -- filmed on
           a kid's cell -- has been edited: think lots of slow motion
           of Emma's awkward slaps, punches and angry expressions.  

           It is hard to imagine a grown woman looking sillier. 

                                 EMMA
                        I'm so sorry, Paul.
                                 PAUL
                        Why?  There's been over three hundred
                        thousand hits. 

                                 JACK-O.C.
                        What are you guys watching?

           Dying, Emma turns...

           Jack is behind her in the doorway.  

           He eyes the screen.  Amazed.

                                 EMMA 
                        He was... very rude.

                                 PAUL
                        Well you showed him!  

           Paul fast-forwards / reverses the image -- making Emma on
           screen slap the twelve year old over and over again.

           Which the Marketers think is hilarious. 

                                 JACK
                        That is one stupid hat.  

           Jack's words silence the room.

                                 EMMA
                        It is. In fact-- I can't imagine
                        anything on a person's head that
                        would invite more ridicule.

           Paul looks at Emma.  Pissed.

                                 PAUL
                        You said you liked it!  You said it
                        went over well.

                                 EMMA
                        I was lying, Paul. Didn't you find
                        it weird no-one else in the department
                        wanted a free trip to New York!?  

           On Paul, disconcerted.  And in that tense silence--

                                 JACK
                        A minute in the board room, Emma?

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Jack closes the glass door behind them. And they are alone --
           in a fishbowl. 
                                 EMMA 
                        You realize there are about eighty
                        people watching us.

                                 JACK
                        Which is why I brought a prop.

           Jack puts Milo's reel in the DVD player, and a MUSIC VIDEO
           comes on screen: luscious, sweet and colorful. 

           Emma and Jack stand before it, watching it.  

           But certainly not each other.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        He is talented.  I'm about to tell
                        Paul to let him direct the new clips. 

                                 EMMA
                        Can I give him a thumbs up, then? 
                        Because I think he might pass out. 

           Emma looks through the glass: at Milo, not subtly -- staring
           at them watch his reel.  Very anxious.

                                 JACK
                        Definitely.

           When Emma gives him a thumbs up -- Milo beams.  And raises
           his arms.  Victorious!  Racing off through the aisles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Emma... what I'm about to ask you is
                        completely inappropriate. Given our
                        circumstances professionally.

                                 EMMA
                        I fought a twelve year old. 
                        Inappropriate doesn't scare me.

                                 JACK
                        Okay.  Because that's what I've wanted
                        to be with you for a while now.

           On Emma, thrilled, but trying to look very professional, for
           all the prying eyes beyond the glass. 

                                 EMMA
                        How inappropriate are we talking? 

                                 JACK
                        I thought we could start with dinner.

           In her most professional voice--
                                 EMMA
                        I think that could be arranged.

           Emma tries very hard not to show her excitement... 

           As THROUGH THE GLASS

           Connor watches she and Jack.  Annoyed.

           INT.  THE GIRLS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jack waits in the living room with Jemima, as Lissy fixes
           them drinks.  

                                 JEMIMA
                        Emma will be just a few minutes. So,
                        Jack... what do you do?

                                 JACK
                        I'm in business.  What about you?

           Lissy hands Jack a drink.

                                 LISSY
                        Oh please.  We know who you are. 
                        And I'm so sorry about what happened
                        to your friend.

                                 JACK
                        Thank you, Lissy.

           INT.  EMMA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma rushes to get ready. Excited. As a KNOCK sounds at her
           door--

                                 JACK-THROUGH THE DOOR
                        Can I come in?

           Panicked, Emma surveys her messy room.  Then races to close
           drawers -- shove clothes under the bed -- push up her push-
           up bra -- and open the door--

           'Relaxed.'  

                                 EMMA
                        Hey.

           Jack enters her room, fascinated...

                                 JACK
                        Which one do you have the dreams
                        about: Lissy or Jemima?

           Emma blushes--
                                 EMMA
                        That I'll never tell.

           Jack explores the room.  Fascinated.  Which makes Emma uneasy. 
           Eying her BARBIE BEDSPREAD:

                                 JACK
                        Nice blanket.

                                 EMMA
                        It's ironic. 

           Jack eyes her framed photos on her dresser of Lissy and Jemima
           and various family pets -- many with 'unicorn horns.'

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        So are those. 
                            (embarrassed)
                        There's this website.

           Smiling, Jack eyes the far wall -- now covered in tacked up
           PORTRAITS. 

           He stares at them.  Then Emma. Impressed.

                                 JACK
                        You are serious about photography.

                                 EMMA
                        Was. Let's go.

           As Emma ushers Jack from the room, his phone BEEPS.  

           Reading a text: his face falls.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Everything okay?

           Jack looks up, a little flustered.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah. 

           INT.  FANCY RESTAURANT BY WATER - NIGHT

           A cozy, posh restaurant. Jack and Emma have just settled at
           their table.

                                 EMMA
                        This is so weird.

                                 JACK
                        What do you mean?
                                 EMMA
                        You knowing all my secrets.  Usually
                        on a first date you might test the
                        waters with one. You know, something
                        light--

                                 JACK
                        --Like how if I open your purse later,
                        there'd be a roll of toilet paper
                        from the bathroom in it? 

           Emma laughs--

                                 EMMA
                        Yes!  I mean no. I'm not going to do
                        that. 

                                 JACK
                        Why?  It's three-ply here, very soft.
                        I'll be disappointed if you don't.

                                 EMMA
                        I'll think about it. Point is, you
                        tell your secrets over months,
                        years... and maybe you get to the
                        doctor porn but I'm not sure you
                        ever get to 'I was my cousin's
                        stalker.' 

           Jack chuckles.

                                 JACK
                        One of my favorites.

                                 EMMA
                        So how does a first date go when you
                        know all the... weird, unsettling
                        things about me?

           Jack nods to a WAITER, who appears a bottle of champagne:  

                                 JACK
                        Like this.

                                 WAITER
                        Krug's Clos de Mesnil, Sir. Miss.

                                 EMMA
                            (charmed)
                        ...With Champagne just appearing.  

           The WAITER fills their glasses.

                                 JACK
                        There are upsides to all that truth.  
           Jack's phone makes a sound.  He checks it.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Shit.  Sorry.  I have a bit of a
                        situation I'm monitoring. 

           Emma waits for Jack to send a text.  Not a short one.

           Then he raises his glass to hers, in a toast.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        To... being way past good impressions.

           TIME CUT -- LATER

           Over appetizers, Emma talks as Jack listens intently.

                                 EMMA
                        I had to get out of my parents'
                        basement, so I applied for a job
                        with my cousin.  A few weeks later,
                        we're at dinner with my parents--
                        she slips me a standard rejection
                        letter from her HR department. 
                        Doesn't say a word. 

                                 JACK
                        Christ.  She sounds like a nightmare.

                                 EMMA
                        She's half the reason I moved to New
                        York.  I'm exaggerating.  But not
                        totally.  I went there to... be
                        something very different.  Hard to
                        do in your home town.

                                 JACK
                        What made you come back?

                                 EMMA
                        I've been talking too much.

                                 JACK
                        I'm interested. 

                                 EMMA
                        New York... 

           Emma's smile dies.  This, still a sore spot.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        My apartment flooded.  The global
                        economy collapsed.  The photographer
                        I was working for went bust.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        And the whole art world thing...
                        seemed really unrealistic. 

           Emma shakes that off.  Smiles.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Here I've been going on and on...
                        but what about you?

                                 JACK
                        What about me?

                                 EMMA
                        Where were you last year?

           On Jack, tense.  His words, a little cold--

                                 JACK
                        That's not something I feel
                        comfortable talking about. 

                                 EMMA
                            (stung)
                        Oh.  Okay.

           Jack's PHONE RINGS. 

                                 JACK
                        I have to take this.

                                 EMMA
                        Of course.

           Jack slips out the doors to a balcony overlooking the water. 

           INT.  FANCY RESTAURANT BY WATER - NIGHT - LATER

           It's been way too long. The main course waits. Emma, feeling
           insulted, is aware of people glancing at her. Curious.

           A WAITER approaches.  Delicate.

                                 WAITER
                        Did you want me to put those back in
                        the oven?

           Jack returns.  Flustered. 

                                 JACK
                        I'm so sorry.  

           The Waiter moves off.
                                 EMMA
                        Do you want to talk about it?

                                 JACK
                        No. 

           There is an awkward silence.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        It's a work thing. It's complicated.

                                 EMMA
                        Try me.

                                 JACK
                            (sharp)
                        I can't, Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Is it the same reason you murdered
                        the phone the other day?

           Jack eyes her.  Annoyed.

                                 JACK
                        Some secrets are a little more
                        important than 'I hate my job,' or
                        'I want to be spanked by a medical
                        professional.'

           On Emma, very taken aback.  And feeling very exposed.

                                 EMMA
                        Are you sure it's the secrets you're
                        talking about? 

                                 JACK
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Because I think what you really mean
                        is some people are more important
                        than others.   

                                 JACK
                        What?  No!

           But Emma sets her napkin on the table.  And rises.

                                 EMMA
                        If you'll excuse me-- 

           And with that, Emma is moving through the restaurant...
           EXT.  STREET NEAR FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

           Emma is in a crowded bus stop near the restaurant.  Jack
           pulls up in his car.  Jumps out.

                                 JACK
                        You're not taking the bus home! 

           Jack gets dirty looks from OTHER PEOPLE at the bus stop.

                                 EMMA
                        There's nothing wrong with public
                        transportation.

                                 JACK
                        Sorry. Bad choice of words.  I mean--
                        I always see a date to her door.  

                                 EMMA
                        This was not a date. People on dates
                        do not leave each other for half an
                        hour to watch their food get cold. 
                        People on dates share things. 
                            (the crux)
                        You know more about me than anyone
                        has ever known-- but you don't trust
                        me enough to tell me anything about
                        your life.  Or even to try. 

           The BUS lumbers up.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Later, Mr. Harper.

           Emma gets on.  As Jack watches her.  Frustrated.

           EXT.  THE SKATE RAMPS OUTSIDE PANTHER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The concrete expanse in front of the Panther Office is
           floodlit -- busy with TEENAGERS skateboarding. 

           And Jack.  His baseball hat pushed low.  At ease on his board.  

           Two TEENAGE SKATERS watch him--

                                 TEENAGE SKATER
                        The old guy's back.  

                                 JACK
                        I heard that.  Assholes.

           Jack circles, flipping his board a few times, heads for the
           biggest ramp--
           Crouching low, jamming his foot on the ground for speed, he
           takes the ramp...

           Landing on the top deck, with ease.

           Standing on the top of the ramp, Jack looks out over the
           skate park, then up at the Panther building.

           Brooding.  Troubled.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT / EMMA'S DESK - LATER

           Emma works at her desk, a little blue.

           Artemis approaches.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Want to grab lunch?  

           On Emma -- very surprised.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           A busy lunch spot near Panther, filled with young
           professionals. Emma and Artemis chat over their food. 

                                 ARTEMIS
                        What you did with Milo, that showed
                        project management instincts. 

           On Emma, surprised.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, Artemis.  

                                 ARTEMIS
                        I'm serious.  Leadership skills. 
                        Commitment. 

           Artemis smiles.  Warmly.

                                 ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
                        Something's changed in you, Emma.
                        Since Harper got back. 

           At the mention of Jack's name, Emma's smile pales.

                                 ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
                        And I like it. 

           EXT.  PANTHER COLA - DAY

           Emma waits at the bus stop across from Panther. Across the
           street -- she sees Jack leaving Panther with Sky. He eyes
           Emma.  His expression neutral. 
           Then he gets on his phone and turns away.

           Hurt, Emma gets in line as the BUS pulls up.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Emma!

           Emma turns, hopeful... 

           But it's Connor -- who's run across the street to catch her. 

                                 CONNOR
                        I got tickets to Uri Caine with Larry
                        Grenadier on bass. Town Hall Saturday. 

           Emma looks confused. 

                                 CONNOR (CONT'D)
                        We saw him in the fall.  Amazing
                        solos, really free form.

           Emma is touched.  And somehow lying feels ridiculous...

                                 EMMA
                        That's really nice Connor, thank
                        you.  But I don't like jazz. 

                                 CONNOR
                        What?  You went on about how great
                        he was.

                                 EMMA
                        I know.  I wanted you to think we
                        had things in common. 

           On Connor, taken aback.

                                 CONNOR
                        Oh.  Okay. 

           Connor, disconcerted, watches Emma get on the bus. 

           As Emma steals a glance at Jack -- still on the phone. 
           Oblivious.

           INT. BUS - DAY

           As the packed bus nears her stop, Emma pulls the bell.  But
           watches - confused - as the bus speeds past her stop.

                                 EMMA
                        That's my stop!

           In the crowd, her voice is lost...
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Hey!

           Emma's voice is drowned out, as MANY PASSENGERS yell at the
           driver.  Because the bus is TURNING OFF THE MAIN STREET...

           Emma pushes through PASSENGERS to the bus driver.  But her
           words trail off...

           Because he has just pulled up in front of her HOUSE.

                                 DRIVER
                        This your stop?

           Emma smiles.  AMAZED.

                                 ANGRY PASSENGER
                        This ain't my stop!

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        I'd give Jack Harper another chance
                        if I were you.

                                 EMMA
                        Did he pay you?

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        That'd be a bribe, and the Metro
                        Seattle Transport Authority does not
                        take bribes.  But Panther Cola is
                        the proud new sponsor of my kid's
                        baseball team. 

           The driver, grinning, hits the doors open. 

           EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF EMMA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Emma walks up her lawn, as Jemima, on the balcony -- watches
           the bus head up the street, incredulous.

           Emma's cell rings.  She answers--

                                 JACK-OVER PHONE
                        I always take a date to her door. 
                        And you were right. I was a dick.

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK-OVER PHONE (CONT'D)
                        Is that silence you smiling? I'd
                        really like it to be.

           Emma starts jumping, happy.

           But her voice is somber--
                                 EMMA-ON PHONE
                        It might be...

           Emma is oblivious to Jemima signaling to her from above.

                                 JACK-OVER PHONE
                        Most girls melt for my bribe the bus
                        driver shtick.

                                 EMMA-ON PHONE
                        Well, I'm not most girls, Jack.

           Emma resumes jumping, adding some dance moves.  Not good
           ones.  But really getting into it...

           Jemima gives up.  Covers her face. It's just too embarrassing.

                                 EMMA-ON PHONE (CONT'D)
                        And this time-- I take you out.  

                                 JACK-OVER PHONE
                        Will you do that-- when we go out?

           Emma stops.  Looks up at Jemima -- who peeks out from behind
           her hands. Emma cannot turn around.  CANNOT.

           To the curb -- where Jack is in his car.  Grinning.

           Jemima waves at him.

                                 EMMA
                        I have to go.

           Burning with embarrassment, Emma hangs up and walks straight
           into the house.  Closing the door behind her. 

                                 JACK
                        Think she'll be coming out?

                                 JEMIMA
                        Would you?

           INT.  EMMA'S DESK / MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAYS LATER

           Emma is on the phone with Lissy; perusing the on line version
           of the Seattle weekly THE STRANGER'S night life section. 

                                 EMMA-INTO THE PHONE
                        I am such an idiot!  How am I going
                        to impress a millionaire!?

                                 LISSY-OVER THE PHONE
                        Just be yourself.
                                 EMMA-INTO THE PHONE
                        That's not a suggestion. That's you
                        working while you humor me.

                                 LISSY-OVER THE PHONE
                        You're right, I should wing this
                        deposition for a young mother who
                        stole food for her kids, to help you
                        with this--

           On Emma, taken aback.  When you put it that way.

                                 EMMA-INTO THE PHONE
                        Well I think we both know where your
                        priorities lie, Counselor.

           Emma hangs up.  Looking around... who can help?

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT / PAUL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma enters Paul's office.  Paul looks up from his desk.

                                 EMMA
                        Theoretical question?

                                 PAUL
                        Shoot.

                                 EMMA
                        When you're a little brand going up
                        against a very established brand--
                        when you can't compete financially,
                        how do you... frame your campaign?

           Paul considers.

                                 PAUL
                        Give people something they've never
                        thought of.  Farther from their normal
                        lives, the better.  Jack and Pete
                        built a brand by setting up skate-
                        parks where guys in offices could
                        tear it up on their lunch hour. 

           Emma smiles.  As it dawns on her... 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, Paul. 

                                 PAUL
                        Good to see you so engaged, Emma.
           INT. TAXI - A WEEK LATER - NIGHT

           Emma and Jack travel in the back of a taxi through dark,
           industrial streets.

                                 EMMA
                        It's very underground.  Trust me--
                        you're gonna love it.

           Jack eyes the empty streets.  Skeptical.

           Emma spots the warehouse. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Here it is!

           The taxi pulls to a stop.

                                 JACK
                        You sure?

                                 EMMA
                        It's gonna blow your mind. 

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jack eyes the dark street, the taxi's tail-lights receding. 

                                 JACK
                        It's pretty quiet out here.

                                 EMMA
                        That's the point. It's still way
                        below the radar.  Very word of mouth.

           Emma leads Jack to the hole in the fence.

           MOMENTS LATER

           As they walk through the moonlit yard, Emma is getting
           worried.  Shouldn't she see people by now?

           Emma and Jack crawl through the debris-strewn doorway... 

           Through a small, dark OUTER ROOM...

           INT. INNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           And into the massive inner room, which Emma is horrified to
           find utterly empty.

                                 EMMA
                        What the hell?

           Jack, baffled, looks around the cavernous space.  
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I swear there's this amazing party
                        tonight.  The location of which...
                            (mortified)
                        Must change.

           Emma looks around the dank room.  

           Her spirits dying.

           Jack, stepping over a stained mattress, makes a very noble
           effort not to laugh. 

           Insult to Emma's injury.

           EXT.  YARD OUTSIDE ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

           Humiliated, Emma gets off the phone as she walks quickly
           toward the street.  But Jack lingers -- staring back at the
           empty building.

                                 EMMA
                        The taxi will get us two blocks over--
                        there's a Seven Eleven there. And
                        Jemima got us a table at this cool
                        restaurant by her gallery--

                                 JACK
                        You sure?  I bet that roof has an
                        amazing view.

           Emma breaks.  The failure of the night boiling up--

                                 EMMA
                        You don't have to spin this, Jack. 
                        I am aware of how this looks.

                                 JACK
                        What do you mean?

                                 EMMA
                        Your idea of a good time is the French
                        Riviera, yacht parties, celebrity
                        DJs... And I brought you to an empty
                        warehouse that smells like pee.

           Jack stares at her intently.  Not laughing.

                                 JACK 
                        Do you always do that?

                                 EMMA
                        What?
                                 JACK
                        Be sarcastic or self-deprecating--
                        when something makes you vulnerable?

           On Emma, considering. 

                                 EMMA
                        Yes. I probably do. 
                            (disarmed)
                        I just really wanted to surprise you
                        tonight, Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Since you sat by me on that plane--
                        you haven't stopped surprising me.

           Emma smiles.  Touched.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        But for someone who claims I've told
                        them so little, you have a lot of
                        opinions about what I like to do.

           Jack starts walking toward the street.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Come on.  Let's go to Seven Eleven
                        then actually do something cool.

           EXT.  ROOF OF ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma and Jack sit on the roof of the warehouse, which does
           have a great view -- of the vast, twinkling lights of Seattle.
           Jack opens a 7-11 bag and takes out two MOON PIES, the super
           sweet cake-sandwich.

           Emma bites into hers. 

                                 EMMA
                        So good!  I don't think I've had one
                        of these in twenty years.

                                 JACK
                        That makes me really sad for you.  

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Wanna know a secret?

                                 EMMA
                        What do you think?

           Their eyes meet.  For Jack, this is hard:
                                 JACK
                        There's a 7-11 by my old school in
                        Wayne, New Jersey.  And late at night
                        last year, I'd buy these, and skate
                        in the playground. 

           Emma stares at him strangely.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        On that plane you had me at 'I ran
                        home to my parents' basement.'

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        In a rec room, where many living
                        room sets have gone to die-- I watched
                        a lot of daytime TV. And was very,
                        very scared.

                                 EMMA
                        People think you were in Tibet!

                                 JACK
                        I know.  It's awkward.

           Emma laughs.  Blown away.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You know how Pete got Wallop?  We
                        were walking past this biker bar. 
                        Every guy was twice our size.  And
                        there was that dog in a truck--
                        roasting in the sun.  Pete just
                        grabbed a two-by-four, smashed the
                        window, and took him.  That was Pete.
                        This huge heart.  Afraid of nothing.

                                 EMMA
                        It must've been so hard when he died.

           On Jack, somber.  Considering.

                                 JACK
                        We never expected Panther to take
                        off. Pete's hippie uncle had invented
                        this drink, said we should come out
                        here and try and sell it as a summer
                        job. That was it... It was just us,
                        trying stuff. The more outrageous
                        the better.  And we could. Because
                        we had each other to say the only
                        thing that matters when you're trying
                        something that will probably fail.
                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        I believe in you completely.

           On Emma, moved.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I spent years as the company grew--
                        imagining how it would all fall apart. 
                        But I never imagined having to pull
                        it off without Pete.

           Emma smiles.  Taking it in.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You're thinking, this guy is such a
                        pussy, right?

                                 EMMA
                        I'm thinking for the first time-- I
                        get this guy. 

           Jack smiles.  Stares at her, and she at him...

           And in that beat of expectant silence--

           Jack grabs Emma and KISSES her.  

           And it's electric.

           Emma opens her eyes -- as a SET OF HEADLIGHTS enter the yard
           below.  Then another.

                                 JACK
                        That, very unfortunately is my ride. 
                        And yours.  I have a flight to Madrid. 

                                 EMMA
                        Madrid?

                                 JACK
                        I have a lunch-- We're trying to
                        renew Beckham's sponsorship deal. 
                        He's being difficult.

                                 EMMA
                        You're having lunch with David Beckham
                        tomorrow?

                                 JACK
                        And some face time with Panther Spain--
                        to reassure them I'm not a junkie or
                        insane. Or in Tibet.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                            (heartfelt)
                        But thank you.  For a great night.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, this is nothing.  Next time I'll
                        take you to the dump. Or a meat-
                        packing plant.

           Jack laughs.  Ever so close to her lips...

                                 JACK
                        Can I?  One more time...?

                                 EMMA
                        Don't ask.

           Emma kisses him.  Hard. Long, and hungry...

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT / SMALL MEETING ROOM - MORNING

           Emma is with Milo in a meeting room, looking at story boards
           he has made for the new online clips. 

                                 MILO
                        I can't believe I'm actually getting
                        paid to direct something.  

                                 EMMA
                        Its about time.

                                 MILO
                        Thank you, Emma.  I mean it.

           Emma smiles. 

           Her cell rings.  The screen says: Jack. 

                                 JACK-INTO PHONE
                        Hey.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        Mom!  How are you?

           Milo grins.  Curious.

                                 MILO
                        Tell your mom she should get that
                        really low man's voice looked at.

           Emma moves out of the meeting room, into THE MAIN OFFICE

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        How's David?
                                 JACK-OVER PHONE
                        Fine.  How are things on your end?

           Emma passes the BOARD ROOM -- where PANTHER STAFFERS assemble
           samples of a new product.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        R and D's showing us the new meal
                        replacement bar.

                                 JACK-OVER PHONE
                        You must be so excited.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        Oh yeah, couldn't sleep last night. 

           Jack laughs.

                                 JACK-INTO PHONE
                        Gotta go.  Beckham's on his way back
                        from the bathroom. 

           Jack hangs up, as Emma eyes the phone, amazed.

           EXT. EMMA'S STREET - DAY

           Emma gets off the bus at the foot of her street.  Passing
           the window of the SKY LINE DINER, she is surprised to see
           Lissy at a booth with Wayne.  And clearly, what they're
           discussing -- thrills them.  

           Emma enjoys how excited Lissy looks.

           She wants to go in, but... opts to give them their privacy. 
           And heads home.

           INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Emma, fast asleep, is woken by the ringing of her cell phone
           on the night table.  Groggy, she answers. 

                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE
                        Is it too early to call?

           Coming to, Emma smiles.  Tries to sound perky.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        No! Just back from my run.  

                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE
                        You haven't run since eighth grade. 

           Emma cringes.
                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE (CONT'D)
                        I took notes, remember?

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        How's Spain?

                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE
                        I came back early. 

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        Why?

                                 JACK-OVER THE PHONE
                        To take you for breakfast.

           Emma sits up.  Beaming.

           EXT. PIKE PLACE MARKET - THAT MORNING

           A bustling, multi-level market in the heart of downtown --
           packed with TOURISTS.  Jack and Emma stand in a crowd watching
           a FISHMONGER throw huge fresh fish in high arcs over the
           heads of the crowd -- to another, who packs them in newspaper.  

                                 JACK
                        Why on earth have we come to the
                        biggest tourist trap in the city for
                        breakfast?

                                 EMMA
                        Because as a kid that's what I loved
                        about it. It's like traveling without
                        going anywhere. And because chances
                        are very low of running into anyone
                        from work. 

                                 JACK 
                        Yeah, that'd be tricky, wouldn't it?

                                 EMMA
                        Tricky?  Try one text away from being
                        the only thing anyone is talking
                        about Monday.  Come on--

           Emma walks toward the stairs.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        The restaurant's upstairs.

           INT.  PIKE PLACE MARKET / SECOND FLOOR - MORNING

           Small booths sell everything from shoes to soap to magic
           props.  Emma leads Jack through the crowded hall towards a
           grungy Chinese restaurant overlooking the water. 
                                 EMMA
                        It was my family's favorite dim sum
                        place when I was a kid--

           Spotting something -- Emma YANKS Jack behind a pillar in the
           middle of the hall.

                                 JACK
                        What are we doing?

                                 EMMA
                        We have to get out of here.

                                 JACK
                        Why?

                                 EMMA
                        My family-- they're here!  They didn't
                        see us.  We can still exit gracefully
                        if we just get behind a large group
                        and move with them--

                                 JACK
                        Graceful might be a stretch.

           Emma's cell beeps.  It's a text from Kerry: WE CAN SEE YOU

                                 EMMA
                        What the?

           Another text: ALL OF US. 

           Emma turns to a perfect reflection of she and Jack behind
           the pillar -- in the FUN HOUSE MIRROR by the magic shop.

           Another text: TOTALLY STARING AT YOU

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Ok, I get it!

           INT.  CHINESE RESTAURANT / PIKE PLACE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 

           Her worlds colliding, Emma and Jack squeeze into the way too
           tight confines of the table in the busy restaurant with:
           Linda, Dale, Nev and Kerry -- whose eyes are locked on Jack.  

                                 NEV
                        Smooth entrance.

                                 LINDA
                        Kerry and Nev grabbed us on the way
                        back from golf. 

                                 EMMA
                        Nice. Huh.  Everyone, this is--
                                 KERRY
                        Jack Harper.  Jack owns Panther. 

           Linda and Dale eye each other, surprised. 

                                 JACK
                        Guilty as charged.

           Kerry extends her hand to Jack.  Which Jack shakes heartily.

                                 KERRY
                        I'm Kerry, Emma's cousin.

                                 JACK
                        Emma's told me so much about you. 

           Kerry eyes Emma -- amazed.

                                 KERRY
                        Emma didn't tell me she worked so
                        closely with you! I'm not surprised. 
                        She's doing so well.  As a business
                        owner myself, who's just gone national--

                                 JACK
                        Congratulations.

                                 KERRY
                        Thanks!  I know it takes the right
                        leadership... so rare, to unlock
                        someone's potential. And Emma's
                        amazing. As we've all known for years.

           Jack's gaze goes from Kerry to Emma. 

                                 JACK
                        Wow.  That was a perfect mix of
                        sucking up to me and being wildly
                        condescending to you. 

           Kerry's smile dies.  So does everyone's at the table. 

                                 EMMA
                            (a warning)
                        Jack--

                                 JACK
                        You have to say something.

           If looks could kill, Emma has just offed Jack.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You cannot let her talk about
                        unlocking potential...
                                 EMMA
                        Jack--

                                 JACK
                        Because didn't you apply for a job
                        with her when you were having a rough
                        time?

                                 EMMA
                        Shut up.

                                 DALE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 EMMA
                        He's confused.  That's a story about
                        a friend of mine.

           On Kerry, tense.

                                 KERRY
                        If you did apply for a job with me,
                        Em-- I'm gonna have a word with my
                        HR people.

           Emma and Kerry's eyes lock.  Emma, amazed by her smooth lie.  

           And Emma breaks--

                                 EMMA
                        You put a rejection in my purse! 

           Dale and Linda are shocked.

                                 LINDA 
                        Is that true? 

           Kerry is for once, speechless. 

                                 NEV
                        She was trying to handle an awkward
                        situation gently. Emma was trying to
                        use nepotism to get herself a job.  

           Emma eyes Nev.  Years of frustration boiling up...

                                 EMMA
                        Well, no shit-- Nev.  So I wanted a
                        little nepotism? 

           Linda eyes Kerry, very disappointed.  And Dale looks pissed.

                                 DALE
                        Nepotism?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                        You had no problem with that when we
                        lent you money to start your company. 
                            (to Emma)
                        Why didn't you tell us this?

           Kerry smiles coolly at Emma.  Eying the NEARBY TABLES, at
           which people stare at them. 

                                 KERRY
                        You're making a scene.

                                 EMMA
                        I don't care!  I am so sick of not
                        calling you on your bullshit.  You're
                        amazing, and your life is one glorious
                        achievement after another. And I try
                        really hard to be cool with that. 
                        But when someone in your family comes
                        to you for a crap job when they're
                        desperate-- what kind of asshole
                        just doesn't say yes?! 

           Kerry is shocked.  So are Linda, Dale, and Nev.

                                 JACK
                        Fair question, I think.

                                 EMMA
                        Let's go, Jack--

           Emma rises. Jack awkwardly smiles at Linda and Dale--

                                 JACK
                        Really nice to meet you.

           By the entrance, Emma moves through PEOPLE LINED UP to get a
           table...

           Then stops.  Courage rising. 

           And turns back.  Pushing back through the crowd toward Kerry:

                                 EMMA
                        And your stalker in high school,
                        Kerry-- was me! And I meant every
                        threatening word!

           Now her family is really shocked.  Her exit far more grand. 

           INT.  JACK'S CAR / TRAVELING - DAY

           Jack drives as Emma laughs in the passenger seat. 
                                 EMMA
                        You don't understand!  I've wanted
                        to do that for fifteen years! 

                                 JACK
                        Well you did it. You really did.  

           Emma's leans back.  Happy.  

                                 EMMA
                        Where are we going?

                                 JACK 
                        Don't know.  If you could be anywhere
                        this weekend-- where would it be?

           It's a moment before she speaks...

                                 EMMA
                        This photographer I love has a show
                        in New York.  I'd take you to see
                        it. 

           Jack smiles.  Saying nothing. 

           Which is when Emma realizes where they are heading--

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Why are we going to the airport?!

           EXT.  TARMAC ON PRIVATE RUNWAY - DAY

           Emma is nervous, as she and Jack stand on the tarmac staring
           up at a small, sleek AIRPLANE.  

                                 EMMA
                        It's very romantic... but as you
                        know-- flying: not my idea of fun.

           Jack smiles and waves at THE CREW -- as they head toward
           them, from a hangar--

                                 JACK
                        I thought of a way to distract you.

                                 EMMA
                        Nothing can distract me from being
                        thirty thousand feet in the air--

           Jack, holding a paper bag -- hands it to her. 

                                 JACK
                        Not even these?

           Emma looks in at the contents.  Amazed, she smiles.
           EXT. JACK'S PRIVATE PLANE / TRAVELING - DAWN

           The plane glides east over the clouds into a perfect, clear
           morning...

           INT.  JACK'S PRIVATE PLANE / TRAVELING - DAWN

           In the private cabin, the contents of the brown bag are strewn
           on the floor: doctor's scrubs, a nurse's uniform, and surgical
           tubing... and Jack and Emma are cozy under the blankets. 
           Emma, hair askew, still has her nurse's hat on. 

                                 EMMA
                        You're gonna have to talk dirty to
                        me whenever we fly, doctor.

                                 JACK
                        Good god.  We're only over Minnesota
                        and I've run through all my material.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh come on--

           Jack considers.  Tries his best to look very stern.

                                 JACK
                        Ok. In this scenario, you're less a
                        floor nurse. More a research
                        assistant.

                                 EMMA
                        That could be hot, sure--

           Jack clears his throat. 

                                 JACK
                        I'm disappointed in you, Nurse.  I
                        checked the blood cultures in your
                        petrie dish-- and your bacterial
                        growth is out of control.

           Emma looks at him in distaste.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Not doing it for you?

           Emma shakes her head.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Slacker nurse? 

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, that sounds good!
                                 JACK
                            (stern)
                        If you don't get on the floor and do
                        your rounds, we're going to lose
                        another patient.

           On Emma, trying not to laugh.

                                 EMMA
                        You're the worst dirty talker in the
                        world.

                                 JACK
                        I am so gonna spank you for that.

                                 EMMA
                        Great.  You're good at that!

           On the other side of the LOCKED DOOR--

           Wallop sleeps by the FLIGHT ATTENDANT, who reads the New
           York Times. As happy squeals come from behind the locked
           door...

           EXT.  PRIVATE RUNWAY / MANHATTAN - DAY

           New York in style. Emma and Jack emerge from the plane -- 
           dashing across the runway to their driver who waits for them.

           EXT. CHELSEA - DAY

           A gorgeous NY afternoon. Emma and Jack walk arm in arm along
           23rd Street in Chelsea -- a strip of galleries.  Stopping
           before the gallery she has come for, Emma regards Jack.

                                 EMMA
                        One rule.  Do not at any point turn
                        to me and say-- you're good too. You
                        should try photography again.

                                 JACK
                        You've thought this out.

                                 EMMA
                        It's natural, when you're involved
                        with someone... to give them the
                        'little engine that could' speech. 
                        But I did not bring you here for
                        that.  I brought you here to show
                        you something that makes me happy. 
                        And I don't want to feel all awkward
                        and have to explain to you all the
                        reasons why you're wrong. 
                                 JACK
                        Promise.  Not an encouraging word. 

           INT.  GALLERY ON 23RD STREET / CHELSEA, NYC - DAY

           A small gallery. Emma and Jack study intimate PORTRAITS. 

           Jack studies one of a LITTLE GIRL, perched on a suitcase in
           a bus station; smiling, mischievous. Emma joins him.

                                 JACK
                        She's planning something. And its
                        big. To her.  

                                 EMMA
                        That's what he does.  Shows you a
                        crack in the surface-- where things
                        start to get interesting.

           Jack eyes Emma -- about to say something. 

           Emma turns to him.  Stern.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Don't. 

                                 JACK
                        I just--

                                 EMMA
                        Because you don't know anything about
                        photography.  And people who do,
                        didn't see it that way.

                                 JACK 
                        --Wanted to know if you thought I
                        should buy it.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh.  

           Jack's phone rings.  He eyes it; his face falling.

                                 JACK
                        Will you excuse me a minute?

           Emma nods. Jack exits. 

           Emma eyes him through the window as he walks across the street -
           deep in conversation.  His expression grave.

           EXT.  STREET IN CHELSEA - DAY

           Emma heads out of the gallery toward Jack up the street. He
           is off the phone and she can tell something is very wrong...
                                 EMMA
                        Hey.

           Jack looks at her.  But doesn't answer.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        You all right? 

           Clearly not.  Jack stares at her.  Hard.  Considering.  

                                 JACK
                        I need to tell you something. Because
                        it's killing me. 

           Emma nods. 

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Six weeks ago, in an internal audit,
                        irregularities were found.  That's
                        why I came back.
                            (this is hard)
                        It seems that... Pete overstated the
                        profits of a number of our foreign
                        holdings, and funneled cash to a
                        maze of dodgy offshore banks.

           On Emma, horrified.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my god.

                                 JACK
                        I don't know if we'll recover half
                        of what he stole.  I just offered
                        the President of the bank of Macau a
                        hundred grand bribe-- just to access
                        Pete's accounts. 

                                 EMMA
                        Is this why you're selling the
                        bottling plants?

                                 JACK
                        Yes.  Any hard assets we can do
                        without.  To put the cash where it
                        was supposed to be.  You could say
                        we're making his lies reality. To
                        cover up what he did.

                                 EMMA
                        Why? 
                                 JACK
                        The official answer: if the public
                        gets wind of it, our stock price
                        takes a serious hit. 
                            (hard)
                        Between us-- I can't let this be how
                        he's remembered. 

           They walk up the busy street, as daylight wanes.  And in the
           silence, Emma puts her arm in his.

                                 EMMA
                        I'm so sorry, Jack.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           INT.  SKYLINE DINER - WEEKS LATER

           Autumn in Seattle.  Rain patters on the window of the diner
           as Jemima, Emma, and Lissy eat sunday brunch.

                                 LISSY
                        I can't believe your boyfriend is on
                        Larry King tomorrow.

                                 EMMA
                        It is a little surreal.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Your secret boyfriend.  You guys
                        have to tell the people you work
                        with some time, you know-- 

           Wayne passes, coffee pot in hand--

                                 WAYNE
                        You girls need anything?

                                 LISSY
                        We're good, thanks.

           As Wayne moves off, he winks at Lissy.  Which Jemima sees.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Oh my god.  You're sleeping with the
                        23 year old.

           Lissy rolls her eyes.

                                 JEMIMA (CONT'D)
                        It's so true!  I've seen you in here
                        with him.  And the last three fridays
                        you've been-- 
                            (quoty fingers)
                        Out.
                                 LISSY
                        People go out on Friday nights.

                                 JEMIMA
                        You go over contracts Friday nights. 

           On Lissy, uneasy.

                                 LISSY
                        Okay. You got me.  

           But Emma eyes Lissy.  Not so convinced. 

           Emma grabs her ringing cell--

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        Hello. Of course.  I'll be there.

           Emma hangs up.

                                 EMMA
                        That was Artemis. She and Paul want
                        to meet tomorrow.  That's weird. 
                        Usually she just looks stern and
                        motions toward her office. 

                                 JEMIMA
                        They so know.

           INT.  PAUL'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 

           Emma sits on the couch. Beside Artemis.  Paul is at his desk.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        So... 
                            (grinning)
                        Harper's on Larry King today--

           On Emma, worried.  What are they getting at?

                                 EMMA
                        Which is exciting. For all of us.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Yes, but he's talking about a campaign
                        you're pretty involved in. 

           Like bequeathing a treasure, Paul hands Emma the new PANTHER
           BAR, still in generic packaging. 

                                 PAUL
                        This... is for you.

                                 EMMA
                        The new meal replacement bar? 
                                 ARTEMIS
                        We want you to run with it.  

                                 PAUL 
                        We want to make you a brand-manager. 

                                 EMMA
                        Really!?

                                 PAUL
                        There's a significant pay increase,
                        of course.

                                 EMMA
                        I can't believe it.  Thank you! 

           Paul smiles at Emma.  So does Artemis.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Congratulations!

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Happy, Emma walks toward the board room -- filling with
           MARKETERS gathering to watch Jack's interview -- as she talks
           on her cell to her mom:  

                                 LINDA-OVER THE PHONE
                        That's amazing honey! And your
                        sweetie's about to be on Larry King!

                                 EMMA
                        You didn't tell anyone about him,
                        did you?

                                 LINDA-OVER THE PHONE
                        Of course not!

           INT.  STAFF ROOM AT LINDA'S SCHOOL - DAY

           In the staff room at her school, Linda hangs up her cell
           phone, amidst A CROWD of her FELLOW TEACHERS around the TV. 
           A FEW OTHER TEACHERS walk into the room.

                                 LINDA
                        My daughter's boyfriend-- Jack Harper,
                        is about to be on Larry King!

           Excited, the TEACHERS gather...

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           As Emma reaches the board room, her phone rings again.  Seeing
           who it is -- she hangs back for privacy.
           The following is INTERCUT between Emma at Panther and Jack
           in the GREEN ROOM at The Larry King Show:

                                 EMMA
                        Hey?  Aren't you going on right away?!  

                                 JACK
                        Yeah. But I have to cancel our plans
                        tonight.  

                                 EMMA
                        Why?

                                 JACK
                        We located three of Pete's bank
                        accounts in St. Kitts.  I'm flying
                        there right after the show.

           A cute P.A. peeks into the GREEN ROOM and gives Jack the
           'THREE MINUTE' signal.  Jack nods.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I should go.

                                 EMMA
                        Wait! Guess what! I'm brand-managing
                        the meal replacement bar.

                                 JACK
                        Oh... 
                            (a pregnant pause)
                        That's great.

           Emma's elation dies.

                                 EMMA
                        I'm such an idiot.  You made them
                        promote me, didn't you?

                                 JACK
                        No, Emma.  That was all you.

           But why does she find Jack's tone so odd?

           INT.  BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Emma sits in the crowded board room, watching Jack on Larry
           King, on the large TV. 

           ON SCREEN: JACK BEING INTERVIEWED BY LARRY KING

                                 LARRY
                        We're back with Jack Harper, founder
                        of Panther Cola, talking about his 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        new campaign to try and woo women to
                        the energy drink market.

           Jack chuckles. 

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        I can say that, can't I?

                                 JACK
                        Sure.  That's exactly what we're
                        trying to do.

                                 LARRY
                        With a campaign very different from
                        the hyper-aggressive image you and
                        Pete built.

                                 JACK
                        I disagree.  This campaign is about
                        aggression.  Just a more private
                        kind. A promise to yourself to act
                        on your secrets-- is about changing
                        your life.  A hell of a lot scarier
                        than extreme sports, don't you think?

                                 LARRY KING
                        But you're a big proponent of
                        authenticity in marketing, right?

                                 JACK 
                        Well, not a lot of CEOs would come
                        here and talk to you about the new
                        image they want to build. 

                                 LARRY KING
                        But you and Pete were young ambitious
                        guys selling something to guys a lot
                        like you.  How can you, Jack Harper,
                        CEO, understand what it's like to be
                        someone whose dreams are unrealized?

           Jack stares at Larry.  Considering.

           And his answer, is with conviction--

                                 JACK
                        Because I know this person. I get
                        her. 

                                 LARRY KING
                        So who is she?

           Jack smiles.  Considers.  Then speaks with passion.
                                 JACK
                        She has a killer sense of humor. 
                        Her bedroom's an emporium of all
                        things ironic.  

           Emma smiles.  Is he talking about her?

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And all that irony-- it's symbolic,
                        I think.  Of doing things sort of
                        half-ass.  Not trying hard enough to
                        fail, or succeed. 

           Emma's smile dies...

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Take the sexual fantasies she has
                        about one of her best friends-- yet
                        she never got up the guts to do it
                        with a girl in college.

           Emma is mortified -- and trying hard not to show it.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Or how she likes that she just got
                        promoted-- but not the new job itself. 

           Around the table, Emma's colleagues look at her strangely.

           Especially Artemis and Paul.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        But see, here's the rub.  Once she
                        did try something she cared about. 
                        But then things got bad, and she
                        fell into a dark hole in her parents'
                        basement, lined with years of self
                        doubt, years of fearing her family
                        isn't proud of her... 

           Connor stares at Emma.  Indignant.

                                 CONNOR
                        Oh my god.  It's true! You're banging
                        Harper! 

           On Emma, horrified -- as now EVERY MARKETER in the room stares
           at her. 

                                 JACK
                        ...And with an amazing ability to be
                        the punch line of her own jokes, and
                        a little Lexipro-- she lowered the
                        bar for herself.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Took a job at a place, that when
                        she's honest-- she calls a soul-less
                        corporate abyss. 

                                 PAUL
                        Ouch.

           A sentiment echoed by MARKETERS across the room.

                                 JACK
                        But this woman has passion, Larry. 
                        And this unique take on the world. 
                        I've seen it.  Tragedy is, it's spent
                        pissing around.  Photo-shopping Hitler
                        into pictures with senior staff. 

           Stifled laughter around the room. 

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And-- making up literature for the
                        fake non-profit she invented to get
                        that job she can't stand.  

           Paul stares at Emma, amazed. Betrayed.

           She can't look at him.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And though it may fail, Larry, I
                        think she really owes it to herself
                        to try what she loves again.  That's
                        what the new Panther is about.

                                 LARRY
                        Well, that's quite specific. 

                                 JACK
                        Marketing is about specificity.  

           As LARRY KING cuts to a commercial break--

           Emma looks around at her colleagues, who stare at her. 

           And in the fraught silence, Emma rises.  Humiliated. 

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me.

           And leaves the room...

                                 ARTEMIS
                        What was with the Hitler reference?

           The entire room of Marketers look anywhere but at Artemis.
           INT. PANTHER COLA / ELEVATOR - DAY

           Emma rides the elevator with two PANTHER WOMEN from another
           department. 

                                 PANTHER WOMAN ONE
                        Who d'you think she is?

                                 PANTHER WOMAN TWO
                        Apparently some low-level person in
                        marketing. 

           Panther Woman One chuckles. 

                                 PANTHER WOMAN TWO (CONT'D)
                        You know Harper.  He studies people. 
                        That's how he gets his ideas. 

                                 PANTHER WOMAN ONE
                        You think he was studying her?

                                 PANTHER WOMAN TWO
                        Come on.  The guy could have anyone. 
                        And he kicked ass in the interview.

           Emma, burned, suffers.  Her eyes -- welling up.

           INT.  THE GIRLS LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 

           Emma, distraught, sits with Lissy and Jemima -- who is fuming. 
           Much wine consumed.  

                                 JEMIMA
                        He's not going to get away with this!

                                 EMMA
                        I can't believe he told America I
                        made up a fake non-profit.

                                 LISSY
                        About that-- why didn't you just use
                        a real one?

           Emma looks at her.  Realizing.

                                 EMMA
                        I didn't even think of that. 

                                 JEMIMA
                        I mean-- who does he think he is?!

                                 EMMA
                        He's Jack Harper and I'm a girl he
                        screwed on his plane.
                                 JEMIMA
                        I was worried about this! The power
                        differential is just way too big. 
                            (intense)
                        Love is all about power.  And never
                        letting him get the upper hand--

           Emma and Lissy eye Jemima.  Who feels she's said too much.

                                 LISSY
                        That's way too screwed up to unpack
                        right now.  But Em, Jack spoke very
                        passionately about you.  And I think
                        he said things that were... the
                        product of much thought.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Aw-- Jack Harper peered into her
                        soul and saw something.  How totally
                        condescending of him.  That truth
                        Lissy, that's hers. Not his-- to use
                        to connect with an audience. 

                                 EMMA 
                        She's right Lissy.

           TIME CUT -- A LITTLE LATER

           Emma, more drunk, fills her glass, as Lissy checks the
           messages on the land line -- in the kitchen.

                                 LISSY
                            (hollering)
                        Your parents called again.  And your
                        gran, who's freaking out about the
                        Lexipro.  And Jack-- twice more from
                        the plane.

                                 JEMIMA
                        He can just keep calling, can't he!

           Jemima, making sure Lissy is out of earshot, looks at Emma:

                                 JEMIMA  (CONT'D)
                        By the way-- I'm totally cool with
                        the sexual fantasy thing.

                                 EMMA
                        Dreams, not fantasies. Very different. 
                        And they weren't about you.

                                 JEMIMA
                        What?!  That's sick.  Who wants to
                        do Lissy?
           Lissy enters, smiling--

                                 LISSY
                        One more person than wants to do you
                        in this house.  I knew it was me.

           Emma moves over to let Lissy sit on the couch.

           But Lissy takes the chair.

                                 LISSY (CONT'D)
                        I'm good here. I don't want to give
                        you the wrong idea. 

                                 EMMA
                        You're serious.

                                 LISSY
                        Half. Am I good in these dreams?

           On Emma, mortified.

                                 EMMA
                        Jack Harper ruined my life!
                            (quiet, in anguish)
                        You know... I spent so long thinking:
                        why me?  But that was the point.  I
                        was Jack Harper's authentic way in
                        to ordinary. I was the guided tour. 

                                 JEMIMA
                            (with fury)
                        And he is gonna regret making you
                        feel that for the rest of his life.

           For once, Emma appreciates Jemima's anger.

                                 LISSY
                        The hypocrisy is what gets me. The
                        guy disappeared for a year.  Did he
                        tell America where he was?

           Emma glances at Lissy.  Anger rising.  No shit.

                                 EMMA
                        His parents' basement in New Jersey.

           Lissy and Jemima look at her.  Amazed.

                                 JEMIMA
                        What kind of secret is that? 

                                 EMMA
                        I thought it was pretty good actually.  
                                 JEMIMA
                        Well it isn't one we can use. 

           Emma pours herself more wine, now very looped.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay... want a secret? Pete Lawson
                        was not who everyone thinks he was.

           Jemima and Lissy stare at her.  Now they're listening.

           INT.  THE GIRL'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Emma, very hung over, dressed for work, quietly opens Jemima's
           door.  Looks down at her sleeping friend.  Taps her foot.

           Jemima groans.

                                 EMMA
                        The stuff I told you about Pete-- I
                        shouldn't have done that.  I was
                        pretty hammered.  It needs to stay
                        between us.  You know that, right?

           Jemima nods.  Turns to the wall.

           But as Emma closes the door, Jemima opens her eyes.  

           Pissed off all over again.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Emma steps off the elevator to the ultimate WALK OF SHAME.
           Her Colleagues stare at her. Some openly. Some more discrete. 
           But no-one doesn't look.

           Then Emma spots-- 

           On the wall of a COLLEAGUE'S CUBICLE

           A copy of her M.A.R.Y. pamphlet

           Annoyed, Emma rips it down, as the Marketers snicker.

           But, in another cubicle -- is another M.A.R.Y. pamphlet.

           Staring around her, she sees MANY COPIES, on MANY CUBICLES.

                                 EMMA
                        Hilarious, guys.

           Humiliated, Emma walks to her desk.

           Where there is a M.A.R.Y. 'collection box.'
           INT. PAUL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma enters.  Paul looks up from his desk. Cool.

                                 EMMA
                        About my volunteer work, or lack
                        thereof--

                                 PAUL
                        Dark, Corrigan. I wondered why I
                        couldn't find M.A.R.Y. on-line.  

                                 EMMA
                        I'm so sorry. 

                                 PAUL
                        I'm glad we gave to the ASPCA.

                                 EMMA
                        Me too.

                                 PAUL
                        And not your fake organization.  For
                        fake kids. 

           Emma nods, ashamed.  Paul eyes a M.A.R.Y. pamphlet. Mournful. 

                                 EMMA
                        Is there any disciplinary action you
                        want to take?

                                 PAUL
                        You're banging my boss.  We both
                        know you're bullet proof.

                                 EMMA
                        Was.  There'll be no more banging. 
                        And it's not like that. 

           A SLAM on the glass makes Emma turn to see Artemis, fuming -- 
           the photo of her with Hitler against the glass.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh shit.

           Artemis enters. 

                                 ARTEMIS
                        What part of me and Hitler on a ski
                        lift is funny to you?

           On Emma, dying. What to say? 

           Paul tries to keep a straight face. 
                                 ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
                        Paul? All the times you saw this and
                        said nothing-- what about it was
                        funny to you?

                                 PAUL
                        Not one part really. More the whole
                        idea.  

           Dismissing him with a withering look, Artemis glares at Emma.

                                 EMMA
                            (genuine)
                        I'm so sorry.

                                 ARTEMIS
                            (hurt)
                        I took you under my wing. I took you
                        to lunch. And this is what I get?

           Artemis drops the photo and speeds through the department...

                                 EMMA
                        Artemis!

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

           Miserable, Emma walks to her desk and eyes her new name-plate
           that reads:

                          EMMA CORRIGAN, BRAND MANAGER

           Connor walks by--

                                 CONNOR
                        That's one way to get a promotion.

           Mortified, Emma hears LAUGHTER from nearby cubicles. 

           Emma, hurt, glares at Connor striding away--

                                 EMMA
                        Wait to kick someone when they're
                        down, Connor! I am so not picking
                        the phone up anymore when you're
                        drunk and want some.

           Connor turns back.  The eyes of the whole department on him.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        And for future reference: if a woman
                        compares her G-spot to a bedding
                        plant-- you haven't found it!  She
                        just wants you to stop slamming her
                        head into the arm of the couch!
           Shocked silence.  Connor stares at her in disbelief.

           Then Emma sees Rachel gazing in horror behind Emma.  

           Emma turns--

           To see... her parents, who stand AWKWARDLY in the aisle.  

                                 LINDA 
                        When you wouldn't return our calls--

                                 DALE
                        We thought we should check in.

           INT.  SOME FIRKIN BAR - DAY - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           A pub near Panther.  Emma sits with her parents in a booth
           over beer.  Mortified.  She breaks the silence--

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, I had sex with Connor. For like
                        a year.  No, he was not my boyfriend.
                            (pained)
                        Nor did he ever want to be. 

                                 DALE
                        You're an adult, Em.  That's not our
                        business.  We're here because of
                        what Jack said on TV... about you
                        not thinking we're proud of you.
                        Honey, we're so proud of you. 

                                 LINDA
                        So proud!

                                 DALE
                        When you had those big meetings in
                        New York, I told everyone at work!

           On Emma, burning--

                                 EMMA
                        There was no big meeting in New York,
                        dad. I made that up. I wanted you to
                        think I had my shit together-- after
                        all I put you through last year.

                                 LINDA
                        Put us through?  

                                 DALE
                        You came home.  You moped.  As we
                        learned on Larry King, you went on
                        an antidepressant. Your gran's quite
                        upset about that, by the way-- 
                                 LINDA
                        Honey, we had no idea Kerry made you
                        feel so many things. Maybe we turned
                        a blind eye, because of her mom.

                                 DALE
                        I think we did.  And I'm so sorry.  

                                 LINDA
                        I'm sorry too. 

           Emma is touched.  This, so long-coming...

                                 EMMA
                        And I should have said things. 

           Dale leans over and gives Emma's shoulders a squeeze.

                                 DALE
                        We all have secrets. You know how I
                        was home-schooled in the ninth grade?

                                 LINDA
                        Sure.

           Dale looks at Linda.  Getting up the guts.

                                 DALE
                        I wasn't. I was in a youth detention
                        center-- for setting some sheds in
                        my neighborhood on fire.

           Linda and Emma stare at him -- amazed.

                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                        I was working some things out. 

                                 LINDA
                        I can't believe you never told me!

                                 DALE
                        I was afraid to.

           Emma starts laughing. Losing it. Linda starts laughing too...

           Then Emma isn't laughing anymore... she's tearing up.

                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                        What, Em?

                                 EMMA
                        Nothing. No... Truth? I bought it. 
                        I bought him. Jack Harper was using
                        me to sell an energy drink. And I
                        thought I was falling in love.  
           Dale puts his arm around Emma.  As Linda reaches across the
           table and holds her hand. 

           INT.  WAITING ROOM / LISSY'S LAW FIRM - DAYS LATER

           Lissy walks through an office of busy lawyers, emerging in
           the WAITING ROOM -- very surprised to see -- Jack waiting
           for her.  He rises.

                                 JACK
                        Please.  Hear me out?

           Lissy tries very hard to glare at him.  

           Which does not come easy to her.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL YARD OUTSIDE AN OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma and Lissy make their way through another moonlit
           industrial yard where PUNK ROCK kids mill about.  But this
           time, Lissy greets some of them. 

                                 EMMA
                        Have you been coming to these on
                        your own?

           But Lissy, preoccupied, scans the dark yard...

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Lissy?  

           Because she has spotted him first--

                                 LISSY
                        I'll meet you inside.

           Emma, puzzled, watches Lissy dash off.  

           As, through the darkness -- Jack approaches.

                                 EMMA
                        What the hell are you doing here!? 
                        Wow, that really sucks of Lissy--

                                 JACK
                        I messed up, Emma.  Big time.  

                                 EMMA
                        You used me for research.  And
                        humiliated me on national television. 
                        Own it, Jack.  And leave me alone.

                                 JACK
                        Research?  No!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        After your blanket rejection of
                        'little engine that could' speeches--
                        I figured I had to shake you up to
                        make you listen. 
                            (somber)
                        But I got carried away.

                                 EMMA
                        You think? You told my secrets to
                        millions of people!

                                 JACK
                        Carried away is an understatement. 
                        Look... I was walking into the studio
                        after you told me about your
                        promotion, and I was hit by the fact
                        that if I hadn't been on that plane,
                        you might have quit. You couldn't
                        care less about marketing!  And what
                        if because of me... you stay in a
                        life that has nothing to do with who
                        you are?

           Jack takes out his wallet and retrieves the very crumpled
           COCKTAIL NAPKIN from the plane.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I keep this in my wallet.  Not for
                        research purposes-- well, at first
                        yes, but... Because sometimes in the
                        midst of all the crap going on with
                        what Pete did, I look at this stupid
                        napkin. And it makes me happy. 
                        Because these-- are the secrets of
                        the most interesting person I know. 
                        Who...
                            (hard)
                        I believe in completely. 

           Okay so Emma is moved.  A little.

                                 EMMA
                        Please. You know David Beckham.

                                 JACK
                        David Beckham doesn't send threatening
                        letters to members of his family. 
                        Or fight kids.  Or lie about being a
                        long distance runner-- And he
                        certainly isn't the person I'm falling
                        in love with.

           On Emma, struck.  Reeling--
                                 EMMA
                            (smiling)
                        Screw you, Jack Harper. 

           INT.  ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma and Jack walk into the massive moonlit room where PUNK
           ROCK KIDS cluster around the band.

                                 JACK
                        You're right.  It is a good party.  

                                 EMMA
                        Isn't it?  Let's find Lissy.

           Emma and Jack push into the crowd. 

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        She'll be near the front. 

           Then Emma stops.  Amazed.  Because...

           The 'band' in the center of the crowd -- is Lissy. 

           With Wayne, on drums.

           Lissy sings a Punk version of something we recognize. 
           Something unexpected.  With her pearls, Wayne's beat-up
           guitar, and her hair, low over her face, she kisses the
           microphone.

           And is very punk rock.

           Emma stares at Lissy.  Amazed.  So does Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Does she do this often?

                                 EMMA
                        In her mind.  All the time.

           She looks at Jack in the dark. Smiling. He grabs her hand.  

           Her heart, as their hands touch -- racing. 

           Emma's phone rings.  The screen reads: Jemima.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Jemima has to see this. Just a sec--

           Emma fights her way out of the crowd, to answer the phone.

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        You have to get here now!
           Excited, Jemima says something inaudible...

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE (CONT'D)
                        Just wait-- I can't hear you!

           Emma moves farther from the crowd...

                                 JEMIMA-OVER PHONE
                        I got your revenge on Jack Harper!  

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JEMIMA-OVER PHONE
                        I told my friend at Gawker about
                        Pete.  You've got to see the article.  

           Emma hangs up.  Drops the phone to her side.  

           In disbelief.

           Emma walks, with dread, to Jack, in the crowd, watching Lissy. 

           His smile, when he turns to her -- kills her.

                                 EMMA
                        I have to tell you something.  

           Emma leads Jack to a dark corner, away from the crowd.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Jemima... 
                            (this, so hard)
                        told her friend at Gawker about Pete.

           On Jack -- horrified.  

                                 JACK
                        What about Pete?

                                 EMMA
                        My guess-- everything you told me. 

           Jack looks like he's been punched.

                                 JACK
                        How could you?

                                 EMMA
                        I'm so sorry.  I was so hurt. I really
                        thought you used me.  Can you blame
                        me? Who'd believe that of all the
                        people you could have, you'd choose
                        me!?
           Jack's anger rises.  

                                 JACK
                        You couldn't.  That's the problem. 
                        You know, Emma-- there's this fine
                        line between self-deprecating...
                            (hard)
                        And just not taking yourself
                        seriously.

           On Emma, taken aback.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And you cross it.  All the time. 
                        And that is so grating. And toxic. 
                        Because if you'd just held a beat,
                        and believed the guy you've been
                        seeing for weeks could actually care
                        about you--  

           Jack's phone is ringing.  Grave, he gets it--

                                 JACK-INTO HIS PHONE
                        Yes, I'm aware of the situation. 
                        Yes, I know how bad it is. 

           Jack is so angry, he's shaking.  

           About to speak, he stops.

                                 JACK
                            (hard)
                        Good bye, Emma.

           Jack heads out of the warehouse.  And Emma watches him go...

           Devastated.

           INT. MARKETING DEPARTMENT / BOARD ROOM - DAYS LATER

           Emma, suffering the fire storm she has unleashed, sits in
           the room packed with Marketers.  The mood, grim. 

                                 PAUL
                        Focus on the offensive.  Every nasty
                        article you read about Pete-- turn
                        it into fire in your belly--

           Connor is whispering with a few other Marketers.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                            (annoyed)
                        Question, Connor?
                                 CONNOR
                        Is it a bad time to talk about our
                        stock options?

           The Marketers, whispering amongst themselves, clearly wonder
           the same thing. 

           But Rachel's question is more emotional--

                                 RACHEL
                        I know our job is just to get people
                        to buy an energy drink.  But Pete
                        was stealing. I don't know about you
                        guys-- but I woke up this morning
                        thinking that really sucks.

           The whispering in the room says they agree. And Paul -- master
           of spin, is at a loss for words.

           On Emma, feeling sick.

           INT.  JACK'S PLANE - DAY

           In the cabin of Jack's plane, Jack sits with members of his
           legal team.  Strategizing. 

           But for a moment, their voices die out...

           As a New York Times article on the table catches Jack's eye. 
           The headline, above the familiar picture of he and Pete, by
           the van with their skateboards, is:

                      JERSEY BOYS DONE GOOD.  OR DID THEY?

           At his feet, Wallop sits. 

           Suffering, lost in thought, Jack reaches down to pet him. 

           INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - EVENING 

           The TV box is in her room, Emma in it.  As Lissy peeks inside.

                                 LISSY
                        You're going to have to come out of
                        there some time. 

           Emma, a wreck, does not answer.

                                 LISSY (CONT'D)
                        Jemima found an apartment.

                                 EMMA
                        I don't want to talk about Jemima.
                                 LISSY
                        She tried contacting Jack again--

                                 EMMA 
                            (hard)
                        So have I. 

           Lissy nods.  She knows.  Heads for the door.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Do you think I don't take myself
                        seriously?

                                 LISSY
                        Do you really want me to answer that
                        while you're lying in a box?

           Emma crawls out of the box.   

                                 LISSY (CONT'D)
                        Honest?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes.

                                 LISSY
                        I think moving to New York took a
                        lot of courage.  And when it fell
                        apart, you got scared.  I think it
                        was easier to say you failed and
                        make fun of yourself for that-- than
                        figure out how to try again.  And as
                        your best friend since we were
                        thirteen... yes. I think it's a cop-
                        out.   

           On Emma, taken aback.  Somber.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, Lissy. 

           Then Emma crawls back in the box. And as we move in on Emma's
           face... the impact of Lissy's words are apparent...  

           She is right.

           INT.  MARKETING DEPARTMENT / PAUL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma arrives at work. The department bustling.  She passes
           her desk and heads for PAUL'S OFFICE

           Paul glances up from his desk as she enters.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey.
           This is hard.  Really hard...

                                 EMMA
                        I quit, Paul.

           On Paul, very surprised.

                                 PAUL
                        Jumping ship, huh?

                                 EMMA
                        I kind of sunk the ship.  Or at least,
                        bore a good sized hole in the hull.

                                 PAUL
                        What are you talking about?  The
                        past few months, you kicked ass.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, but that was mostly about the
                        boss I was banging. 

           Emma walks out of the office.  As Paul watches her. 

           INT. EMMA'S DESK / MARKETING DEPARTMENT - DAY

           As Milo and Rachel look on, Emma packs up the contents of
           her desk in a box. 

                                 RACHEL
                        We'll miss you.

           Emma looks over to see Artemis powering by -- sternly. 

                                 MILO
                        Some of us will. 

                                 EMMA 
                        I'll miss you too.

           From under her desk, Emma gets the Hershey's Kiss. 

           Unwraps it.

                                 MILO
                        You're not gonna eat that-- 

                                 EMMA 
                        Oh, yes I am. 

           As Emma heads for the elevator, she puts the chocolate in
           her mouth.  And yes, it's stale.  And as she chews, her teeth
           encounter something that might be ant eggs... 

           But she eats the whole thing. 
           INT.  BUS / TRAVELING - DAY

           Emma sits on the bus, her box from work in her lap.  

           The tension of the last horrible week -- breaks open.  She
           starts to cry.  A HEAVY SET WOMAN beside her, passes her a
           tissue.  

           Grateful, Emma tries to smile.  

           But just cries harder.

                                 HEAVY SET WOMAN
                        You okay?

           Between sloppy sniffles, Emma nods.

                                 HEAVY SET WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Because, you know-- sometimes it can
                        help to talk to a stranger.

           Through her tears, Emma looks at the woman. 

           Struck by her words.

           INT.  EMMA'S ROOM - DAY

           Tears dried, Emma rushes into her room and puts down her box
           of office stuff.

           She paces, excited.  An idea blooming in her mind.

           She flips on her laptop.  Intent.

           Brings up CRAIGSLIST.

           And begins to compose an ad. Growing more excited as she
           writes, her fingers fly--  

           The title she gives it:

                            CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

           Then, eyeing the ad with anticipation, Emma hits send.  

           Putting it out to the world...

           And... turning to the TV box, she kicks it flat.  

           Hauls it out of her room...

           EXT.  FANCY HOUSE ON THE WATER - NIGHT

           With trepidation, Emma rings the doorbell of a posh house by
           the water.  
           Kerry opens the door, very surprised to see Emma.

           INT.  KERRY AND NEV'S SPACIOUS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma is with Kerry in her spacious kitchen.  

                                 EMMA
                        I'm sorry about the stalker thing. 
                        I shouldn't have scared you like
                        that.

           Kerry laughs.  Chilly.

                                 KERRY
                        I wasn't scared. I knew it was you.

                                 EMMA
                        You did?

                                 KERRY
                        I recognized your hand writing.  And
                        whenever I saw Jemima, she'd give me
                        the finger, so... I kind of figured.

                                 EMMA
                        But you went to the police!

                                 KERRY
                        I know.  It made me feel like a rock
                        star.  

           Kerry softens.

                                 KERRY (CONT'D)
                        Look-- I was a needy kid.  And I was
                        really jealous of you.

                                 EMMA
                        Of me?

                                 KERRY
                        Yeah!  Your folks are awesome.  Your
                        friends...
                            (embarrassed)
                        D'you know when I'm in a restaurant
                        alone, sometimes I pretend to talk
                        on my cell with my friends-- Lissy
                        and Jemima. 

           On Emma, taken aback.

                                 EMMA
                        That is so weird. And you can have
                        Jemima.
                                 KERRY
                        I can't help if I do things well,
                        Emma. I'm very driven.

           With humility--

                                 EMMA
                        I know you are Kerry. Which is why I
                        want you to do something for me.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           INT.  KERRY CORRIGAN DESIGNS - DAY

           ON SCREEN: SIX MONTHS LATER

           We move through Kerry's bustling design studio. To find Emma,
           staring intently at a computer screen at a WORK STATION. 

           But as we see the screen -- we see she is checking her email
           inbox: filled with responses to her CRAIGSLIST AD.

           She grins, perusing one she finds intriguing.

           Jots a note to herself about it.

                                 DISGRUNTLED DESIGNER
                        What are you doing on my computer!?

           A DISGRUNTLED DESIGNER approaches.

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry!

           Emma quickly closes out of her email, and grabs an armful of
           cardboard tubes that hold design plans -- handing him one.

                                 DISGRUNTLED DESIGNER
                        This is an hour late!

           ANOTHER DESIGNER shoots the Disgruntled Designer a glance.

                                 ANOTHER DESIGNER
                        Easy.  That Kerry's cousin-- She
                        goes ballistic if you hassle her.

           Emma moves off -- dropping more tubes on other WORK STATIONS.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        I am far more up front these days
                        about when I'm calling it in.
           EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET IN SEATTLE - NIGHT

           Emma walks up a street, lugging too much camera equipment. 
           She stops.  Consults an address jotted on a scrap of paper.  

           Looking around, she sees:

           A BILLBOARD.  Huge, lit up... Of an OFFICE WORKER, at a desk,
           smiling like she has a secret.  And below her desk -- sits a
           CAN OF PANTHER COLA. 

           Emma eyes the billboard.  Smiling, sadly.

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        There are even moments when I grasp
                        the power of marketing.

           Picking up the camera equipment, Emma walks up the street. 
           With resolve.

           INT.  A WOMAN STRANGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           An upscale living room.  Emma, very focused, checks the frame
           on a camera mounted on a tripod.  Then snaps some shots of
           the BLACK WOMAN IN HER FIFTIES, whose home this is. 

                                 BLACK WOMAN IN HER FIFTIES
                        I can't believe I'm doing this!

           As the woman giggles, Emma adjusts a light set up nearby.

                                 BLACK WOMAN IN HER FIFTIES (CONT'D)
                        Whatever gave you the idea?

           Emma smiles, reframes the shot.

           Intent on the task -- like we have never seen her.

                                 EMMA
                        This guy.

           INT.  CITY PARK - NIGHT

           Emma snaps shots of a VERY PROPER BUSINESSMAN in a suit. 

                                 VERY PROPER BUSINESSMAN
                        So what happened with him?

           Emma snaps a few more shots.  Then regards the stranger.

                                 EMMA
                        For a while, it was great. Then it
                        ended.  Horribly.
                                 VERY PROPER BUSINESSMAN
                        So are you over him?

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. 

                                 EMMA-V.O.
                        Okay, so I still tell the occasional
                        lie to keep certain secrets.

           EXT.  STREET IN BALLARD - DAY

           On a bright spring day, Emma walks up to Jemima's gallery.
           Through the window, she watches Jemima -- alone, on a step-
           ladder, hanging a painting. 

           INT.  JEMIMA HUNTER GALLERY - DAY

           Emma enters the gallery.  We now see she has a portfolio. 

                                 EMMA 
                        Hi Jemima.  How've you been?

           Very surprised, Jemima climbs off the ladder.  Speechless...
           nervous...

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I know how you are. I ask
                        Lissy all the time.

           Jemima smiles.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Me too.  I'm so sorry, Emma--

                                 EMMA
                        I didn't come to talk about all that. 
                        I've been working on this thing, and
                        I want your honest opinion.  

           Emma sets the portfolio on a table.

                                 JEMIMA
                        Honesty isn't my problem.

           Emma nods.  Knows.

                                 EMMA
                        You know where to find me.

           Jemima watches Emma walk out of the gallery, up the street. 

           Then Jemima opens the portfolio.  Studies the contents.  

           Getting somber.  Disconcerted.
           EXT.  STREET IN BALLARD - MINUTES LATER

           As Emma walks up the street, her cell phone rings. She answers--

                                 JEMIMA-OVER PHONE
                        Who the hell are you talking to!?

                                 EMMA-INTO PHONE 
                        What?

                                 JEMIMA-OVER PHONE
                        White Gallery won't do shit, and if
                        Sorenson's trying to woo you, no
                        matter what he says he's totally cut
                        off in Europe--

                                 EMMA
                        What are you talking about?

           Emma hears footsteps behind her.  She turns to -- Jemima,
           breathless, running after her -- on her cell.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Are you saying you like them?

           Jemima looks very serious.

                                 JEMIMA
                        I love them. I mean, I have thoughts--
                        But I can sell these!  

           INT.  JEMIMA HUNTER GALLERY - WEEKS LATER - NIGHT

           Emma, in an elegant dress, washes her hands before the mirror
           in the bathroom of the gallery.  One of the STALLS opens,
           and a BLACK WOMAN, 35, joins her at the sink. 

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        I have my mom's narrowed down to
                        three. But she won't tell me.  Can
                        you just give me a hint?

                                 EMMA
                            (smiling)
                        Absolutely not.  

           INT.  JEMIMA HUNTER GALLERY / MAIN SPACE - NIGHT 

           Emma exits the bathroom into the main room of Jemima's
           gallery, where a crowded art opening is underway.  Hers.

           In letters across the back wall: 

                            CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
           On one wall, simple, framed blurbs of text.  

           Secrets like:

                      Every night I pee in my rude neighbor's pool. 

           And:

                      I stuck pins through dad's condoms, so I'd get a
                      brother. And it worked!

           And some, we might recognize:

                      I want the courage to be with a guy and not care 
                      who has the upper hand.  Because at 28, I've never
                      been in love. 

           And on the opposite wall, the PORTRAITS: 

           Of the people to whom the secrets belong.

           Lots are STRANGERS.  

           But there are also:

           Lissy, in a neat suit, holding up her hair to show three new
           piercings on her ear.

           Kerry, in a restaurant, alone amidst tables of women chatting.

           And in the crowded art gallery -- mingle people we know:  

           Like Milo and Cassie, quite cozy, chatting with Rachel and
           even Artemis.  

           Lissy and Wayne chat by a secret that reads:

                      I am banging a 23 year old.  And it is awesome.

           Emma walks through the crowd to Linda and Dale. 

                                 LINDA
                        Look at the turnout! 

                                 DALE
                        We are so damn proud of you, honey. 

           Near them, a PORTRAIT OF DALE: by their garden shed, winking --
           with a lit match.

           ACROSS THE ROOM 

           Kerry leads Nev to the WALL OF SECRETS. 
                                 NEV
                        What kind of weirdo would do that?

           The secret he's talking about:

                         I have fake phone conversations with friends I
                         wish I had.

           Kerry, annoyed, glares at Nev.  

                                 NEV (CONT'D)
                        So which one's yours, babe?

                                 KERRY
                        None of your business.

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Emma approaches Paul, studying the haunting PORTRAIT OF
           JEMIMA: sexy in her bra, but very alone in her double bed. 

                                 PAUL
                        Making a living with this?

                                 EMMA
                        No.  Not yet.

           Paul smiles.  Impressed.

                                 PAUL
                        A certain soul-less corporate abyss
                        might have freelance photography
                        work if you're in a pinch. 

                                 EMMA
                            (touched)
                        Thanks Paul.  

           Suddenly, Emma sees Wallop, wandering through the crowd...

           And her heart POUNDS.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god!

                                 PAUL
                        I want credit for that. I sent around
                        three inter-office memos.

           Grinning at Paul, she moves off, scanning the crowd...

           Where is he?

           And there he is.  Jack stares at her. He looks tired; the
           past months apparent in his face.  
           His expression... neutral. 

                                 JACK
                        Congratulations, Emma. 

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you, Jack. How have you been?

                                 JACK
                        Red Bull beat us last quarter.

                                 EMMA
                        I'm so sorry.

                                 JACK
                        Me too.  I've been so mad at you. 
                        And Pete.  And her.

           Jack looks over at Jemima, who tries a friendly wave, then
           thinking better of it, dashes off.

                                 EMMA
                        I can't imagine.

                                 JACK
                        But maybe I know what it's like to
                        do something wrong-- to protect
                        someone you love. 

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And sometimes, lately... I can go a
                        whole day, not wanting to beat up my
                        dead best friend. And just miss him. 

           Jack eyes her.  Intense.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And there were times in the shit
                        storm of the last six months-- when
                        I was glad you made me come clean
                        about what he did.  

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Which is maybe the point, right?

                                 EMMA
                        Of what?

                                 JACK
                        The story.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Girl gets on a plane and tells a guy
                        her secrets. He forces her to act on
                        them.  And she... to act on his. 
                        And then... 

           In his face, forgiveness.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        They're both better for it.  

           Emma smiles sadly.  This, so not the ending she wanted.

                                 EMMA
                        I should stop drunk-dialing you. 

                                 JACK
                        I should stop watching you fight the
                        kid on YouTube.  

                                 EMMA
                        You do that?

           Jack looks around at the portraits...

                                 JACK
                        There's a lot of weird, unsettling
                        things you don't know about me. In
                        college, my girlfriend said I had
                        womanly hands.

                                 EMMA 
                        But you have quite muscular hands.

                                 JACK
                        Because ever since-- I've done hand
                        exercises.  With little weights.  

           Emma smiles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And when I hear certain classic rock
                        songs from the '80s-- I imagine I've
                        been in a plane crash and saved all
                        these people.  And as I machete out
                        of the dense foliage leading the
                        wounded, CNN is there and I say to
                        Christine L'Amanpour, "I just did
                        what anyone would do in these
                        circumstances."

           Emma laughs.  Melting.
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And I would really like to not see a
                        jazz show with you. And to not go
                        running with you on a Saturday
                        morning, but tell everyone we did.

           On Emma -- her heart leaping.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And have champagne appear.  Every
                        day.  Wherever we are.

                                 EMMA
                        That's a lot of champagne--

                                 JACK
                        Shut-up, Emma.  I'm trying to be
                        romantic.

           Then Jack kisses Emma.  And she him. 

           Long and hard, and hungry. 

           Until he pulls away, whispering.  His lips grazing her ear.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And I so want to talk dirty to you.

           Emma laughs.

                                 EMMA
                        No, Jack.  Not that. Don't ever do
                        that.

           Then Jack and Emma go back to kissing...

                                 THE END

           As across the gallery MANY MORE secrets are revealed...
