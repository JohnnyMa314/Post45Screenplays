           We hear guttural, labored GRUNTING and a woman SCREAMING. A 
           Zombie ripping apart some hapless victim?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        No! No! Nooo!

           FADE IN:

           To reveal -- 

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           -- Wait for it --

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

           No, these are not the sounds of a Zombie attack. They are 
           those of 35-year-old, lanky MIKE PETERS and his unfairly 
           pretty wife SARAH doing the hibbity jibbity. 

                                 SARAH
                        No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes!

           We notice a half-finished CANVAS PAINTING and ART SUPPLIES 
           scattered about the room.

           A TV plays the news in the background. 

           CLOSE ON TV: a TV NEWS ANCHOR sits at her desk.

                                 ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        More controversy on the Hill today 
                        in the wake of the recent 
                        government-mandated quarantine of 
                        Pittsburgh -- 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Sarah arches her back.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God! Yes! Yes!

           CLOSE ON TV: On the bottom left of the screen are the words 
           “Sen. Albertson R-NC.” White-haired, Southern SENATOR 
           ALBERTSON looks into the camera.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON (ON TV)
                        If you ask me, the recent tragedy 
                        in Pittsburgh is a direct result of 
                        all this namby-pamby enforcement 
                        legislation passed by the liberals 
                        in congress...
           BACK TO SCENE

           Sarah is verging on the point of climax -- clutching the 
           sheets with one hand and digging her nails into Mike’s back 
           with the other.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON (O.S.)
                        We need to enact strict, concrete 
                        control measures to ensure this 
                        does not happen elsewhere!

                                 SARAH
                        Yes! Yes! Mike! Oh my God! Mike! 
                        Don’t stop! Yes! Yes!!!

           ... And there it is.

           She catches her breath.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you...?

                                 MIKE
                             (clearly lying)
                        ... yes?
                             (off her look)
                        No. I didn’t -- it’s just, you 
                        know, the TV was on, and --

           Sarah GROANS and rolls over.

                                 SARAH
                        Jesus, Mike.

           Embarrassed, Mike collapses next to her on the bed.

           Sarah’s scowl warms into a smile.

                                 SARAH
                             (teasing him)
                        I did.

           Now, Mike cracks a smile, too.

                                 MIKE
                             (ironic)
                        Really?

           She playfully pushes him away from her.

           THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mike and Sarah sit at the table, along with Sarah’s elderly 
           parents HYAM and ESTHER. Esther wears a puffy winter coat. 
           Everyone eats in silence until --
                                 ESTHER
                             (brightly)
                        Harriet Rosenberg died today.

                                 HYAM
                        Oh, come on, Esther, they don’t 
                        want to hear that. Why do you 
                        always have to start every 
                        conversation with who died?

                                 ESTHER
                             (relentlessly upbeat)
                        Lung cancer. She was a smoker, you 
                        know. Poor thing. Is it hot in 
                        here?

                                 HYAM
                        You’re still wearing your jacket.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry. Who is Harriet 
                        Rosenberg?

           Esther takes off her jacket and drapes it over her chair.

                                 ESTHER
                        You don’t remember? She was your 
                        old piano teacher. It broke her 
                        heart when you gave it up. She 
                        always said you had so much talent.

                                 HYAM
                        Pump the brakes on the depression-
                        mobile, honey. I feel like I’m in a 
                        Tennessee Williams play.

                                 ESTHER
                        Harriet had eight grandchildren. 
                        Another one on the way, too. Isn’t 
                        that great?

           Mike goes for his scotch. Hyam makes a show of throwing his 
           utensils on his plate and slumping back in his chair in 
           exasperation.

                                 ESTHER
                        We should all be so lucky. To see 
                        our grandchildren before we pass 
                        on.

                                 HYAM
                        So how’s government work, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m afraid that’s classified, Hyam.

           Hyam pretends this is funny enough to warrant a smile.
                                 ESTHER
                             (on a mission)
                        When are you going to give me a 
                        grandson? You’re such a cute 
                        couple. I bet you’d make some 
                        beautiful babies.

           Sarah blushes.

                                 SARAH
                        We’re working on it, mom.

                                 HYAM
                             (to Esther)
                        Lay off it, honey. Let’s try and 
                        enjoy our dinner.

           Mike pours himself another glass of wine.

                                 ESTHER
                        I think I need to use the little 
                        girls’ room.

           Esther leaves, using a WALKER to assist her.

                                 HYAM
                             (forcing a smile)
                        Okay, sweetie.

           Hyam maintains his fake smile until she’s out of earshot -- 
           then drops it abruptly.

                                 HYAM
                        For real though, when are you two 
                        jagoffs going to give that woman a 
                        grandbaby?

                                 SARAH
                        Geez, dad. I said we were working 
                        on it.

                                 HYAM
                        Working on it? What’s the hold up?
                             (to Mike)
                        Your dick broke or something? You 
                        got a broke dick?

                                 SARAH
                             (more embarrassed)
                        His dick works just fine. Okay?

                                 MIKE
                        Rome wasn’t built in a day, you 
                        know.
                                 HYAM
                        What? Rome? We’re not talking about 
                        a city, here. Sarah was built 
                        during sound-check at a Pearl Jam 
                        concert. It doesn’t require a huge 
                        fucking time commitment.

                                 SARAH
                        This isn’t something you can rush, 
                        Dad. It happens when it happens.

                                 HYAM
                        Okay. Whatever. It would be nice if 
                        your mother could see her 
                        grandchild while she still has 
                        brief episodes of being in her 
                        right mind.
                             (ironic)
                        But it’s no big deal. Take your 
                        time.

           Mike looks to Sarah for support, but she just stares at her 
           food.

           INT. METRO CAR - UNDERGROUND - MOVING - DAY

           COMMUTERS read the newspaper, listen to iPods, drink lattes, 
           etc. It’s your normal, everyday commute, EXCEPT --

           EVERYONE is packing heat. Handguns protrude from waistbands 
           or rest conspicuously in side holsters. A few men 
           nonchalantly carry shotguns and rifles. 

           SCROLLING TEXT on an ELECTRONIC SIGN reads: “Threat Level 
           raised to orange. Be alert... Free Handgun Voucher Program 
           extended to families earning up to $30,000/year -- apply 
           today!”

           Mike stands next to AMIT (40s), whose greasy beard and 
           bloodshot eyes give the impression he hasn’t slept in days.

                                 MIKE
                        I remember when wearing mesh shorts 
                        would make me splooge. Now I can’t 
                        even splooge inside a woman. What’s 
                        happening to me?

           A WOMAN standing nearby looks disgusted.

                                 AMIT
                        I guess you’re going through early 
                        menopause.

           Mike declines to dignify this with a response.

                                 AMIT
                        I just called you a woman.
                                 MIKE
                        Maybe it’s some kind of Freudian 
                        hangup. Like I know she quit taking 
                        birth control so my subconscious 
                        knows what’s gonna happen if I...

           Mike clenches his hand into a fist, then opens it up with the 
           following sound effect:

                                 MIKE
                        Sh-shpeww!

           The train jerks to a stop, and the sliding doors open. Amit 
           turns to get off.

                                 AMIT
                        Great. Now I’m going to have that 
                        image in my head all day.

           Mike follows Amit off the train.

           INT. METRO STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY

           Mike and Amit stand at a vending machine. Amit buys a candy 
           bar.

                                 AMIT
                        What do you have against children?

           ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a ZOMBIE climbing out of a nook in the 
           subway tunnel -- crossing the tracks.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. They’re always 
                        sticky. It’s like they have someone 
                        who just shows up and pours maple 
                        syrup on them twice a day...

                                 AMIT
                        I have a kid, you know. It’s not so 
                        bad.

           REVERSE ANGLE: The Zombie creeps up behind Mike and Amit. 
           They don’t notice.

                                 MIKE
                        Your kid killed a squirrel with a 
                        butter knife last week.

                                 AMIT
                        Yeah, well, that squirrel had it 
                        coming. Probably reincarnated by 
                        now, anyway -- 

           Suddenly, Mike notices the REFLECTION of the Zombie standing 
           directly behind them.
                                 MIKE
                        Oh shit...

                                 ZOMBIE
                        RAWR!!!!

           Mike and Amit each spin around, startled. Mike draws his gun 
           and FIRES wildly in the general direction of the Zombie -- 
           completely missing it three times.

           Meanwhile, Amit SHOOTS it twice in the head, killing it.

           Amit holsters his gun and reaches for his candy bar -- no big 
           deal; this kind of shit happens all the time.

                                 MIKE
                        Nice shot.

                                 AMIT
                        Thanks...

           Mike and Amit head toward the exit. Amit looks at his candy 
           bar -- 

                                 AMIT
                        A Zombie-Finger?! I pushed the 
                        thing for Snickers!
                             (reading)
                        “Brain flavor.” Hmm.

           He takes a bite.

                                 MIKE
                        What do brains taste like?

                                 AMIT
                             (eating)
                        Nougat. So, who told you Aden 
                        killed that squirrel?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. One of Sarah’s 
                        friends. She said your wife threw a 
                        shit fit, though.

                                 AMIT
                        Yeah, she was going on about how 
                        that means he’s going to be some 
                        kind of sociopath. I told her if he 
                        can’t kill a squirrel now, what 
                        good’s he going to be when he’s an 
                        adult?
                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. I think killing an 
                        animal with a butter knife might 
                        still qualify you as a sociopath... 
                        even today.

                                 AMIT
                        Just a kid doing stupid kid shit.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s exactly my point! Kids are 
                        just like little sociopaths. I 
                        don’t want one of those in my 
                        house!

           As they walk up the stairs toward the street, HOLD on a 
           POSTER on the wall. It’s an ad for a book titled “Right 
           Between the Eyes” and the cover features an INTENSE-LOOKING 
           MAN in body armor, holding an automatic weapon.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           PUSH to a big government building, with the words "UNITED 
           STATES DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE" etched prominently in the 
           facade.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Amit presses the button for the seventh floor, labeled 
           “Research & Development.” We notice the fourth floor is 
           labeled “Zombie Population Control.”

           The news plays on a FLAT-SCREEN TV on the wall.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        As the “War on Zombie” drags into 
                        its fifth year, with no end in 
                        sight, citizens are speaking out...

                                 AMIT
                        Do you even remember what life was 
                        like in the “before” times?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. It sucked. 

                                 AMIT
                        ... What?

                                 MIKE
                        Seriously -- I was living in South 
                        West, working at a copy store and 
                        delivering pizzas on weekends. Then 
                        -- BOOM -- Zombies all of a sudden 
                        exist. They kill off enough people 
                        more qualified than me, and I start 
                        getting job offers.
                                 AMIT
                        Fucking recession.

           DING. The doors open.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, the Zombies really turned the 
                        economy around. You gotta give ‘em 
                        that.

           Mike and Amit walk out of the elevator. PUSH to the TV.

           TEST AREA - DAY

           A military vehicle (”The Prowler”) -- an MRAP modified for 
           Zombie-killing -- is the only thing in the room.

           OUTSIDE TEST AREA - SAME TIME

           Mike and Amit stand on the other side of one-way glass.

           A DV CAM on a tripod films the test area. Mike speaks into a 
           mic connected to the camera.

                                 MIKE (INTO MIC)
                        Commencing stability test on baited 
                        Prowler.

           He hits a button on the control board.

           TEST AREA - SAME TIME

           A mechanized door inside the room opens. Zombies run in and 
           start attacking the vehicle.

           OUTSIDE TEST AREA - SAME TIME

           KELLY -- a pretty, bespectacled young woman who wouldn't 
           rather be anywhere else in the world right now -- approaches, 
           carrying a gun. On the other side of the glass, Zombies 
           continue attacking the military vehicle.

                                 KELLY
                             (re: gun)
                        Check it out. Integrated a Zombie 
                        Detection Device with a handgun. 
                        Point it at a Zombie and it just 
                        starts shooting.
                                 MIKE
                        So, it’s a gun for really, really 
                        lazy people?

                                 KELLY
                        The blind, the elderly, you know. 
                        But watch this.

           Kelly produces a ROOMBA (one of those self-propelled robot 
           vacuum cleaners), wedges the Zombie-detecting handgun into 
           it, and holds it up.

                                 MIKE / AMIT
                        No way. / That’s the most genius 
                        thing since the upside-down tomato 
                        planter.

                                 KELLY

           The Roomba rolls around the room, killing Zombies.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           OUTSIDE TEST AREA - SAME TIME

           Mike, Amit, and Kelly watch this.

                                 MIKE
                        That is so awesome... 

                                 KELLY
                        Yeah, it's pretty badass, huh?

           Then, the Roomba SHOOTS the gas line of the vehicle, which 
           EXPLODES.

                                 MIKE / KELLY
                        Holy shit! / Whoa!

           The Zombies that haven’t already been shot are all 
           incinerated. So is the Prowler.

                                 AMIT

           Mike lets his head fall against the glass.
                                 AMIT
                        Hey, it’s an easy fix.
                             (standing)
                        Come on, buddy. I’ll buy you a 
                        drink.

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT - "ZOMBIE" POV

           Someone -- or someTHING -- approaches the building. Cue echo-
           y, suspenseful SFX.

           QUICK CUTS between his/its shaky, weird-VFX-laden POV and 
           his/its feet shuffling awkwardly toward the front door...

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Sarah struggles with a painting -- a MAN’S FACE, half of 
           which is smiling and half of which is frowning, surrounded by  
           ANGRY-LOOKING SHAPES (hard edges, jarring colors, etc.).

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - SAME TIME - "ZOMBIE" POV

           The “Zombie” hesitates in front of the door.

           A HAND grabs the door knob. SFX and MUSIC CUES RAMP UP. 

           The DOORKNOB turns --

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           All SFX and MUSIC drop out as the “Zombie” enters and catches 
           his reflection in a mirror.

           It’s Mike -- looking very drunk.

           THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Sarah takes a step back from her weird, discordant painting. 
           Frowns.

           THE BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Mike stumbles in and takes a piss. From the way he smacks his 
           mouth, it’s clear there is a bad taste in it.

           THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Frustrated, Sarah SLINGS PAINT all over the canvas.

           THE BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Mike reaches for some toothpaste on the sink. As he does, he 
           notices a prescription pill bottle. He picks it up.

           CLOSE ON PILL BOTTLE: “Pergonal.”
           BACK TO SCENE

           Mike sets the bottle down. Picks it up again. Then opens the 
           medicine cabinet and pulls out one of those “M/T/W/Th/F” pill-
           boxes.

           THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike changes clothes. Sarah enters, wearing one of his old T-
           shirts and nothing else. It would be really sexy if she 
           weren’t so pissed off.

                                 SARAH
                        What the hell is wrong with you?!

                                 MIKE
                        Uh -- I don’t -- What?

           She holds up a pill bottle.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you really think I wouldn’t 
                        notice?

                                 MIKE
                        Notice what?

                                 SARAH
                        That you replaced my fertility 
                        drugs with birth control pills. 
                        They’re not even the same color.

                                 MIKE
                        What? I didn’t do that.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. I guess it was Jimbo, my 
                        imaginary pet dinosaur...
                             (stuggling)
                        ... with anthropomorphic... 
                        opposable thumbs... and a penchant 
                        for... mischievous... -- NO ONE 
                        ELSE FUCKING LIVES HERE, IF IT 
                        WASN’T YOU, WHO WAS IT?!

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know, maybe you did it. 
                        Sleepwalking or something. You’ve 
                        been taking a lot of Ambien --

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God.

                                 MIKE
                        Because, subconsciously you know 
                        you’re not ready --
                                 SARAH
                        Jesus. Shut up. You could have 
                        talked to me. “Sarah, I’m starting 
                        to have second thoughts about 
                        trying to get pregnant. Maybe we’re 
                        not at a place in our lives where 
                        we can support a child.”

                                 MIKE
                        That’s good. Let’s pretend I said 
                        that.

                                 SARAH
                        But you didn’t. You flushed, like, 
                        $800 worth of fertility drugs down 
                        the toilet. Because, on the 
                        Freudian timeline, you never 
                        matured past the anal stage.

                                 MIKE
                        Is that before or after genital?

           She crosses her arms.

                                 MIKE
                        Because I definitely made it to 
                        genital.

           A staring contest...

                                 SARAH
                        Are you sure about that?

           A beat. Sarah wins.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s called whiskey-dick.
                             (leaving)
                        It’s a real thing. Look it up on 
                        Urban Dictionary.

           THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Angry, Mike pours himself another glass of scotch.

           He takes a sip. Anger fades into regret...

           THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The alarm clock reads: “1:13.”

           Sarah and Mike are in bed. Sarah is sound asleep. Mike is  
           staring at her. She looks even more beautiful now that she’s 
           not really stressed out. Mike just looks depressed.

           Mike gets out of bed and leaves the room -- grabbing a 
           marijuana pipe and a lighter on his way out.
           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

           Mike sits on the ground, exhaling an impressive plume of 
           smoke -- then remains motionless, staring into space, lost in 
           thought.

           He tries to take another hit of pot, but the bowl is cashed. 
           He bangs the ash out on the cement, then goes back inside.

           We notice, once he’s inside, that he’s left the FRONT DOOR 
           SLIGHTLY AJAR.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The alarm clock reads “3:27.”

           Mike and Sarah both sleep soundly. Until --

           A SMALL THUD comes from the other room. Sarah opens her eyes. 
           There’s an even SMALLER THUD, followed by RUSTLING. She 
           shakes Mike. 

                                 SARAH
                        Mike... Mike!

           Mike doesn’t so much as stir. Sarah shakes him as hard as she 
           can.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike!

           Mike SNORES. She shakes him again. Nothing.

                                 SARAH
                        Goddamnit, you are worthless!

           A beat. Now, only the RUSTLING can be heard... Somebody 
           probably just left a window open. Sarah decides to go 
           investigate.

           The CAMERA stays on Mike as we hear the bedroom door OPEN and 
           CLOSE... Sarah’s FOOTSTEPS getting farther away... then --

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

           Mike jolts awake.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

           Mike jumps out of bed. Grabs his gun off the bedside table.
           THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Mike rushes in. A ZOMBIE MAN and a ZOMBIE WOMAN have Sarah 
           trapped in a corner --

           CRACK! Mike shoots Zombie Man in the jaw. He reels, but 
           immediately turns back to Sarah. Zombie Woman charges Mike -- 

           CRACK! Mike takes out Zombie Woman -- easy headshot. She 
           crumples to the floor. Zombie Man LUNGES for Sarah’s neck --

           CRACK! Mike shoots him in the temple. He collapses on Sarah.

           Sarah shoves Zombie Man’s body off her, and it THUDS to the 
           floor. As Mike rushes over --

                                 MIKE
                        Are you okay?!

           Mike puts his arm around her. Pushes her hair off her face, 
           her neck -- searching for bite marks -- was he too slow?

           Sarah pulls him close to her. For all he knows, she’s about 
           to tear open his neck with her teeth, but he doesn’t try and 
           stop her --

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah... I’m okay... I’m okay...

           Mike kisses her cheek. Wraps his free arm around her. 
           Squeezes.

                                 SARAH
                        Can’t breathe --

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

           He loosens his grip just a little bit.

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

           GRUNTING, Mike drags Zombie Man’s corpse past a BLACK TRASH 
           BIN and a BLUE “RECYCLABLES ONLY” BIN before arriving at RED 
           BIN that reads “BIOHAZARD: ZOMBIE REMAINS ONLY.” He struggles 
           to lift the corpse into the bin -- knocking a FLOWER POT off 
           an adjacent brick wall in the process -- but, finally, he 
           succeeds.

                                 MIKE
                             (catching his breath)
                        Whew!

           Sarah arrives with Zombie Woman’s corpse.

                                 MIKE
                        I can take it from here.
           Sarah nods “thanks,” wipes her brow, and heads back inside. 

           Their neighbor JESSICA opens her window. Shouts --

                                 JESSICA
                        Mike! You really need to be taking 
                        out the trash at quarter of four in 
                        the morning?!

                                 MIKE
                             (shouting up)
                        Sorry, Jessica. Had a late-night 
                        Zombie run-in. Didn’t mean to wake 
                        you.

                                 JESSICA
                             (re: bin)
                        That couldn’t have waited until the 
                        morning?

                                 MIKE
                        Well, considering the stomach-
                        churning stench, not really!

           Jessica GRUMBLES, then SLAMS her window. Then --

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Mike, get in here!! There’s another 
                        one!

           Mike turns and bolts toward the house, drawing his gun.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH'S ROWHOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike runs in. Sees Sarah leaning against a cabinet.

                                 MIKE
                        Where?! Where is it?

           She gestures at the cabinet --

                                 MIKE
                        ... What?

                                 SARAH
                        It’s just a little one.

           Sarah opens the cabinet door, revealing a ZOMBIE BABY, 
           wearing a diaper and nothing else. Closes the cabinet.

                                 SARAH
                        A little baby one.

           Mike puts his hand on the cabinet door.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. I’ll take care of it.
           He throws the door open -- points the gun at Zombie Baby.

           Zombie Baby cowers, slinks into the corner. 

                                 SARAH
                        Aww. Look how scared it is.

           Mike gives her a look --

                                 SARAH
                        ... Sorry.

           Mike looks back to Zombie Baby, adjusts his aim --

                                 SARAH
                        Wait. I don’t want to watch.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, don’t watch.

                                 SARAH
                             (closes her eyes)
                        All right. I’m not watching. Go.

           Mike pulls the trigger. CLICK.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. Go get me some bullets.

                                 SARAH
                        ‘K.

           Sarah leaves. As Mike waits for her to come back, Zombie Baby 
           manages to look even more helpless and vulnerable and 
           pathetic.

           Sarah arrives with the bullets. Mike loads the gun as --

           Zombie Baby gives Sarah the puppy-dog-eyes look.

                                 MIKE
                        Take a couple steps back. There 
                        might be some splatter.

                                 SARAH
                             (doing so)
                        Oh... Okay...

           Mike points the gun at Zombie Baby...

                                 MIKE
                             (preparing himself)
                        Okay.

           Zombie Baby WHIMPERS.
                                 SARAH
                        Wait -- do you have to shoot it? 
                        Isn’t there a more, like, humane 
                        way to kill a Zombie?

                                 MIKE
                        Not that I can think of...

           Mike focuses his attention back to Zombie Baby. Steadies his 
           aim --

                                 SARAH
                        It’s just so loud and violent.

           Mike lowers his gun slightly.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess we could stab him in the 
                        eye with an ice-pick or 
                        something...

                                 SARAH
                        How is that better?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s quieter...

                                 SARAH
                        I’m serious, Mike! Don’t they say 
                        how you die affects how you 
                        experience the afterlife?

                                 MIKE
                        Zombies are already dead, babe. 

                                 SARAH
                        No. They’re undead. Look at him!

           Zombie Baby shivers -- clearly, on some level, he is “aware.”

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t they have some government 
                        Zombie Disposal Service or 
                        something? What about that hotline?

           Resigned, Mike hands her the gun.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sarah has the Zombie baby at gunpoint. Mike, pacing, holds a 
           cordless phone to his ear. The OVEN CLOCK reads “3:45.”

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        You are the 86th caller in the 
                        queue --
           LATER   

           The oven clock now reads “4:23.”

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        You are next in the queue.

           The line starts RINGING.

                                 MIKE
                        Finally!

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Hello. Please select one of the 
                        following options so that we may 
                        direct your call to the appropriate 
                        department.

                                 MIKE
                        What?!

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Press “one” if you have a question 
                        about what to do in the event of a 
                        Zombie attack. Press “two” if you 
                        have a question about the Free 
                        Handgun Voucher Program.

           A beat. These are the only options.

           Sarah shifts the weight of the gun to her other arm, blows 
           hair out of her face.

                                 SARAH
                        My arm’s getting tired.

           Mike presses “one.”

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        In the event of a Zombie attack, 
                        shoot the Zombie in the head. If 
                        you do not have a firearm, puncture 
                        the brain with a sharp object. As a 
                        last resort, use a blunt object to 
                        bash in its skull. If there’s time, 
                        call 911. Goodbye.

           DIAL TONE. Seething, Mike hangs up. Slowly sets down the 
           phone.

                                 SARAH
                        Can’t you find out at work 
                        tomorrow?

                                 MIKE
                        And just leave him in the cabinet 
                        until then?
                                 SARAH
                        He doesn’t even have his teeth yet. 
                        It’s not like he can hurt us.

                                 MIKE
                        Still...

                                 SARAH
                        What if we rig it so it can’t open?

                                 MIKE
                        My Frosted Flakes are in there.

           She pulls out the Frosted Flakes and hands them to Mike -- 
           “see how easy that was?”

           Zombie Baby sneezes in her face, erasing her smug expression.

                                 SARAH
                        Ew. Gross!

           Sarah wipes the snot off her face with her shirt-tail. Mike 
           laughs at the universe punishing her for her momentary lapse 
           of humility.

           She closes the cabinet, takes off her hair scrunchie, and 
           wraps it around the knobs of the cabinet doors.

           She starts to leave the room. Mike bursts out laughing again.

                                 SARAH
                        Asshole.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, come on. That was funny!

           Mike follows her back to the bedroom.

           ANGLE ON SCRUNCHIE: Beginning to SLIDE OFF the cabinet doors.

           THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The ALARM CLOCK reads “5:40.”

           Mike is asleep. He slowly opens his eyes. Zombie Baby is 
           sucking on his head -- trying to eat his brains.

           Sarah jolts awake.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God!

           Mike realizes what’s happening --

                                 MIKE
                        Bwah!!
           -- then violently THROWS Zombie Baby across the room. Zombie 
           Baby huddles in the corner and WHIMPERS.

                                 SARAH
                        Aw, Mike... You didn’t have to 
                        throw him like that.

                                 MIKE
                             (into pillow, screaming)
                        ZOMBIE!!!

           Mike gets out of bed.

           THE NEXT DAY

           Zombie Baby is hog-tied with electrical cords to the leg of a 
           chest of drawers. The TV blares in the background --

                                 CONSERVATIVE BLOWHARD (ON TV)
                        I think it’s about time! We don’t 
                        draw a line between terrorists and 
                        those who harbor them! Why should 
                        we do that with this threat?!

           Mike enters, half-dressed for work, noticeably sleep-
           deprived, and eating a banana. He puts his shoes on.

                                 LIBERAL BLOWHARD (ON TV)
                        All I’m saying is: We have more 
                        pressing matters to deal with right 
                        now than Zombies. Like health care 
                        reform. Over-inflation. The war 
                        with Pakistan --

           Mike, ready for work, points the banana at Zombie Baby. Tries 
           to make the noise that guns make -- 

                                 MIKE
                        P’choo.

           Zombie Baby just smiles at him.

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - DAY

           Mike walks out in a hurry. He steps over a copy of the 
           Washington Post.

           CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER: The front page headline reads “HR 2472 
           Passes.”

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - ARCHIVES - DAY

           Mike scans down the index of a DOZ MANUAL. The letters “A”-
           ”Y” take up about five percent of the page. The letter “Z” 
           takes up the remainder.
                                 MIKE
                             (mumbling as he reads)
                        Zombie diet, Zombie dirtboarding, 
                        Zombie Dis...

           CLOSE ON: The index -- which reads, “Zombie Discourse, Film 
           and Literature pp. 8, 26-32” --

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                             (disappointed)
                        ... course.

           The next line reads, “Zombie Doer: See ‘Zombie Fucker.’” No 
           evidence of “Zombie Disposal Service.”

           BACK TO SCENE

           Disappointed, Mike closes the manual.

           Just then, a cell-phone alarm goes off. Mike turns and sees 
           Amit yawing as he pulls himself off a nearby, empty 
           bookshelf.

                                 AMIT
                             (nonchalant)
                        Hey.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing in here?

                                 AMIT
                        Where I take my hangover naps... 
                        What are you doing here?

           Mike decides not to show his hand --

                                 MIKE
                        Same thing.
                             (holds up the manual)
                        Pretty good pillow in a pinch.

                                 AMIT
                        You don’t have to tell me. Put some 
                        newspaper on top and oh, man. If 
                        you can’t fall asleep on that, you 
                        didn’t drink enough last night.
                             (as he walks off)
                        You coming?

                                 MIKE
                        To what?

                                 AMIT
                        Mandatory sensitivity training. 
                        Read your e-mail like once a week, 
                        dude.
           A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           ROGER, Mike’s boss, wraps up the conference. There are lots 
           of “stuffed-animal” versions of Zombies and dismembered 
           people near him.

                                 ROGER
                        Are there any questions?

           Mike looks around.

                                 MIKE
                        I have a question... What is the 
                        preferred method of disposal for an 
                        infected person? You know, other 
                        than having to shoot them in the 
                        head.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m not sure I understand the 
                        question --

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. Let’s say, hypothetically, 
                        you manage to trap a Zombie 
                        somewhere in your house. Is there 
                        some kind of “Zombie Disposal 
                        Service” you could call to take 
                        care of it in a humane manner?

                                 ROGER
                        “Humane manner?”

           Everyone LAUGHS. 

                                 ROGER
                        No, there is no Zombie Disposal 
                        Service. And, thanks to the bill 
                        that passed  yesterday -- HR 2472, 
                        which made harboring a Zombie a 
                        treasonous offence -- if someone 
                        did find himself in the situation 
                        you just described, he could be 
                        sentenced to death by hanging.

           Mike REACTS.

           R & D FLOOR - DAY

           Mike hurries toward the exit. He checks his phone.

           CLOSE ON IPHONE -- One missed call from Sarah.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Mike calls her back.
           RING. RING. RING. RING. CLICK.

                                 MIKE
                        Sarah?

                                 SARAH (OVER PHONE) 
                        Hi, this is Sarah. Leave me a 
                        message!

           As Mike nears the door, an exasperated Kelly enters, taking 
           off her hat and gloves. She notices Robert giving her a look.

                                 KELLY
                        Sorry I’m late, boss. Train on the 
                        red line hit a Roving pack of 
                        Zombies. Three hour delay going 
                        South. No service whatsoever 
                        Northbound. It’s a mess out there.

           Pissed, Mike spins around and heads back the way he came.

           EDDIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           EDDIE works at his computer. Mike enters.

                                 MIKE
                        I need to borrow your car.
                             (off his hesitation)
                        Please. It’s an emergency. I 
                        wouldn’t ask if it weren’t.

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - DAY

           It snows. Mike peels out of the parking garage in Eddie’s BMW 
           M3 convertible.

           INT. / EXT. BMW - DAY

           Mike holds his cell phone to his ear. It’s ringing.

                                 SARAH (OVER PHONE)
                        Hi, it’s Sarah. Leave a mess--

           Mike ends the call. He fumbles with the phone, drops it -- 
           and it lands right on the switch that makes the convertible 
           top go down.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit.

           Mike continues to speed through D.C. as he gropes under the 
           seat for his phone. Meanwhile, the wind catches the 
           convertible top, and there’s a horrible METALLIC CRUNCH.

           Mike pushes the button to make the top go up again. Nothing. 
           He pushes the button to make it go down. Nothing. 
           When he looks up, he has to slam on the brakes to avoid a 
           ramming into a slew of vehicles stopped at a red light.

           After the BMW skids to a stop, a CRAZED ZOMBIE darts into the 
           intersection, flailing its arms around.

           A loud, deep horn BLOWS as, from the cross-street, an 18-
           wheeler SKIDS through the intersection -- SPLATTERING the 
           Zombie and then CRASHING into a telephone pole.

           The light turns green, but the 18-wheeler completely blocks 
           the intersection. Moronically, other cars HONK.

           Mike slams his fist on the steering wheel in frustration -- 
           just before he notices a DISFIGURED FACE lunging at him from 
           the other direction!

                                 MIKE
                        Oh Jesus!

           But wait -- it’s just a HOMELESS GUY washing Eddie’s 
           windshield. Mike catches his breath -- then BLARES the horn 
           and shoos the man away with his arms.

                                 MIKE
                        Get out of the way!

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                             (shuffling aside)
                        Asshole.

           Mike makes an illegal U-turn, turns right onto the first side 
           street, and speeds away.

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - DUSK

           The BMW SCREECHES to a halt in front of the house. Mike, 
           covered in snow and shivering, jumps out.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           Sarah plays with Zombie Baby. Mike enters.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank God. You’re all right.

                                 SARAH
                        Of course I’m all right. Why 
                        wouldn’t I be?

                                 MIKE
                        You didn’t hear about the new law?

           Sarah continues playing with Zombie Baby.
                                 SARAH
                             (nonchalant)
                        HR 2742? Yeah. It was all over the 
                        news.
                             (then; ironic)
                        What, did you think the gendarmerie 
                        was going to storm in here and 
                        arrest me on one of their daily 
                        Zombie Raids?

                                 MIKE
                        How can you be so calm about it?! 
                        We’re literally committing crimes 
                        against the state right now. If 
                        someone sees us with that --
                             (whispers)
                        baby Zombie --

           Sarah spins Zombie Baby around so he’s facing Mike.

                                 SARAH
                        You mean with this little cutie? 
                        Doesn’t look like a Zombie to me.

           Mike looks at Zombie Baby. He doesn’t really look like a 
           Zombie, anymore.

                                 MIKE
                        Is he wearing makeup?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. Makes him look more people-y, 
                        huh?

                                 MIKE
                             (begrudgingly)
                        He is less disgusting than I 
                        remember. But, Sarah, this is 
                        ridiculous. We can’t possibly --

           A KNOCK at the door.

           FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike looks through the peephole as whoever’s outside KNOCKS 
           again -- causing the door to hit Mike in the face.

           He opens the door, rubbing his eye-socket in pain. Hyam and 
           Esther stand outside.

                                 HYAM
                        Hey. I think someone forgot her 
                        jacket the last time we were here.

                                 ESTHER
                        “Someone?” I have a name, you know.
           Mike grabs Esther’s puffy jacket from earlier off the coat 
           rack.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. Right. Here you go.
                             (handing her the jacket)
                        Well, I’d invite you in but Sarah 
                        and I were just about --

           Just then, Zombie Baby scurries in from the living room, with 
           Sarah chasing him.

                                 SARAH
                        Crap, crap, crap --

           She swoops him up and bolts back into the living room -- but 
           not before Esther notices.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh my God! Is that what I think it 
                        is?!

           Hyam puts his hand on Mike’s shoulder. Smiles.

                                 HYAM
                        Son of a bitch. You did it?

           Esther forces her way past Mike.

                                 ESTHER
                        You adopted?

                                 MIKE
                             (following her)
                        Well, we’re just fostering him, 
                        really --

           Hyam follows Mike, following Esther, into the --

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sarah sits on the couch with Zombie Baby in her lap. Esther 
           leans over them.

                                 ESTHER
                        What’s his name?!

           Mike and Sarah look at each other.

                                 MIKE / SARAH
                        Um... / Well... / It’s...

                                 MIKE
                             (thinking fast)
                        Colin.
                                 ESTHER
                        Colin?! Sounds a little goy to 
                        me...

                                 MIKE
                             (joking)
                        Well, his middle name is Phlegm, so 
                        we thought it kind of evened out.

           Esther laughs, then pinches Mike on the back of his arm.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, this one thinks he’s clever --

                                 MIKE
                        Ow!!

                                 ESTHER
                             (re: Colin)
                        Aw. He’s too cute.
                             (pokes his nose)
                        You’re just adorable!

                                 MIKE
                        Now, don’t start researching prep 
                        schools just yet..

                                 ESTHER
                        Huh? Why do you say that?

                                 MIKE
                        You know. These things fall apart 
                        all the time. We’re just a 
                        temporary home for him.

                                 ESTHER
                        What? You’re just going to abandon 
                        him?!

                                 MIKE
                        No, but if someone --

                                 ESTHER
                        I know what “foster” means. At 
                        least give him a chance to warm up 
                        to you, before you throw him away. 

           Esther reaches for Zombie Baby [Colin].

                                 ESTHER
                             (to Sarah)
                        You’re holding him wrong. Give him 
                        to me.

           Sarah hands Colin to Esther. She tickles his chin. Colin 
           GIGGLES and COOS. Hyam notices that Mike looks put off. He 
           feels like they’re intruding.
                                 HYAM
                        Okay, honey. We should probably get 
                        a move on. Don’t want to be late.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, yes. Of course. We’ve got to 
                        get to -- where are we going again?

                                 HYAM
                        We’ve got orchestra seats for Mars 
                        Attacks at the Kennedy Center --

           Esther hands Colin back to Sarah.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, that’s right. They say it works 
                        much better as a play than a movie, 
                        you know. I can’t wait.

                                 MIKE
                        ... Really?

                                 ESTHER
                             (to Sarah, re: Colin)
                        Promise me you’ll give him a 
                        chance, okay?

                                 SARAH
                             (reluctantly)
                        Okay, mom. I promise.

           Mike glares at her. Then hurries Esther and Hyam to the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, We don’t want to keep you. 
                        Thanks for stopping by.

           FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

                                 ESTHER
                        Bye, Mike.
                             (shouts)
                        Bye, Sarah! Bye, Colin!

           Esther and Hyam walk out the front door. Esther has never 
           looked happier.

           LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike storms in the room.

                                 MIKE
                             (hushed)
                        What was that?!

                                 SARAH
                        What?
                                 MIKE
                        You just let him run into the other 
                        room so your parents could see 
                        him?!

                                 SARAH
                        I looked away for like two seconds! 
                        He just took off!

           Mike pulls out his gun.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, this has gone on long enough. 
                        Put him on that table.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike! No!

           Mike picks up Colin and puts him on the table himself. Sarah 
           gets up and stands between Mike and Colin.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?!

                                 MIKE
                        Sarah, we can’t keep a goddamn baby 
                        Zombie in the house. I was worried 
                        sick about you today --

                                 SARAH
                        Aww. You were?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes! Why did you call me, by the 
                        way?!

                                 SARAH
                        Oh. That must have been Colin. He 
                        likes shiny things... And things 
                        that light up. It’s pretty cute.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, well, before you get any more 
                        attached, move out of the way so I 
                        can shoot him.

                                 SARAH
                        We can’t kill him now! What are we 
                        going to tell my mom?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. We’ll figure 
                        something out.

                                 SARAH
                        You saw how happy he made her. 
                        She’d be devastated!
                                 MIKE
                        We really don’t have any other 
                        options.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike -- if we don’t have this baby 
                        tomorrow, no matter what we tell 
                        her, she is going to think we’re 
                        horrible parents. We’ll never hear 
                        the end of it.

                                 MIKE
                        Sarah, I really feel like you don’t 
                        appreciate the gravity of this 
                        situation.

                                 SARAH
                        Please. Let’s just wait a couple 
                        more days. Then you can kill him 
                        and I’ll say we gave him back to 
                        Child Services. At least she’ll 
                        think we tried.

           A beat. She looks at him pleadingly. Mike turns Colin, who 
           also looks at him pleadingly. Colin’s lower lip QUIVERS. 
           Finally, Mike holsters his gun.

                                 MIKE
                        Fine. Just for a couple of days.

           THAT NIGHT

           Mike and Sarah are asleep. Colin is tied to the chest of 
           drawers -- and CRYING. Mike sort-of wakes up.

                                 MIKE
                             (half-asleep)
                        Sarah... Zombie baby’s crying.

                                 SARAH
                             (half-asleep)
                        What is?

                                 MIKE
                        Connor. Collard. What are we 
                        calling it again?

                                 SARAH
                        Colin.

           Mike half-heartedly tries to shake Sarah awake without moving 
           his own body.

                                 MIKE
                        Cotton’s making noise. Make him not 
                        make noise, okay?
                                 SARAH
                        You do it.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll do it next one. Time.

           Sarah gets up and sees to Colin. The CAMERA does not.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Aw. You’ve got a dirty diaper. 
                        Except you aren’t wearing a diaper, 
                        so you’re covered in shit, yes you 
                        are! Ewwwww! Oh my God, Mike, this 
                        is so disgusting. The floor is 
                        slippery.  I’m turning on the 
                        light.

           CLICK. PAN to reveal: The whole corner of the room that 
           Colin’s chained to is covered in shit.

                                 MIKE
                        Man, that is gross...
                             (half-assed sing-song)
                        Someone hasn't been eating his 
                        vegetables...
                             (then)
                        Wait a minute. Didn’t he come with 
                        a diaper?

           Sarah gestures toward the diaper several feet away on the 
           floor. 

                                 MIKE
                        Huh. We should probably get him 
                        some more...
                             (rolling over)
                        ... one day.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, you are not going back to 
                        sleep!

                                 MIKE
                             (falling asleep)
                        Shit-corner will still be there in 
                        the morning, babe...

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, it smells horrible... MIKE!!!

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, okay! I’m up!
           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

           Colin sits on the concrete, naked, as Mike, yawning, sprays 
           him with a hose. Colin stares at Mike with a big, goofy grin 
           on his face -- despite being so cold his skin is blue.

           Mike looks around -- notices his NEIGHBOR staring at them as 
           he lets out his dog. Mike quickly starts pretending that 
           Colin is just having fun playing in the water.

                                 MIKE
                        Whooo! Don’t get wet! Dodge the 
                        water!

           Mike runs in circles around Colin, spraying him, them missing 
           him, then spraying him again. Colin remains motionless.

           Mike’s neighbor goes inside. Mike resumes standing in one 
           spot and spraying Colin.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Mike!

           Sarah walks outside, pissed.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?

           Mike quits spraying Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        What? He stank!

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, he’s not a wetsuit!

                                 MIKE
                        Come on. He likes it.

           Colin still has the goofy grin, but now he’s SHIVERING.

                                 SARAH
                        He’s shivering, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        He wasn’t doing that before...

           Sarah SIGHS, picks up Colin, and walks inside.

                                 MIKE
                             (following her)
                        Oh, come on --

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DIAPER AISLE - DAY

           A sign on a beer display reads “Zombie Apocalypse Day Weekend 
           Sale -- Domestic Beer 30% Off.”
           Mike pushes a shopping cart with Colin in it. Colin is 
           wearing makeup and looks just like a normal, human baby. He 
           is also wrapped in a SHEET.

           A WOMAN walks by. COLIN opens his mouth and leans toward her. 
           He thrashes about, Zombie instincts telling him to eat her 
           brains, but the sheet is wrapped too tightly for him to make 
           any progress.

                                 WOMAN
                        Aw, aren’t you adorable?

           Sarah smiles “thanks” as the woman walks away.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Mike, re: Colin)
                        Good call on the swaddling clothes. 

                                 MIKE
                        I do what I can.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Colin)
                        Look at you, all swaddled up. Just 
                        like Baby Jesus.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, I don’t know about that 
                        analogy.

           Sarah picks up a package of diapers.

                                 SARAH
                        What about these ones? They have 
                        wings.

                                 MIKE
                        Is that good or bad?

                                 SARAH
                        I think they help keep all the poop 
                        inside.

                                 MIKE
                        Perfect. Get those. God bless 
                        America.

           Sarah throws the diapers in the cart as Mike notices 
           something else on the shelf.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, look at this! Rubber pants! 
                        Jackpot! We could shove him in a 
                        pair of these and forget about it.

                                 SARAH
                        Gross. We’re not doing that.
                                 MIKE
                        Why not? He’s a Zombie. He doesn’t 
                        care if he’s sitting in his own 
                        poop for a couple days.

                                 SARAH
                        Eh... I don’t know.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. We’ll get both. Double-bag 
                        it.

           Mike throws the rubber pants in the shopping cart.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mike sprawls on the couch, flipping through channels on the 
           TV, until he lands on an “Entertainment Tonight”-type 
           celebrity interview. The man being interviewed is the same 
           man we saw in the book ad in the subway.

           Throughout this scene, Colin CRIES in the other room.

                                 HOST (ON TV)
                        I’m here with Military Consultant 
                        Jeffrey Peters, author of the book 
                        “Right Between the Eyes.”

           As the TV cuts to Jeffrey, Mike GROANS. Something about this 
           guy really pisses him off.

                                 HOST (ON TV)
                        Jeffrey, your book has been an 
                        inspiration to so many people. Tell 
                        us, what was your inspiration.

                                 JEFFREY (ON TV)
                        Well, Jim, to be honest. I just 
                        love killing Zombies.

           The Host chuckles.

                                 HOST (ON TV)
                        It sure seems that way. According 
                        to your book, you’ve killed 2,348 
                        Zombies to date.

                                 JEFFREY (ON TV)
                             (full of himself)
                        Those are confirmed kills. The 
                        actual number’s probably closer to 
                        twenty-six hundred.

                                 HOST (ON TV)
                        What do you think about HR 2471 --
                        the new federal law about harboring 
                        Zombies?
                                 JEFFREY
                        What do you think I think? Zombies 
                        are a threat to civilization as we 
                        know it. If you ask me, death by 
                        hanging is too light of a 
                        punishment for the scum that refuse 
                        to see that.

           A little freaked out, Mike turns off the TV.

                                 COLIN (O.S.)
                        WAHHHHH! WAHHHHHH!

           BEDROOM - DAY

           Sarah jiggles Colin in her arms -- trying to make him stop 
           crying.

                                 COLIN
                        WAHHHHHH! WAHHHHHH!

           Mike enters. Leans over Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        Shhh...

           Colin stops crying.

                                 MIKE
                        Good work.

           Mike stands up straight. Colin starts to cry again.

                                 MIKE
                        Now what?

           Mike takes Colin from Sarah. (NOTE: Mike always holds Colin 
           like a toddler -- hoisted up so Colin’s head is over Mike’s 
           shoulder. Sarah “cradles” him like an infant.)

                                 MIKE
                        Did you poop yourself again?

           Mike smells Colin’s diaper.

                                 MIKE
                        Yep... No, wait, that’s just 
                        rotting flesh. Hmm...

           Mike spins Colin around and pats him on the back, trying to 
           “burp” him. Colin stops crying.

                                 MIKE
                        Fixed him.

           Mike hands Colin to Sarah. Colin cries.
           Mike takes him back. Colin stops crying.

                                 MIKE
                             (joking)
                        I guess he just likes me more than 
                        you.

                                 SARAH
                        Wait a minute.

           Sarah takes Colin -- keeping him at arm’s length. Colin 
           starts to cry. Then she holds him near Mike’s head. Colin 
           stops crying and opens his mouth, leans in toward Mike’s 
           head.

                                 SARAH
                        Or maybe he’s just hungry.

           EXT. ASIAN MARKET - CHINATOWN - DAY

           Mike, Sarah, and Colin -- still swaddled up -- force their 
           way through the crowd. Mike and Sarah do most of the forcing.

           Mike approaches an old ASIAN WOMAN selling intestines.

                                 MIKE
                        Excuse me, where can I find brains?

                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                             (smiling and nodding)
                        Yes...

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t think she speaks English.

                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                             (thick accent)
                        What you like?

                                 MIKE
                             (to Asian woman, slowly)
                        I’m looking for --
                             (points at head)
                        Brains --
                             (pantomiming eating)
                        To eat...

                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                        Ah, yes...
                             (points)
                        All the way in back. Any kind of 
                        brain you need. They have 
                        everything. All animal brain. 

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.
           Mike and Sarah manage to get a few feet away before a YUPPIE 
           WOMAN approaches them.

                                 YUPPIE WOMAN
                        Excuse me. Is this your son?

                                 SARAH
                             (wary)
                        Yes...

                                 YUPPIE WOMAN
                        You know you really shouldn’t wrap 
                        him so tightly. It restricts blood 
                        flow. He could have really serious 
                        circulatory problems when he gets 
                        older.

                                 MIKE
                             (faking sincerity)
                        Oh, really? That’s good to know.

           Mike starts to adjust Colin’s swaddling clothes, when --

                                 SARAH
                        DON’T TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY 
                        CHILD!

           The entire place goes quiet.

                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                             (confused)
                        No. The back! Brain and sex organ, 
                        that way, in back!

                                 MIKE
                             (sotto to Sarah)
                        Come on.

           They shame-walk toward the back of the market.

                                 ASIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
                        And rectum! Same place! Rectum, sex 
                        organ, and brain. All in back!

           ANOTHER PART OF THE MARKET - DAY

           Mike and Sarah walk.

                                 MIKE
                        What the hell was that back there?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. I guess my maternal 
                        instincts kicked in. She was 
                        questioning my parenting abilities.
                             (under her breath)
                        Bitch.
                                 MIKE
                        Well, try to keep the explosive 
                        outbursts to a minimum from now on. 
                        The less attention we attract, the 
                        better.

           They round a corner and find themselves on --

           THE BRAIN AISLE - DAY

           A row of tables with every kind of brain imaginable -- pig, 
           cow, goat, sheep, etc.

                                 SARAH
                        There’s so many choices. What kind 
                        do we get him?

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s just grab some and get out of 
                        here. I’m starting to feel 
                        nauseous.

                                 SARAH
                        What if he doesn’t like them?

                                 MIKE
                             (fed up)
                        Here.

           Mike takes Colin, and -- standing so that other shoppers 
           can’t see what he’s doing -- holds him above the pig brains.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you like pig brains? Wonderful 
                        pig brains?

           Colin does not seem the least bit interested in the pig 
           brains.

                                 MIKE
                        Huh. Guess not.

           Next, Mike holds him over the goat brains.

                                 MIKE
                        What about goat brains?
                             (off Colin’s indifference)
                        Kind of a picky eater, aren’t you?

           Mike notices a sign for “monkey brains” and heads that way.

                                 MIKE
                        What about monkey brains? They’re 
                        almost people!... Genetically 
                        speaking! You like people brains, 
                        right?!
           Mike holds Colin over the monkey brains.

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

           Mike turns to the MONKEY-BRAIN PURVEYOR.

                                 MONKEY-BRAIN PURVEYOR
                        Monkey brain. Three dollar.

                                 MIKE
                        Wow.
                             (reaching for his wallet)
                        I’m not even going to haggle with 
                        you.

           INT. MIKE’S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Sarah tries to spoon-feed monkey brains to Colin. Colin turns 
           his head from side to side to avoid the spoon.

                                 SARAH
                        Here comes the airplane! 
                        Thbhtbhthhbthbhthbhbthbtb...
                             (trying again)
                        Here comes the... coroner’s wagon! 
                        Vrooooom!
                             (then)
                        Here comes the organ-delivery 
                        helicopter! It’s brain-delivery 
                        day! Thoomp thoomp thoomp thoomp.

           Still no luck. A beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Let me try --

           Mike takes the spoon from Sarah and fake-eats the brains.

                                 MIKE
                        Mmmmmmmm!

                                 SARAH
                        See? Daddy likes it.

           Mike starts to fake-eat another spoonful, but Colin WHACKS 
           his arm -- shoving the brains into his mouth. Mike gags, then 
           swallows so he doesn’t throw up. Colin seems very pleased 
           with himself.

                                 COLIN
                        Ba-ba-ba.

                                 SARAH
                             (stern)
                        Colin! That was not funny.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                             (to Mike)
                        Are you okay?

           Mike stands --

                                 MIKE
                             (while inhaling)
                        You take over for a bit.

           Sarah scoops up some brains then glides the spoon toward 
           Colin, who turns his face away from her.

                                 SARAH
                        Why isn’t he eating? Did we wait 
                        too long to feed him? Has he lost 
                        his appetite? Is he going to be 
                        okay?

           Mike shudders away his gag reflex.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe he just knows it’s not fresh.

           Mike puts the plate of monkey brains in the microwave.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m doing it for a minute, you 
                        think that’s good?

                                 SARAH
                        We don’t want him to burn his 
                        mouth. Take it out after 30 
                        seconds. See if he’ll eat it then.
                             (to Colin)
                        Are you okay, honey? You gonna eat 
                        for Mommy?

           DING! Mike opens the microwave.

                                 SARAH
                        Wow, that actually smells pretty 
                        good.

           Mike gags -- then sets the plate in front of Colin.

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

           Colin attacks the brains. Then abruptly stops. 

                                 SARAH
                        Why did he stop?

           Mike and Sarah stare at Colin for a beat.
                                 MIKE
                        Try jiggling it, so he thinks it’s 
                        alive.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        I had a snake when I was a kid. 
                        Whenever we gave it a dead mouse, 
                        we had to jiggle it around or 
                        Bullwinkle wouldn’t eat it.

                                 SARAH
                        Brains don’t jiggle when they’re 
                        alive. They aren’t animals.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, but you get attacked by a 
                        Zombie, your heart-rate’s gonna be 
                        jacked... all this blood’s gonna be 
                        pulsating through your head... I... 
                        I bet they jiggle. Just try it.

           Sarah jiggles the brain. Colin attacks it.

                                 SARAH
                        Ah!

           Sarah jumps back. Mike stifles a laugh. As Colin continues 
           devouring the monkey brain, Sarah gives Mike a look -- 
           impressed with his fatherly instincts.

           LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mike, Sarah, and Colin watch the news. 

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        -- another protest today on Capitol 
                        Hill in response to the military 
                        barricades set up around Pittsburgh --

           The TV cuts to FOOTAGE of Zombies approaching a MILITARY 
           BARRICADE -- then fleeing as SOLDIERS open fire.

                                 MIKE
                        How come Zombies in Pittsburgh 
                        always look so... healthy?

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        The ones we have here are all 
                        falling apart and blue -- but look 
                        at those... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        They just look like normal, 
                        inarticulate, flesh-eating crazy 
                        people.

                                 SARAH
                        Huh.

           A KNOCK at the door.

           LATER

           Mike, Sarah, and Hyam watch as Esther plays with Colin.

                                 ESTHER
                        Ahhhh-booga-booga-booga.

           Colin LAUGHS.

                                 ESTHER
                        Ahhhh-booga-booga-booga.

           Colin LAUGHS.

                                 HYAM
                             (sotto to Sarah)
                        How is he not sick of that game? 
                        She’s been doing that for like 
                        forty-five minutes.

                                 ESTHER
                        Ahhhh-booga-booga-booga.

           Colin LAUGHS.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Hyam)
                        Easily amused.

                                 ESTHER
                        Ahhhh-booga-booga-booga.

           Colin LAUGHS.

                                 HYAM
                             (to Esther)
                        Come on, dear, let’s get out of 
                        these kids’ hair. We’ve got tickets 
                        to Miami Vice on Ice, remember?

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, my God! I completely forgot!

                                 MIKE
                             (re: Miami Vice)
                        You’re kidding. Did they really 
                        sink that low?!
                                 HYAM
                             (sotto to Mike and Sarah)
                        No! I just can’t get her to move 
                        her ass unless she thinks we’ve got 
                        a show to go to. She’ll forget as 
                        soon as we’re out of the door.

                                 SARAH
                             (bummed)
                        Is it that bad?

                                 HYAM
                        Depends on what it is.
                             (re: Colin)
                        She wouldn’t shut up about 
                        homeskillet there last night. 
                        Nearly talked my damn ear off.

           Sarah smiles.

                                 ESTHER
                             (from the doorway)
                        Come on! I don’t want to miss the 
                        opening number!

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - R & D FLOOR - DAY

           Mike, Amit, and Kelly work on the Prowler prototype.

                                 MIKE
                        It doesn’t make sense. Why do they 
                        want to take the prototype out into 
                        the field?

                                 KELLY
                        We’re so over-budget, this thing is 
                        never going to make it past the 
                        prototype stage. I guess they 
                        figured we might as well use the 
                        one we got.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, but why? Why not take a 
                        couple of choppers? Fly in, get the 
                        water sample, and get out.

                                 KELLY
                        All the choppers got reassigned to 
                        Pakistan.

                                 MIKE
                        All of them?! All our choppers are 
                        in Pakistan?

                                 AMIT
                        It’s a quagmire, dude.
           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Sarah dabs paint on a canvas.

           REVEAL Colin sits on the floor nearby, without makeup on. 
           Sarah is painting a portrait of him -- in his true Zombie 
           form.

           A KNOCK at the door. Sarah furrows her brow.

           She picks up her canvas and puts it in the closet. Grabs her 
           makeup kit. Starts gussying up Colin.

           Another KNOCK at the door.

                                 SARAH
                             (shouts)
                        Just a minute!

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

           Mike approaches the house, worn out from work. He opens the 
           door to find JEFFREY PETERS pointing a RIFLE in his face.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I ought to kill you right where you 
                        stand.

           Mike freaks out.

                                 MIKE
                        Uh -- I -- 

           Jeffrey lowers his gun. Throws out his arms. Smiles.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Not telling me I’m an uncle?! 
                        What’s wrong with you? C’mere, 
                        bro’!

           Jeff pulls Mike in for a hug. Mike is too scared to breathe.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sarah holds Colin. Mike drinks a glass of scotch, trying to 
           calm down. Jeffrey leans on a counter.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hey man, I really appreciate you 
                        letting me stay here. You know I 
                        can’t stand hotels.

                                 MIKE
                             (still in shock)
                        Yeah. All the semen.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Exactly! Have you seen those black 
                        light pictures?! There’s semen 
                        everywhere! Grosses me out, dude.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing in town?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Got assigned to lead a recon 
                        mission into Pittsburgh. It’s not 
                        till next Wednesday 0-asscrack-of-
                        dawn-thirty, but they wanted me out 
                        here ASAP to round up a team and 
                        what have you. You know the drill.

                                 MIKE
                        Next Wednesday, huh? Sarah, can I 
                        talk to you in the other room?

           BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sarah holds Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        You told him he could stay here?!

                                 SARAH
                        What was I supposed to do? He’s 
                        your brother!

                                 MIKE
                        So?!

                                 SARAH
                        So he put me on the spot. I got 
                        flustered. What do you want from 
                        me?

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, here’s the plan. Tomorrow, we 
                        take Colin out of the house and 
                        kill him. We tell Jeffrey he got 
                        bit by a Zombie and we had to put 
                        him out of his misery.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, we can’t do that.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 SARAH
                        My dad called. He’s already made 
                        arrangements for the bris. My whole 
                        family’s coming down from New York.
                                 MIKE
                        You’re kidding me.

           Sarah shakes her head “no.”

                                 MIKE
                             (with a sigh)
                        Okay, when is it?

                                 SARAH
                        Tuesday night.

                                 MIKE
                        And you think you can keep him 
                        looking people-y until then?

           Sarah nods.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. We’ll wait until Jeff leaves 
                        at the ass-crack of dawn on 
                        Wednesday because I really don’t 
                        want to deal with that either, but 
                        then we’re killing the Zombie baby 
                        for real. Okay?

                                 SARAH
                        Okay.
                             (then)
                        Hey, look what I did.

           Sarah opens the closet and pulls out the painting of Colin as 
           a Zombie. It’s pretty awesome, but Mike says nothing.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you think?

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, it’s great. It’s just... 
                        pretty incriminating.

                                 SARAH
                             (she knows)
                        Yeah. I’ll get it out of the house.

           EXT. DUPONT CIRCLE STREET - DAY

           Sarah walks down the street, with Colin in one arm and her 
           painting, covered by a piece of fabric, in the other. 
           Struggling with her awkward burden, she tries switching arms. 
           As she does, the wind catches the painting’s cover and whips 
           it down the street.

           She glances down at her painting, then looks at Colin. 
           Realizing the painting now serves as an advertisement of her 
           decision to flout HR 2742, she hugs it close to her chest. 
           The painting is so large, however, that this is only 
           partially effective.

           She notices some POLICE OFFICERS headed toward her. She stops 
           at a crosswalk, but the light to cross is red. As the cops 
           get closer, she turns, about to head back the way she came, 
           but sees MORE cops headed toward her from that direction.

           She looks at the crosswalk signal again. Still red. Finally, 
           she ducks into a PERFORMANCE STUDIO.

           INT. PERFORMANCE STUDIO - DAY

           Sarah realizes she has walked into a “Mommy and Me” yoga 
           class.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Hi there. Thanks for joining us. 
                             (points)
                        There’s a free mat right over here.

           Sarah sets her painting down, facing the wall, and nervously 
           walks to the mat.

                                 SARAH
                        Ah... okay.

           All the women in the class are on their backs with their 
           babies on their shins, rocking back and lifting the babies 
           toward their heads. Sarah follows suit.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Now, rock back. And breathe. 

           When Sarah does this, and Colin gets close to her head, he 
           GROWLS hungrily.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        And rock. And breathe.

           Sarah does as instructed. Colin GROWLS.

                                 SARAH
                             (quietly)
                        Shhh, honey.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        And rock. And breathe.

           Colin GROWLS again. This time more frustrated than hungry.

                                 SARAH
                             (quietly)
                        Be good for Mommy, okay? No 
                        growling.
           When Sarah’s feet touch the mat. Colin angrily lifts her a 
           few inches off the ground with his ZOMBIE STRENGTH. Sarah 
           lands back on the mat with a THUD.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Is everything okay?

                                 SARAH
                             (too quick)
                        Yeah, everything's fine!
                             (lifting Colin; quietly)
                        Calm down, baby.

           Colin GROWLS.

           When Sarah’s feet touch the mat again, Colin, more 
           frustrated, lifts her even higher off the ground. She lands 
           with a bigger THUD.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        You sure you’re all right?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. We’re just getting the hang 
                        of it.
                             (to Colin; quietly)
                        Don’t do that again, honey. We’re 
                        trying to blend in, okay?

           Colin GROWLS.

           When Sarah’s feet touch the mat this time, Colin throws all 
           his strength into lifting her -- flipping her over himself. 
           She FACE-PLANTS on the wood floor.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Oh my God! What happened?

                                 SARAH
                             (standing)
                        I just don’t think I have the 
                        balance for this.

           Sarah quickly takes Colin by the hand and pulls him with her 
           toward the door, grabbing her painting on the way out.

                                 SARAH
                             (forced smile)
                        Thanks for your time.

           The instructor and the other women watch wide-eyed as she 
           exits.

           EXT. PERFORMANCE STUDIO - DAY

           Sarah breaks her brisk stride and starts limping. She purses 
           her lips together and shakes her head at Colin -- bad boy.
           Colin smiles at her and COOS.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - R&D FLOOR - LAB - DAY

           Amit has his head inside the “wall” above one of the rear 
           wheels of the Prowler.

                                 AMIT
                        Uh, Mike, I don’t mean to question 
                        your engineering skills but the 
                        inside of this “wall” is, like, 
                        bigger than my apartment.

                                 KELLY
                        Crumple space.

           REVEAL Mike and Kelly are standing behind Amit, holding the 
           panel that will cover up all the crumple space.

                                 MIKE
                        Move, dude.

           Amit only now realizes he’s in the way and steps aside. Mike 
           and Kelly slap the panel in place, and Amit goes about 
           tightening the hex bolts that will hold it there.

           DING. Mike reaches in his pocket and pulls out his iPhone.

           CLOSE ON IPHONE: a CALENDAR ALERT reads, “Dear Future Mike, 
           Today is our and Sarah’s anniversary! Love, Doghouse Mike.”

           INT. GALLERY - DAY

           Sarah enters, with Colin in one arm and her painting in the 
           other. She sees a well-dressed woman, BETHANY, walking around 
           and looking at the installations.

           Sarah makes a beeline for the storage area in back. Bethany 
           notices her.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sarah! What do you have here?!

                                 SARAH
                        Oh... this is Colin. My husband and 
                        I are fostering him.

                                 BETHANY
                             (sincere)
                        How charitable of you.
                             (re: painting)
                        And what is this?

                                 SARAH
                        Um, it’s a work in progress. I’m 
                        not ready to show it.
                                 BETHANY
                        Oh, nonsense. Give it here.

           Bethany takes the painting from her. Sarah turns Colin toward 
           herself so Bethany cannot see his face.

                                 BETHANY
                        Sarah. This is genius! A baby 
                        Zombie!... “The destruction of 
                        innocence!” Is that what you’re 
                        calling it? It should be what 
                        you’re calling it. I love how the 
                        contrasting colors highlight the 
                        juxtaposition of mortality and 
                        youth. Was that intentional?

                                 SARAH
                             (it wasn’t)
                        Absolutely.

                                 BETHANY
                        I think I know someone who might be 
                        interested in this. Hold on.

           Bethany takes out her cell phone.

                                 BETHANY
                        He’s a politician. He’s got more 
                        money than he knows what to do 
                        with.

           INT. D.O.Z. - LOBBY / FLOWER KIOSK - NIGHT

           Mike pays for a bouquet of flowers. He turns and heads toward 
           the exit.

           Just then, Jeffrey enters.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hey bro’ --
                             (noticing the flowers)
                        Who the flowers for? You workin’ a 
                        little somethin’ on the side?

                                 MIKE
                        No, these are for Sarah. It’s our 
                        anniversary.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Oh yeah? You going out tonight? 
                        Celebrating?

                                 MIKE
                        I think we’re just going to stay 
                        in. Take it easy.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Bullshit!

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. You know -- probably too late 
                        to get a sitter...

                                 JEFFREY
                        What? Fuck that! I’ll watch your 
                        kid.

                                 MIKE
                             (tensing up)
                        That’s all right. I’m sort of 
                        looking forward to a quiet night 
                        in.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hell no. You gotta go out and get 
                        her liquored up so you can get that 
                        crazy anniversary fetish sex. You 
                        ain’t gonna get that after a “quiet 
                        night in.”

                                 MIKE
                        Jeff, really -- I don’t --

                                 JEFFREY
                             (looks at watch)
                        Shit. I’m late for the strategy 
                        session.
                             (walking away)
                        I’m watching your kid tonight, 
                        though. I won’t take no for an 
                        answer. I’ll be back in two hours.

           Jeffrey bolts toward the elevators.

                                 MIKE
                        Seriously, man --!

           But he’s gone.

                                 MIKE
                        Balls.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Loud GANGSTER RAP music plays as Mike does his best to hide a 
           bag of brains behind a bunch of cartons of orange juice in 
           the fridge.

                                 SARAH
                        You sure this is a good idea?
           Mike is satisfied with his handiwork. He turns around to see 
           Sarah facing the opposite direction, waiting for him to zip 
           up her dress. He does so.

                                 MIKE
                        No. But I think if we push back too 
                        hard, he’ll figure something’s up.
                             (then, re: Colin)
                        I gave him the biggest brain we 
                        had. With any luck, he’ll get a 
                        food coma and just sleep the whole 
                        time.

           REVEAL the gangster rap is coming from a speaker, on top of 
           which is a monkey brain on a plate. Every time the bass 
           thumps, the brain jiggles, and Colin -- in a high chair -- 
           attacks it.

                                 MIKE
                        Do we have any NyQuil?

           Mike opens a cabinet. Sees some Nyquil. Grabs it.

                                 MIKE
                        Suc-cess!

           Mike drizzles NyQuil on the monkey brain.

                                 SARAH
                        Ew. Now it looks all bloody.

                                 MIKE
                        This is your brain on... aneurysm.

           Colin attacks the brain (intermittently) with even more 
           vigor.

           Mike puts the NyQuil back in the cabinet as someone KNOCKS at 
           the door. Mike looks out the window.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit. He’s early.

                                 SARAH
                             (shouts toward the door)
                        Just a minute!

                                 MIKE
                             (to Colin)
                        Eat faster!

           Mike goes to the stereo and hits some buttons. DANCE MUSIC 
           starts to play. Colin’s brain-attacks sync up with the music  
           -- about twice as fast as before.

                                 MIKE
                        Atta boy.
                                 SARAH
                        Mike! He’s gonna get an upset 
                        stomach!

                                 MIKE
                        He’ll be fine.

           Another KNOCK at the door. Sarah gives Mike a panicked look.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t worry, he doesn’t have a key.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you lock it?

           The door OPENS O.S. and we hear FOOTSTEPS pounding up the 
           stairs.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, hold up a sec, Jeff. Sarah’s 
                        naked up here.

           The FOOTSTEPS continue up the stairs.

                                 MIKE
                        There’s no way he didn’t hear that.

                                 SARAH
                        Jeff, just wait there a minute!

           Colin polishes off the brain. Mike puts away the speaker, 
           then pantomimes zipping up Sarah’s dress as Jeff enters.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey man, you almost got a free 
                        show.

                                 JEFFREY
                        No worries. I wouldn’t have 
                        complained...
                             (smiles)
                        Now, get out of here, kids. Go have 
                        fun... I got this.

           Sarah wraps up Colin in his swaddling clothes and reluctantly 
           hands him to Jeff.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DUPONT CIRCLE - NIGHT

           Mike and Sarah have dinner at an upscale place -- delicious-
           looking food on the table, a bottle of white wine chilling in 
           a bucket, well-dressed wait staff -- the type of place that 
           makes you wish you made more money than you do.

                                 SARAH
                        God, I’m worn out. Quite the 
                        handful, that baby Zombie.
                                 MIKE
                        You can say that again.

                                 SARAH
                        To be honest, though, it’s kind of 
                        weird not having him screaming in 
                        my ear... or trying to eat it.

                                 MIKE
                             (changing the subject)
                        Uh-huh. How’s the fish?

           She wouldn’t know. She hasn’t touched it. A beat, then --

                                 SARAH
                        I think I’m gonna call.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, don’t call. Come on. This is 
                        supposed to be “us” time.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. You’re right. We shouldn’t 
                        call.

           A beat. Mike takes a bite of his meal.

                                 MIKE
                        This lobster is excellent.

           A beat.

                                 SARAH
                        I think we should call.

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, sweetie. Do we have to do 
                        this all night?

                                 SARAH
                        No! It’s just on my mind and I 
                        can’t stop thinking about it and I 
                        just need to call and make sure 
                        everything’s all right, and then 
                        I’ll drop it. Okay?

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. You’re right. We should just 
                        check in so we can forget about it 
                        and get back to dinner.

                                 SARAH
                        Right.

           Mike hands her his phone. She dials.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Dishes soak in the sink as Colin crawls around on the 
           counter, unsupervised. He knocks a toaster into the 
           dishwater, then slides in himself. He is ELECTROCUTED.

                                                                PAN TO:

           THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           A half-empty bottle of red wine and a tray of gouda cheese 
           are on the table. Jeffrey plays his Zombie-killing video 
           game, tracking down one particularly crafty Zombie.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Come on, come on -- Yeah!

           Jeffrey kills the video-game Zombie. Then, he smells 
           something. He hits “pause” and leaves the room. When he’s 
           gone, his phone lights up on the table -- “Mike calling.” 

           THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Colin sits on the counter, looking dazed. Smoke rises from 
           his body. Jeff picks him up --

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hey, little guy. How’d you get in 
                        here?

           -- then drops him. Colin lands on the floor with a THUD.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Oops. Slippery little fella.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - DUPONT CIRCLE - SAME TIME

           Sarah hangs up the phone.

                                 MIKE
                             (trying to convince himself)
                        I’m sure everything’s fine. He’s 
                        probably just got the TV cranked up 
                        or something. Jeff never answers 
                        his phone, anyway. 

                                 SARAH
                             (nods)
                        Okay. Yeah...

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Jeffrey sets Colin down on a couch. The poor, wet Zombie baby 
           shivers as he drips water onto the floor.

           Jeff unpauses the video game and SHOOTS a Zombie on the 
           screen.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Boom! UN-un-dead, biatch!

           Colin looks at Jeffrey with hatred and starts to growl 
           softly.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (to TV)
                        Oh, you coming back for more? Boom!

           BOOM! Jeffery shoots the video-game Zombie again, killing him 
           this time.

                                 COLIN
                        Grrrr!

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - DUPONT CIRCLE - SAME TIME

           Mike and Sarah are right where we left them.

                                 MIKE
                        So they’re gonna use the vehicle 
                        Amit and Kelly and I designed for 
                        that recon trip to Pittsburgh.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh yeah?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. The --
                             (affected “sexy” voice)
                        “Prowler.”

           A beat.

                                 SARAH
                        What if something happened?

                                 MIKE
                        Babe -- what do you want me to do? 
                        We’re at this nice place. It’s our 
                        anniversary. Let’s just enjoy a 
                        night to ourselves.

                                 SARAH
                        I think we should go check.
                                 MIKE
                        I haven’t even finished my 
                        lobster...

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, I really want to go home and 
                        check. Please? 

           Mike knows this is an argument he is not going to win. He 
           puts some cash on the table and grabs a lobster claw for the 
           road.

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s rock and roll.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Jeffrey is still killing video-game Zombies. Colin GROWLS 
           LOUDER.

                                 COLIN
                        GRRRR!

           Jeffrey hits “pause.”

                                 JEFFREY
                        What’s the matter with you? Huh?

           Jeff stands and walk toward Colin. As he steps in the puddle 
           of water on the floor, and Colin winds up -- preparing to 
           attack -- we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Mike and Sarah buckle up. Mike turns to the CABBIE --

                                 MIKE
                        16th and Columbia.

           The cab pulls away from the curb, and Mike sees the worry on 
           Sarah’s face. He turns back to the cabbie.

                                 MIKE
                        There’s another $50 in it for you 
                        if we get there in 10 minutes.

           The cab accelerates.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           In the dim light, we see two figures on the couch -- Colin 
           curled up on the sofa, and Jeffrey slumped next to him. 
           Light gleams off Jeffrey’s head and chest -- he’s covered in 
           something dark and wet.

           A DOOR OPENS O.S... FOOTSTEPS pound through the kitchen. 
           Then, Mike and Sarah enter. Mike FLIPS on a light, and --

           We see Jeffrey is covered in BLOOD -- and notice the little 
           bits of BRAINS oozing out of his scalp!

           ON MIKE AND SARAH: Horrified. Colin has Zombie-fied Jeff.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Mike draws his gun. Slowly approaches Jeffrey. Gets up to 
           point-blank range. All the while keeping an eye on Colin.

           Then, something CRUNCHES under Mike’s foot. Jeffrey stirs. 
           Opens his eyes.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

           Mike jumps back, startled.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re not a Zombie?

                                 JEFFREY
                        What? Fuck no! I’m Jeffrey Peters! 
                        I kill Zombies for a living!

                                 MIKE
                             (defensive)
                        Well, you’re sitting here covered 
                        in red liquid with -- what is 
                        this...
                             (touches “brains”)
                        Cheese on your head... looks like 
                        your brains spilling out...

                                 JEFFREY
                        Who would have Zombified me?! Huh?! 
                        Do you see any Zombies around here?

           Sarah glances at Colin. Catches herself. Looks away.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. What am I supposed to 
                        think?! It’s 2018. If you see 
                        someone covered in blood, with 
                        their brains oozing out, you think 
                        “Zombie.” Okay? No hard feelings.

           Mike moves his foot. Another CRUNCH. He looks down.

                                 MIKE
                        What is this, a wine bottle?
                                 JEFFREY
                        Yes! I was having some wine, okay?! 
                        You were out of beer...

                                 MIKE
                        I just bought a twelve pack...

                                 JEFFREY
                        Well, I drank it all.

           Sarah quickly grabs Colin and leaves the room. Mike just 
           stares at his brother, incredulous.

           THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sarah sleeps. Mike stands over Colin’s crib, looking down. 
           Colin sleeps soundly.

           A smile slowly appears on Mike’s face.

           Sarah rolls over.

                                 SARAH
                             (sleepy)
                        What are you doing?

                                 MIKE
                        What? Uh --
                             (fake-coughs)
                        Uh -- nothing. I was just -- uh -- 
                        I thought I heard something. I was 
                        just making sure he didn’t 
                        escape...

                                 SARAH
                        Come back to bed.

           He does. Sarah rolls back over.

           Now she is the one smiling.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - R & D FLOOR - DAY

           Mike walks through the lab, sipping a cup of coffee. As he 
           approaches his desk, he sees Sarah standing nearby, holding 
           Colin, and looking around nervously.

           Mike nearly does a spit-take. Sarah notices him.

                                 SARAH
                        Hey.

                             (forced casualness)
                        Hey... What are you doing here?
                             (hushed; serious)
                        With Colin?
           For the rest of the scene, Mike and Sarah speak in whispers.

                                 SARAH
                        I need you to take over for a 
                        while.

           Mike looks around then nods toward the exit.

                                 MIKE
                        Walk with me, talk with me.
                             (as they walk)
                        What’s going on?

                                 SARAH
                        Ron Albertson, the crazy senator 
                        from North Carolina, wants to buy 
                        that painting I did of Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        What? I thought --

                                 SARAH
                        I know. It’s a long story. But I’m 
                        supposed to meet him at his office 
                        in half an hour. Bethany set the 
                        whole thing up.

           Sarah notices Eddie approaching. She turns toward Mike so 
           Eddie can’t see Colin. Mike forces a smile and nods “hello.” 
           Once Eddie’s out of earshot --

                                 MIKE
                        You couldn’t have, like, 
                        rescheduled?!

           They arrive at the elevators. Mike presses the call button.

                                 SARAH
                        I tried! But --

           Elevator doors DING open. Sarah notices several PEOPLE are 
           already in the elevator and stops talking.

                                 MAN IN ELEVATOR
                        Going down?

           Sarah nods, and she and Mike enter --

           THE ELEVATOR - DAY

           Mike, Sarah, and the other riders stand in silence.

           FIRST FLOOR - DAY

           Everyone gets off the elevator. Mike and Sarah loiter until 
           everyone else is out of earshot, then head toward the exit.
                                 SARAH
                        I tried! But he said he wants it 
                        tonight for a party and why didn’t 
                        he just have Bethany swing by the 
                        gallery and pick it up and then 
                        they could meet me at our place and 
                        I got scared and said nevermind -- 
                             (overwhelmed)
                        And then Dad wasn’t answering his 
                        phone and you left yours in the 
                        pants you wore yesterday and then I 
                        called here but you were out to 
                        lunch already and I didn’t know 
                        what else to do.

           Mike feels bad for snapping at her. He takes Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s okay. I can probably knock off 
                        early.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah?
                             (as he nods)
                        Thank you.
                             (kisses him)
                        I’m really late. Bye.

           She hurries off. Mike trails behind her. Just before he gets 
           to the door, Roger enters, in a rush.

                                 ROGER
                        Mike! Who is this little guy?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, well, this --

                                 ROGER
                             (realizing)
                        Hey, you’re not leaving, are you? 
                        We’ve got the general briefing to 
                        this afternoon. Really need you to 
                        be there.

           Roger hurries inside. Mike purses his lips together -- 
           “fuck.”

           THE ELEVATOR - DAY

           Mike, holding Colin, nervously drums his fingers on the wall.

           The button for the “Zombie Population Control” floor is lit 
           up. It flashes off as the doors DING open. 

           “ZOMBIE POPULATION CONTROL” FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mike and Colin get off the elevator. Kelly rushes up --
                                 KELLY
                        Oh my God! Mike! What do you have 
                        here? Is he yours?

                                 MIKE
                        Well, for now. We’re fostering him, 
                        so...

           Suddenly, all of Mike’s COWORKERS -- including Eddie and Amit 
           -- surround him, cooing at Colin.

                                 COWORKERS
                        Look at him! / Awww! / A baby! / 
                        Congratulations! / Is that blood?

           Colin loves the attention. Mike is overwhelmed.

           Suddenly, Colin is gnawing on Eddie’s finger. Eddie jerks it 
           away --

                                 EDDIE
                        Ow! Jesus.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah... Don’t get too close... He’s 
                        pretty feisty.

           Kelly indicates she wants to hold Colin.

                                 KELLY
                        May I?

           Hesitantly, Mike hands him over --

                                 KELLY
                        Look at you! You’re just as cute as 
                        a button!

           Colin starts gnawing on her ear.

                                 KELLY
                        Aww, he gave me kiss...
                             (to Colin)
                        You’re so sweet.

           Kelly hands Colin back to Mike. Colin stretches toward Kelly 
           for another “kiss.” Amit LAUGHS.

                                 AMIT
                             (to Colin)
                        Can you say “mac daddy?”

                                 COLIN
                        Ba. Ba. Ba.
                                 COWORKERS
                        Aw. / He’s so cute. / Got a hell of 
                        grip, there / I want one! / etc.

           Mike actually seems a little bit proud.

           INT. SENATOR ALBERTSON’S FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           Beautiful young STAFFERS wearing way too many pastels scurry 
           around the office. Sarah enters amid the chaos, with her 
           (covered) painting. She scans the room, wondering whom she 
           should talk to, but is distracted by a MOUNTED ZOMBIE on a 
           wall not far from PROPAGANDA POSTERS reading: “The only good 
           Zombie is a dead Zombie,” “Nuke Pittsburgh!” etc.

                                 A GORGEOUS INTERN
                        Hi. Can I help you?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes. I’m hear to see --

           But before she can say his name, Senator Albertson emerges 
           from his private office, flanked by TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                        Sarah. Glad you made it. Come on 
                        back.

           After the slightest hesitation, she follows him toward his 
           office.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. D.O.Z. - WEAPONS TESTING AREA - SAME TIME

           SCIENTISTS from the R&D Department and SOLDIERS from the ZPC 
           Division stand in a room full of deadly-looking equipment.

           Roger addresses the crowd. Jeffrey stands next to him. Nearby 
           is a CAGED ZOMBIE, thrashing about in his confines.

           Mike, carrying Colin, joins Roger and Jeff.

                                 ROGER
                        In just a minute, I’m going to give 
                        the floor to Jeff, who’s leading 
                        the mission to Pittsburgh, and 
                        Mike, who helped design the vehicle 
                        they’ll be taking... But first I 
                        have to show you guys this thing 
                        Kelly rigged up.

           Roger takes Kelly’s Zombie-killing Roomba off a table, then 
           turns it on and sets in the floor. It roams around aimlessly.

           Mike REACTS.
                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Zoomba!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s it do?

           The Zoomba approaches the caged Zombie.

                                 ROGER
                        Just wait... wait...

           CRACK! The Zoomba shoots and kills the Zombie. As everyone 
           OOHs and AHHs, Colin twitches violently. Various people in 
           the crowd NOTICE.

                                 ROGER
                        As soon as we can figure out how to 
                        mass-produce these suckers, you ZPC 
                        folks just might be out of a job.

           A few scientists CHUCKLE.

                                 ROGER
                        Okay, Jeff, tell us about this 
                        recon mission.

           The Zoomba hits a wall, goes in a different direction. Mike 
           eyes it nervously.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. SENATOR ALBERTSON’S PRIVATE OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Senator Albertson enters, pulling the cover off Sarah’s 
           painting and then admiring it as he walks. Sarah and the 
           bodyguards follow.

           Sarah takes a seat in front of the senator’s desk.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                             (re: painting)
                        This is really fantastic. I mean 
                        that.

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                             (to bodyguard)
                        Close the door please.

           Sarah casts a furtive glance over her shoulder as the 
           bodyguard shuts the door -- that was weird.
                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                             (to Sarah)
                        I know this probably an annoying 
                        question, but, if you don’t mind me 
                        asking: What was your inspiration?

           The senator leans the painting against a wall and sits at his 
           desk.

                                 SARAH
                             (rehearsed)
                        Well... I wanted to comment on 
                        society’s fixation on Zombies. And 
                        how this fixation turns us into 
                        these selfish, brutal, obsessive 
                        creatures who --

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                             (suddenly bored)
                        Right. The virus makes Zombies out 
                        of us all.

                                 SARAH
                        Exactly. Except instead of thinking 
                        “Brains” we think “Zombies.” We’re 
                        becoming --

                           SARAH
                                                    SENATOR ALBERTSON
                 (with conviction)
                                                (flat)
           What we fear most.
                                              What we fear most.

           Sarah is starting to get really uncomfortable.

           The senator turns back to the painting. Frowns. Then smiles 
           and looks up to the bodyguards.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                        Boys, is it just me, or does 
                        something smell like bullshit?

           The guards laugh -- almost as hard as Senator Albertson 
           himself.

           Sarah’s face goes WHITE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. D.O.Z. - WEAPONS TESTING AREA - SAME TIME

           Mike struggles to keep an eye on the Zoomba without being 
           conspicuous.
                                 JEFFREY
                             (stepping forward)
                        There’s been a lot of speculation 
                        that the reason Pittsburgh went 
                        completely Zombie is that the virus 
                        made its way into the water supply. 
                        But, of course, the only way to 
                        test this theory is to actually go 
                        in there and get a sample. And I’m 
                        gonna be assembling an elite 
                        fighting force to do just that.

           The Zoomba bounces off a different wall.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I haven’t made the final decision 
                        about the team members for this 
                        mission, so if you’ve got the itch 
                        to kill some Zombies --

                                 SOLDIERS
                        Yeah! / Fuck yeah! / Hoo-rah!

           Mike shifts Colin from one arm to the other.

                                 JEFFREY
                        -- I know I do -- speak to me this 
                        afternoon, and I’ll see if I can 
                        make it happen.

           The Zoomba hits a corner, heads back the way it came -- Mike 
           doesn’t notice, but it’s headed straight for him and Colin!

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. SENATOR ALBERTSON’S PRIVATE OFFICE - SAME TIME

           The senator leans forward and looks Sarah in the eye.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                        Mrs. Peters, when I campaigned for 
                        this office, I made a promise to my 
                        constituents that I would do 
                        everything in my power free this 
                        great nation of the Zombie menace. 
                        And, to me, that doesn’t just mean 
                        introducing legislation or getting 
                        all riled up on TV to rally 
                        support. It means following up on 
                        every lead, no matter how small. 

           Worried where this is going, Sarah glances toward the door. 
           There’s no way she’s getting past the guards.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                        Because one Zombie is liable to 
                        become two Zombies. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON (CONT'D)
                        And two Zombies are liable to 
                        become four Zombies. And, frankly, 
                        I don’t like how they do that. It 
                        keeps me up at night. I just want 
                        them dead. I want them all dead.

           Sarah is terrified.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. D.O.Z. - WEAPONS TESTING AREA - SAME TIME

           Mike still doesn’t notice the Zoomba heading toward them --

                                 ROGER
                        Mike, tell us about the Prowler.

           -- but now he does. He REACTS.

                                 MIKE
                             (rapid-fire)
                        Well, it drives like a truck and 
                        goes through a shit-load of 
                        gasoline. That’s about all you need 
                        to know.

                                 ROGER
                        Really? That’s it? How many men can 
                        it carry?

           Mike takes a couple of steps to the right to get out of the 
           pathway of the Zoomba -- pretending to be pacing as he 
           thinks.

                                 MIKE
                        Two in the cab and, depending on 
                        how heavily armed they are, ten to 
                        twelve in the back.

           As the Zoomba grazes someone’s chair-leg and changes course 
           back toward Mike, we go --

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. SENATOR ALBERTSON’S PRIVATE OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Sarah is about to shit her pants.

                                 SENATOR ALBERTSON
                        I am probably the Zombie-hating-est 
                        man you’ll ever meet.
                             (changing gears)
                        But even I see more in this little 
                        Zombie baby than just a Zombie. 
                        That expression on the boy’s face -- 
                        confusion and fear and tenderness 
                        all at once.

                        It’s just so intimate and 
                        unfiltered.
                             (with a smile)
                        Do you really think I’d pay $20,000 
                        for some post-modern intellectual 
                        “statement” piece? No. Your 
                        painting is much, much more than 
                        that... You must have tapped into 
                        something deep within your soul to 
                        create it.

                                 SARAH
                             (shell shocked)
                        Thank you...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. D.O.Z. - WEAPONS TESTING AREA - SAME TIME

           Mike notices the Zoomba and “paces” back the other direction.

                                 ROGER
                        Anything else?

                                 MIKE
                        No, Roger. That’s about it.

           The Zoomba glances off the foot of someone in the first row 
           and heads straight toward Mike again. Mike “paces” back the 
           other way. People in the crowd GRUMBLE -- “what the hell is 
           he doing?”

                                 ROGER
                        Any safety concerns to be aware of?

                                 MIKE
                             (staring at the Zoomba)
                        No.

           The Zoomba hits Roger’s foot, does a 180-degree pivot. Mike 
           ducks just before the gun would have pointed at Colin.

                                 ROGER
                        Are you okay, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        What? Yeah, no.
                             (fishes coin from pocket)
                        Found a quarter.
                             (looks at it)
                        Nickel.

           People LAUGH.
                                 ROGER
                             (to crowd)
                        Okay, I guess that about wraps this 
                        up. Get back to work, folks.

           Everyone stands. Mike can’t get out of the room fast enough.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SENATE OFFICES - SAME TIME

           Sarah walks outside, still wondering exactly what just 
           happened. Slowly, she starts to smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Colin emerge into the daylight. Mike breathes a sigh 
           of relief.

           BOOM! Mike turns abruptly toward the source of the sound. A 
           BUSINESSMAN has just mortally wounded a Zombie with a PISTOL.

           BOOM. The man finishes off the Zombie a shot to the head.

                                 MIKE
                             (shouting, to businessman)
                        You good?

           The businessman, struggling to regain his composure, gives 
           Mike the thumbs up. Mike, slightly sobered, nods in 
           acknowledgement, then heads toward the street. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. SENATE OFFICES - SAME TIME

           Sarah, now absolutely beaming, hails a cab. Her phone rings. 
           She answers.

                                 SARAH (INTO PHONE)
                        Hi Dad, I just wanted to see if y--

           But he says something on the other end that makes, for the 
           second time today, all the color drain out of her face.

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike enters, carrying Colin. Sarah sits on the couch. She 
           looks very sad.

                                 MIKE
                             (concerned)
                        Hey. How’d it go?
                                 SARAH
                             (glum)
                        Really good.

                                 MIKE
                        Did you get us some money?

           Sarah nods, tearing up.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s excellent!

           Sarah WHIMPERS.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s wrong?

           Sarah looks at him. Starts to CRY.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

           A funeral. Sarah, Mike, and Hyam sit in the third row. Colin 
           is wrapped up in swaddling clothes on Sarah’s lap. Sarah 
           cries.

           A RABBI stands near the coffin. It rains.

                                 RABBI
                        Yo-shayv b’sayer el-yon, b’tzayl 
                        sha-dai yis-lonon.

           CLOSE ON COLIN: Freaking out and confused as the rain hits 
           him in the face. Even wrapped tight in his swaddling clothes, 
           he thrashes around spastically.

                                 RABBI (O.S.)
                        Omar la-donoy ach-si um’tzudosi, 
                        elohai ev-tach bo.

           ON MIKE AND SARAH: As they both notice Colin spazing out -- 
           then turn their heads slowly toward each other until they 
           catch each other’s eyes.

           Sarah, despite her tears, has to stifle a chuckle.

           INT. SARAH’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Hyam, Sarah, and Mike sit in the living room. Hyam sucks down 
           a glass of scotch.

           Mike changes Colin’s diaper.

                                 HYAM
                        Ugh -- It smells like my sister’s 
                        room at the nut house. And she used 
                        to make sculptures out of shit.

                        Not just her shit, either -- about 
                        half the patients in that place 
                        gave her their shit to use. Some of 
                        the orderlies, too.
                             (nostalgic)
                        She was an artist.

           Hyam finishes his glass, pours another.

                                 SARAH
                        Dad, maybe you shouldn’t be 
                        drinking so much. The doctor said --

                                 HYAM
                             (ignoring her)
                        I was supposed to be the first one. 
                        I should have been in the ground 
                        six years...

                                 SARAH
                        Please, Dad. Not the life 
                        expectancy thing again. It’s really 
                        depressing...

                                 HYAM
                        Sorry. Sorry. Listen, I think you 
                        two should know -- Esther was just 
                        tickled pink with your boy there. 
                        And, as far as I could tell, 
                        thinking about him made it a lot 
                        easier for her to go. He was all 
                        she talked about at the end, so --
                             (takes a sip of scotch)
                        There you are.

                                 SARAH
                        Thanks, Dad, that’s really nice to 
                        hear.

           Sarah looks at Mike -- “aren’t you glad we didn’t kill him?”

           INT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Colin’s in the tub. Mike rubs shampoo into his scalp. Colin’s 
           eyes have the look of someone either getting a really good 
           massage or on heroin. Without his make-up on, Colin looks 
           very ragged. He’s getting worse.

                                 SARAH
                        Not too hard!

                                 MIKE
                        Look at him -- he likes it.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah but he’s falling apart, 
                        remember?
           Mike takes his hands off Colin’s head. His fingers have 
           pieces of flesh stuck to them.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God!

           Colin still has the same goofy grin on his face.

                                 MIKE
                        Ewww... I think I just shampooed 
                        his brain.

           Mike dunks his hands in the bathwater, removing the sticky 
           Zombie flesh from his fingers.

                                 SARAH
                             (abruptly, to Colin)
                        Okay, rinse time!

           Sarah pours water over Colin’s head, putting her hand on his 
           forehead so as not to get water in his eyes. Colin gets water 
           in his eyes anyway.

                                 SARAH
                        Look down for me, sweetie.

           Sarah gently pushes his head to angle it toward the tub. 
           Colin does not cooperate. Sarah pushes harder. Still no luck. 
           She starts to get worried.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, give me a hand with this.

           Mike helps her. Colin’s head still doesn’t move.

                                 SARAH
                        Why isn’t he moving? Why does he 
                        still have that goofy look on his 
                        face? Did you just give him brain 
                        damage?

                                 MIKE
                        Honey I don’t think Zombies can get 
                        brain damage.

                                 SARAH
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                             (also starting to freak)
                        Doesn’t that make sense?

                                 SARAH
                        No! If the only way to kill them is 
                        to puncture their brain, then their 
                        brain is the only part of them that 
                        matters!
                                 MIKE
                        Shit, that’s a good point --

           Colin’s head flops forward. The vacant stare remains, but the 
           grin is gone.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh shit, Mike. I think he’s dead. I 
                        think we killed him.

           Sarah starts to tear up. Mike hangs his head...

           Then, all of a sudden, Colin attacks the water!

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

           Mike falls backwards.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit!

           On all fours now, Colin stares at his reflection, growls... 
           attacks!

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

                                 SARAH
                        What the hell is he doing? He’s 
                        gone crazy!

           Colin attacks the water once more. Mike laughs.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, what are you laughing at?! 
                        This isn’t funny!

                                 MIKE
                        No, it is. It’s really funny. He 
                        saw his reflection! He thinks 
                        there’s another baby in the tub 
                        with him and he wants to eat it!

                                 SARAH
                        ... really?

           Sarah leans over the tub, watches Colin stare at the water as 
           the ripples die down. When his reflection crystallizes, he 
           attacks again.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God, you’re right!

           Sarah starts to laugh. Colin attacks again, but with less 
           enthusiasm this time. Mike looks at Sarah as she wipes the 
           tears from her eyes. He holds out his arm.
                                 MIKE
                        Baby, come here --
                             (as she does)
                        It’s okay.

           She sits down next to him and leans into his shoulder. Colin 
           swats at his reflection once more, then quits growling.

                                 MIKE
                        Did you see that look on his face? 
                        I must give one hell of a brain 
                        massage.

                                 SARAH
                        You give horrible massages.

                                 MIKE
                             (”fair enough”)
                        Okay.

           Colin pokes his reflection in the face. As ripples distort 
           his image, he cocks his head to the side.

           HOLD on Colin long enough to make us wonder if he has just 
           had a developmental epiphany and now understands the concept 
           of “self.”

                                 COLIN (PRELAP)
                        WAHHHHHHHHH!

           THE BEDROOM - DAY

           Sarah bounces Colin. He looks like he’s in a lot of pain.

                                 MIKE
                        I think he’s broken.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Colin)
                        Shhhhh. Shhhhh.

                                 MIKE
                        Why is he still crying? He’s not 
                        dirty. He just ate. He can’t be 
                        tired. All he does is sleep.

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe he’s sick.

                                 COLIN
                        WAHHHHHHHHH!

                                 MIKE
                        Whoa. Was that a tooth? I think I 
                        just saw a tooth poking out there.
           Mike grabs Colin’s head with one hand and his jaw with the 
           other and pries his mouth open.

                                 SARAH
                        Geez, Mike. Don’t be so rough with 
                        him.

           Mike gives her a look -- “Still. A fucking. Zombie.”

           But, yes, there is some kind of white thing sticking out of 
           Colin’s gums.

                                 MIKE
                        Holy shit, he is teething.

                                 SARAH
                        Can Zombies age?

                                 MIKE
                        Well, I guess technically his gum 
                        flesh is just rotting away and 
                        exposing his teeth. I was just 
                        simplifying.

                                 SARAH
                             (freaking)
                        Shit shit shit shit he’s right next 
                        to my head what if he gets hungry 
                        all of a sudden?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Give me him.

           Mike takes Colin from Sarah, keeping him at arm’s length. Re-
           ties him to the chest of drawers with electrical cords.

           THE KITCHEN - DAY

           Mike boils water. Sarah enters with a grocery bag, which she 
           empties onto the counter. Out comes a tube of silicon glue, 
           four heavy rubber gloves, a pack of hinge-springs, some 
           Orajel, and two football mouthguards.

           THE BEDROOM - DAY

           Sarah (wearing a pair of the gloves) is rubbing Orajel on 
           Colin’s gums with a pencil eraser. Colin’s SOBS have turned 
           to WHIMPERS.

           Mike enters (wearing the other pair of gloves), carrying the 
           pot of boiling water. He sets it on a towel near Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        Let’s do this.
           He pulls the two mouthguards (now attached at the “molars” 
           with the hinge-springs) out of the boiling water with a 
           spoon.

                                 MIKE
                        Scootch.

           Sarah moves out of the way. Mike slowly puts the spring-
           loaded mouthguard contraption near Colin’s mouth -- which is 
           now inconveniently closed. Mike makes the “baby face” -- 
           raised eyebrows, open mouth, etc. -- you know the one.

                                 MIKE
                        Ba-Ba-Ba.

           Colin opens his mouth, mimicing Mike -- and Mike pops the 
           mouthguard contraption in it.

           Colin’s mouth flies open -- and stays that way for a beat -- 
           but then he slowly figures out he can close it if he tries 
           really hard. He doesn’t seem too bothered by this new 
           situation.

                                 MIKE
                             (proud of himself)
                        There.

           Sarah looks at Mike with admiration, nods her approval. They 
           hold each other’s gaze until Sarah breaks it with:

                                 SARAH
                             (excited)
                        So can we untie him now?!

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

                                 SARAH
                        Yay!

           She hurries to Colin.

           LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sarah, holding Colin, and the rabbi from the funeral stand at 
           the front of the room. The rabbi prepares for the ceremony. 
           Mike, Hyam, and just about all of Sarah’s extended family sit 
           in collapsible chairs.

           Jeff arrives and sits next to Mike. They speak in whispers.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, man, you don’t have to be here 
                        on my account. I know you’ve got to 
                        get ready for the Pittsburgh thing.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Nah. It’s cool. I’ve never been to 
                        one of these things. Thought it 
                        could be interesting. If somebody’s 
                        hand slips and your kid’s pecker 
                        gets chopped off, I want to be here 
                        to see it.

                                 MIKE
                        ... Thanks?

           Jeffrey nods, focuses on the rabbi.

           ON RABBI: Laying out instruments.

           CLOSE ON JEFFREY: As he looks at the rabbi. Squints.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jeff leans over to Mike.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I think I know this guy from 
                        somewhere... Who is he?

                                 MIKE
                        Sarah’s dad’s rabbi.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What’s his name?

                                 MIKE
                        Finklestein?

           Jeff sits up straight, realizing something -- then leans 
           toward Mike again.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You know what, I am gonna take off.

           Jeff pats Mike on the shoulder, then, to Mike’s relief, 
           leaves.

           LATER

           Mike is now up front with Sarah, Colin, and the rabbi. The 
           ceremony is underway. Mike looks out the window. Sees Jeff 
           walking around the back yard, talking into a WALKIE. Mike 
           turns his attention back to the ceremony.

           The rabbi holds Colin’s foreskin with one hand (O.S.), and a 
           knife with the other. He moves the knife toward Colin’s wang, 
           but before it gets completely there, we hear --

           RRRIIIIPPP.

           ON MIKE AND SARAH: Jaws drop. Eyes bug out.
           Mike leans to Sarah. Whispers --

                                 MIKE
                        Did what I think just happened 
                        really just happen?

                                 SARAH
                             (quietly)
                        Oh God I hope not.

                                 MIKE
                             (still sotto)
                        Did Colin’s foreskin just rip off 
                        in that guy’s hand?!

           BACK TO SCENE

           At first, the rabbi looks just as shocked as Mike and Sarah -- 
           but soon his shock fades into a smirk.

           Mike and Sarah share a look -- oh shit. He knows.

           They start looking around the room -- does anyone else?

           But the rabbi plays it off. He continues to pantomime cutting 
           off the foreskin that is now already completely detached from 
           Colin’s fandangler.

           Mike notices Sarah staring at him -- “now is the time when 
           you are supposed to say something.”

                                 MIKE
                             (clears his throat)
                        Blessed are You, Adonai our God, 
                        King of the Universe, who has 
                        sanctified --

           LATER

           Everyone besides Mike, Sarah, Colin, and the rabbi has left.

           Mike wraps Colin in a blanket.

                                 MIKE
                             (super-friendly)
                        I just wanted to say thanks again. 
                        It looks like you did a bang-up job 
                        down there.

                                 RABBI
                        He was very cooperative. No 
                        bleeding whatsoever.

                                 MIKE
                        My hat goes off to you, sir.
                                 RABBI
                        I’ve been doing this 30 years and 
                        I’ve never seen that before.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh... Well, there’s a first time 
                        for everything, I supp--

                                 RABBI
                        And I’ve definitely never had 
                        shmeckle break off on its own.

                                 MIKE
                        You know... Winter... Dry skin. 
                        Eczema runs in my f--

                                 RABBI
                             (cutting him off)
                        I know your boy’s a Zombie.

           Sarah opens her mouth to speak but says nothing.

                                 RABBI
                        So... yeah...
                             (then)
                        Anyway, I’m proud of you.

                                 MIKE
                        ... Why?

                                 RABBI
                             (sincere)
                        You understand! God put them on the 
                        earth for a reason.

           Mike scratches his head.

                                 MIKE
                        He certainly works in mysterious 
                        ways...

                                 RABBI
                             (evangelistic)
                        Not this time. Think about it. The 
                        earth has reached capacity. Our 
                        lifestyle isn’t sustainable. 
                        Zombies are the solution to both 
                        those problems. On one hand, 
                        they’re controlling our 
                        exponentially increasing 
                        population, but, at the same time, 
                        they’re causing us to return to a 
                        simpler way of life... all about 
                        survival... It’s genius! They’re 
                        like a modern plague! --

           Colin begins to cry.
                                 RABBI
                        And everyone thinks we have to 
                        shoot all the Zombies in the head -- 
                        they forget the Sixth Commandment: 
                        “Thou shalt not kill.” If we don’t 
                        let the plague run its course, we 
                        won’t be cleansed of the evil...

                                 SARAH
                             (humoring him)
                        I see.

                                 RABBI
                             (re: Colin)
                        He looks a little jaundiced. What 
                        have you been feeding him? 

                                 MIKE
                        Monkey brains, mostly. Well... 
                        exclusively.

                                 RABBI
                        That’s no good. Monkey brains tear 
                        up their digestive track. I’m gonna 
                        level with you here. I’ve got a 
                        similar thing going on. My mother’s 
                        infected. I keep her chained up in 
                        my basement. Anyway, I’ve known the 
                        woman 45 years, and the only time I 
                        think I’ve ever seen her smile is 
                        after I fed her human brains. 

                                 MIKE
                        ... Like from a graveyard?

                                 RABBI
                        Yes, like from a graveyard! What, 
                        do you think I’m going to feed her 
                        live people? Please... 

                                 MIKE
                        Right. Okay. Got it.

                                 RABBI
                        Well, if there’s anything else I 
                        can do -- please, don’t hesitate to 
                        call.
                             (winks)
                        You’re soldiers of the Lord.

                                 SARAH
                        Thanks again, Rabbi Finklestein. I 
                        wish you and your mother all the 
                        best.

           The rabbi exits. Mike and Sarah watch through the window as 
           he walks out onto the stoop.
                                 SARAH
                        What a nice man.

           Mike puts his arm around her.

           Suddenly, Jeffrey pops out from behind a tree as three other 
           SOLDIERS sprint up from the other direction.

                                 JEFFREY
                        There he is! The Zombie 
                        sympathizer!

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, fuck.

                                 JEFFREY
                        FREEZE!

           The rabbi realizes what’s going on, and bolts.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Stop, or I’ll shoot!

           The rabbi keeps running. CRACK! Jeff shoots him. 

           GANGSTER RAP fades up on the soundtrack.

           The rabbi falls to the ground, and begins trying to drag 
           himself away with his arms -- ostensibly paralyzed from the 
           waist down -- leaving a trail of blood.

           Jeffry briskly walks over and, without a second thought, 
           shoots him in the head -- the “mercy kill.”

           Jeffrey -- pumped from the hunt -- notices Mike watching and 
           gets as close as he can to his second-story window.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Dude! That guy was a fucking Zombie 
                        Sympathizer, man! Can you believe 
                        it?!
                             (jumps up and down)
                        A Zombie Sympathizer in your 
                        fucking house!

           Mike shakes his head “no.”

           THE KITCHEN - DUSK

           The GANGSTER RAP continues playing.

           ON MIKE AND SARAH: sitting at the table, staring into space.

           ANOTHER ANGLE reveals: Colin, in a high chair, staring at a 
           brain on top of a vibrating speaker -- completely 
           disinterested. A piece of his ear falls off. Glumly, Mike 
           turns off the stereo.
                                 MIKE
                        Maybe he’s not hungry.

                                 SARAH
                        He has to be hungry. He hasn’t 
                        eaten in 18 hours. Babies are 
                        supposed to eat like every 25 
                        seconds.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, well, he’s made it 18 hours. 
                        I think he can make it another six 
                        before Jeffrey leaves.

                                 SARAH
                             (sarcastic)
                        That’s really thoughtful, Mike -- 
                        how would you like to be starving 
                        your last day on Earth?

                                 MIKE
                        Babe -- try not to get too 
                        attached. We know what we have to 
                        do. 

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t be so melodramatic.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not being melodramatic. I’m 
                        being practical! 

                                 SARAH
                        Well, shut up and help me figure 
                        out how to make him eat.

                                 MIKE
                             (after a beat)
                        You know, after a couple of years, 
                        Bullwinkle quit eating dead mice, 
                        no matter how much we jiggled them. 
                        We had to start feeding him alive 
                        ones.

                                 SARAH
                        A couple years? We’ve been doing 
                        this trick on Colin for five days.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe Zombies are smarter than 
                        snakes.

                                 SARAH
                        So what are we supposed to do? Feed 
                        him alive brains?
                                 MIKE
                        No. I think we just need to do a 
                        better job tricking him.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Mike, now wearing a BIKE HELMET, takes the brain off the 
           speaker and puts it on his head. Colin climbs up on the 
           table.

                                 COLIN
                        Grrrr.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh shit. It’s working.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, be careful.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll be fine.

           Colin crawls deliberately across the table, like a lion 
           stalking its prey. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, but what if he falls off the 
                        table or something?

                                 MIKE
                        Put him on the floor.

           She does.

                                 COLIN
                        Grrr!

                                 MIKE
                        Atta boy! Look! I’m wounded!

           Mike starts limping away from Colin, holding the brain in 
           place with one hand.

                                 SARAH
                        Go get him! Go get Daddy!

                                 MIKE
                        My brains are already halfway out 
                        of my head!

           Colin lunges at him.

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

           Mike dives out of the way.
                                 MIKE
                        Too slow!

           Mike laughs and runs into --

           THE LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           Colin is close behind. Though he’s a rugrat, his combination 
           crawling-walking-galloping is enhanced with Zombie-strength.

           Mike runs to the other side of the couch.

                                 MIKE
                        Look! Now I’m over here!

                                 COLIN
                        Grr!

           Colin jumps onto the couch, then lunges at Mike.

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!

           Mike ducks, and Colin face-plants on a table.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh! Gotta be faster than that, 
                        little man!

           Colin immediately gets up and lunges again. Mike is caught 
           off-guard but jumps out of the way.

                                 MIKE
                        Ah!

           Colin slams into the wall -- with his hands and feet. Sarah -- 
           now in the doorway -- GASPS.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike!

           Colin uses the wall to redirect his momentum toward Mike. He 
           connects -- knocking Mike onto a couch.

                                 MIKE
                        Ah! You got me!

           Mike smiles as Colin violently rips chucks of brain matter 
           off his bike helmet.

           He glances toward the door to the kitchen. Sarah is leaning 
           against the doorjamb, smiling.

                                 SARAH
                        I wish I had a camera.

           Mike smiles at her.
           THAT NIGHT

           “Old Yeller” is playing on the TV in the B.G.

           Mike is passed out on the couch with Colin asleep on his 
           chest. It is almost unbearably cute.

           Sarah watches from a chair as the light from the TV bounces 
           off her husband and “son.”

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 TRAVIS (ON TV) (O.S.)
                        No, Mama!

                                 MAMA (ON TV) (O.S.)
                        There’s no hope for him now. He’s 
                        sufferin’. You know we gotta do it.

                                 TRAVIS (ON TV) (O.S.)
                        I know, Mama... But he was my 
                        dog... I’ll do it.

           FADE IN:

           INT. MIKE’S ROWHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike lies awake. The clock reads “3:00.” He gets up --

           Goes to Colin’s crib, watches him sleep.

           LATER

           The clock reads “3:14.” Mike lies awake.

           An ALARM CLOCK sounds O.S.

           We hear FOOTSTEPS, then a door OPEN and SLAM. Jeffrey has 
           left the building.

           LATER

           The clock reads “3:35.” Mike still lies awake.

           He rolls over and shakes Sarah, waking her.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. Let’s get this over with 
                        before I psych myself out. I can’t 
                        sleep.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay.
           LATER

           Mike and Sarah stand over Colin’s crib as he sleeps. Mike 
           points the gun at Colin -- changes positions -- points the 
           gun at Colin again.

                                 MIKE
                        Better do it outside. Less cleanup.

           Sarah nods solemnly, then reaches into the crib.

           EXT. MIKE AND SARAH’S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

           Colin cries. Sarah, fighting tears, bounces him in her arms.

                                 SARAH
                        Hushhh... Shhhh... Everything’s 
                        going to be okay. Okay? There 
                        now...

           Colin stops crying. Sarah puts him on the ground.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Mike)
                        Okay, hurry up.

           Colin looks at Sarah as Mike takes aim.

                                 SARAH
                        I can’t watch.

           She turns around. Colin looks to Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay... Don’t worry, little man. 
                        This probably won’t hurt... At 
                        least not for very long...

           His hand starts to tremble.

                                 COLIN
                        Da-da.

                                 MIKE
                        Ah fuck. Did you hear that? He said 
                        “daddy.”

                                 SARAH
                        He’s just making baby noises. He 
                        said “duhdah.” 
                             (to Colin)
                        Right, sweetie? You don’t have any 
                        idea what’s going on, do you?

                                 COLIN
                        Ma-ma.
                                 SARAH
                             (exasperated)
                        Oh my God. Mike, I can’t take this 
                        anymore. Just do it. We don’t have 
                        a choice -- if you don’t, either 
                        he’s going to kill one of us or 
                        somebody else or we’ll get arrested 
                        for crimes against humanity! It’s 
                        not going to end well! 
                             (then, softly)
                        Please, let’s just get this over 
                        with...

           Mike steadies the gun... slowly squeezes the trigger -- the 
           hammer cocks back...

           His hand won’t stop shaking...

           Finally, he lowers the gun.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t you think we should at least 
                        give him a last meal?

                                 SARAH
                        We’re out of monkey brains.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, let’s get him something 
                        special. Human brains.

                                 SARAH
                        You want to go grave-robbing at 
                        four o’clock in the morning.

                                 MIKE
                        When else would we go grave-
                        robbing?!

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, that seems really 
                        irresponsible.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. But...
                             (indicating Colin)
                        Look at him.

           Sarah looks at Colin, smacking his lips around his mouthguard 
           contraption, looking cute.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. Fine.
           EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

           Mike and Sarah, each carrying a FLASHLIGHT, walk past 
           tombstones. Sarah shines her light on a headstone.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh! This guy died in 2015. You 
                        think he’s fresh enough?

                                 MIKE
                        No. I think we need somebody who 
                        kicked the bucket within the last 
                        year or so if he’s going to have 
                        any brains left.

           Mike shines his light on another headstone.

                                 MIKE
                        Here we go! 2018.
                             (reading)
                        Sang-Mi Cheng...
                             (to Colin)
                        You feel like Chinese?

           LATER

           Mike is waist-deep in the grave, trying to pry the lid of a 
           coffin open with a shovel. Sarah sits on the ground with 
           Colin on her lap, bouncing him on her knee to keep him happy. 

                                 SARAH
                             (to Colin)
                        Shhh. I know you’re sleepy. You’re 
                        about to have a treat.

                                 MIKE
                        Almost got it, buddy.

           The coffin lid pops open -- revealing a CORPSE.

                                 MIKE
                        Bingo!

           Just then, the corpse JOLTS UPRIGHT.

                                 ZOMBIE SANG-MI
                        RAAAWWWRRR!!!

                                 MIKE / SARAH
                        WHOA!! / Ahhh!!

           Mike BASHES Zombie Sang-Mi over the head with the shovel 
           until he collapses back into his grave.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh my God, Mike! What the hell just 
                        happened?
                                 MIKE
                             (catching his breath)
                        It’s okay. I read about that. Post-
                        mortem infection. It’s rare. Let’s 
                        go try another one.

                                 SARAH
                             (re: Sang-mi)
                        What’s wrong with him?

           Mike starts climbing out of the grave.

                                 MIKE
                             (re: Colin)
                        He’s not going to eat one of his 
                        own kind. He’s a Zombie, not a 
                        cannibal.

           ANOTHER PART OF THE GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

           Mike is waist deep in a different grave. He struggles to pry 
           open a casket.

                                 SARAH
                        Are you sure about this one?

           CLOSE ON HEADSTONE: The date of death is Dec. 28 2017.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, I said “a year or so.” Anyway, 
                        this is the best we got.

                                 SARAH
                        I know. I just don’t want him to 
                        get food poisoning.

           Mike finally gets the casket open. He doubles over, then 
           pulls his shirt over his nose and mouth.

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus, it smells like Colin down 
                        there!

                                 SARAH
                        How are you not used to it by now? 
                        Oh God --

           Sarah gags, then pulls her shirt up to her nose.

                                 SARAH
                        It just hit me.

           At the same instant, Colin catches a whiff, too. He salivates 
           and goes into a frenzy, freeing himself from Sarah, then 
           diving into the grave.
           He gnaws on the skull of the corpse, but his mouthguard 
           contraption prevents him from ripping into it.

                                 MIKE
                        Ah, shit.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sarah has Colin’s head pinned to the ground. Mike uses a 
           stick to pop the mouthguard contraption out of Colin’s mouth.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Sarah)
                        Don’t let go.

           Mike discards the stick and grabs Colin’s arms.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, let go.

           Sarah does so. Mike uses his right hand to pin both of 
           Colin’s arms behind his back -- then, with his left hand, 
           Mike picks Colin up by the “waistband” of his diaper.

                                 SARAH
                        Be careful!

           Mike takes Colin into the grave and, with the posture of 
           someone operating a weed-whacker, guides Colin’s mouth toward 
           the head of the corpse. Colin digs in.

           Sarah watches from above.

                                 SARAH
                             (to Colin)
                        How is it, sweetie?

           Mike smiles at Sarah, then focuses his attention on Colin.

                                 MIKE
                        Must have been hungry. I didn’t 
                        even have to jiggle the dude.

           On cue, Colin stops eating.

           Mike kicks the casket. The corpse rocks back and forth. The 
           brains jiggle. Colin attacks again.

           Colin quits eating. This time, little is left of the man’s 
           head -- definitely no brains.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Colin)
                        Clean plate club. Good job.

                                 SARAH
                        Do you think he got enough?
           Mike sets Colin on the “ledge” of the grave next to Sarah. 
           Colin -- eyes half-closed, looking stuffed -- belches.

                                 MIKE
                        Yep.

           Mike puts the mouthguard contraption back into Colin’s mouth. 
           Pats him on the belly.

           All of a sudden, Colin’s face is illuminated by a flashlight. 
           Mike turns toward the source of the light -- one pissed-off-
           looking RENT-A-COP.

                                 RENT-A-COP
                        All right. Nobody move.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck that!

           Mike jumps out of the grave, picks up Colin, grabs Sarah by 
           the hand, and takes off -- dragging her behind him.

                                 MIKE
                        Come on --

           The rent-a-cop gives chase.

                                 RENT-A-COP
                        Hey! Hold it right there!

           Mike looks around for an escape route -- the best bet is the 
           WOODS at the edge of the graveyard.

                                 MIKE
                        This way.

           Mike hurdles a headstone, looks back toward the rent-a-cop, 
           then hands Colin to Sarah.

                                 MIKE
                        Here. I’ve got an idea.

           Just then -- Colin BARFS BRAINS on Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                             (as they “drip” off her)
                        Ewwwww.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

                                 RENT-A-COP
                             (into walkie talkie)
                        I need backup in the George 
                        Washington Cemetery. Send all State 
                        Police in the area.
           Mike starts to slow down. So does Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Why are we slowing down?

                                 MIKE
                        No! I’m slowing down! You keep 
                        going!... Go!

           Mike pushes her forward.

           COLIN’S POV: The rent-a-cop is closing in on Mike.

                                 RENT-A-COP
                        You’re in for a world of hurt, 
                        Zombie lover.

           ON COLIN: Stricken with anxiety.

           BACK TO SCENE

           The rent-a-cop, only feet behind Mike, turns on the 
           afterburners.

           Mike makes an abrupt stop, then turns around and PUNCHES the 
           rent-a-cop in the GUT.

                                 RENT-A-COP
                        Ugh!

           The rent-a-cop DOUBLES OVER in pain as Mike takes off again.

           Mike catches up with Sarah and Colin, and the trio escapes 
           into the woods.

           INT. METRO CAR - UNDERGROUND - MOVING - PRE-DAWN

           Mike, Sarah, and Colin ride in silence. The news plays on a 
           flat-screen TV in the car.

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

           The news cuts to aerial footage of Pittsburgh. There seems to 
           be some sort of IMPROMPTU MARKET where Zombies are busy 
           trading brains and half-eaten corpses for shovels, tarp, 
           twine, and other supplies.

           The news cuts to footage of a Zombie man FISHING. Then to a 
           Zombie woman in front of a bunch of Zombie children -- a

                        that we, as a society --

           Mike sits up straight.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait a minute. I just figured out 
                        the universe.

                                 SARAH
                             (deadpan)
                        Really.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Okay. If you take a tiger 
                        away from other tigers and put him 
                        in a zoo, he gets depressed. And if 
                        you take a person away from his 
                        community and put him in solitary 
                        confinement, he goes crazy. Right?

                                 SARAH
                        Right.

                                 MIKE
                        So, what if the only reason Zombies 
                        fall apart is that they don’t get 
                        to hang out with other Zombies 
                        enough? I mean --
                             (re: TV)
                        Look how put-together those Zombies 
                        are. They have their own ecosystem!

           Sarah looks at the TV. More aerial footage of Pittsburgh. The 
           Zombies look very healthy. A beat.

                                 SARAH
                        So you think if we can get Colin to 
                        Pittsburgh, he’ll be happy and quit 
                        falling apart and we don’t have to 
                        kill him.

           Mike nods.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike, they shoot people for trying 
                        to go to Pittsburgh.

                                 MIKE
                             (after a beat)
                        I’ve got a plan.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF ZOMBIE - BRIEFING ROOM - DAWN

           Jeffrey addresses his TEAM.
                                 JEFFREY
                        We’ll take the Prowler as deep into 
                        the city as possible, but satellite 
                        images confirm the concentration of 
                        abandoned civilian vehicles will, 
                        at some point, make foot travel a 
                        necessity. Don’t forget to stay 
                        hydrated.

           DEPLOYMENT AREA - DAWN

           Mike, Sarah, and Colin stand by the Prowler in an otherwise 
           barren room. Mike is unscrewing the last of the hex bolts (on 
           the side panel) with the pliers on his Leatherman tool. The 
           bolt comes out. Mike pops off the panel.

           Sarah and Colin get in. It’s already a tight squeeze.

           Mike gets in, holding the side panel by the edges. He tries 
           to pop it into place, but his fingers are in the way.

           SNAP. One side pops in. At this point, all we can see are 
           Mike’s fingertips, pinched between the pieces of metal, 
           turning white. He GRUNTS.

           SNAP. The other side pops into place.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Mmmm!

           INT. PROWLER WALL - CONTINUOUS

           Almost pitch black. Just a little light seeping in through 
           the seam shows us the contorted position Mike and Sarah are 
           in. Mike cannot see his own hand.

                                 MIKE
                        Do I still have all my fingers?

                                 SARAH
                             (checking)
                        Uhh -- yes.

                                 MIKE
                        Awesome.

           Sarah shifts her weight, trying to get semi-comfortable.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t move around too much. This 
                        sucker will pop right off.

           DEPLOYMENT AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeffrey and his team enter the room --
                                 JEFFREY
                        Head ‘em up. Move ‘em out!

           -- and get in the Prowler.

           EXT. I-376 - DAY

           The Prowler’s engine ROARS as it speeds down the Interstate. 
           Downshifts as it approaches the --

           MILITARY CHECKPOINT - MOMENTS LATER

           Several young BORDER PATROL OFFICERS loiter by their post. 
           One approaches Jeffrey, who’s driving the vehicle.

           INT. PROWLER WALL - DAY

           Mike and Sarah are even more contorted than they were when we 
           last saw them.

                                 BORDER PATROL OFFICER (O.S.)
                        You’re the recon mission from DC?

                                 JEFFREY (O.S.)
                        That’s right. Authorization number 
                        eight four six.

           We hear the GROAN of a MECHANICAL GATE opening.

                                 SARAH
                             (whispers)
                        I really have to pee.

                                 MIKE
                             (whispers)
                        Shush.

           EXT. PROWLER - DAY

           The Gate is opened. The Prowler drives through.

           INT. PROWLER WALL - DAY

           Sarah shifts her weight.

           EXT. PROWLER - DAY

           The side panel POPS OFF, CLANKING onto the asphalt. Mike and 
           Sarah are exposed, but, thankfully, they are on the opposite 
           side from the Border Patrol officers.

           The wind whips Sarah’s hair in Mike’s face. Mike puts his arm 
           over her and Colin so they don’t fall out.

           We notice Colin’s makeup has rubbed off. He looks like 100% 
           USDA Certified Grade A Zombie.
           EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - DAY

           The Prowler stops in front of a bunch of abandoned vehicles, 
           which are blocking the road. It makes a U-turn. Drives to a 
           side street -- also blocked.

                                 JEFFREY
                        All right, boys, this is about as 
                        close as we’re gonna get in this 
                        thing.

           The front doors open. A soldier walks RIGHT PAST Mike and 
           Sarah. He doesn’t notice them.

           The rear hatch OPENS. Soldiers pour out.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Let’s go! Move! Move! Move!

           Slowly, the sounds of the soldiers fade into the distance.

                                 SARAH
                             (whispers)
                        Are they gone?

                                 MIKE
                             (whispers)
                        Hold on.

           Silence. A distant ZOMBIE ROAR.

           More silence.

                                 MIKE
                             (whispers)
                        Okay.

           They get out, walk around the vehicle.

                                 MIKE
                        We need some guns.

           INT. PROWLER - DAY

           The rear hatch is closed. WALKIE-TALKIES hang from the walls.

           Sarah watches as Mike struggles to open the lid of a storage 
           compartment. It POPS open, and Mike’s momentum causes him to 
           fall over.

                                 MIKE
                        Finally.

           He stands. Pulls a SHOTGUN from the compartment.

                                 MIKE
                        Damn. Thought there would be more.
           Then a walkie-talkie goes “CHH.”

                                 VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
                        B-team -- Was that one of y’all 
                        running back to the Prowler?

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
                        Affirmative. Smith’s weapon locked 
                        up. He went to swap it out.

           Mike approaches the rear hatch, opens it -- only to see --

           One of the soldiers (SMITH) -- vacant eyes, drooling blood -- 
           a Zombie.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh shit!

                                 SMITH
                        RAAWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!!

           Sarah SCREAMS as Mike SHOOTS Smith in the head with the 
           shotgun. Smith’s head EXPLODES.

           Colin freaks out. Sarah comforts him.

                                 VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
                        What was that?

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

           Jeffrey, wearing a walkie headset and holding a RIFLE, 
           watches two teams of soldiers making their way deeper into 
           Pittsburgh.

                                 JEFFREY (INTO WALKIE)
                        Gunfire. I’ll loop back and check 
                        it out. You guys keep moving...

           He turns toward the fire escape.

           EXT. PROWLER - DAY

           Mike, Sarah, and Colin have just gotten out of the Prowler.

                                 JEFFREY’S VOICE (OVER WALKIE)
                        Maintain radio communication.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit shit shit shit.

                                 SARAH
                        What do we do?

           Mike looks around.
                                 MIKE
                        Come on.

           Mike pulls Sarah and Colin toward a MERCEDES E550, next to 
           which is a well-dressed, recently killed ZOMBIE -- a SERVICE 
           KNIFE in its head. Blood pools on the street.

           Mike notices the keys are in the ignition before he notices 
           the ZOMBIE WOMAN in the passenger seat.

                                 ZOMBIE WOMAN
                        CHHHHHHH!

           Mike points the gun at her. Sarah covers Colin’s eyes.

           The woman lunges out of the car at Mike and --

           BOOM! Dead Zombie Woman.

                                 MIKE
                        Get in! We have to get out of here! 

           Mike notices Jeffrey sprinting toward them from the distance, 
           yelling something into his radio.

                                 MIKE
                        Like now.

           They jump in. Mike floors it.

           ON JEFFREY: As he slows to a jog, perplexed.

           INT. / EXT. MERCEDES - MOVING - DAY

                                 SARAH
                        Now what?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. That wasn’t supposed 
                        to happen.

                                 SARAH
                        Was that your brother running 
                        toward us? Do you think he saw who 
                        we were?

                                 MIKE
                             (yes, he does)
                        Dunno...

           Colin seems to sense Mike and Sarah’s fear. He huddles as 
           close to Sarah as he can.

           LATER

           Mike and Sarah drive through a different part of downtown 
           Pittsburgh. Mike slows as they pass a ZOMBIE WOMAN.
                                 MIKE
                        What about her? She seems like 
                        she’d be a good mother.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know.

                                 MIKE
                        Baby, we don’t have time to 
                        interview prospective parents.

                                 SARAH
                        I just don’t like the idea of him 
                        growing up in a one-parent home. 

                                 MIKE
                        He’s a Zombie!! It’s not like we 
                        have to worry about him doing 
                        poorly on standardized tests!

                                 SARAH
                        Look, there isn’t time to argue 
                        about it, okay. Just keep going.

           Mike sighs. Steps on the accelerator.

           In the distance -- in front of a BLOCKADE -- are a ZOMBIE MAN 
           and a ZOMBIE WOMAN eating the brains of a CORPSE.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait a minute. What do we have 
                        here?

           Mike pulls the car closer to the Zombies.

                                 MIKE
                        A two-parent household having a 
                        family dinner. Look at that. 
                        Perfect, right?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah.
                             (perking up)
                        This looks okay!

           All of a sudden, Zombie Man PUNCHES Zombie Woman in the face -- 
           knocking her away so he can eat her share of brains.

                                 SARAH
                        Ooh. Abusive home environment. No 
                        good.

                                 MIKE
                        Roger.

           Mike turns the car around at the blockade.
           But SOMEONE is blocking the road!

           It’s Jeffrey -- breathing heavily -- and pointing his RIFLE 
           directly at Mike.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Step out of the vehicle.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit.

           Mike contemplates his options -- looks for an escape route -- 
           the Mercedes is too close to a PARKED CAR for Mike to gun it 
           and swing right -- not enough room to swing left without 
           running over Jeff --

           Before Mike can act, Jeffrey has thrown open the driver’s 
           side door -- all the while keeping the rifle in his right 
           hand trained on Mike.

           Jeffrey grabs Mike by the back of his collar and throws him 
           out of the car.

           Sarah opens her door -- hitting the parked car next to the 
           Mercedes. As she and Colin squeeze out, Colin bangs his head.

           CLOSE ON: Colin’s mouthguard-contraption as it bounces off 
           the sidewalk and into the gutter. No one notices this.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Jeffrey’s gun is still trained on Mike.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Put your hands behind your back.

           Mike does so.

                                 MIKE
                        Just hear me out. This isn’t what 
                        it looks like -- 

           Jeffrey notices Sarah and Colin creeping around the car. He 
           points the gun at them.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Did I tell you to move?!

                                 SARAH
                             (stammering)
                        You said get out of the car...

                                 JEFFREY
                             (re: Mike)
                        I was talking to him! Just --

           He gestures at the ground next to Mike.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Get over here.

           As she does, Colin GROWLS at Jeffrey -- and Jeff realizes 
           what Mike and Sarah are doing in Pittsburgh.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I knew there was something weird 
                        about that kid.
                             (into headset)
                        I’ve got a pair of traitors at 
                        gunpoint at the corner of 10th and 
                        Railroad. Send two men over.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you really going to drop a dime 
                        on us, man? We’re brothers.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Oh yeah?! Brothers? Would a 
                        “brother” take Cindy Kellerman to 
                        prom even though he knew I had a 
                        crush on her?

                                 MIKE
                        Cindy Kellerman hated you. She 
                        thought you were creepy.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Shut the fuck up!

           Sarah looks momentarily jealous.

                                 MIKE
                             (whispers to Sarah)
                        She wasn’t even cute.

                                 JEFFREY (INTO RADIO)
                        What’s your ETA?

                                 VOICE (OVER RADIO)
                        One minute.

                                 SARAH
                             (whispers to Mike)
                        Okay, what are we doing? What’s the 
                        plan?

                                 MIKE
                             (whispers back)
                        I don’t know.

           Jeffrey SMACKS Mike in the head with the butt of his rifle.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I said shut the fuck up!
           Colin freaks. Thrashes. GROWLS.

                                 SARAH
                             (quietly, to Colin)
                        Be still, honey. It’s okay --

           Jeffrey SMACKS SARAH with the gun. Colin ROARS. Mike’s eyes 
           narrow.

           Sarah’s nose is bleeding. Jeff gets in her face --

                                 JEFFREY
                        Shut. The. Fuck --

           Mike takes this opportunity to BUM RUSH Jeff. He tries to 
           wrestle the gun away from him -- but Jeff --

           PUNCHES him in the face. Then KNEES him in the gut.

           Mike falls to the ground. Jeffrey lowers the gun to Mike’s 
           head.

           Colin SCREECHES.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Well, bro, it’s been real.

           He cocks the gun.

           Colin thrashes his way out of the swaddling clothes.

                                 COLIN
                        Rawr!!!!

           Jeffrey turns as Colin LUNGES at him -- and, before Jeff can 
           react -- Colin sinks his ONE TOOTH into his neck.

           Jeffrey drops the gun. Falls onto the ground --

           Then violently CHUCKS Colin down the CROSS STREET.

           Jeffrey stands -- Zombified! He wavers from side to side 
           before getting his balance. His eyes lock on Sarah, and he 
           drops into a dead sprint toward her.

                                 JEFFREY
                        RAAAWWWWWRRRRR!!!!!

           Mike rolls over -- grabs the rifle -- and, without the time 
           to aim, takes a shot in Jeffrey’s general direction.

           BOOM! Complete whiff.

           Mike pulls the trigger again.

           CLICK.
                                 MIKE
                        Fuck.

           Mike hauls ass toward Jeffrey.

           Jeffrey grabs Sarah -- is about to take a bite of her neck, 
           when --

           CRACK! Mike whacks Jeff in the side of the head with the butt 
           of the rifle -- knocking him to the ground.

           Mike goes apeshit on Jeffrey -- bashing his face in with the 
           gun.

           When Jeffrey is clearly dead, Mike, hyperventilating, goes to 
           the Mercedes and gets out the shotgun.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike...

           BOOM! Mike shoots Jeff in the head.

           Sarah grabs Mike’s shoulder.

                                 SARAH
                        Mike... He’s dead.

           BOOM! Mike shoots the bloody pulp where Jeff’s head once was.

                                 MIKE
                             (catching his breath)
                        You can never be too sure.
                             (looks around)
                        Where’s Colin?!

           Mike and Sarah run toward the side street down which Jeff 
           hurled Colin --

           When they round the corner, they see the Zombie woman from 
           before holding Colin. She’s bouncing him the same way Sarah 
           was fond of doing to comfort him.

                                 MIKE
                        Is -- is that the same woman from 
                        before? The single mother?

                                 SARAH
                        I think so. She must have followed 
                        us.

           Zombie Mom looks at Mike and Sarah warily.

                                 MIKE
                        I think she’ll make a good mom.

           Sarah approaches Zombie Mom. Mike follows.
                                 SARAH
                        You sure?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. I grew up without a dad and I 
                        turned out all right.

           Sarah says nothing.

                                 MIKE
                        Right?

                                 SARAH
                             (smiling)
                        More or less.

           Mike and Sarah are now dangerously close to Zombie Mom. Sarah 
           bends over. Zombie Mom covers Colin protectively. 

                                 SARAH
                        Bye, sweetie. I hope you like it 
                        here. This is your, home, right?

           Mike puts his arm around Sarah.

                                 MIKE
                        He’ll be just fine.

           Sarah opens and closes her hand -- the “baby wave.” Colin 
           baby-waves back. Zombie Woman gives Sarah a dirty look.

                                 SARAH
                        Awwww. Bye-bye... Can you say bye-
                        bye?
                             (baby-talk)
                        Bye-bye...

                                 COLIN
                             (waving)
                        Bah-bah.

                                 SARAH
                             (tearful)
                        Awww.

           Sarah reaches toward Colin.

                                 ZOMBIE MOM
                        RAAAWWWWRRRR!!!!

                                 SARAH
                        Ahhhhh!

           Mike and Sarah drop into a DEAD SPRINT back the way they 
           came.
           They round the corner toward the Mercedes. Mike looks over 
           his shoulder. Zombie Mom is hauling ass after them.

                                 MIKE
                        At least she’s a protective parent!

           Mike unlocks the Mercedes with the key fob as Zombie Mom 
           rounds the corner after them.

           They jump in the car and peel away.

           INT. MERCEDES - MOVING - DAY

           Sarah wipes the tears from her eyes.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, when we get back to D.C., what 
                        do you say we get drunk and try to 
                        make some babies?

                                 SARAH
                        Really? You mean that?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah...

           Sarah lets out a small laugh, puts her hand on his leg.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. Let’s do it.

           She leans over and kisses him. Does this again. Again.

                                 MIKE
                             (smiling)
                        When we get back to D.C.

                                 SARAH
                             (fake-sigh)
                        Fiiine.
                             (then)
                        How are we going to do that again? 
                        Get back to D.C.?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m still mulling that over.

           EXT. I-376 MILITARY CHECKPOINT - DAY

           The Prowler idles.

           CLOSE ON: The wheels resting on the dirt.

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Smith and Peters ran into a couple

           PULL UP to: The empty “wall” of the Prowler. DOLLY OVER to --

                        If you see anyone, shoot first, ask 
                        questions later.

                                 BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                        You got it, boss.

           The gates open.

           The Border Patrol officer salutes. The soldier returns the 
           salute. Puts the Prowler in gear.

                                 BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                        You heard the man! Everyone at your 
                        posts! Secure the perimeter! NO ONE 
                        GETS OUT OF THIS CITY ALIVE!!

           CRANE UP TO REVEAL:

           Mike and Sarah lying prone on the roof of the vehicle.

           The CAMERA stays with them as the vehicle speeds up.

           The wind whips through Sarah’s hair. She shivers, huddles 
           closer to Mike.

           Mike unzips his jacket and puts half of it over her.

           Sarah smiles.

           We HOLD on this as the vehicle goes through third, fourth, 
           and then fifth gear. As the engine crescendos to a ROAR in 
           fifth, we --

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END.
