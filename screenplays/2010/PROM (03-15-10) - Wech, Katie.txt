           IN SOFT FOCUS:  

           The ruffle of a gown.  The petals of a corsage.  An archway 
           of colorful BALLOONS reaching overhead.

                        Prom.  It’s a magic word.  Put it in 
                        front of any other word, and it 
                        changes it. Something ordinary becomes 
                        something unforgettable.  A dress is 
                        just something you wear, but a prom 
                        dress is something you dream about.  
                        You can go on a lot of dates, but 
                        you’ll always remember your prom date.

           A mirrored disco ball spins, and we PUSH IN until it becomes 
           a blur of light and motion...

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And there are hundreds of nights in
                        high school. But there’s only one
                        prom night.

           The blur of spinning motion sharpens into a large metallic 
           drum, spitting out glossy, multicolored SHEETS.

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        One word, and everything changes. It 
                        all starts with Prom.

           INT. PRINT SHOP -- DAY

           We realize we’ve been seeing a PRINTER, and the glossy 
           sheets, POSTERS.  Heaps of them.  We glimpse details: LAKE 
           CANYON HIGH... SENIOR PROM... TICKETS ON SALE NOW.

           TILT UP from one poster to the face of NOVA PRESCOTT, 17.  
           You know Nova.  Pretty, straight A’s, friends with everybody?  
           And if you need any help, with like, ANYTHING...  

           She examines the poster carefully.  Finally: 

                                 NOVA
                        They’re perfect.

           As she ROLLS up the poster with a flourish...

           TITLE CARD: WALT DISNEY’S PROM

           EXT. LAKE CANYON HIGH SCHOOL, ESTABLISHING -- DAY

           Nova pulls into the sprawling parking lot.  KIDS loiter by 
           their cars, preparing for another day of high school. 
           As she gathers up her rolls of POSTERS, A CLUNKY OLD SEDAN 
           trundles by blasting MUSIC.  We go with it --

           INT. THE CAR YOUR MOM DROVE -- SAME TIME

           TIGHT on the faces of two SOPHOMORES.  The first is PHILIP 
           QUOVADIS, 15.  This kid just cleared the puberty hurdle like 
           15 minutes ago, but give him a year or two and he’ll be major 
           crush material.  Meanwhile -- 

           GARY, 15, Philip’s geekier cohort is SUPER PUMPED to be 
           driving right now.  He’s rocking out, YELLS over the music.  

                                 GARY
                        This is the turning point.

                                 PHILIP
                        You really think so?

                                 GARY        
                        Dude.  We can drive.  Anywhere we 
                        want!

           Suddenly the MUSIC STOPS.

                                 GARY’S MOM (O.S.)
                        As long as it’s during daylight hours 
                        and with supervision.

           Reveal GARY’S MOM, 40, hand on the dial.  Philip’s in the 
           back.  Okay, so Gary only has his permit.

                                 GARY
                           (subdued)
                        Eleven months and twenty nine days 
                        until total freedom.

           ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

           We HEAR it before we see it -- A DUCATI MONSTER SR2 pulls 
           into a NO PARKING zone.  It’s an older bike, but it’s been 
           lovingly rebuilt, and is actually pretty mean-looking.  The 
           Driver yanks off his helmet and we meet --  

           RICK LINSEY, 18.  Leather jacket, shaggy hair.  The dangerous 
           boy that good girls try (and usually fail) to ignore.

           ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

           A world weary man in a rumpled jacket and tie watches Rick 
           dismount his illegally parked bike with narrowed eyes... This 
           can only be PRINCIPAL PIPER (40s).  He may not have had a lot 
           of control of what happened when he was in high school, but 
           by God, he’s in charge NOW...
           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH -- DAY   

           Back with Nova, walking into school.  Waiting with tape 
           dispenser at the ready is BRANDON, 17 -- the guy your mom 
           wants you to marry.

                                 BRANDON
                           (re: the posters)
                        You got them!  

           He takes some posters from her, unfurls one against a wall.

                                 NOVA (V.O.)
                        At prom, every couple has a story. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Wow, these look great.

                                 NOVA
                        I know, right? 

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And though each one is different, they 
                        all start the same way.  Somebody has 
                        to ask you.  And you have to say yes.

           As they smile at each other, it’s quite clear who Nova hopes 
           will be asking her to prom...

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        After that... well, pretty much 
                        anything can happen.  

           Suddenly Nova TURNS and sees A CHUBBY, DISHEVELED GIRL 
           frowning at the poster.  A hopeless look in her eye.  Nova 
           pauses, goes over to her.  Straightens her collar, gives her 
           an encouraging, infectious smile.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna be a great night.

           The DISHEVELED GIRL smiles back, hope restored.  She looks 
           back at the PROM POSTER as we go to --

           ANOTHER HALLWAY 

           SLAP.  Nova puts this one right next to RICK’S locker.  He 
           glances up, annoyed.  Clocking this, she adds one more piece 
           of tape for good measure.  Spins on her heel. 

           A CROWD OF KIDS gathers around the poster.  Rick works his 
           combination lock, trying to ignore them.  No luck.
                                 GIRLS (VARIOUS)
                        Ohmigosh isn’t it romantic/I wonder if  
                        Steve’s gonna ask me/Saw the cutest 
                        dress the other day/etc.

           Rick GROANS.  Finally resorts to grabbing the poster and 
           MOVING it across the hall.  The crowd moves with it.

           Rick returns to his locker, relieved to be at peace.

           ANOTHER HALLWAY

           Another poster.  We meed LLOYD, 17. Lloyd is that kid you see 
           at graduation and realize you never talked to.  He regards 
           the poster with his scrawny Freshman kid sister, TESS, 14.

                                 LLOYD
                        Ugh.  Prom.   

                                 TESS
                        You know, you could go.

                                 LLOYD
                        What, and jeopardize my status as a 
                        social leper?  

                                 TESS
                        How do we have the same parents?  
                        C’mon, prom was invented for guys like 
                        you.  It’s your chance to change 
                        things.

                                 LLOYD
                        Oh, sure.  Let me just pick a 
                        cheerleader from my speed dial. 

                                 TESS
                        I have several available friends...

           Tess nods encouragingly toward a clutch of FRESHMAN GIRLS -- 
           tragically gangly and acne-afflicted.  Lloyd winces.

                                 LLOYD
                        I’m not going with a Freshman.

                                 TESS
                        Fine, then ask somebody else.  But do 
                        it soon.  And be creative.  This is 
                        your last chance, Lloyd.  

           As SOMEONE raises their PHONE and SNAPS A PICTURE of the 
           poster, we go OFF LLoyd, pondering the possibilities...
           YET ANOTHER HALLWAY 

           Slap.  Nova tacks up yet another poster right where The COOL 
           KIDS congregate:  VARSITY JACKETS and fist bumps all around 
           as we meet TOMMY BARSO, 17, the Mayor of Lake Canyon High.  

           He’s flanked by his ever-present buddies, JIMBO and MAX (17).

                                 TOMMY
                        Nova.  Posters look good.

                                 NOVA
                        Better get your tickets soon, Tommy.  
                        Even the King has to buy one.

           Nova grins as MONICA, 17, (head cheerleader and don’t-you-
           forget-it) STEAMS toward Tommy.

                                 TOMMY
                           (to Monica)
                        And there’s my queen!  

                                 MONICA
                        We need to talk.  

           MONICA YANKS him into--

           ANOTHER HALLWAY

           And holds up a PINK LIP GLOSS like a murder weapon.

                                 MONICA
                        What is this?

                                 TOMMY
                        A lip gloss?

                                 MONICA
                        Very good.  Why was it in your car?

                                 TOMMY
                        I drove half the girl’s soccer team to 
                        Papa Gino’s last week...

                                 MONICA
                        Try again.

                                 TOMMY
                        No, really.  I had six of ‘em in my 
                        back seat, it was like a clown car. 

                                 MONICA
                        Who is she?
                                 TOMMY
                        There’s no one but you, I promise.

                                 MONICA
                        I deserve better than this, Tommy.  
                        I’ve given you the best years of my 
                        life.  Prom is our moment.  My moment.  
                        I’ve earned that crown, and I plan on 
                        wearing it.  So don’t screw it up.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Babe, don’t worry.  We’re going to 
                        prom.

                                 MONICA
                        Oh, are we?  Because you haven’t 
                        asked.

                                 TOMMY
                        Wait, you just said -- I thought it 
                        was implied!

                                 MONICA
                        Nothing is implied.  You need to ask 
                        me.  And it better be good.

           She DROPS the lip gloss at his feet and walks away.

           A POSTER OUTSIDE HOMEROOM -- SAME

           Around this poster is a gaggle of wistful SOPHOMORE GIRLS.  

                                 SOPHOMORE GIRL
                        I heard last year three sophomore 
                        girls got asked by seniors.  

                                 ANOTHER SOPHOMORE GIRL
                        I’d give anything to go to prom.

                                 SOPHOMORE GIRL
                        Me too.  Wouldn’t you, Simone?
                        Simone?

           Their friend is the striking, raven-haired SIMONE PEREZ, 15.    
           She possesses a sweetness and a realness that shines through 
           as much as her natural beauty.  She’s been quiet, conflicted 
           even -- something else is going on with her...

                                 SIMONE
                        Huh?  Oh.  It... would be something. 

           WITH PHILIP and GARY 
           Approaching Simone and friends.  Philip eyes Simone longingly 
           as she regards the poster.  Then, she turns --  

                                 SIMONE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Philip.

                                 PHILIP
                           (flustered)
                        Simone!  Heylo!  Hilo! I mean... hi.

           Gary shakes his head in disgust.

                                 SIMONE
                        Thanks for your help on the gravity 
                        experiment.

                                 PHILIP
                        Oh.  You’re welcome.  

                                 SIMONE
                        I need a serious cram session for the 
                        elements test.  I don’t even know the 
                        atomic weight of carbon.

                                 GARY
                           (can’t help himself)
                        Twelve.

                                 PHILIP
                        Thanks, Gary.  

                                 GARY
                        Excluding isotopes.

                                 PHILIP
                        Thank you.

                                 SIMONE
                        See you in there.

           Simone heads into HOMEROOM, leaving Gary and Philip in front 
           of THE POSTER.  Gary’s practically JUMPING out of his skin.

                                 GARY
                        Dude.  She wants you. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Give me a break.

                                 GARY
                        I’m serious.  You’re so in.  You gotta 
                        make a move.
                                 PHILIP
                        A move?

                                 GARY
                        Now is your chance to go from the land 
                        of “Just Friends” to the next social 
                        stratosphere.  You’re golden.

                                 PHILIP
                        She doesn’t wanna go out with me, she 
                        wants -- THAT.

           He points at the POSTER. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        I have nothing to offer her.  No car, 
                        no cool parties, no prom.  What am I 
                        gonna do, invite her to join our Stick 
                        Hippo Fan club?

                                 GARY
                        She listens to Stick Hippo?!

                                 PHILIP
                        No one listens to Stick Hippo.  Except 
                        us.  That’s the point.

                        Our fansite had one hit last week.

           ANOTHER HALLWAY -- SAME 

           SLAP.  Nova puts up a poster with the help of her sassy 
           friend SAEYOUNG, 17, who sports a Michigan SWEATSHIRT.  

           Then JUSTIN, 17, walks up wearing a Michigan HAT.  

                                 JUSTIN
                        Nice sweatshirt.  You going to U of M?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Yeah.  I hear the guys there are 
                        really cute.

           Even Nova has to ROLL her eyes as they KISS hello -- a REAL 
           kiss.  Nova heads off, on her mission as Saeyoung jumps on 
           Justin’s back, piggyback style.  They’re in their own world.

                                 JUSTIN
                           (re: poster)
                        Prom.  Huh.  I gotta find somebody to 
                        ask to that...

           She swats him playfully as he SPINS her around.  Young love.
           INT. PRINCIPAL PIPER’S OFFICE, WAITING AREA -- DAY

           RICK camped out, balancing a pen on his face while RHODA 
           (40s), Piper’s career secretary, tries to ignore him.

                                 RICK
                        Hey Rhoda, I turned 18 last week.

                                 RHODA
                        Happy birthday.

                                 RICK
                        You know what that means, right?

                                 RHODA
                        They can try you as an adult.

                                 RICK
                        Rhoda, you break my heart.  It means 
                        we can finally run away together.  

           She tries really hard not to smile. 

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        We’ll get away from it all.  Piper 
                        doesn’t appreciate you like I do.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER (O.S.)
                        Linsey!  Let’s go.

           Piper ushers Rick into -- 

           INT. PRINCIPAL PIPER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Rick settles into a stance he’s clearly occupied often during 
           his high school career.  Piper holds up an ATTENDANCE RECORD.  

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        According to my records, you have cut 
                        last period every Tuesday for 4 weeks.  
                        You know what that is?

                                 RICK
                        A new record?  

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        It’s flagrant truancy.  And in the 
                        end, you’re only cheating yourself.

                                 RICK
                        You know, I had a talk with myself 
                        about that?  Turns out, I’m okay with 
                        it.
                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Do I look like I’m joking? 

                                 RICK
                        You couldn’t have been serious when 
                        you put on that tie.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        You have been nothing but trouble 
                        since you got here - disregard for 
                        rules, bad attitude, hostile to other 
                        students.

                                 RICK
                        Have you met the other students?

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Listen, you’ve got two months until 
                        you’re out of here.  Your chances for 
                        graduation are already shaky, and with 
                        no diploma, your prospects will only 
                        get dimmer.  So do us both a favor and 
                        try to control your delinquent 
                        tendencies?  

                                 RICK
                        We’re done here, right?

           Rick shoves his chair back and heads out.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        And move that junk heap out of the red 
                        zone before I have it towed.

           Rick stops.  Closes his eyes.  Probably counting to ten... 

                                 RICK
                        You know something, Piper?  That tie’s 
                        growing on me.  Really makes your eyes 
                        pop.

           INT. HALLWAY -- DAY

           Simone heads down a hallway alone... when suddenly SOMEONE 
           GRABS HER, pulls her into -- 

           INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET -- SAME TIME

           She yelps as we adjust our eyes in the dark space.

                                 SIMONE
                        What are you doing? 
                                 VOICE
                        Shhhh.

                                 SIMONE
                        We’re in big trouble.  People KNOW.

           REVEAL who she’s talking to: It’s Tommy.

                                 TOMMY
                        Don’t worry.  It’s under control.

                                 SIMONE
                        She found my lip gloss.  You call that 
                        under control?

                                 TOMMY
                        I handled it.  It’s all good now.

                                 SIMONE
                        Why didn’t you tell me about Monica?

                                 TOMMY
                        I assumed you knew.

                                 SIMONE
                        Well, I didn’t!  I never would’ve gone 
                        out with you if I knew you had a 
                        girlfriend.

                                 TOMMY
                        Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.  
                        But the truth is, it’s been over 
                        between me and Monica for a long time.

                                 SIMONE
                        So you’re not asking her to prom?

                                 TOMMY
                        I -- well, yeah I am... but what am I 
                        supposed to do?  I can’t just dump her 
                        right before prom, it would be 
                        devastating.  It would totally 
                        humiliate her.    

           He looks genuinely torn.  Simone takes him in, weighing her 
           instincts against his conflicted, pleading expression.

                                 SIMONE
                        What does this have to do with me?

                                 TOMMY
                        Everything.  It wasn’t until I met you 
                        that I realized how unhappy I was.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOMMY (CONT'D)
                        You changed my life, Simone.  This 
                        just feels so right.

                                 SIMONE
                        This feels right?  This is a closet.

                                 TOMMY
                        Please try to understand.  I want to 
                        be with you, but I’m trying to do the 
                        right thing.  

                                 SIMONE
                        So am I, Tommy. 

           She OPENS the door to the janitor closet and walks out.

           in the making, and ROLO, 17, who, yes, is eating Rolos.

                        The sustainably-grown wood we special 
                        ordered for the backdrops was 
                        Saeyoung’s idea.  And Gabby got that

                        appreciation, you each get these.  Two 
                        tickets to prom.

           She hands out the TICKETS to her committee.  They pull them 
           out of the envelopes, examine them.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)

                        committee, they’re on me.  Thanks, you 
                        guys.

           Gabby looks over at Rolo as he pockets his tickets.

                        Who’re you gonna take Rolo?  Your

           Saeyoung lights up, SNEAKS out as Nova carries on unaware...

                                 NOVA
                        Take a good look.  Because the next 
                        time you see these decorations, it’ll 
                        be the big night.  Posters are up, 
                        tickets are selling.
                           (with a triumphant sigh)
                        We’re ready.

           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, LOCKERS -- DAY

           CLOSE ON: Cut out MAGAZINE LETTERS on a locker:

                           Alice  --  I’ve Been watCHing You.  
                         Would  You Go To Prom with Me ???

           Reveal Lloyd, admiring his date-fetching artwork.  Totally 
           unaware of how creepy it looks.  He ducks around a corner as 
           the unsuspecting ALICE (16) approaches with a FRIEND.  

                                 ALICE
                           (stopping short)
                        What is that?

                                 FRIEND
                        Oh, my god...

                                 ALICE
                        Who did this?

           WITH LLOYD

           As he puffs out his chest, SWINGS around the corner with a 
           winning smile, about to reveal himself, when he sees -- 

           Alice is crying.  Her friend comforts her.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, what kind of sick twist would 
                        put creepy, serial killer letters on a 
                        person’s locker? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Oh.

           The girls TURN, traumatized and suspicious.  He rushes --

           AROUND THE CORNER

           Where Tess eagerly waits.

                                 TESS
                        How’d it go?

           He just shakes his head, POWER WALKS away.  She follows.

           INT. SCHOOL THEATER -- AFTER SCHOOL

           Justin leads Saeyoung into the dark theater.  Sits her down.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What are we doing in here?

                                 JUSTIN
                        One second... 

           He disappears from sight as we STAY on Saeyoung.  Suddenly --

           ON STAGE

           A SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating a LIFE SIZE CUT-OUT 
           PICTURE of JUSTIN, age 12.  Saeyoung shrieks from her seat.

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        When we met, I was a scrawny brace 
                        face with a paralyzing crush on a 
                        beautiful girl in my math class.  Her 
                        name was Saeyoung.

           That cut-out’s spotlight goes dark, and ANOTHER one lights up 
           nearby -- This one of him at age 14. 

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        But it wasn’t until Freshman year that 
                        I finally had the courage to ask her 
                        out.  Oh, the anxiety...

           It goes dark, and ANOTHER SPOT reveals a CUT-OUT OF BOTH OF 
           THEM, laughing together.
                                 JUSTIN  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        But it was worth it.  From that 
                        fateful first date until now, we’ve 
                        been inseparable.  And this is just 
                        the beginning...

           ANOTHER cut-out lights up.  This one of them in their “M” 
           sweatshirts.  Saeyoung laughs, delighted.

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        But I’m getting ahead of myself.  
                        Because before graduation, and college, 
                        and the rest of our lives together, 
                        there’s something I need to know.

           The STAGE falls dark.  Then:  The FINAL SPOT lights up -- .  
           The actual Justin.  Holding a single rose.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Will you go to prom with me?

           Saeyoung RUSHES up to him... and answers him with a kiss...

           EXT. STORAGE SHED -- DAY

           Nova gets ready to close up as Brandon LINGERS conspicuously 
           behind her.  She grins, knows what’s coming.

                                 BRANDON
                        Looks like it’s just us...

                                 NOVA
                        Looks like it. 

                                 BRANDON
                        Do you have a minute? I was hoping to 
                        talk to you alone.  

                                 NOVA
                        Me?  Sure.  Let me just do one quick 
                        thing.  Be right back.

           Nova ducks --

           INTO THE SHED

           Now hidden from view, she WHIPS out a lip gloss.  Applies it.  
           FLUFFS her hair.  SLAPS herself a few times.  Okay.  Ready.

           OUTSIDE THE SHED

           She reappears.  All smiles.
                                 NOVA
                        Okay.  Sorry about that.  What’d you 
                        want to talk about?

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s about Prom.  

                                 NOVA
                           (badly feigned surprise)
                        Oh?

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s right around the corner, as you 
                        know...  

           IN THE BACKGROUND

           Cheerleaders (led by MONICA) arrange themselves in a complex, 
           three-tiered formation.  A CHEER-A-MID, if you will.

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        And, we’ve been working together on 
                        the prom committee for several months.  

                                 NOVA
                        That’s true.

                                 BRANDON
                        Which has led to what I would describe 
                        as a very cooperative acquaintance.  

                                 NOVA
                           (underwhelmed)
                        Uh-huh.

           IN THE BACKGROUND

           A BOY leads an UNSUSPECTING GIRL out toward the Cheer-A-Mid.  
           She’s blindfolded, laughing, holding his hand... 

                                 BRANDON
                        And, since we’re on the committee, I 
                        think it’s a good idea for us to 
                        arrive a little early on Prom night.  
                        Make sure everything’s copacetic.

                                 NOVA
                        I suppose that makes sense.

                                 BRANDON
                        So driving-wise, we should go 
                        together.
                                 NOVA
                        You want to...

                                 BRANDON
                        Carpool.

                                 NOVA
                        Right.  

                                 BRANDON
                        People get so carried away with the 
                        Prom date thing.  I say, why not be 
                        practical about it.  You know?

                                 NOVA
                        Yeah.  Practical...

           IN THE BACKGROUND

           NOVA POV:  The Cheerleaders now hold GIANT PLACARDS with 
           LETTERS that read:   SALLY - PROM?

           The girl sees this -- SQUEALS and RUNS into the boys’s arms.  
           He spins her around, The Cheer-A-Mid waves their pom-pons.  
           It looks really fun.  Nova tunes back into Brandon...  

                                 BRANDON
                        Exactly, no drama.  An arrangement 
                        that’s 100% mutually beneficial.  So 
                        that’s a yes?

           Her face is frozen into a stunned half-smile.  She realizes 
           it’s her turn to talk, struggles to snap out of her daze...

                                 NOVA
                        Um.  Well, Brandon, I...
                           (clears her throat)
                        I’d be honored.  

                                 BRANDON
                        Great.

                                 NOVA
                           (getting on board)
                        Yeah, it is.  It’s really great.

                                 BRANDON
                        So you wanna take your car or mine?

           Off Nova, fighting like a champ to keep smiling...
           EXT. ANOTHER FIELD -- LATER

           Not the tidy, bustling school fields.  More like a place 
           you’d meet somebody for a fight.  We HEAR the MOTORCYCLE 
           engine as Rick pulls in.  ARC around to reveal:

           EXT. DAY CARE FACILITY -- SAME

           A group of SEVEN YEAR-OLDS plays baseball out front.  

                                 RICK
                        Let’s go, Pauly!

           PAULY (7) looks up from under his baseball cap.  He waves.

           EXT. RICK’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Pauly wears Rick’s motorcycle helmet, Rick walks his bike.

                                 PAULY
                        But could I be a professional baseball 
                        player AND a jet pilot?

                                 RICK
                        Sure, just not at the same time.

           They walk up the driveway to a SMALL HOUSE that could use a 
           new coat of paint and some landscaping.  Their MOM - SANDRA 
           (40s) - in a WAITRESS UNIFORM, passes them on her way out. 

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        You look tired.

                                 SANDRA
                        I am tired.  I left you guys some mac 
                        and cheese.

                                 RICK
                        You gotta get back on days, Mom.  

                                 SANDRA
                        Tips are better at night, sweetie.

           She pecks his cheek, heads to her car.  Rick watches her go.  

           INT. AUTO GARAGE -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Nova weaves her way through a noisy GARAGE.  As she passes a 
           BEETLE ON A LIFT, a MECHANIC working on it looks up --

                                 BEETLE MECHANIC
                        Hey Nova!  How’d it go with AP Chem?

                        Had a little trouble with the lab, but 
                        I aced the written.

                        Thatta girl.

           Another GUY on a crawler slides out from under a Toyota.

                                 TOTOTA MECHANIC
                        Finished with the prom decorations?

                                 NOVA
                        All done, Zeke.

           ANOTHER MECHANIC looks up from under the hood of a FORD.

                                 FORD MECHANIC
                        Now all you need is a date.

                                 NOVA
                        Got one of those too, Bob.

           A FINAL MECHANIC in a blue work shirt turns -- A kind face, 
           if a little grease-smudged.

                                 FINAL MECHANIC
                        Yeah?  Your old man gonna approve?

                        Hi, Dad. 

           We realize this is FRANK, 45, Nova’s dad.  His workspace is 
           WALLPAPERED in Nova paraphernalia -- report cards, photos, 
           faded RIBBONS that may have been there since Kindergarten.

                                 FRANK
                        So who’s the lucky guy?  It’s Brandon, 
                        right?
                           (louder, for all)
                        Brandon.  The one who applied pre-med 
                        to Princeton.

           The Mechanics all NOD, impressed.

                                 NOVA
                        Yeah, it’s Brandon, but it’s not 
                        exactly --

                                 FRANK
                        What?

           Despite her doubts about her prom date situation, Nova 
           smiles.  Doesn’t want to disappoint him.
                                 NOVA
                        Nothing.  It’s gonna be great.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s my Nova.

           Off Nova, hiding her reservations as her Dad closes up shop.

           INT. TOMMY’S ROOM -- DAY

           Still in his practice gear, Tommy sits in front of an OPEN 
           LAPTOP, lacing new strings into a lacrosse stick.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        So she caught you with a sophomore?

           ARC AROUND to reveal, on screen in an IChat window: MASON, 
           20.  Tommy’s big brother.  He wears a Syracuse Lacrosse 
           sweatshirt, and is ALSO lacing up a lacrosse stick.

                                 TOMMY
                        Sort of... not exactly.

                                 MASON
                        Have I taught you nothing?  You gotta 
                        be smart if you’re gonna play the 
                        field.  Can’t get sloppy.

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s not really like that.  This 
                        girl’s pretty special --

                                 MASON
                        Yeah, yeah yeah.  They’re all special.  
                        But you gotta make it right with 
                        Monica.  

                                 TOMMY
                        But it’s so much simpler with Simone --

                                 MASON
                        Tommy.  It’s okay to have your fun 
                        with a Sophomore, but you don’t take 
                        her to Prom.  The Barso Boys take the 
                        Prom Queen to prom.  

           OFF Tommy’s look..

           EXT. OUTSIDE PROM STORAGE SHED -- NIGHT

           Tommy stands beside Monica, who’s wrapped in a blanket.
                                 TOMMY
                        I thought about what you said.  You do 
                        deserve an awesome prom.  So why wait?

           He OPENS the doors to reveal: A PATHWAY of PILLAR CANDLES.  
           She follows them inside  -- 

           INT. CANDLELIT SHED -- NIGHT

           Still a shed crammed with Prom supplies, but with Tommy’s 
           special touches,  it’s totally enchanting, somehow.

           CANDLES illuminate every nook and cranny.  Iridescent 
           Shimmera fabrics catch the light as they drape over assorted 
           Giraffe and Zebra standees.  Glittery Palm trees sparkle from 
           the corners.  A few feathery PARROTS perch overhead.

                                 TOMMY
                        Like it?

                                 MONICA
                        Are you kidding me?

           White twinkle-lights frame a leafy ARCHWAY surrounded by 
           candles.  She spreads the blanket under the archway.

                                 TOMMY
                        And what’s Prom without a romantic 
                        dinner?

           He opens his jacket, reveals two paper-wrapped BURRITOS.  

                                 MONICA
                           (delighted)
                        You got Taco King?

                                 TOMMY
                        Vegetarian Burrito, extra guac.

                                 MONICA
                        You’re the best.  

                                 TOMMY
                        So does that mean you’ll go with me?  
                        To prom.

           She looks at her burrito, hesitates for a beat...

                                 MONICA
                        Yes.  But Tommy, I want prom night to 
                        be amazing.  No drama.  So if you’re 
                        gonna be with me, then be with me.  
                        Nobody else. 
           He looks shocked, gestures to the glowing, romantic shed.

                                 TOMMY
                        Come on.  You think I’d do this for 
                        anyone but you?

           She softens.  Looks like big brother’s advice pays off.  As 
           he LEANS in for a kiss --

           INT. NOVA’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Finally alone, from her back pack, Nova pulls out THE LAST 
           PROM POSTER.  Pins it up on her wall.  She regards it, 
           clearly wiped out from her day.

           Then, Nova’s mom, the even-tempered KITTY (40s), pops in.

                                 KITTY
                        Hey.  That looks great.

                                 NOVA
                        Thanks.

                                 KITTY
                        You’ve had quite a day. 

           Nova looks to a STACK of books and homework on her desk.

                                 NOVA
                        It’s not over yet...

                                 KITTY
                        Nova.  You did a great job.  Enjoy it 
                        for a minute, huh?

           Kitty closes the door and Nova slumps into her desk chair.  
           Her head DROPS onto the desk.  Then -- head still down, she 
           lifts her arm to her nearby ipod.   Clicks her “ROCK OUT” 
           playlist.  MUSIC as she taps her foot.  

           The MUSIC picks up, and so does Nova’s enthusiasm.  She 
           STANDS UP, SPINS, reenergized and in her own world.

           QUICK SHOTS of Nova as she JUMPS ON HER BED, sings in front 
           of her mirror, stands on her desk chair, letting loose...

           We notice one thing -- as she sings along to the music, she 
           knows almost NONE OF THE WORDS.  But it doesn’t stop her -- 
           she hums, grunts, makes up nonsense words, rocking out... 

           EXT. STORAGE SHED, SCHOOL PROPERTY -- NIGHT

           The figures of Tommy and Monica can just be seen creeping 
           away, snuggling under the blanket.  HOLD on the shed doors. 
           Then PUSH THROUGH THEM into our shed, which is now dark -- 
           except for-- could it be?  A faint FLICKERING is perceptible. 

           DOLLY through the darkness, past the standing animal figures, 
           past the sparkling palm trees...

           ... To ONE LONE CANDLE, still burning in a corner.  Just a 
           teensy bit too close to those dangling crepe streamers...

           INT. NOVA’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Nova dead asleep on her bed.  Prom poster in a place of honor 
           overhead.  Blissfully unaware...

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

           A RAGING INFERNO -- NIGHT

           The shed and its contents are mere tinder for this EPIC FIRE.  
           FLAMES lick the darkness, smoke columns overwhelm the sky.  

                                                    FLARE TO WHITE.

           FADE BACK IN ON:

           NOVA’S FACE.  Catatonic.  Stricken.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
           she’s standing among --

           EXT. THE REMAINS OF THE SHED -- DAY

           A few piles of ash still smolder as the HEAVY BOOTS of the 
           fire crew stomp by her, extinguishing the last of the fire.

           Brandon, Saeyoung, Gabby and Rolo plod toward Nova.

                                 BRANDON
                        There she is.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        She doesn’t look good.

                                 ROLO
                        Whoa.  It’s like, Apocalypse Prom.

           EXT. LAKE CANYON HIGH -- DAY

           FIRE TRUCKS and POLICE CRUISERS surround the site.  Students 
           flock to the scene, abuzz over the spectacle. 

           EXT. THE REMAINS OF THE SHED -- DAY

           We FIND TOMMY AND MONICA, who exchange a look.  She points to 
           the ruins, and then to them, like, “did we do that?”   
           PHILIP and GARY amble up.

                                 GARY
                        This debris is definitely gonna 
                        trigger my asthma.  Carcinogens...

           PRINCIPAL PIPER

           Walks around the perimeter of the burn area.  Talks with a 
           FIRE MARSHALL (50’s), who gestures and explains his findings.  
           Piper listens attentively, until he catches a glimpse of --

           RICK

           On the side of the burn area.  His enjoyment of the 
           destruction is evident on his smiling -- even laughing -- 
           expression.  Piper zeroes in on Rick...

           BACK WITH TOMMY

           Noting Piper’s narrowed eyes, his fixation on Rick.  Tommy 
           takes Monica’s hand. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Come on.  Let’s go.

           BACK WITH NOVA

           Surveying the destruction like a field general after a 
           battle.  The Prom Committee approaches her, tentative.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                           (cautiously)
                        Hey there... 

                                 BRANDON
                           (scared of answer)
                        How you... doing, Nova?

           She picks up the remains of a COLORFUL PARROT.  She tilts her 
           head, hopeful.  It disintegrates into a million ashy pieces.  

                                 NOVA
                        The eco-friendly wood.  The leopard 
                        print fabric.

                                 GABBY
                        You know, I never liked that fabric.  

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        She’s right. 

                                 GABBY
                        It was tacky.
                                 SAEYOUNG
                        We’re better off without it.

                                 GABBY
                        Way better.  Nova?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Don’t pass out, don’t pass out.  
                        Breathe...

           They brace the glazed over Nova as FIREFIGHTERS strut by.

                                 ROLO
                        So is prom like, canceled?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        We could postpone it ‘til after 
                        graduation.

                                 GABBY
                        Or just do it without decorations?  

           Nova suddenly snaps awake.

                                 NOVA
                           (sharply)
                        No.  No, and no.
                           (beat)
                        We must rebuild.

           They look like she just suggested they all fly to Mars. 

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        Guys.  We can’t let this setback ruin 
                        our Prom.  We are the Prom Committee.  
                        If we give up, if we turn back now --

                                 ROLO
                        The terrorists have won?

                                 NOVA
                           (ignores him)
                        People are counting on us.  Do you 
                        want to tell the Senior Class to 
                        return their dresses, cancel their 
                        dates, and forget the whole thing 
                        because we abandoned them when they 
                        needed us most?  We can do this.  We 
                        just need some determination and a 
                        little elbow grease.  Who’s with me?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Nova, prom’s three weeks away.
                                 NOVA
                        Then we work overtime.  Before school, 
                        after school, whatever it takes.  

                                 ROLO
                        I don’t know man.  This was already my 
                        hardest class this semester.

                                 GABBY
                        I really wanna help, Nova, but I got 
                        the lead in the Spring musical.

           Nova turns to her last hope...

                                 NOVA
                        Brandon?

                                 BRANDON
                        It’s just I’m behind in some of my AP 
                        classes, and now I’ve got all these 
                        exams to study for...

           We leave her and find PIPER surveying the scene.  He sees:

           MOTORCYCLE TRACKS running through the grass alongside the 
           burn area.  He looks again at Rick, clutching his HELMET and 
           enjoying the scene.  Piper stomps over.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        You think this is funny?  

                                 RICK
                        No. It’s tragic.  I mean, we missed a 
                        serious weenie roast opportunity.

           Piper seethes at Rick, eyes narrowed.  Then:

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        You did this.

                                 RICK
                        What?

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Where were you last night?

                                 RICK
                        At home.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Can you prove that?

                                 RICK
                        You gotta be kidding me.  
                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Can you explain these motorcycle 
                        tracks?

                                 RICK
                        I cut through here on my way home. 

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Or after fleeing the scene of the 
                        crime. 

                                 RICK
                        Oooh.  Impressive, Detective Piper.  
                        How long you been on the force?

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                           (fuming)
                        I warned you, Rick.  This time you’ve 
                        gone too far.  And you will be held 
                        accountable.

                                 RICK
                        You can’t prove anything.  

           Piper mulls this for a beat.  Maybe he can’t.  But then...

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        I don’t have to.  This is my school.  
                        And you’re under my authority.

                                 RICK
                        They’re just some dumb prom 
                        decorations.

           This brings a perverse smile to Piper’s face.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Oh yeah?  Come with me.

           Piper marches Rick over to Nova and the committee.

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER (CONT’D)
                        Nova.

                                 NOVA
                        Yes?

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                       This is the person who burned down 
                        your decorations.

                                 NOVA
                        What?
           Rick’s face is impossible to read.  

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        And this is the person who’s gonna 
                        rebuild them.

                                 RICK
                        What?

           Nova looks at Rick with complete disdain.

                                 NOVA
                        Mr. Piper, really, I have it covered--

                                 PRINCIPAL PIPER
                        Oh no.  He’s doing it.  I want him to 
                        see the impact of his very, very poor 
                        judgement.  So from now until Prom, he 
                        will spend every waking hour 
                        developing an appreciation for just 
                        how much work went into this project.  
                        Before he destroyed it, that is.

           Nova’s eyes narrow as she zeroes in on him: The Enemy. The 
           line between her and Rick is clearly drawn.  It’s on.

           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, HALLWAY -- DAY 

           Life (and class) goes on despite the fire.  A BELL RINGS and 
           SIMONE filters out into the hall to see Philip and Gary.  Who 
           happen to be wearing LACROSSE HELMETS.

           A few Seniors pass by, TAPPING on their helmets as they pass.

                                 SIMONE
                        Hi, guys.

           Gary and Philip turn in opposite directions, KNOCK helmets. 

                                 SIMONE (CONT’D)
                        What’s with the helmets?

                                 PHILIP
                        Varsity players make the JV wear them 
                        on game days.  

                                 GARY
                        It’s... humiliating.

                                 SIMONE
                        I think it’s cute.
                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah, well.  Wait ‘til lunch.  You’ll 
                        change your mind if you see us try to 
                        eat pasta with them on.

           She laughs.  Philip grins from behind his helmet.  

           DOWN THE HALL

           Tommy looks up from grab-assing with his pals to see SIMONE 
           with Philip, laughing warmly.   He watches, wheels spinning.

           BACK WITH PHILIP AND SIMONE

                                 SIMONE
                        I’ll see you later, alright?

                                 PHILIP
                        Sure.

           He backs up, trying to be cool, BANGS into his locker door --

                                 SIMONE
                        Watch out!

           -- and a huge CHEMISTRY BOOK falls out onto his head.

                                 SIMONE (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah, I’m fine.  Hey, good thing I had 
                        the helmet, huh?

           She laughs again, waves affectionately as she leaves.  This 
           exchange is NOT LOST on Tommy, still observing down the hall.

           EXT. LACROSSE FIELD -- LATER

           WHISTLES as the lacrosse players gear up for the game.

           ON THE SIDELINES

           Philip and Gary sport lacrosse pads and jerseys.  We THINK 
           they’re lifting weights - they’re grunting and struggling --

                                 GARY
                        So did you ask her out, or what?

                                 PHILIP
                        No.  It wasn’t a good time.  I’m 
                        waiting for the right moment.
           PULL BACK to reveal they’re trying to lift the GATORADE 
           container onto the bench.  It’s too heavy for them.

           Tommy JOGS over, easily lifts the Gatorade container.

                                 TOMMY
                        There you go, fellas.

                                 GARY
                           (softly)
                        We totally had that.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey, Philip.  You’re looking good out 
                        there, bro.

                                 PHILIP
                        Really?

                                 GARY
                        He is?

                                 TOMMY
                        You’ve got real varsity potential.

                                 GARY
                        He DOES?

           Philip shoots Gary a look and he scuttles away, muttering.

                                 PHILIP
                        Wow, thanks, Tommy.  I don’t know what 
                        to say.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m having a team barbecue on Friday. 
                        You should swing by.

                                 PHILIP
                        Really?

                                 TOMMY
                        Totally casual.  Bring a friend if you 
                        want.  

                                 PHILIP
                        Gary?

                                 TOMMY
                        I was thinking more like a girl, 
                        Philip.

                                 PHILIP
                        Oh. Right.
                                 TOMMY
                        You know some of those, don’t you?

           As Philip’s wheel’s spin, the COACH blows a WHISTLE, Tommy 
           heads over, offering an encouraging wink as he leaves.  

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        See you there, bro.  

           INT. HOMEROOM -- DAY

           Philip looks toward the door, eagerly awaiting Simone.

                                 GARY   
                        Tommy Barso’s barbecue.  It doesn’t 
                        get any more exclusive than that.

                                 PHILIP
                        What can I say?  I’ve got Varsity 
                        potential.

           Simone walks in with her friends.  Gary snaps to attention.

                                 GARY
                        There she is.  Your moment for glory 
                        has arrived.  Go.  Make me proud.

           Philip gets up, Gary suddenly freaks--

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Wait!  Fly check.  
                           (Philip checks his fly)
                        Pit check.  
                           (and his underarms)
                        Now, breathe on me.

                                 PHILIP
                        What?  Why?

                                 GARY
                        Breath check.  The most crucial of 
                        all.  You want to ask her out with 
                        Death Breath?  Come on, hit me.

           Reluctantly, Philip LEANS over, and EXHALES into Gary’s face.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t get anything.  Hit me again.

                                 PHILIP
                        Gary --
                                 GARY
                        I just had a cough drop, my olfactory 
                        nerves are compromised.   

           Gary leans in, inhales strenuously, as --  

                                 SIMONE (O.S.)
                        What are you guys doing?

           Gary and Philip jerk apart, embarrassed.  Okay, mortified.

                                 GARY
                        Molecular experiment!  Condensation!  
                        I gotta go...

           He scuttles away.  Philip tries to recover...

                                 PHILIP
                        I was looking for you.  

                                 SIMONE
                        You were?

                                 PHILIP
                        Well, I was about to. Before I --

                                 SIMONE
                        Started breathing in Gary’s face?

                                 PHILIP
                        There’s a lacrosse team barbecue on 
                        Friday.  I was wondering if you wanted 
                        to go with me?  I mean, unless you’re 
                        busy.  You’re probably busy...

           She thinks it over for a second, then smiles warmly.  
           Philip’s open, eager face is JUST the antidote she needs for 
           her cramped-closet conversation from earlier.

                                 SIMONE
                        That sounds like fun.

                                 PHILIP
                        Really?

                                 SIMONE
                        Sure.  I love barbecues.  

           She leaves with a smile, as Philip watches her go.

                                 PHILIP
                        She loves barbecues.   She loves 
                        barbecues!
           He yells it out in triumph.  A few students stare. 

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- AFTER SCHOOL

           Nova  -- sleeves rolled up, ponytail secure -- directs 
           DELIVERY GUYS carrying FERNS and FICUS PLANTS.

                                 NOVA

                        Excuse me, that’s for the Junglescape, 
                        it goes over here...

           Saeyoung, Gabby and Rolo open a shipment of palm fronds.

                                 GABBY
                        I’m deciding between Donny Honda and 
                        Vinny LeClair.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        You need to choose.  Soon.

                                 GABBY
                        It’s not that easy.  We’re not all the 
                        perfect couple with our lives planned 
                        out for the next ten years.

                                 NOVA
                        Um, guys?  Do you mind?  We have 
                        bigger things to worry about than our 
                        dates right now.  Like the pile of two-
                        by-fours outside -- 

           She spins around to discover -- RICK at the entrance.  He 
           carries in a HUGE LOAD of plywood, looking very manly. Nova’s 
           expression immediately darkens.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, look.  It’s Mister helpful.

                                 RICK
                        Where do you want this?

                                 NOVA
                        Right there’s fine. 

           He sets it down.  It’s hard not to notice his sizeable arm 
           muscles.  Nova, despite herself, checks him out.  Then 
           catches herself.  Saeyoung and Gabby are less principled.

                                 GABBY
                        Welcome to the jungle, Tarzan.

           Nova scowls.  Traitors.  He wipes his hair out of his eyes. 
                                 RICK
                        Now what?

           She eyes a HUGE PILE of BOXES on one side of the gym. 

                                 NOVA
                        Tell you what.  Why don’t you move all 
                        of those boxes over there, to --  
                           (re: the opposite wall)
                        There.  Think you can handle that?

           He just starts moving them, ignoring her. 

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)

                        birds of paradise display.

           Rolo looks up from examining the business end of a DRILL. 

                                 ROLO
                        I can’t.

                        I got a chat-date with my lady.  
                           (off Gabby’s SNORT)
                        Who is REAL.

           He holds up his phone as proof.  Gabby inspects it. 

           INSERT TEXT MESSAGE: Can’t wait 2 chat W U.  Xoxo - A.

                                 GABBY
                        A text.  Nice proof.  Anyone could’ve 
                        sent that. 

                                 ROLO
                        Whatever.  I’m out.  No time to build 
                        fake parrots, yo.

           He heads out.  Nova shakes her head, turns to Gabby.

                                 GABBY
                        I have to go, too.  Rehearsal.

           Nova nods, accepting her fate.  Gabby heads out, sheepish.

                        Good luck with the parrots.

                        Okay, Saeyoung.   That leaves us.

                        Actually...

           Saeyoung nods toward the DOOR of the gym, where JUSTIN’S FACE 
           has materialized.  He BLOWS her kisses, gestures “come on!”

           Saeyoung leaves.  Rick and Nova are now ALONE.  TURNING, she 
           finally clocks his BARE CHEST.  And STUMBLES into the PLANTS.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  

                                 RICK
                        Problem?

                                 NOVA
                        No.  Nothing.  I’m just... arranging 
                        this foliage.  

           She PICKS up a plant.  It’s a lot heavier than she thought.

                                 RICK
                        You want help with that?

                                 NOVA
                        From you?  No, thanks.

           As she struggles, spilling dirt...

                                 RICK
                        You sure you don’t want help?  Because 
                        this --
                           (gestures to boxes)
                        Seems kind of pointless and stupid.

                                 NOVA
                        I think pointless and stupid suits you 
                        just fine.
           Defiant, she picks the plant up again.  And immediately 
           TRIPS.  The PLANT goes flying.  She has dirt on her face.  
           She springs up, disregards his obvious enjoyment of this.

           As she lifts the plant again, he RUSHES OVER--

                                 RICK
                        Wait.  Nova, wait.  Hold on. I just 
                        want to say one thing.

           Thinking he’s going to apologize, she pauses, righteous, and 
           waits for it.  He walks up to her and stands close.  Really 
           close, looks at her intensely.  Confidingly, he whispers --

                        Lift from the legs.

                        A rude, arrogant menace with no sense 
                        of personal space.  And he was late 
                        today.

                        Mr. Piper’s forcing me.  I think he 
                        thinks it’s some kind of character 
                        building exercise or something.

                        Is there any chance he might actually 
                        help you?

           Nova and Frank look at Kitty. 

                                 FRANK
                        Kitty, he’s a punk.

                        I’m just saying, it seems like you 
                        could use the help, Nova.  Three weeks 
                        is not a lot of time.  
                                 NOVA
                        Help, sure.  But he’s a vandal, he’s -- 

                                 FRANK
                        The enemy.

                        Right!  Thank you.  

           Kitty shakes her head.  Knows better than to interfere with 
           Nova and Frank’s close bond.

           ON KITTY: The corners of her lips curl up slightly, clocking 
           the passion with which Nova discusses her new companion.

                        Not really, Justin.  I mean, they’re 
                        your friends.

                                 JUSTIN
                        They’re your friends, too.  It’ll be 
                        fun.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What, you don’t think it’ll be fun to 
                        just be with me?  You have to have 
                        your friends there?

                        Of course not... 

                                 SAEYOUNG

                        should rethink this whole thing.

                                 JUSTIN
                        I had no idea you felt this way.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Yeah.  Because you didn’t ask.

                        What is that sound?  I could swear 
                        it’s my mom nagging me, but that’s 
                        impossible since she promised to be 
                        quiet during this car ride.

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey, Tommy.  This is Simone.

                                 SIMONE
                        We’ve met.

                                 PHILIP
                        Oh, really?

                                 SIMONE
                        Doesn’t everybody know Tommy Barso?

           Awk-ward.  Tommy continues leading them into --

           EXT. TOMMY’S BACKYARD -- DUSK

           DRIFT through the casual backyard gathering.  These are 
           SENIORS -- 6 months from the freedom of college, and counting 
           the minutes.  Philip and Simone do not blend.

           A bevy of SENIOR GIRLS (who look like they’re about 28,) turn 
           at their approach.  Simone immediately locks eyes on MONICA.

           Instinctively, she backs away, as Monica sizes Philip up.

                                 SIMONE
                        Um, I’ll be right back, okay?

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey guys, this is Philip.  He’s on the 
                        team.
                                 MONICA
                        You don’t look like a senior.

                                 PHILIP
                        Neither do you.

           Miraculously, the seniors LAUGH at this, surprising no one 
           more than Philip.  What do you know -- he’s funny!

           ACROSS THE PATIO

           As Philip is absorbed into the Senior Throng, Simone finds a 
           soda and cracks it.  Tommy appears behind her.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hi.

                                 SIMONE
                        Don’t talk to me.

                                 TOMMY
                        Why not?  We’re not doing anything 
                        wrong.  
                           (off her silence)
                        Look if you’re not speaking to me then 
                        why’d you come?

                                 SIMONE
                        I had no idea this was your party.

                                 TOMMY
                        You sure about that?  You sure there 
                        wasn’t a teeny tiny part of you that 
                        wanted to see me, too?

           OVER BY THE GRILL

           Philip serves up a burger to a SENIOR GIRL.

                                 SENIOR GIRL
                        You’re the grill-master.

                                 PHILIP
                        Actually I’ve never grilled anything 
                        before.  Except maybe ants.  On the 
                        sidewalk.

           They laugh AGAIN.  It’s miraculous.  Philip is in!  Simone 
           approaches him, spinning a soccer ball.  She smiles.
           EXT. BACKYARD -- SUNSET

           Simone kicks off her shoes.  Philip dribbles a SOCCER BALL 
           toward her.  Tries to pass her -- she SNAKES it from him.  
           She laughs and dribbles away.  He SPRINTS to catch up.

                                 PHILIP
                        Whoa!  You’re a ringer.

                                 SIMONE
                        I’m Argentine.  We live for soccer.

                                 PHILIP
                        I don’t know about dating a girl who’s 
                        more athletic than I am.

           Whoops.  That just sorta slipped out.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Not that we’re dating.  You could have 
                        a boyfriend, for all I know.  Who’s 
                        gonna kill me and throw me in a pit. 

                                 SIMONE
                           (grinning)
                        I don’t have a boyfriend.  I went out 
                        with one guy this year who I liked a 
                        lot.  But that’s over.

                                 PHILIP
                        What happened?

                                 SIMONE
                        He wasn’t exactly... available.  So I 
                        broke it off.  I’m not into guys with 
                        girlfriends.  No matter how charming 
                        or cute or fun they are.

                                 PHILIP
                        Sounds like you still like him.

                                 SIMONE
                        I guess you can’t really choose who 
                        you fall for.

                                 PHILIP
                           (you said it)
                        No, I guess you can’t.

                                 SIMONE
                        It’s in the past.  Head’s up!

           She races up to him and steals the ball, taking off.
           BACK WITH MONICA

           On the patio, watching Simone very carefully...

           EXT. SAEYOUNG’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Justin rings the bell, waits anxiously.  Saeyoung answers.  

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What’re you --

           That’s when she notices

           THE DRIVEWAY

           Where a STRETCH LIMOUSINE idles in front of her house.

                                 SAEYOUNG (CONT’D)
                        What did you do?

           He simply holds out his hand, leads her into -- 

           INT. LIMO -- CONTINUOUS

           She climbs in, bewildered.  He joins her.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Okay.  Seriously.  What is this?

                                 JUSTIN
                        It’s our limo.  I thought we should 
                        test it out.  ‘Cause this is how it’s 
                        gonna be on prom night.  Just you and 
                        me.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What about Mark and Isabelle?

                                 JUSTIN
                        They’ll get their own ride.  Saeyoung, 
                        you’re my whole world.  Nobody matters 
                        to me as much as you.

           Saeyoung breaks into a huge smile  

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        You are amazing.  And this --  
                           (sinking into the cushion)
                        I could get used to.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Actually, I have to get it back in 15 
                        minutes or I lose my deposit.
           INT. GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Nova works alone.  Surrounded by an OVERWHELMING amount of 
           work to be done.   A GIANT CLOCK reads 3:15.  

           Then -- Rick saunters in.   She turns to him, displeased.

                        There was traffic.  Go with the flow a

                        I’m the only one here.  Would you 
                        rather me be here late, or not at all?

           Rick watches her go to a rickety, raw wood FRAME with HOSES 
           and PUMPS inside of it.  A few stray leaves glued to it.

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- Nova assembles an ARCHWAY with a puny little HAMMER.   She 
           keeps BENDING nails, messing up.  Rick walks over with a MUCH 
           BIGGER hammer, DRIVES a nail in with one whack.  Walks away.

           -- They each work on different parts of a BACKDROP, back to 
           back -- then TURN toward the toolbox at the same time -- BUMP 
           HEADS.  No one wants to admit it, but it’s kinda funny.   

           -- She drapes fabric, he staples leaves.  They BOTH wear 
           headphones.  He puts down the staple gun, she picks it up in 
           a fluid, intuitive motion -- an unspoken rhythm has formed 
           between them, even if they don’t realize it...

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- ANOTHER DAY

           Nova (alone) prepares to run a test on the FOUNTAIN.  She 
           fumbles with a switch.  It TURNS ON, and for a moment --

                                 RICK
                        I didn’t say that.

           EXT. LAKE CANYON PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

           Nova walks to her car, upset.  He comes out after her.

                                 RICK
                        Sorry I insulted your prom.  It’s 
                        obviously really important to you, I 
                        just don’t get it, all this for one 
                        night.

                                 NOVA
                        Yeah.  It’s just one night, just a 
                        dance. But it’s the last night.  The 
                        last dance.  And for that one night, 
                        there’s nothing behind us and nothing 
                        ahead, just all of us in this one 
                        perfect moment, forever. (Beat) And I 
                        want to be a part of that.

           She gets into her car.  Rick watches her go.

           INT. COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Gabby peers around her computer monitor toward Rolo.

                                 GABBY
                        Hey, Rolo.  Can I see her profile?

                                 ROLO
                        She doesn’t have one.

                                 GABBY
                        Come on, Rolo, you said you met 
                        online!

                                 ROLO
                        I did.  But she had to take her page 
                        down because she got grounded.

                                 GABBY
                        What for?  

                                 ROLO
                        She was out clubbing ‘til late.
           This newest fabrication DELIGHTS Gabby.

                                 GABBY
                        Clubbing.  Athena likes to get up in 
                        the club, huh?

                                 ROLO
                        Yeah.  She does. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE HOMEROOM -- DAY

           Philip and Gary at their lockers.  Gary looks rather 
           displeased as Philip blathers excitedly.

                                 PHILIP
                        She basically told me flat out that 
                        she’s available. 

                                 GARY
                        Philip.

                                 PHILIP
                        I mean, it’s just like you said, I’m 
                        golden.  Which is why I’m going to ask 
                        her to study as soon as I see her.

                                 GARY
                        Philip.  Have you forgotten what day 
                        it is?

           Philip looks confused.

                                 PHILIP
                        Wednesday?

                                 GARY
                        Wednesday.  Yes.  Which we’ve 
                        established and designated as Stick 
                        Hippo T-shirt day.  Where’s yours? 

           Reveal Gary’s SHIRT: A stick-figure drawing of a four-legged 
           animal with a round, hippopotamus head.  

                                 PHILIP
                        I... guess I forgot.

                                 GARY
                        I have an extra.  For emergencies -- 

           As Gary ducks into his locker, Philip sees...
                                 PHILIP
                        Tommy!  
                           (waving wildly)
                        Great party, bro!

           Down the hall, Tommy looks up with a nod.

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re the man, Phil!

           Philip puffs up, overjoyed.  Gary mouths, “Phil?” as Philip 
           struts into --

           INT. HOMEROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           -- on a mission, moving confidently toward Simone.

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey, Simone.  Listen, if you want to 
                        study for the Chemistry test after 
                        school...

                                 SIMONE
                        I’d love to.  I really need it! 

                                 PHILIP
                        How about we meet in the library?

                                 SIMONE
                        Perfect.  I’ll be there.

           Philip turns, offers a triumphant nod to a confused Gary.

                                 GARY
                        I thought we were gonna study.

                                 PHILIP
                        Dude.  I’m sealing the deal.  

                                 GARY
                        You’re right.  No, you’re totally 
                        right.  I’ll be fine.

           Philip doesn’t seem particularly concerned about whether Gary 
           will be fine, as he watches Simone from across the room...

           INT. BY THE LOCKERS -- DAY

           A CUTE GIRL, KRISTEN (17), stands at her locker alone. 

           REVEAL LLOYD observing her.  Beside him, the helpful TESS.  

                                 TESS
                        She’s alone.  Go for it.  
                                 LLOYD
                        What do I say?

                                 TESS
                        Just pretend you’re a normal person.

           Tess disappears from sight.  Lloyd approaches Kristen.

                                 LLOYD
                        Hi, Kristen.
                           (off her confused look)
                        It’s Lloyd.  I’m in your Life Sciences 
                        class.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Really?

                                 LLOYD
                        You lent me a pencil.

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh.  

                                 LLOYD
                        This might seem out of the blue... It 
                        is out of the blue, actually, but 
                        Prom’s coming up and I’m looking for a 
                        date and I wondered if you maybe 
                        wanted to go with me? 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Are you serious?

                                 LLOYD
                        I know it’s a little last minute. But 
                        I’m really fun, I swear.  I have 
                        references.

                                 KRISTEN
                        No, it’s not that.  I have a 
                        boyfriend.  Didn’t you know that?  

                                 LLOYD
                        Oh.  No, I guess not.  Is it a new 
                        thing, or...?

                                 KRISTEN
                        Sorry, this is just so weird.  I 
                        thought everyone knew about us.
                           (off his blank stare)
                        I’m Kristen.  He’s Anton.  We’re 
                        Kranton?  
           She FLINGS open her LOCKER as further proof: Giant, glittery 
           letters spell: KRANTON!  The inside is WALLPAPERED with 
           pictures of them, hearts, puffy paint...  Lloyd takes it in.

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        How can you not know about us?  You’d 
                        have to live in a cave.  I mean, we’re 
                        always together.  This five minutes 
                        I’m talking to you is the longest 
                        we’ve been apart in months.  

                                 LLOYD
                        I had no idea. 

           Just then, she closes her locker to reveal -- yep, ANTON, 17. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        You’re back.

                                 ANTON
                        I missed you.

           As they proceed to MAKE OUT --

                                 LLOYD
                        Alrighty, then.  Talk to you around.  
                        Kranton.

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Nova walks into the gym and is quickly swallowed by DARKNESS.

                                 NOVA
                           (in the dark)
                        Hello?  Why aren’t these lights on?  
                        Rolo, did you fall asleep in the 
                        treasure chest again?

           THEN: A SWITCH is flipped.  An ethereal glow from the center 
           of the gym.  The sound of flowing WATER.  Then she sees it.

           THE FOUNTAIN

           A towering, tropical waterfall made of rocks and leaves and 
           real flowers.  The water cascades into a sparkling pool lit 
           from beneath.  Nova is ecstatic.  It’s heavenly.

           Reveal RICK, his hand on the switch.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        It’s finished!  How did you -- you 
                        must’ve worked all night.
                                 RICK
                        You like it?

                                 NOVA
                        It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve 
                        ever seen.  I had no idea you were so 
                        talented.

                                 RICK
                        Thanks a lot.

                                 NOVA
                        I didn’t mean it like that.  This is 
                        amazing.  You’re an artist.

           This means more to Rick than Nova could possibly know.  She 
           admires the fountain...  realizes he’s staring at her.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 RICK
                        I have a kid brother.  He’s seven.  
                        And because of my mom’s work schedule, 
                        I have to pick him up from day care.

                                 NOVA
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 RICK
                        It’s why I’m late.  It’s why I cut 
                        class and I’m late getting here.  I 
                        just want you to know I’m not blowing 
                        it off ‘cause I’m a slacker.

                                 NOVA
                        I’m sorry I assumed that.

                                 RICK
                        It’s okay.  Everybody does.

           They hold each other’s gaze... a nice moment.

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY -- DAY

           Philip finds an empty table.  He sits down, then looks up.

                                 PHILIP
                           (to an imaginary Simone)
                        Simone!  Hey!  I didn’t see you there.  
                        What am I saying, of course I saw her.

           A NERDY KID shoots him a weird look from across the room.
           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, LOCKERS -- SAME

           TOMMY matches step with Simone, on her way to the library.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey, Simone.

                                 SIMONE
                        What do you want, Tommy?

                                 TOMMY
                        Can I give you a ride home? 

                                 SIMONE
                        I have plans. 

           He SWINGS around in front of her.  Turns the charm WAY up.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Come for a ride.  Please?  Just a 
                        quick ride. I promise.

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY -- DAY

           Philip taps his pencil on the table.  Looks around for 
           Simone.  Only spots the Nerdy Kid, who shrugs at him.

           INT. TOMMY’S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Tommy’s parked along a neighborhood street.  Simone struggles 
           to stay strong, stares straight ahead. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Why won’t you answer my texts? 

                                 SIMONE
                        You know why.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m trapped, don’t you see?  My hands 
                        are tied.  Please don’t ice me out 
                        like this.  I miss you.  I miss that 
                        little dimple you get when you smile.  
                        Lemme see it, just once. 

                                 SIMONE
                        No...

                                 TOMMY
                        Ahhh, there it is.  There’s a smile.  
                        Don’t fight it, come on.

           She softens -- melting slightly as he leans in close.
           INT. MONICA’S CAR -- SAME TIME

           REVEAL MONICA, in her car, half a block down the road. She 
           peers at Tommy and Simone through the windshield, seething.

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY -- EVEN LATER

           The Nerdy kid packs up to go home.  Philip watches him go.

           EXT. GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Late in the day.  Rick staples twinkle lights onto a backdrop 
           while Nova talks into her PHONE, increasingly disturbed.

                                 NOVA
                        Those tiki torches were supposed to be 
                        here yesterday.  What do you mean you 
                        delivered them?  To what address?
                           (turning white)
                        What?  WHAT?    

           Rick turns, perplexed, as she sinks down onto the bleachers.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        I understand the confusion.  I’ll 
                        figure something out.  Thank you. 

           She looks up at Rick.  Devastated.

                                 RICK
                        What was that all about?

                                 NOVA
                        Cranbrook’s prom theme is Welcome to

                                 RICK
                        So?

                                 NOVA
                        So they’re our biggest rival.  And 
                        they totally copied us.

                                 RICK
                        Can’t there be two jungle proms?

                                 NOVA
                        I don’t know, Rick.  Can there be two 
                        presidents of the United States?  Two 
                        winners of the Superbowl?  There’s no 
                        tie for number one. 
                           (beat)
                        What else can go wrong?
                                 RICK
                        C’mon, I’m sure your prom’s better.

                                 NOVA
                        But how do I know for sure?  I have no 
                        idea what they’re planning.    

                                 RICK
                        There’s one way to find out.  

           She cocks her head as a gleam shines in his eye.

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

           Rick on his bike, Nova stands beside him shaking her head.

                                 RICK
                        You want my help or not?

                                 NOVA
                        On this thing?

                                 RICK
                        You can do it Nova, I know you can.

                                 NOVA
                        Do what?

                                 RICK
                           (handing her a helmet)
                        Trust me.

           EXT. CRANBROOK HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

           Another school, silent in the darkness.  Rick and Nova creep 
           up to a DOOR on the building’s side, whispering --

                                 NOVA
                        How are you gonna get us in there?

                                 RICK
                        I’m gonna fire my grappling hook gun, 
                        scale the side of this wall, and crash 
                        in through the skylights.

                                 NOVA
                        Really?

           He KICKS the door to the gym and it simply opens.
           INT. CRANBROOK’S GYM -- NIGHT

           They creep into the dark gym.  Nova swaggers through like a 
           detective at a crime scene, increasingly pleased at what she 
           sees.  She picks up a cheap looking PLASTIC PLANT. 

                                 NOVA
                        Hmm.  Fake.  I would expect more from 
                        these guys.

           He smirks.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 RICK
                        You’re so cocky right now.

                                 NOVA
                        I am not, it’s the truth.  They don’t 
                        even have a fog machine.

                                 RICK
                        Amateurs. 

           He sticks his head into a headless Gorilla STAND UP FIGURE.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                           (behind Gorilla body)
                        Your prom’s definitely better.

           She looks at him, awash in gratitude.  It occurs to her --

                                 NOVA
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 RICK
                        Eh.  I hadn’t broken in anywhere for a 
                        while...

                                 NOVA
                        I’m serious.  You don’t care about 
                        this.  Why help me?

                                 RICK
                        It’s nice to be around someone who 
                        believes in something so much. 

           They’re both a little surprised by his simple honesty.  In 
           fact, it leaves her rather flustered and elated.  

                                 NOVA
                           (with a grand gesture)
                        I do care.  And my prom is better!
           And her enthusiastic gesture then knocks over a giant pile of 
           FAKE ROCKS.  They CRACK UP, scramble to stop the avalanche -- 
           and wind up practically in each other’s arms.  A beat.

           He looks at her.  She looks at him.  It’s a kiss moment.  And 
           she’s about to go with it... When she suddenly draws back.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 RICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 NOVA
                        You were gonna kiss me!

                                 RICK
                        No, I wasn’t!

                                 NOVA
                        Why not?

                                 RICK
                        What?  Nova, if I’m about to kiss you,  
                        you’ll know it.

           Then -- A COMMOTION from the hallway.  Nova JUMPS five feet.

                                 NOVA
                        What was that??

           A SECURITY GUARD, keys jangling, approaches.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Somebody there?

                                 RICK
                        We gotta go.

           He GRABS her hand as the Guard rounds the corner.  His 
           FLASHLIGHT BEAM bounces around the room.  Rick and Nova are 
           gone.  But THEN -- he hears a DOOR close on the other side of 
           the gym and begins to CHASE THEM -- here we go...

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- Nova and Rick run down a hallway and around a corner, out 
           of breath and exhilarated, the guard hot on their tails.

           -- CAFETERIA KITCHEN: They blast through the kitchen. Nova 
           looks at a giant vat of oil.  Ew.

           -- AUTO SHOP GARAGE:  They duck into one side of a half-built 
           car and out the other as the guard gives chase.
           -- ANOTHER HALLWAY: Nova stops at a Cranbrook PROM POSTER.  

                                 NOVA
                        Black and white? 

                                 RICK
                        C’mon!

           Rick grabs her hand and pulls her away.

           -- LOCKER ROOM SHOWERS:  The guard creeps through the tiled 
           shower area.  

           REVEAL RICK AND NOVA, crouched close together in a little 
           stall.  Rick looks up, sees --

           AN OPEN WINDOW

           Nova shakes her head.  Rick  nods.  She shakes again.  He 
           nods again.  Then THE GUARD’S FLASHLIGHT is visible against 
           the tile.  She leaps up and climbs onto his shoulders, 
           practically stepping on his head, to get out the window.  

           He shoves her (okay, on the butt,) out the window and then 
           pulls himself up with those impressive arm muscles we 
           mentioned earlier...

           JUST as the flashlight lands on the window, Rick’s SHOE 
           disappears from view.

           EXT. CRANBROOK HIGH SCHOOL --  NIGHT

           Nova LEAPS onto the back of the motorcycle and OFF THEY GO as 
           the guard lumbers out the doors, shouting.

           They tear away, roaring through the streets.  Nova YELLS with 
           abandon and exhilaration -- they made it!

                                 NOVA
                        We did it!

           And in that triumphant moment -- CHERRY LIGHTS start to whir 
           behind them.  Rick pulls over as Nova deflates.  Caught.

           INT. POLICE STATION, BENCHES -- NIGHT

           Nova and Rick sit on a BENCH in the administrative area.  

                                 NOVA
                        Jail.  This is jail.

                                 RICK
                        This is not jail.  It’s a bench.
                                 NOVA
                        I’m a convict!  Do you know how JAIL 
                        looks on a resume?

                                 RICK
                        Maybe we can get matching prison tats.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        So this is funny to you.  

           Frank and Kitty appear.  Frank is SEETHING, doesn’t even SEE 
           Nova through his fury at Rick.

                                 NOVA
                        You guys got here quick.

                                 FRANK
                           (spits it out)
                        Rick Linsey. 

                                 RICK
                        Nice to meet you, sir.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t “sir” me.  I’m not buying it.  

                                 NOVA
                        Wait a minute, Dad.  This is not his 
                        fault.

                                 FRANK
                        Riding her around on that death 
                        machine.  Breaking and entering. 

                                 NOVA
                        He was trying to help me.    

                                 FRANK
                        Like he helped burn your prom down?

           Nova reacts to his sharp tone.  Meanwhile Rick recoils, 
           sinking into a familiar defensive slouch.  Nova presses on --

                                 NOVA
                        Dad, please listen.  I deserve the 
                        blame.  Rick, tell them.

           But Rick just slumps against the bench, silent.

                                 FRANK
                        I should’ve intervened on day one.   
                        Before he dragged her down to his 
                        level.
           Nova keeps trying to catch Rick’s eyes, it’s not happening.

                                 NOVA
                        Rick?

           He avoids her eyes as Frank leads her away...

           INT. HOMEROOM -- DAY

           Philip and Gary at their lockers as Simone approaches.

                                 SIMONE

                        there.

           OF COURSE he saw her there.

                                 SIMONE
                        I’m really sorry I didn’t make it to 
                        the library to study with you.

           GARY’S EYES bulge at this news.  Philip takes a beat.  Then:

                                 PHILIP
                        We were supposed to study!  Wow.  You 
                        know, I totally forgot.

                                 SIMONE
                        You did?

                        Yeah.  That’s crazy.  I was out with

                                 SIMONE
                        The... team?

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah, Tommy wanted to show me some 
                        moves.  Varsity stuff.  I’m looking 
                        good for next year, so.

                                 SIMONE
                        Tommy showed you.

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah.  We must’ve lost track of time, 
                        I forgot all about our plans.  
                                 SIMONE
                        Well, I’m still sorry.  I would’ve 
                        hated to be waiting all afternoon for 
                        someone to show up.

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah.  That would’ve sucked.

           He smiles.  Simone watches him, her heart breaking.  Gary 
           ALSO watches, feels his buddy’s pain...

           EXT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Nova stands in the NO PARKING ZONE.  Waiting.

           Here comes RICK, pulling in on his bike.  As he dismounts --

                                 NOVA
                        I don’t know whether to apologize to 
                        you or throw this book at your head.  

                                 RICK
                        Oh, no, she’s showing signs of violence.  
                        Does my bad influence have no end?

                                 NOVA
                        Why didn’t you fight?  Why didn’t you 
                        tell the truth?

                                 RICK
                        Because it doesn’t matter.

                                 NOVA
                        You don’t know my dad, he’s a 
                        reasonable man, he would’ve listened --

                                 RICK
                        Your Dad took one look at me and 
                        decided I was the bad guy, end of 
                        story.  I could’ve started reciting 
                        Shakespeare, it wouldn’t have made a 
                        difference.  

                                 NOVA
                        Why do you think that?

                                 RICK
                        Let’s just say I’ve seen that look 
                        before.  Never ends well for me.  

                                 NOVA
                           (suddenly)
                        You didn’t set that fire.
           There it is, at long last.  Rick sighs.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        Piper assumed you were to blame, and 
                        you didn’t fight that, either.  I’m 
                        right aren’t I?  You’re innocent.

                                 RICK
                        It. Doesn’t. Matter.

                                 NOVA
                        Yes, it does.  It absolutely does!

                                 RICK
                        Then how come it took you this long to 
                        ask?

           She has no answer.  He gets back on his bike.  

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        You were willing to believe it was me, 
                        just like everybody else.  So thanks 
                        for the sudden vote of confidence, but 
                        it’s coming just a little on the late 
                        side.  I’m outta here.

           And he starts up his engine, leaves her there alone.

           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, LOCKERS -- END OF THE DAY

           Gary shakes his head as he walks to Philip’s locker with him.  

                                 GARY
                        This is all my fault.  I never 
                        should’ve told you to ask her out.

                                 PHILIP
                        Gary, it’s fine.  

                                 GARY
                        It’s not fine.  You’ve been dissed, 
                        trampled, humiliated!

           An ENVELOPE is taped to Philip’s locker. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

           The envelope:  Blank. Philip spots SIMONE at her locker.

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey, Simone.  You didn’t happen to see 
                        anybody tape this envelope onto my 
                        locker, did you?
                                 SIMONE
                        Why, what is it?

                                 PHILIP
                           (opening it)
                        Tickets.  To see Stick Hippo.

           He gestures to a POSTER of the band in his locker.  

                                 SIMONE
                        They’re good.  I checked out their 
                        fansite online.  Pretty cool.

           Gary and Philip look at each other in disbelief... and then, 
           to Simone, in even more disbelief.  

                                 GARY
                        You’re the one hit. She’s the one hit!

                                 SIMONE
                        I bet they’re great live.  

           She smiles.  Philip smiles back.  

                                 GARY
                        Are you kidding, they’re the best!   
                        Where are our seats?

           Philip holds only TWO tickets.  Simone looks uncomfortable.  
           Gary suddenly realizes what’s happening.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        This is like a “you guys” thing, huh?
                           (a beat)
                        That’s cool.  Just uh, get me a T-
                        shirt or something.

           Gary shuts his locker as Philip smiles at Simone.  

           EXT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, MONICA’S LOCKER -- DAY

           Tommy weaves through the crowd toward Monica, unsuspecting.  
           Monica’s friends see him coming and SCATTER.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey, babe.

           She turns to him with a face of stone.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.  What’d I do now?

                                 MONICA
                        It’s over, Tommy.  
                                 TOMMY
                        What is?

                                 MONICA
                        I know about Simone.

                                 TOMMY
                        I gave her a ride home.  What are you 
                        upset about?

                                 MONICA
                        I’m not upset.  I’m over it.  

           She’s not taking the bait.  He calls an audible...

                                 TOMMY
                        You don’t mean that, prom’s right 
                        around the corner.  What happened to 
                        “Prom is our moment?”  

                                 MONICA
                        This isn’t gonna ruin my prom, trust 
                        me. I can get another date much faster 
                        than you can talk your way out of 
                        this. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Another date?  Who?

                                 MONICA
                        You think over the years guys haven’t 
                        hit on me?  Haven’t asked me out?

                                 TOMMY
                        Nobody at Lake Canyon’ll take you to 
                        Prom.  Not while I’m around.

                                 MONICA
                        Well, Lake Canyon isn’t the only 
                        school in town.  

           The possibility of Monica with somebody else has literally 
           never occurred to Tommy.  She sees that on his face.

                                 MONICA (CONT’D)
                        Despite what you think, Tommy, you are 
                        replaceable.

                                 TOMMY
                        Okay, you’re right.  I’m a jerk.  I’m 
                        sorry.  You know me, I just --
                                 MONICA
                        I do know you.  Which is why I can’t 
                        believe it’s taken me this long to do 
                        this.  Goodbye.  

           And off she goes.  Tommy Barso stands there - for the first 
           time ever maybe - alone.

           EXT. SAEYOUNG’S FRONT PORCH -- DAY

           Saeyoung and Justin walk home from school.

                                 JUSTIN
                        So my parents will come over around 4 
                        for pictures.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What?  No.  I don’t want your parents 
                        butting in on everything we do.  I 
                        mean who’s prom is it?   

                                 JUSTIN
                        Everyone’s parents do this, it’s part 
                        of the deal.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        I don’t care.  I don’t want to do it.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Saeyoung, that’s gonna kill my mom.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Then go with her if it’s so important 
                        to you.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Okay, take it easy.  They’re just 
                        pictures, we’ll figure it out.

           A tense beat.  Then, his eyes go to a LARGE PACKAGE on her 
           porch.  He brightens.  

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh, what’s this?  Could it be... 
                        Someone’s prom dress has arrived?

           She looks at the box, less excited than you’d think she’d be.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You have to try it on.  Come on.
           EXT. DAY CARE FACILITY -- DAY

           Rick pulls up to the lot we saw Pauly playing in earlier.  
           Except this time, something’s different --

           NOVA is standing with Pauly, chatting like old friends. 

                                 PAULY
                        I have a 2005 Bowman Chrome Justin 
                        Verlander that’s worth like 25 bucks, 
                        and a mint 2001 Fleer Focus Albert 
                        Pujols that’d go for 60 at least. 

                                 NOVA
                        You must have some allowance, kid.

                                 PAULY
                        They were my Dad’s.

           That lands on Nova, as another piece of the Rick puzzle drops 
           in.  And speaking of Rick...

                                 RICK
                           (approaching)
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 NOVA
                        I came to apologize.

                                 PAULY
                        You guys know each other? Are you like 
                        his peer-counselor or something?

                                 NOVA
                        No.

                                 PAULY
                        Parole officer?

                                 RICK
                        Pauly. 

           Pauly zips it.  Rick takes in the incongruous sight of her, 
           here on his turf.

                                 NOVA
                        I was wrong.  And I’m sorry.

                                 RICK
                        You came all the way here to tell me 
                        that?
                                 NOVA
                        Yes.  I thought I knew you, Rick.  And 
                        I don’t.  
                           (then)
                        But I’d like to.  If you’d let me.

           Rick and Nova look at each other for a beat.  Then -- 

                                 PAULY
                        Think fast!

           He THROWS a softball at her...

           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD -- SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- Nova pitches to Pauly.  Pauly actually hits one that sends 
           her running.  Rick and Pauly fist-bump.

           -- Nova at bat.  Rick sends in the pitch and she doesn’t 
           swing.  Pauly calls a strike.  She turns and starts an 
           argument.  Pauly threatens to throw her out.  Rick smirks.

           -- Rick RUNS around third as Nova fields his hit and readies 
           to throw to Pauly at third base.  But as Rick rounds third he 
           PICKS PAULY UP and carries him with him over home plate.  

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY -- DAY (AFTER SCHOOL)

           Simone in the library stacks.  She pulls out a book to reveal 
           -- TOMMY’S FACE on the other side.  She YELPS.

           The same Nerdy Kid from before looks up, disturbed.

                                 NERDY KID
                        Shhh!

                                 SIMONE
                           (whispering)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 TOMMY
                        I’ve been looking for you everywhere.  
                        I wanted you to hear it from me first.  
                        It’s over with Monica.  I ended it.

                                 SIMONE
                        Tommy... 

                                 TOMMY
                        I mean it.  For real.  Ask anybody.

                                 SIMONE
                        But what about prom, and your hands 
                        being tied...
           He holds up his hands, wide apart.

                                 TOMMY
                        Untied!  Simone...  Will you go to 
                        prom with me?

           She looks at him, conflicted, but already getting lost in his 
           compelling gaze...

           INT. SAEYOUNG’S ROOM -- DAY

           Justin stands in the HALLWAY outside Saeyoung’s room.  Her 
           door is closed.  Closed and locked.  

                                 SAEYOUNG (O.S.)
                           (behind door)
                        I look like a manatee.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Can I at least just see it on you?

                                 SAEYOUNG (O.S.)
                           (behind door)
                        No.  

                                 JUSTIN
                        Please?

                                 SAEYOUNG (O.S.)
                           (behind door)
                        Absolutely not.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Then how can I be sure it’s as awful 
                        as you say?  It might look great!

           The door FLIES open and Saeyoung storms out, carrying A PROM 
           DRESS over her arm.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        It does not look great.  It looks 
                        hideous.  The color is wrong, the cut 
                        is wrong, the fabric is wrong.  
                        There’s only one place this dress is 
                        going.  And it’s not to prom. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE SAEYOUNG’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           She storms to the TRASH BIN, dramatically throws off the lid 
           and STUFFS the dress inside.  Slams the lid angrily.
                                 SAEYOUNG
                           (to the dress)
                        I hate you.  Hate, hate, hate.  
                        Goodbye!

                                 JUSTIN
                        Don’t do that.  Now what are you going 
                        to wear?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Nothing.

                                 JUSTIN
                        What, you’re gonna just not wear a 
                        dress to prom?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        No, I’m gonna just not go to prom.

           He takes a deep breath as she fumes.  Finally:

                                 JUSTIN
                        Look, if you don’t want to go, you can 
                        just tell me.  We can skip this whole 
                        Promzilla routine.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 JUSTIN
                        First it was the limo, then the 
                        pictures, now the dress.  You’re 
                        obviously looking for excuses not to go.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        I never said that.   

                                 JUSTIN
                        You don’t have to. I know when I’m 
                        being blown off.  You don’t want to 
                        go, fine.  Prom’s off, problem solved.

           He leaves her there, beside the trash bin.

           INT. THE FAMILY BUGGY DINER -- DAY 

           Nova, Rick and Pauly at the COUNTER of this popular hang out. 

           SANDRA, Rick’s Mom, serves up milkshakes with a look at Rick.

                                 SANDRA
                        You say you two have been working 
                        together at school?
                                 RICK
                        Something like that.

           Rick grins at Nova.  It’s infectious, Sandra smiles too.  
           Pauly looks at everybody grinning and rolls his eyes.

                                 PAULY
                        Oh, brother.  Can I get a refill 
                        before I barf, please?

           Suddenly LAUGHTER erupts from a booth a few tables away.

           AT THE BOOTH

           A group of COLLEGE KIDS laugh as they construct a TOWER OF 
           FOOD -- sandwiches and pizza and chocolate cake and syrup...

                                 SANDRA
                        My favorite kind of customers.

           ... and it topples.  Food spills everywhere.  The kids laugh.

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        Oh, waitress!

                                 COLLEGE KID 2
                        Cleanup on aisle five!

           Rick’s Mom picks up a RAG, resigned.  Rick turns toward the 
           College Kids, readying for confrontation.

                                 RICK
                        You gonna clean that up?

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        Excuse me?

                                 RICK
                        You heard me.

           Nova reaches for Rick.

                                 NOVA
                        Why don’t we get out of here?

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s a good idea, Nova.  I’ll keep 
                        Pauly here, you two should go.

           But Rick’s heading over to the kids, ready to pummel them.  

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        What’re you gonna do, not take my 
                        coupons at the Grocery Mart?
                                 COLLEGE KID 2
                        Yeah, mind your own business, kid.  
                        I’m sure somebody somewhere needs you 
                        to serve them a side of fries.

           They CRACK UP as NOVA RUSHES up and spins Rick around.

                                 NOVA
                        I want you to come with me.

                                 RICK
                        Get out of the way.

                                 NOVA
                        No.  Listen.  You can do this, Rick, I 
                        know you can.

                                 RICK
                        Do what?

                                 NOVA
                        Trust me.

           Hearing his own words gives him pause long enough for her to 
           TAKE HIS HAND and lead him out.  Sandra strolls over to the 
           messy table as the Customers prepare to leave.

                                 SANDRA
                        Boys not happy with your meal?

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        It was great.  Little messy though.

                                 SANDRA
                        Hey Pauly, what is it they say about 
                        people who play with their food?

           PAULY spins on his bar stool to chime in --

                                 PAULY
                        It’s an indicator of below-average 
                        intelligence.

           Customers SMIRK at the College kids.  Sandra winks at Pauly.

           EXT. STREET -- DAY

           Rick and Nova stand by his motorcycle.

                                 RICK
                        I’ve never walked away from a fight in 
                        my life.
                                 NOVA
                        How’s it feel?

                                 RICK
                        Like I need to go back there and crack 
                        some skulls.

                                 NOVA
                        Would that really make you feel 
                        better?

                                 RICK
                        Yeah, it would.  Guys like that do 
                        whatever they want, and get away with 
                        it.  

                                 NOVA
                        No, they don’t.  Stuff balances out.  
                        If you’re not a good person, at some 
                        point, it catches up with you.

                                 RICK
                        Of course you think that.  

                                 NOVA
                        What does that mean?

                                 RICK
                        That it’s easy to be optimistic when 
                        everything always goes your way.

                                 NOVA
                        Everything doesn’t always go my way!  
                        I simply choose to look on the bright 
                        side.  Sure, my prom date ditched me, 
                        and my decorations were incinerated.  
                        But, I met you.  And got arrested.  
                        Which was very educational.

           That gets a laugh out of him.  

                                 RICK
                        Thanks.  But I haven’t had a lot of 
                        reasons to look on the bright side in 
                        my life.

                                 NOVA
                        Well, maybe that’s changing.

                                 RICK
                        Maybe it is.

           They share a long look.  
                                 RICK (CONT’D)

                        Prom dresses?  I can’t.  Sorry.

           INT. GIRLY BOUTIQUE -- DAY

           RICK sits on a pink divan, surrounded by SHOE BOXES and 
           DRESSES.  MUSIC for Nova’s Pretty Woman montage:

           -- A PINK FRILLY number.   Rick gives thumbs down.

           -- A POLKA DOT nightmare.  Rick shields his eyes.

           -- A FLOWERY MUU-MUU situation. Rick laughs. Nova looks at 
           her reflection, retreats into the dressing room. 

           -- Rick takes matters into his own hands.  He slips a SLINKY 
           BLACK NUMBER through the dressing room curtain.

           -- The BLACK SLINKY is immediately thrust OUT of the curtain.

           Rick takes the dress back, leans against the wall as she 
           changes behind the CURTAIN.

                                 RICK

                        pendant necklace!

                                 NOVA
                        Necklace?  Please.  With the price of 
                        this dress, the only necklace I can 
                        afford'll be made of candy.

           She prattles on, oblivious to the way he’s looking at her.  

                                 RICK
                        That guy who ditched you made a big 
                        mistake.

           Nova turns, suddenly very aware of his eyes on her.

           INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

           A girl, BETSY, 17, SIGHS at a list of BOOK TITLES she’s 
           holding.  LLOYD walks by her as she GROANS.

                                 BETSY
                        Do all assigned books have to be 
                        torturously boring?
           Lloyd pauses, looks around.  She doesn’t seem to be 
           addressing anyone in particular... He picks up the ball.  

                                 LLOYD
                           (leans in, reading)
                        Ugh.  This is rough.  Ethan Frome?

                                 BETSY
                        The worst!  Guy falls in love with his 
                        wife’s cousin, goes sledding with her, 
                        she winds up paralyzed.  Snore.

                                 LLOYD
                        That’s an incredibly accurate plot 
                        summary.  

           They laugh as the BELL RINGS.  Lloyd watches her gather up 
           her books, hope dawning anew.  

                                 LLOYD (CONT’D)
                        Listen, you don’t happen to have a 
                        date to prom, do you?

                                 BETSY
                           (shyly)
                        Me? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Yeah.  I mean, I know it’s a crazy--

                                 BETSY
                        No, it’s really sweet.  I don’t think 
                        we’ve ever talked before...  Have we?    

                                 LLOYD
                        Maybe not.  I’m Lloyd.

                                 BETSY
                        Betsy.

                                 LLOYD
                        Short for Elizabeth?

                                 BETSY
                        That’s right.

                                 LLOYD
                        Pretty.  

                                 BETSY
                        Thanks.

                                 LLOYD
                        So what do you think, Betsy?  Prom? 
                                 BETSY
                        That could be fun.  You seem nice.

           Lloyd practically floats off the ground -- this is it! 

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        But I have a date already.  I mean 
                        it’s just a friend, we’re going as 
                        friends... But prom’s Saturday, I 
                        can’t cancel now.

                                 LLOYD
                        No, I understand.

                                 BETSY
                        It’s too bad.  Maybe if we’d met 
                        sooner, you know?

           Her words hit Lloyd like bullets.  Once again, he’s too late.

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that funny, how you can go to 
                        school with somebody for so long and 
                        not even meet them ‘til now? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Yeah.  Funny.

           Off Lloyd, feeling as bleak as an Edith Wharton novel...

           EXT. CRANBROOK HIGH SCHOOL, ESTABLISHING -- DAY

           Another high school -- markedly similar to Lake Canyon, but 
           clearly not the same place.  A school bell RINGS, and KIDS 
           begin to spill from the building. 

           In the parking lot, we find...

           MONICA 

           Sitting in her car.  She flips down her visor mirror, touches 
           up her lipstick.  Checks her cleavage.  Visor up.  Go time.

                                 MONICA
                        Watch this, Tommy.

           She gets out of her car and scans the STUDENTS until she 
           finds some CUTE SENIOR GUYS hanging by their cars.  

           Monica takes a few steps toward them, then stops in her 
           tracks.  Looking closer, she sees...

           Three guys, one of them clearly the leader -- white teeth, 
           chiseled jawline, perfectly tousled hair.  
           And as we zero in on his BUDDIES, the parallels between this 
           trio and Tommy’s own cadre of pals are striking.

           She watches, rapt, as our Tommy-doppelganger doles out a few 
           fist bumps, then walks over to...

           SOME CHEERLEADERS

           Standing by a car in their uniforms, we can immediately tell 
           which one’s the ALPHA GIRL.  She’s pretty and confident, and 
           she’s the one that the Tommy-doppelganger walks up to.  

           He puts his arm around her in a way that says loud and clear, 
           she belongs to him.  

           WITH MONICA

           She stares, frozen.  She’s watching herself.  It’s the wake 
           up call of a lifetime.  And in a moment, she’s seen enough.

           She gets back in her car, and drives away.

           EXT. RANDAZZO TUXEDO SHOP -- DAY

           Gabby walks past the tux shop, through the window, glimpses --

           INT. TUXEDO SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

           FIND ROLO, examining a VELVETY TUX JACKET.  Gabby approaches.

                                 ROLO
                        Tactile.

                                 GABBY
                        Hey, Rolo.  Looking for a tux?

                                 ROLO
                        How do I know which one to pick?

                                 GABBY
                        Hmm.  Well, what’s Athena wearing? 

                                 ROLO
                        This. 

           He hands over a MAGAZINE PICTURE of a model in a VEERY grown 
           up dress.  Gabby examines it.

                                 GABBY
                        Nice try.

                                 ROLO
                        What do you mean?
                                 GABBY
                        First of all, this dress is satin. 
                        Which everyone knows is the most 
                        unforgiving fabric there is.  Heidi 
                        Klum would have to cut back on the 
                        carbs to pull this off.  

                                 ROLO
                        That’s what she’s wearing.

                                 GABBY
                        No, it’s what every guy fantasizes his 
                        girlfriend would wear.  Where’d you 
                        get this, anyway?

                                 ROLO
                        She sent it to me.

                                 GABBY
                        Rolo, you clearly ripped this out of 
                        some magazine somewhere.  I mean, for 
                        real, you’ve gone from like, wishful 
                        thinking to Notify the Authorities.

                                 ROLO
                        She’s real. 

                                 GABBY
                        Alright, you know what?  I tried.  
                        Some people can’t be helped. 

           She walks off, disgusted.

           INT. GAS STATION CONVENIENCE STORE -- DAY

           RICK walks in and drops some cash on the counter.  Nods 
           toward the pump where his bike is parked.

           Then he spots -- CANDY NECKLACES on display.  He grins.

                                 RICK
                        One of these, too.

           The CLERK gives him a funny look.  Rick stares him down.

           ACROSS THE STORE

           We find TOMMY, with Jimbo and Max, dispensing sodas.  Tommy 
           approaches the register.  He and Rick nod to each other.

                                 TOMMY
                        What’s up, man.  How’s Pauly?
                                 RICK
                        He’s in little league.

                                 TOMMY
                        No way.  I remember when that kid was 
                        in diapers.

           ...Ah, so these two used to be friends.  Jimbo and Max 
           WRESTLE, knock into stuff.  Tommy pays and heads for the door 
           when suddenly, on a whim, he turns back...

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I never thanked you for taking 
                        the bullet on that whole accidental 
                        inferno thing.

           Rick TURNS, practically in slow motion, as the words sink in.  

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I get for trying to 
                        impress a girl with a candlelight 
                        dinner, right?

                                 JIMBO
                        Yo, Tommy, let’s go!

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m out.  Thanks again, bro.

                                 RICK
                        Don’t thank me, Tommy.

           Tommy stops, looks genuinely confused at Rick’s sharp tone.

                                 TOMMY
                        Why not?

                                 RICK
                        I didn’t take a bullet for you.  

                                 TOMMY
                        You didn’t?

                                 RICK
                        No.  Why would I do that?

                                 TOMMY
                        ‘Cause what do you have to lose?  I 
                        just figured you were taking one for 
                        the team.

                                 RICK
                        What team?  We haven’t been on the 
                        same team for years.
                                 TOMMY
                        Look, I’m sorry, bro, but you didn’t 
                        get blamed ‘cause of me.  You got 
                        blamed ‘cause you’re you.  

                                 RICK
                        How do you figure?

                                 TOMMY
                        Piper has it out for you so bad, even 
                        if I did confess, it wouldn’t make a 
                        difference.  That’s just how it works.

           Rick absorbs the truth of this.  As it weighs on him, Tommy 
           looks out at his friends, HONKING in the parking lot.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta jet.  

           INT. NOVA’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Nova shows her DRESS to Saeyoung and Gabby.  They “ooh” and 
           “ahh” accordingly.  Nova looks at Saeyoung. 

                                 NOVA
                        Have you decided what shoes you’re 
                        wearing? 

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Why?

                                 NOVA
                        I was hoping to borrow those platform 
                        sandals of yours?  But ONLY if you’re 
                        100% sure you’re not wearing them.

           Saeyoung is taken aback, still tender and uncertain after her 
           fight with Justin.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        I’m not 100% sure about anything Prom 
                        related right now.  

                                 GABBY
                        Are you and Justin okay?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                           (no)
                        Yeah, of course.

                                 GABBY
                        Are you sure?  You need to talk...?
                                 SAEYOUNG
                           (overcompensating)
                        Why are we talking about me, you guys?  
                        This is Nova’s night!  And yes, you 
                        can totally borrow my sandals, they 
                        will look amazing with that.  

           Saeyoung smiles through the pain, draws the attention back to 
           Nova, who’s holding her dress in front of herself.

                                 NOVA
                        I wonder if they’ll be too high.  I 
                        don’t want to be taller than him.

                                 GABBY
                        Than... WHO?

           Nova turns, her eyes sparkling.  Saeyoung and Gabby gawk.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        You got a prom date and this is the 
                        first we’re hearing about it?  

                                 NOVA
                        He hasn’t asked me yet.  But 
                        tomorrow’s our last day working 
                        together.  And I think he’s going to.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Is she talking about Rick Linsey?  Are 
                        you talking about Rick Linsey?

                                 GABBY
                        It’s either him or Rolo.  Please say 
                        it’s not Rolo.

                                 NOVA
                        I’m talking about Rick.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Nova likes bad boys.  Who knew?

                                 NOVA
                        It’s more than that.  It’s real.  I 
                        mean, I’ve never felt anything like 
                        this before.

                                 GABBY
                        Nova’s in love!

           Her friends SHRIEK as she jumps onto the bed with them.

           OUTSIDE NOVA’S ROOM
           Frank approaches, again in his work shirt, about to knock 
           when he hears the SQUEALING girls, thinks better of it.  He 
           turns to leave, but can’t help hearing...

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  You and Rick Linsey.  I don’t 
                        believe it. 

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        No one will.

                                 NOVA 
                           (defensive)
                        Why not?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Um, because you’re you.  And he’s...

                                 GABBY
                        ... not exactly college bound.

                                 NOVA
                        Well, maybe that stuff isn’t as 
                        important as I thought it was.  Maybe 
                        there’s more to a person than being 
                        valedictorian, or class president.

           OUTSIDE NOVA’S ROOM

           Frank closes his eyes at what he’s hearing.  His worst fear.  
           He moves off down the hall with a purpose...

           INT. SANDRA’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Rick flips on the light.  Takes in the feminine flourishes, 
           the achingly few masculine effects; A men’s valet tray still 
           on the dresser.  A couple pens, maybe a money clip in it.   

           On one side, the night stand is littered with women’s 
           magazines, reading glasses, an old teacup.  The other side is  
           empty, save for a small wedding photo.  A widow’s bedroom.

           INT. SANDRA’S CLOSET -- NIGHT

           Again, mostly his Mom’s clothes.  Rick pushes them aside, 
           makes his way to the back where a single GARMENT BAG hangs.  
           He pauses for a beat, then UNZIPS the bag to reveal -- 

           A TUXEDO.  Rick negotiates it out of the bag so it hangs 
           freely in front of him.  The closest you can get to standing 
           in front of your father, when he’s gone.  

                                 PAULY (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?
           Rick spins, sees Pauly in the doorway.  With a sad smile...

                                 RICK
                        I was asking Dad if it’s okay to 
                        borrow this. 

                                 PAULY
                        What’d he say?

                                 RICK
                        Something about how you’re supposed to 
                        be getting ready for bed, that’s what.

           Pauly giggles and heads off to bed as... THE DOORBELL RINGS.

           INT./EXT. RICK’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Rick heads down the stairs, pulls open the door to reveal...

                                 FRANK
                        Hello, Rick.

                                 RICK
                        Hi...

                                 FRANK
                        I’m here about Nova.

           Rick steps out onto the front porch.

                                 RICK
                        She alright?

                                 FRANK
                        She’s fine, Rick. In fact, she’s 
                        better than fine.  She’s at the top of 
                        her class, colleges are falling over 
                        themselves to have her.  Scholarships, 
                        even.  

                                 RICK
                        That’s great.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe you don’t understand how much 
                        work she’s done to get to where she 
                        is.  And she’s in the home stretch 
                        now.  That’s where you came in.  Right 
                        at the end.

           Rick’s starting to see where this is heading.  

                                 RICK
                        If Nova has a problem with me --
                                 FRANK
                        Nova’s always falling for charity 
                        cases.  She’s a sucker for a lost 
                        cause. 

                                 RICK
                        You don’t even know me.

                                 FRANK
                        I do know you.  I was just like you.  
                        Struggling to get by, angry at the 
                        world, no plan for the future.  You 
                        might even figure it out, but it’s not 
                        fair to drag Nova down while you do.

           His words hit Rick hard.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I know you think you can be part of 
                        her world right now.  Guys like us 
                        always do.  But believe me when I tell 
                        you the best thing we can do for her 
                        is just stay out of her way.    

           Rick can’t seem to muster his old defenses against Frank’s 
           words.  And maybe, just maybe, Rick agrees with them.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        If you care about her as much as I 
                        think you do, you won’t be the thing 
                        that holds her back.

           Frank walks off the porch, leaving Rick there.  Knocked down.

           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, HALLWAYS -- DAY

           Philip and Gary walk out of class, Gary prattling on --

                                 GARY
                        So I said there already is an iphone 
                        app for that and he said not a free 
                        one, but there is, you found it, 
                        remember?  It’s called like, mega... 
                        mega something?

           Philip looks ahead, down the hall, distracted.

                                 PHILIP
                        Oh, there’s Simone.  I gotta talk to 
                        her about Saturday.  Catch you later!

           Philip leaves Gary there, mid-discussion.

           WITH SIMONE
                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                           (catching up with her)
                        Hey there!  

                                 SIMONE
                        Hey, Philip...

                                 PHILIP
                        I can’t wait for Saturday.  What do 
                        you say?  Pick you up at six?

                                 SIMONE
                        Actually, I’ve been looking for you... 
                        I needed to talk to you about that.  
                        Because, well, Saturday’s prom.

           Philip blanches.  Simone hastens to explain --

                                 SIMONE (CONT’D)
                        And... remember that guy I told you 
                        about?  Who wasn’t available?  

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah...

                                 SIMONE
                        He’s available now.  And we’re going.

                                 PHILIP
                        Oh.  Well.  He’s a lucky guy.

           Philip looks like his smile is made of wax.  Simone sees 
           TOMMY down the hall, can’t tell Philip it’s him. 

                                 SIMONE
                        I didn’t mean to mess up your plans, 
                        it all happened really fast.

                                 PHILIP
                        Say no more.  I’m happy for you.

           Simone walks away from him, looking rather miserable for a 
           girl who supposedly just got what she wanted.  

           As the seniors make their way down the hall toward Philip, 
           Simone vanishes around the corner.  Philip turns toward 
           Tommy, seeking solace in his newfound friendship...

                                 JIMBO
                        Let’s roll, dude, I’m starving.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’ll drive.
                                 PHILIP
                        You guys going for pizza?  I could use 
                        a slice.

                                 MAX
                        Watch it.

           Max ELBOWS Philip against the lockers.  The seniors push 
           past, leaving him behind.  Tommy looks back quickly, catches 
           Philip’s eye.  With a decidedly non-committal nod --

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re the man, Phil.

           That’s it.  Tommy leaves, taking any illusion of friendship 
           Philip thought they had along with him. 

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Nova pulls the DISCO BALL from its packing crate.  A TALL 
           LADDER waits in the middle of the dance floor.  

           Faintly, we hear the sound of RICK’S MOTORCYCLE outside.  She 
           turns at the sound -- heart aflutter.  

           Quickly, she CHECKS her reflection in the disco ball.  Which 
           doesn’t go so well, but no matter -- 

           Because THERE HE IS.  RICK stands in the doorway.

                                 NOVA
                        Hey.

                                 RICK
                        We the only ones here?

                                 NOVA
                        Just us.  

           He walks toward her, and her eyes light up in anticipation.  
           He’s impossible to read.  She twirls the sparkly disco ball.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        The crown jewel!

           He just takes it from her and starts climbing the ladder.  

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        Do you think it should be in the 
                        middle?

                                 RICK
                        What?
                                 NOVA
                        Well, I’m just wondering if it’s a 
                        little predictable, disco ball in the 
                        middle of the dance floor.  What about 
                        maybe putting it in the corner, and 
                        then lighting it from an angle --  

                                 RICK
                        Nova, just tell me where you want it.

                                 NOVA
                        You don’t have an opinion?

                                 RICK
                        My opinion is I want to hang this 
                        thing and be done with it.

                                 NOVA
                        Okay.  I guess the center’s fine.  Why 
                        reinvent the wheel, right?

           He resumes climbing.  Nova takes in the gym, in its final 
           stages of preparation.  She marvels at it.

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t wait ‘til you turn that 
                        fountain on underneath these lights.

                                 RICK
                        Me?  How would I turn it on?

                                 NOVA
                        With... the switch?

           He doesn’t have the tools he needs to fasten the disco ball 
           up.  He climbs down the ladder, rifles through a tool box.

                                 RICK
                        I won’t be there.

           A beat.  Nova teeters on the gossamer thread between optimism 
           and despair...

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t think I was actually gonna 
                        go to this thing, did you?

                                 NOVA
                        I thought it might be a possibility.

           He just sifts through the tools, distant.

                        Is something wrong? 
                           (off his silence)
                        You want to talk about it?

                                 RICK
                        What I want is to get out of here.  

                                 NOVA
                        Okay, then let’s go.  Disco ball’s not 
                        going anywhere.  I could use a break 
                        myself.

                                 RICK
                        Not a break.  I’m done.  I’ve wasted 
                        enough of my time in this stupid gym.

           He SLAMS the tool box shut.  She takes a beat, then, softly--

                                 NOVA
                        I don’t think it was a waste of time.

                                 RICK
                        Well, I guess I wouldn’t either if my 
                        biggest problem in life was where to 
                        put a disco ball.  But some of us have 
                        real problems, Nova, that can’t be 
                        solved by hanging up twinkly lights.

                                 NOVA
                        I know that.  What I mean is... it  
                        hasn’t been a waste of time for us.  

                                 RICK
                        What “us?”  You think because I built 
                        your little fountain anything changed?  
                        Nothing changed.  I’m me, you’re you, 
                        the job’s done.  

           Nova blinks, disbelieving.  Once again, he avoids her eyes.

                                 NOVA
                        I guess I thought we were building 
                        more than just a fountain.

                                 RICK
                        That’s very poetic.  Will you write it 
                        in my yearbook?

                                 NOVA
                        You really expect me to believe that 
                        this hasn’t meant anything to you?  
                        That nothing’s changed?  Everything 
                        changed.  The way I feel changed!  
                                 RICK
                        So what?  You think that’s gonna make 
                        a difference?  How you feel?

                                 NOVA
                        I think...  

                                 RICK
                        I’ll spare you the suspense -- It 
                        won’t.  Your world may be all peace 
                        and justice and happy endings,  but 
                        that’s not where I live.  Where I 
                        live, I’m a bad guy who burned your 
                        prom down, and that’s the only reason 
                        I’m here. 

                                 NOVA
                        That’s the only reason, huh?  And what 
                        if I tell you that if I’d known how 
                        that fire would bring you into my 
                        life, I would’ve set it myself?  What 
                        world do I belong in then, Rick?

           This is crushing him.  He’s got to end it before he breaks.  
           But she’s on fire, unapologetic and unafraid -- she stands 
           before him, forces him to look at her.  

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t about prom, or what anybody 
                        else thinks, or even about how it’s 
                        gonna end.  I don’t care about that, I 
                        care about you.  We can deal with 
                        everything else, as long as you feel 
                        about me the way I feel about you.  

                                 RICK
                        I don’t.

           And there it is -- the blow she can’t get up from.  He walks 
           away, can’t even look back. STAY ON NOVA as his words fall on 
           her like an anvil.  

           OFF the sound of his MOTORCYCLE ENGINE roaring to life...

           EXT. OUTSIDE PAPA GINO’S -- DAY

           The after-school crowd are all here.  Philip walks up when 
           suddenly he spies SIMONE heading in.  He stops.  

           Philip SINKS down on the CURB, alone and forlorn.

           Nearby, a CLUSTER of GIRLS enjoys the spring weather.  LLOYD 
           appears, with much less confidence... As he approaches --
           The girls spot him and SCATTER.  His face falls.  He turns 
           toward ANOTHER PAIR of GIRLS, who get up and leave. 

                                 LLOYD
                        That does it.  I’ve officially been 
                        rejected by every girl at Lake Canyon.

                                 PHILIP
                        I know the feeling.

           He plops down next to Philip, grateful for some conversation.

                                 LLOYD
                        What’s her name?

                                 PHILIP
                        Simone.

                                 LLOYD
                        Simone.  What happened?

                                 PHILIP
                        She wants to go to prom. 

           Lloyd reacts with an empathic sigh.

                                 LLOYD
                        I should’ve known.  Prom is 
                        responsible for more pain, suffering, 
                        and humiliation than any other stupid 
                        social ritual in all of high school.  
                        We’d all be better off without it. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Yeah, well, she’s going.  And now 
                        she’ll never know how I feel.

           Lloyd studies Philip.  Then --

                                 LLOYD
                        You gotta tell her.

                                 PHILIP
                        You don’t even know me.

                                 LLOYD
                        Oh, but I do.  I WAS you.  Shy, nice 
                        guy, always waiting for the right time 
                        to make his move... and the right time 
                        never comes?  Before you know it,  
                        you’re a senior, couple weeks from 
                        graduating, and... well, you saw. 

           He nods toward the girls who scattered at his approach.
                                 PHILIP
                        There’s nothing I can do about it.

                                 LLOYD
                        Not true.  You can change the future.  
                        But you have to act.  You can’t keep 
                        waiting for the right moment to 
                        happen.  MAKE it happen.  You 
                        understand me?  Look, what do you have 
                        to lose?

           INT. PAPA GINO’S -- DAY

           At the Senior Table, Max and Jimbo polish off their slices 
           and head over to the Arcade games.  Tommy gulps a soda and 
           goes after them.  Reveal SIMONE, sitting quietly beside him.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey Max, I play winner! 
                           (to Simone)
                        You cool?

           She nods, he walks away.  And then A WALL OF SENIOR GIRLS 
           appears in front of her.  They PART, revealing Monica.  

                                 MONICA
                        So you’re the lip gloss.  

                                 SIMONE
                        Monica.  I swear I didn’t know Tommy 
                        had a girlfriend when we went out, 
                        please, you have to believe me --  

                                 MONICA
                        I do.  

                                 SIMONE
                        I -- You do?  Really?

                                 MONICA
                        Tommy can be very convincing.  It’s 
                        part of his charm.  It’s part of why I 
                        was with him for so long.  Plus life’s 
                        a lot easier when you’re Tommy Barso’s 
                        girlfriend.  But you know that.    

                                 SIMONE
                        I wouldn’t say I’m his girlfriend.

                                 MONICA
                        It doesn’t matter what you say.  Or 
                        who you are, or what you want.  You’re  
                        That Girl now.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MONICA (CONT'D)
                        You don’t even have to think.  In 
                        fact, it’s probably better if you 
                        don’t.

                                 SIMONE
                        Look, I’m really sorry...

                                 MONICA
                        Sorry?  You did me a favor. Because 
                        right now, I’m walking out of here.  
                        And you’re tethered to that table like 
                        a Labradoodle.  I should thank you.  

           But she doesn’t quite go that far.  She just leaves.

           EXT. THE FAMILY BUGGY DINER -- NIGHT

           Rick pulls up on his motorcycle and sees 

           THE COLLEGE KIDS

           Hanging out by their cars.  Rick stops, looks at them.  And 
           we know what he’s going to do almost before he does --

                                 RICK
                        Hey, buddy.  I got your side of fries.

           And he SWINGS.  As a FIGHT breaks out, Rick is outnumbered.

           Rick’s MOM runs out as Rick gets a punch RIGHT IN HIS GUT.  
           He’s not gonna win this fight.  But he’s not gonna go down, 
           either.  Sandra gets into the fray, pulls the boys apart.  

           Rick doubles over, SPITS onto the cement, catching his 
           breath.  Amidst the action, we find PAULY, looking scared.  
           He spies THE CANDY NECKLACE, abandoned on the cement. 

           As the adrenaline subsides, Rick looks up and locks eyes with 
           Pauly.  Pauly’s confusion and fear is too much for Rick to 
           handle... He looks away as Sandra leads him into the diner.

           INT. NOVA’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Nova walks into her room, drops her backpack.  Gutted.

           HER DRESS hangs like an apparition over the armoire.  Before 
           she can even process that, her eyes fall on --

           THE PROM POSTER on the wall over her bed.
           She RIPS IT off the wall, a SOB rising in her throat that she 
           can’t suppress.  She THROWS herself onto her bed, the ripped 
           pieces of the poster falling around her as she sobs...

                                                       GO TO BLACK.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS -- DAY

           The sun rises.  Sprinklers sputter to life.  Newspapers land 
           on porches.  It’s here.  The Big Day. 

           QUICK CUTS:  A DRESS is pulled from its plastic wrapping.  
           Shoes are shined.  An elaborate UP-DO is sculpted on a 
           teenage head.  PROM TICKETS are set on a table by a door.

           From an OVERHEAD SHOT, we follow a FLEET OF LIMOS down a 
           suburban street, each peeling off into a separate driveway.

           INT. NOVA’S ROOM -- DAY

           Nova stands before her mirror.  She wears her prom dress, 
           make up, the whole nine.  She’s beautiful.  And miserable.

           INT. JUSTIN’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Justin opens the door to the REFRIGERATOR, pulls out a pretty 
           CORSAGE in a clear plastic box.  DUMPS it in the garbage.

           INT. SIMONE’S ROOM -- DAY

           Simone puts on a final dab of lip gloss, trying not to look 
           as freaked out as she feels.  

           INT. MONICA’S ROOM -- DAY

           And here’s Monica.  She eyes a PICTURE of her and TOMMY stuck 
           to her mirror.  RIPS Tommy’s head out of it, leaving just 
           herself.  She smiles, satisfied.  Alone and proud.

           INT. LLOYD’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Lloyd adjusts his tie.  He is going to Prom.  But with whom?

           WIDEN to reveal TESS, beside him.  Dressed for prom, primping 
           in the SAME mirror.  He extends his arm, she takes it. 

           INT. NOVA’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Nova stands, alone, as Kitty poses her in the obligatory 
           picture-by-the-mantle pose.  Frank watches proudly.

                                 NOVA
                        Do we really have to do the picture-by-
                        the-fireplace thing?
                                 KITTY
                        You’ll want these memories one day.

                                 NOVA
                        I highly doubt that.

                                 FRANK
                        C’mon, it’s gonna be great.

                                 NOVA
                        Why?  Because the balloons are right?  
                        And the tablecloths match the napkins?  
                        Is that what prom is about?

                                 FRANK
                        Lots of people go to prom without dates.

           Kitty strokes Nova’s hair, tuned in to her heartbreak.

                                 KITTY
                        I think this is about someone in 
                        particular.  Isn’t it?

                                 NOVA
                        I was so stupid.  How could I think a 
                        guy like Rick could be happy with me?  
                        I have nothing to offer him.  

                                 FRANK
                        I think you’ve got that backwards, 
                        honey.  

                                 NOVA
                        That’s because you don’t know him.  

                                 FRANK
                        I know enough.

           Kitty and Nova both look Frank’s way, growing tense.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t gonna stand by and watch you 
                        waste your potential with some screw up.

                                 NOVA
                           (blanching)
                        What did you do?

                                 KITTY
                        Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        I had a talk with him.
                                 NOVA/KITTY
                        WHAT?!

                                 FRANK
                        That boy would’ve let you down sooner 
                        or later, Nova, and --

                                 NOVA
                        He would’ve let me down?  What about 
                        you?  

                                 FRANK
                        Nova, I --

                                 NOVA
                        Rick said you wouldn’t give him a 
                        chance, but you know what I said?  I 
                        said “you don’t know my dad.”  But I 
                        was wrong.  Turns out I don’t know my 
                        dad.  And maybe you don’t know me 
                        either.

           This one hits Frank hard.

                                 FRANK
                        All I’ve ever wanted is what’s best --

                                 NOVA
                        Best for who?  What do I have to do, 
                        Dad?  How many A’s do I have to get to 
                        get you to trust me to make my own 
                        choices?  

           Nova takes a breath, spent.  Frank turns to Kitty.

                                 KITTY
                           (softly)
                        She’s right, Frank.

           And that’s it.  Not only is he outnumbered, he’s outfought.  
           He looks back to his daughter, wheels spinning.

                                 FRANK
                        I can fix it.  I’ll go and --

                                 NOVA
                           (flatly)
                        You’ve done enough.  

           And with that, she heads out to her car.  Frank watches her 
           go, heartbroken.  He turns to Kitty.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not too late, if I just --
                                 KITTY
                        Frank, she’s gonna be okay. 

           She puts her arm around him as a new understanding of his 
           daughter descends on Frank.

           EXT. JUSTIN’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Justin opens the front door to see -- to his shock -- 
           Saeyoung.  Hair in a ponytail, wearing jeans. 

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        You’re right that I don’t want to go 
                        to prom.  But not because of you.  
                           (beat)
                        It’s because this is gonna end.

                                 JUSTIN
                        What is?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        You and me.  I don’t know when, or 
                        how.  But I know it will.  Sooner or 
                        later, it’ll all just fall apart. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        How can you say that?  Don’t you know 
                        how I feel about you?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        It doesn’t matter.

           She turns and SITS on the porch step, the most fragile we’ve 
           ever seen her.  Finally, the words she hasn’t said yet.

                                 SAEYOUNG (CONT’D)
                        They’re getting a divorce.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Who?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        My parents.

           Everything between them -- the confusion, the anger -- 
           vanishes, and he moves toward her, concerned.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        I guess I thought if I didn’t say 
                        anything, it wouldn’t be real.  It 
                        didn’t work.  
                                 JUSTIN
                        I can’t believe it.  Your parents, 
                        they’re...

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        The perfect couple.  High school 
                        sweethearts.  See what I’m saying?  

                                 JUSTIN
                        Wait a minute, so you think this means 
                        we’re doomed, too?  This is why you 
                        won’t go to prom?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Going with you is like saying I think 
                        everything’s gonna work out.  But I 
                        don’t know if I believe that now.

           He puts his arm around her.  What can you say?  A beat.

                                 JUSTIN
                        You know, nobody knows the future.   
                        But I do know how I feel about you. 

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What if that’s not enough?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Look at me.  Even if tonight is all we 
                        ever have?  It’s enough.  

           She looks at him, softening.  A safe harbor from the storm.

                                 SAEYOUNG
                           (finally)
                        Do you think...

                                 JUSTIN
                           (concerned)
                        What?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        ... Anyone would notice if I wore my 
                        homecoming dress?

           He smiles.

           INT. RICK’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Rick enters the kitchen, surprised to find Sandra there.  

                                 RICK
                        Don’t you need to leave for work?
                                 SANDRA
                        I called in sick.

                                 RICK
                        What?

                                 SANDRA
                        Sit down.  How’s your hand?

           ON HIS HAND: It’s banged up from the fight.  Rick sighs.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        You know the first time I met your 
                        father he had just been in a fight.

                                 RICK
                        Over what?

                                 SANDRA
                        Me, I think.  He was like a freight 
                        train.  Never hesitated, never cared 
                        what anybody thought.

                                 RICK
                        That was probably a good thing.

                                 SANDRA
                        There were people who didn’t think 
                        much of him.  Just like there are 
                        probably people who don’t think much 
                        of you.

           Rick doesn’t say anything.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        But I see you every day, taking Pauly 
                        to school, keeping this place from 
                        falling apart.  Doing things at 17 
                        that your father never could’ve done.  

                                 RICK
                        Where you going with this?

                                 SANDRA
                        It doesn’t matter what anybody else 
                        thinks of you, Ricky.  It matters what 
                        YOU think of you.  

                                 RICK
                        Yeah, well.  I’m not Dad.

                                 SANDRA
                        That’s what I’m trying to tell you -- 
                        you don’t need to be.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANDRA (CONT'D)
                        Let me worry about the grown up stuff 
                        around here.  You just worry about 
                        being a kid. And if you need any help 
                        with that...

           Reveal Pauly in the doorway.  He holds up the candy necklace.

                                 PAULY
                        It’s a little broken but I bet it 
                        still tastes good.

           INT. SIMONE’S ROOM -- DAY 

           Simone hears a TAPPING at her window.  She turns as -- A ROCK 
           FLIES THROUGH THE WINDOW, shattering glass.

                                 SIMONE
                        Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

                                 PHILIP (O.S.)
                        Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

           REVEAL PHILIP in the TREE across from her window.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!

                                 SIMONE
                        What are you doing???

                                 PHILIP
                        I thought it was double-paned!

                                 SIMONE
                        Why are you in the tree?

                                 PHILIP
                        Look, I realize this is like, the 
                        worst possible timing, but I have to 
                        tell you something.

                                 SIMONE
                        Philip, my date is gonna be here --

                                 PHILIP
                        Don’t go to prom.

           He is dead serious.  She stops in her tracks.  

                                 SIMONE
                        You’re not really asking me that.
                                 PHILIP
                        I love you, Simone.  As more than a 
                        friend.

                                 SIMONE
                        Love implies more than a friend.

                                 PHILIP
                           (pressing on)
                        Yes, yes it does.  And I’ve missed 
                        every chance to tell you until now 
                        because I was stupid and scared, but 
                        now I’m in this tree and you are so 
                        beautiful, and if you walk out that 
                        door I might as well stay up here 
                        forever, even though I hate heights 
                        and I’m pretty sure I ripped my pants.  
                        I love you, Simone.  Don’t go.

           She doesn’t say anything for a long beat.  FINALLY:

                                 SIMONE
                        Philip.  

                                 PHILIP
                        Simone...

           Just then, the LIMO pulls up into her driveway.  

           PHILIP’S POV: The Limo Driver opens the door, revealing --

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Tommy?  You’re going to prom with 
                        Tommy?

                                 SIMONE
                        I didn’t know how to tell you.

           He watches Tommy cruise up to the front door and ring the 
           bell, smoothing his hair, not a care in the world.

                                 SIMONE’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Simone?  Honey? 

                                 SIMONE
                           (calling)
                        I’ll be right there!
                           (then)
                        I’m sorry, Philip.  I wish things were 
                        different.

                                 PHILIP
                        I understand.  
                                 SIMONE
                        You do?

                                 PHILIP
                        It feels good to be bumped up to 
                        Varsity.  Even just for one night.

           This hits her hard.  She falters, then rushes out.  He hangs 
           there in the tree, totally unsure how to get down.

           INT. LAKE CANYON HIGH, GYMNASIUM -- PROM NIGHT

           Where the Enchanted Jungle is complete.  

           PHOTOGRAPHERS snap shots of couples at the entrance next to 
           an ACTUAL PARROT on a perch.  Nearby is a booth with a SIGN: 
           VOTE FOR YOUR PROM KING AND QUEEN!  And then, heads turn as --

           SIMONE and TOMMY enter, the Brangelina of high school. Tommy 
           gets absorbed into the throng of his buddies.  Simone is 
           pushed against a JUNGLE BACKDROP, basically camouflaged.

           BACK AT THE ENTRANCE

           The Queen arrives.  Heads turns as MONICA walks in -- 
           beautiful, proud, and most of all, HAPPY to be there alone. 

           Some FACES looking at her at the entrance are clearly 
           perplexed.  We even hear the muted speculation:

                                 VARIOUS VOICES
                        Where’s her date?/She didn’t come 
                        alone, did she?

           Monica just lifts her chin and strides into the dance.  

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE GYM -- SAME

           Standing under the banner, Nova takes a deep breath --  

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

           -- and walks in amidst flashbulbs and squawking parrots. 
           Scans her glittery surroundings.  The JUNGLESCAPE is awesome.

                                 GABBY
                        You did it, Nova.  It’s perfect.

           Reveal Gabby at her side.  She smiles gently.  Nova nods. 

                                 NOVA
                        I guess it is.
           Suddenly SAEYOUNG emerges from the wilderness -- looking 
           pretty good for the last minute wardrobe change.  Urgently:

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Seriously, how could you not tell us?

                                 NOVA
                        Tell you what?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        That HE would be here.

                                 NOVA
                        Who?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Your prom date!

                                 NOVA
                        My what...?

           FROM BEHIND A LARGE FERN

           Two shiny, polished shoes step out.  TILT UP from the snazzy 
           shoes to neatly pressed tuxedo pants, a perfectly tied bow 
           tie... to the sweet, smiling face of -- 

                                 BRANDON 
                        Hi, Nova.

                                 NOVA
                        Brandon!  What are you doing here?

                                 BRANDON
                        My interview was this morning.  I was 
                        able to get back in time!  

           She just blinks at him, overwhelmed and disoriented.  He 
           doesn’t really seem to notice, just prattles on...

                                 BRANDON (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this great?  I mean, everything 
                        worked out!  You’re here, I’m here...

                                 NOVA
                        It’s 100% mutually beneficial.

                                 BRANDON
                        This place looks great.  You did it. 

                                 NOVA
                        Yeah.  I guess I did.  
           INT. GARY’S HOUSE -- PROM NIGHT

           Gary opens the door to a ragged-looking, contrite PHILIP. 

                                 PHILIP
                        The first mistake I made was thinking 
                        Tommy was my friend. 

                                 GARY
                        You hung out with him...  

                                 PHILIP
                        I got invited to a barbecue.  One 
                        barbecue.  What’s that mean?  That all 
                        of a sudden I’m not Philip anymore?  
                        Suddenly I’m Tommy Barso’s best 
                        friend?  I was kidding myself.  And my 
                        second mistake was believing Simone 
                        liked me.

                                 GARY
                        She was into you. 

                                 PHILIP
                        She wanted to study with me.  Because 
                        that’s who I am, the guy you study 
                        with.  Tommy’s the guy you go out 
                        with.  Which is why we’re here, and 
                        they’re at Prom.  But the biggest 
                        mistake...

           He holds up the two STICK HIPPO tickets.  This is about the 
           time we realize he’s also wearing HIS Stick Hippo T-shirt.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Was getting so caught up in everything 
                        I wanted to be, that I forgot who I 
                        actually am.  I’m sorry, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        One second.

           Gary DISAPPEARS in a flash.  A beat.  Another beat.  Then:

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                           (from inside)
                        Mom!  Let’s GO!

           Gary reemerges -- Wearing a GIANT HIPPO HEAD.  He smiles at 
           Philip from behind the large, strange fan gear.  

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                           (re: the hippo head)
                        Think I can get ‘em to autograph it?
           Off Gary and Philip, grinning...

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT 

           Find Lloyd, standing with Tess, who bursts with excitement.

                                 TESS
                        This.  Is.  Awesome.

                                 LLOYD
                           (nods toward dance floor)
                        Go.  Have fun.

                                 TESS
                        Really?  You sure?

                                 LLOYD
                        Yes.  Go.  Enjoy your youth.  

           She beelines for -- 

           THE DANCE FLOOR 

           -- Saeyoung and Justin.  He lifts her, spins her around.

           -- KRANTON do their own conga.

           -- Nova dancing with Brandon, a million miles away.

           WITH GABBY and HER DATE

           Gabby notices Rolo, standing by himself in his tuxedo. Gabby 
           suddenly looks sad. She leans over to her DATE.

                                 GABBY
                           (to her date)
                        I’ll be right back.  I have to make a 
                        charitable donation.

           She walks up to Rolo, holds out her hand.

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Rolo.  Let’s go.

                                 ROLO
                        Where?

                                 GABBY
                        Dance floor.  You and me.  Come on.

                                 ROLO
                        Athena’s just running late.
                                 GABBY
                        I’m sure she is.  In the meantime, 
                        what do you say?  One dance.

                                 ROLO
                        She’s gonna be here any minute.

           He walks away, leaving Gabby there, incredulous.

           NEAR THE PUNCH BOWL

           Simone stands alone as two SENIOR GIRLS stand nearby, 
           watching the dateless Monica dance with friends.

                                 SENIOR GIRL
                        I can’t believe she dumped Tommy and 
                        came alone.

                                 SENIOR GIRL 2
                        I know... It’s awesome.

           They move off while Simone processes this.  Tommy rushes up.

                                 TOMMY
                        Where’ve you been?  They’re about to 
                        announce King and Queen.

                                 SIMONE
                        You didn’t break up with Monica to be 
                        with me, did you?  She dumped you.

                                 TOMMY
                        Well, yeah, technically. 

                                 SIMONE
                        So it has nothing to do with me.

                                 TOMMY
                        Of course it does.  I mean, I’m free!  
                        Finally, after all these years, I’m 
                        free to do whatever I want!  I wanted 
                        to get out so badly -- 

                                 SIMONE
                        You’d even use a sophomore to do it.  

           He halts, blinking, as she levels this accusation.

           UP ON THE STAGE

           Saeyoung takes the microphone, flanked by Nova and Gabby.
                                 SAEYOUNG 
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention 
                        please?  We have tallied the votes and 
                        are proud to announce Lake Canyon’s 
                        new PROM KING... TOMMY BARSO!

           CHEERS -- Tommy weaves his way through the high-fives and 
           back-slaps toward the stage.  As he takes his crown --

                                 SAEYOUNG (CONT’D)
                        And what’s a king without a queen?  In 
                        a landslide win... MONICA LOWRY!

           Monica hugs her friends, triumphant.  Walks up to the stage 
           and, without so much as a glance to Tommy, accepts her crown.

                                 SAEYOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Please make room for the Queen and 
                        King’s official dance.  One sec...

           Monica speaks hastily into Saeyoung’s ear.

                                 SAEYOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Um, at the request of the 
                        queen, she will be sitting this dance 
                        out.  So it’ll just be the King’s 
                        dance.  By order of the Queen!

           A SPOTLIGHT finds Tommy, who shrugs, makes his way to the 
           dance floor, and SIMONE, who lingers at the spotlight’s edge.

                                 TOMMY
                        Madame?

           Tommy reaches his hand out, crown glittering.  Faltering, 
           Simone blinks at him, and then STEPS BACK.  

                                 SIMONE
                        I can’t.

                                 TOMMY
                        What?  Sure you can.  Come on.

                                 SIMONE
                        Sorry, Tommy.  It was fun being your 
                        escape hatch, but I don’t belong here.  

           To the shock of all, Simone walks away, leaving Tommy alone.  
           The DJ looks at Saeyoung like “What do I do?”

                                 TOMMY
                           (trying to play it cool)
                        Alright, cool.  Call ya later, then.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOMMY (CONT'D)
                           (to the stunned crowd) 
                        Who wants to dance with the King?!

           Yeah.  No one.  Tommy turns to Monica.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Monica.  What do you say?  You’re 
                        here... I’m here.
                           (pointedly)
                        Everyone’s watching?

                                 MONICA
                        Please.

           She walks away from him.  Finally the DJ starts up some 
           music, people begin to fill in the cleared area.

           Tommy is sort of SQUEEZED off to the side.  He stands there, 
           crown glittering, and totally irrelevant.   

           MONICA walks away from the dance floor, and almost RUNS 
           DIRECTLY INTO -- 

           LLOYD.  They lock eyes.  TIME SLOWS DOWN.  MUSIC SWELLS.  
           Could it be...?

           A PAUSE as the possibility sinks in for each of them.  Then:

                                 LLOYD
                        Meh.

           He shrugs, moves off.  She’s not his type.

           As kids fill in the dance floor and the party resumes, 
           Gabby’s eyes drift toward FLASHBULBS going off for --

                                 GABBY
                        Oh.  My.  God.

           AT THE ENTRANCE

           Rolo.  And on his arm, ladies and gentlemen -- ATHENA (17). 
           In the dress Heidi Klum couldn’t pull off. She’s flawless, a 
           supreme being of beauty.  The hottest Greek Canadian you’ve 
           ever laid eyes on...

           As she and Rolo BLOW BY Gabby in SLOW MOTION --

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        Nice dress.

           BACK ON STAGE
           Nova and Saeyoung gather up the ballot box.  Suddenly, Nova 
           HALTS.  Tilts her head at the sound -- ever so faint -- of a 
           MOTORCYCLE ENGINE.  It gets LOUDER.  Nova’s heart races.

                                 NOVA
                        Do you hear that?

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        What?

                                 NOVA
                        Nothing, never mind.  Listen, would 
                        you mind handling things from here?  

                                 SAEYOUNG
                        Are you okay?

                                 NOVA
                        I just... I think I’m Prommed out.

           Nova heads off the stage.  Walks past COUPLE AFTER COUPLE, 
           dreams coming true all around her.  Gabby CUTS her off.

                                 GABBY
                        You can’t go now.

                                 NOVA
                        Why not?

                                 GABBY
                        The fountain.  It just stopped 
                        working.

           Nova turns -- sure enough, there it sits, silent.  

                                 NOVA
                        I don’t care.  You guys can figure it 
                        out.  Or, just leave it off.  

           Leaving Gabby stunned, she heads to the ENTRANCE, where she 
           looks out at -- 

           THE PARKING LOT

           Where a limo pulls away.  As it does, it reveals the NO 
           PARKING ZONE.  And the Ducati parked there.

           Nova STOPS dead.  STAY on her face, as

           BEHIND HER

           The fountain comes to life.  HEAR the water begin to cascade, 
           the lights glittering up through the water, the dry ice fog 
           curling around the dance floor... Nova spins around to see 
           RICK

           Step out from behind the fountain.  In the tuxedo, gorgeous.  
           Bad boy meets dream boat -- and staring right at Nova.

                                 RICK
                        Told you these motors were tricky.

                                 NOVA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 RICK
                        You’re right.  It is just one night.  
                        And I can’t let another minute of it 
                        go by without you.

                                 NOVA
                        You sure?

                                 RICK
                        Dance with me.

           Brandon elbows his way through the crowd.

                                 BRANDON
                        Wait just a minute, here.  Nova, is 
                        this guy bothering you?

           Rick turns to Brandon.  He takes one look at Rick, and one 
           look at Nova, and scrams.  A beat.  Finally:

                                 NOVA
                        Nice tux.

                                 RICK
                        You like it?

                                 NOVA
                        I thought you’d never wear that sweaty 
                        symbol of conformity?

                                 RICK
                        I thought about that.  But then I 
                        realized; I kind of rock this look.

           He SPINS her onto the floor as she laughs, lighting up.  As 
           we CIRCLE them in their moment together....

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- PROM NIGHT

           PHILIP AND GARY burst out of the club where the concert was, 
           elated, overjoyed.  Looks like Gary even got his autograph!
                                 GARY
                        Amazing.  That version of Star 
                        Craving?  

                                 PHILIP
                        The best!

           They head toward the car, when suddenly Philip looks 

           ACROSS THE PARKING LOT 

           And sees SIMONE.  In her prom dress, looking beautiful... The 
           girl of Philip’s dreams.  She waves.  He smiles.  Big time.

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

           By the waterfall, Rick takes something out of his pocket.

                                 NOVA (V.O.)
                        At prom, every couple has a story.

                        And the thing is, you don’t know how 
                        it’s gonna end until you actually get 
                        there.

           FIND ROLO and ATHENA, having their picture taken.

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Okay, some you might be able to guess.

           Find SAEYOUNG AND JUSTIN.  Dancing close.  Okay for tonight.

                                 NOVA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But most of them are mysteries.

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

           Simone and Philip sway to MUSIC.  DOLLY OVER to the source -- 

           GARY’S CAR

           Where Gary looks on with a grin, hippo head in his lap.  
           Continue DOLLYING to -- of course...

                                 GARY’S MOM
                        So romantic.

           Gary looks over at her.  What can he say?  It is.

                                 NOVA (V.O.)
                        Surprises.
           INT. GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

           FIND MONICA, single and loving it with her FRIENDS.  Among 
           them:  Tess.  Having the night of her life.  She catches 
           Lloyd’s eye at the side of the dance floor.  Waves.

           Lloyd waves back.  He plops down next to a familiar face...

                                 NOVA (V.O.)
                        That’s part of the magic, I think.

           It’s our Disheveled Girl from the opening!  She cleans up 
           nice... and she’s watched his exchange with Tess.

                                 DISHEVELED GIRL
                        You brought your sister to prom?

                                 LLOYD
                        Yeah... it’s... I can explain --

                                 DISHEVELED GIRL
                        I think that is so... sweet.

           A smile slowly spreads across Lloyd’s face.  

                                 NOVA (V.O.)
                        And of all those stories, the most 
                        magical one... is mine.

           BACK WITH RICK AND NOVA 

           On the dance floor.  The whole gym fades away as they lock 
           eyes, their lips just inches apart...  

                                 NOVA (CONT’D)
                        You’re about to kiss me.

                                 RICK
                        Yup.

           And he does.  And it’s perfect.

           As the metallic flecks of the disco ball encircle the gym, we 
           drift away, awash in the magic...

                                                         FADE OUT.
