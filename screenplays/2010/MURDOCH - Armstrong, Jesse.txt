           EXT. NEW YORK. DAY. 

           New York shimmers in the morning light as we take in 
           Manhattan. We home in on an art deco block on 5th avenue.  

           INT. 5TH AVENUE APARTMENT. DAY.

           It’s early morning. The 3-floor, 20 room, 3 terrace apartment 
           is decorated in tasteful art deco style. Wooden floors, 
           expensive but not ostentatious furnishings.

           We see the dawn breaking through the big windows. In the 
           distance a little girl is talking to herself as she plays. 

           We can hear water running as we move past the marble work- 
           tops of the kitchen, where newspapers lie, through the 
           bedroom, where a woman sleeps, and into one of the two en-
           suite bathrooms. 

           There an old man is leaning over the basin pulling hair dye 
           through his hair, trying to keep it from dripping on himself. 

           This is Keith Rupert Murdoch (KRM). 78-years old and with a 
           bit of stiffness in his back. He mutters to himself as dye 
           runs down his neck. 

                                 KRM
                        Oh Fuck. Shit. Fuck it.

           He takes another towel from the stock of thick white ones 
           near the double sinks and wipes his neck, tossing the dirty 
           towel into the bath tub where several others lie. 

           Finally, satisfied with the dying procedure, he rubs his hair 
           dry with another towel, and sends that also into the bath. 
           Then, with a flannel he tries to wash away the finger marks 
           of dye that have sullied the sink. It’s messy, annoying work. 
           Satisfied, he puts the lid back on the dye, then to his 
           annoyance re-dirties the sink with the residue from the 
           bottle. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Oh for fuck’s sake. 

           He wipes it down carefully like a criminal attending to 
           leaving no forensic evidence behind,  and then crosses to the 
           bath where he turns on the taps full and gives the dirty 
           towels and flannels a swish around in the water - leaving 
           them to soak. 

           KRM walks through the apartment leaving wet footprints as he 
           goes. 
           He heads to the kitchen. Looks through the papers. Ripping 
           the pages over with a professional brutality. Today's New 
           York Daily Post, WSJ, New York Times. 

           He checks his watch makes a call, punching out the number 
           from a piece of paper. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Murdoch here. Yeah I was told by 
                        Doctor Benson I could get to you on 
                        this number?

           He looks around the room. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah that’s right, yeah, sure I 
                        don’t need the soft soap. Yeah he 
                        talked to me about counselling and 
                        whatnot. But we agreed a special 
                        arrangement. So what’s the result? 
                           (he listens)
                        ‘Balign?’
                           (listens impassive)
                        Right, say that again? Benign or 
                        Malign? Can you speak up. 

           He’s getting a very important piece of news but as we look at 
           his face in close up it is hard to clock exactly what it is. 
           Is it bad and he’s being stoical, or it good and he’s very 
           restrained?

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Uh-hu. Okay. And what’s the time 
                        frame on that process? Okay. Yeah 
                        will do, I’ll call the doc and hook 
                        that up. Okay. Thanks. Thank you 
                        very much.  

           He puts the phone down. Looks at the city out the window. 
           Then he looks down. 

           Faxed front pages of the Times and Sun and londonpaper and a 
           layout for tomorrow's Australian. He looks up to check out 
           Fox News playing on a TV with the sound down. 

           He makes a call. Hardly looking at the phone and punching the 
           number without looking it up anywhere. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Jim. I’ve seen your paper 
                        Jim. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                           (beat of silence - he 
                            enjoys the pain he is 
                            dealing out)
                        I’ve seen the pages.  

           Then He hangs up. 

           Looks at more pages. Dials another number - connects.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Mike. Are you losing it? 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. UK BROADSHEET NEWSROOM. DAY. 

           Michael Rowle, 50, thin and anxious, editor of an unnamed 
           Murdoch Sunday Broadsheet is on the phone. We cut between the 
           two of them.  

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Hello?

                                 KRM
                        Are you losing it. Have you lost 
                        it?

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        How do you mean Rupert?

                                 KRM
                        Do you look at the circulation 
                        numbers Mike? You know, how many of 
                        my papers you’re selling? 

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Yes. 

                                 KRM
                           (he leaves a long beat, 
                            turns a page, waits)

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Hello? 

                                 KRM
                        Hello.

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                           (long beat, then)
                        Sorry?
                                 KRM
                        Yeah. So is it going up or down how 
                        many papers you’re selling? 

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Well if you mean, I mean - year on 
                        year or - I mean month against  - 
                        because, I forget but on the month - 
                        not this month but last month 
                        compared to the previous year’s 
                        month that was actually ... 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah and if you compare a 
                        strawberry to an onion it’s much 
                        fucking sweeter. 

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Yes well, I mean, you know the 
                        strategy ...

                                 KRM
                        Uh-hu.

           And Rupert puts the phone down. Leaving Michael spinning.

           We spot Rupert’s daughter, Chloe, six years old is there. Who 
           knows for how long she’s been listening? She offers KRM an 
           envelope. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        What’s that honey? 

           He opens it. It's a birthday card. Drawn in felt-tip pens.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Look at that. Thanks. Thanks 
                        sweetheart. 

           He bends, with a little difficulty, to kiss her forehead. 
           Grace, his eight year old, is there too now smiling.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks girls, thank you. 

           A nanny appears, Lily.  

                                 LILY
                           (in Mandarin, with 
                            subtitles)
                        Okay, away now, leave your daddy, 
                        leave him to work. 
           They start to shuffle off. 

                                 KRM
                        No - girls, it’s fine, jump up 
                        here. C’mon. 

           He lifts Chloe up on to one of the high stools - it used to 
           be easy, but she’s heavier, he’s older, he finds it hard. 
           Grace jumps up. 

           Lily gets them juice as Rupert sorts through a bunch of cards 
           that are laid out for him. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Look at this - See I’ll put them 
                        into four piles. 
                           (with a twinkle)
                        Family first.
                           (shuffles a few cards)
                        Presidents. 
                           (lays out another pile)
                        Kings and Queens and all that sort 
                        of nonsense.
                           (then another pile)
                        Then all these other jokers ...

           The girls laugh. Grace is looking at the front page the New 
           York Times. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with that? Eh?

           Grace doesn’t know. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Too long. Blah blah blah blah. Bit 
                        of stuff 
                           (the story carries on 
                            inside)
                        - now go inside for the rest? No 
                        thanks. I’m having my breakfast! 
                           (he points to another 
                            front page story)
                        Now this has great pictures. So 
                        give it a page. It’s dying for a 
                        page. 

           Wendi Deng, Rupert’s 39 year old wife is there too now.  

           She approaches Chloe who at the other end of the breakfast 
           bar, is staring at the bare-breasted woman on page three of 
           the Sun. Wendi closes the paper. 
                                 WENDI
                           (in Mandarin)
                        Okay, come on, goodbye to bad 
                        rubbish. Run and get your book. 

                                 KRM
                        What?

                                 WENDI
                        I was just saying to get her book. 
                           (to Lily in Mandarin)
                        I don’t want her looking at all 
                        this, alright?

                                 LILY
                           (in Mandarin)
                        I was cutting fruit. 

                                 KRM
                        What? 

                                 CHLOE
                           (in Mandarin)
                        I don’t want fruit, we already had 
                        fruit. 

                                 WEDNI
                        You need fruit. Not just bagel. 
                        More fruit. And let’s have this 
                        rubbish away.  

           Wendi picks up the Sun. Folds it and puts it on the side. 

                                 KRM
                        What. What’s going on? 

                                 WEDNI
                        Nothing, we’re talking about fruit, 
                        okay? Now. Happy Birthday darling. 
                        C’mon. Let’s go back to bed. Little 
                        lie-in okay? 

           Rupert checks the watch. He is a little reluctant. 

                                                             CUT TO: 

           INT. MURDOCH APARTMENT - BEDROOM. DAY. 

           Wendi and Rupert are lying post-coital in their big, big bed. 
           Murdoch is breathing slowly and steadily, with some 
           concentration. 
                                 WENDI
                        You okay, honey? 

                                 KRM
                        Course I’m okay. I’m good.  

                                 WENDI
                        Listen, I want to tell you, for 
                        later, I’ve arranged a surprise. 

                                 KRM
                        A surprise? 

                                 WENDI
                        Yeah - Lachlan, Liz, James, 
                        Prudence, they’re flying in for a 
                        surprise party.

                                 KRM
                        What? 

                                 WENDI
                        I thought you’d want to know. I 
                        didn’t want it to be too 
                        surprising. You don’t like 
                        surprises. 

                                 KRM
                        But - this is still a surprise. You 
                        haven’t eliminated the element of 
                        surprise, honey, you’ve just moved 
                        it earlier. 

           Wendi gives him a kiss, she rubs his belly under the sheets, 
           kisses him again.

                        I’m doing pretty good here Wendi, 
                        but I’m not Superman. 
                           (then)
                        Look. I might talk to the kids. 
                        Today. 

                                 WENDI
                        Today? Good. Why? Did you speak to 
                        the hospital?

                                 KRM
                        Yeah?

                                 WENDI
                        And? 
           Rupert delays a beat. Is he hesitating? Is he telling the 
           truth? 

                                 KRM
                        All good.

                                 WENDI
                        All good? 

                                 KRM
                        All good. 

                                 WENDI
                        Oh that’s great. That’s just great 
                        that’s excellent! 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah. So. That’s good. 

                                 WENDI
                        Right, so do you want me to handle 
                        telling people? 

                                 KRM
                        No need for nothing honey. Nothing. 
                        Alright. Nothing’s changed. No 
                        press release no drama. I don’t 
                        need any celebration. 

                                 WENDI
                        Why not Rupert? 

                                 KRM
                        Look I’ve got 10 to 20 billion of 
                        market cap riding on the good 
                        health of a little walnut hiding 
                        away up my shitter. I don’t want to 
                        put too much pressure on it okay? 

                                 WENDI
                        Sure? 

                                 KRM
                        Sure. Any news about my health, 
                        that’s a stock price roller 
                        coaster. No one knows anything was 
                        up, let’s leave it like that? 

           Wendi looks at him. Is he being totally straight? She kisses 
           him. She fiddles under the sheets.

                        Good, I’m all good. Before the 
                        party, I thought I might swing by 
                        the old place. 

                                 SARAH

                        It’s fine. It’s like water off a

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sure.

                        I’m just going to roll in there. 
                        Have a poke about.
                           (he glances at the screen)
                        Ouch. Oh wow. Calgen’s down again. 
                        I knew it. I knew that was going to 
                        happen. We should have sold. Wasn’t 
                        I saying before we should sell? 

                                 SARAH
                        Uh-hu. Yeah, although you decided 
                        in the end? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I know, in the end I thought best

                        Gut said sell. Why didn’t I sell?

                        I don’t even know, that’s what’s 
                        funny! I hadn’t even thought till 
                        you asked that. Can you imagine 
                        that - when I was - big fucking

                        But I’m so easy about that now. I 
                        don’t even track that shit. 

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, it’s cool how you don’t need 
                        to track it.

                        Yeah he just called? Did he call 
                        you? 
                           (listens)
                        Have you got any clue what he’s

                           (listens)
                        Did Gary tell Cal that or was that

                        figures laid out so if Rupert calls 
                        again I’ve got it there. That

                                 JO 
                        Which number?

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        The good number. The good 
                        circulation number. I just need to 
                        be able to go - blam! - 12 per 
                        cent! Or 17 per cent! 20 percent! 
                        Whatever that good number was. 

                                 JO
                        I don’t think we have a number that 
                        good? I think they said like 4 or 
                        something for something?

                        actually think it could be a hot

                        You’re a rockstar.

                        Great. Good. It looks kind of 
                        snazzy though. You know? I don’t 
                        want to be trying to sell him 
                        anything? It’s more like, ‘hey old 
                        man, you want to miss out on 
                        Chinese Facebook?’ 

                                 JAMES’S ASSISTANT
                        Uh-hu. Plus, strategically, the co-
                        venture with a provincial 
                        Government. That’s sexy.

                           (considers)
                        It sounds kind of bullshitty 
                        doesn’t it? Provincial ... 
                           (makes it sound pathetic)
                        One ‘Chinese Province’?

                        Germany and Australia put together? 

                                 JAMES
                        Make me a note of that. Pen that 
                        shit up for me. Just pen that shit

                           (winces)

                                 JAMES
                        Where you at? Are you flying in? 
                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        On my way. On the Learjet. Chinese

                                 JAMES
                        Ready to back me up on this pitch, 
                        bitch?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Right, don’t want to bamboozle the

                        I can’t believe I mean I really 
                        can’t believe he’s hesitating on 
                        this. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know, I know. I guess he has his 
                        doubts.  

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Yeah, sure. But do you think he’d 
                        be flip-flopping if this was a 
                        paper he was buying?

                           (he laughs indulgently)

           EXT. CAR/6TH AVENUE. DAY.

           Claire, 24, a young journalist is getting a ride into work 
           with Iain, a guy she knows from journalism school. 

           They are both anxiously looking at the numbers on the office 
           buildings on 6th avenue as cars honk at their slow progress. 
           Claire leans out straining to check their progress up the 
           street. 

                                 IAIN
                        Okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hu-hu. I think ... I can’t believe 
                        I didn’t Google this?
                           (looking)
                        Are you sure? We didn’t go past?

                                 IAIN
                        No. I think .. Okay, here we go ... 
                        Nearly 1211... Yup.

           They pull up outside a 60’s/70’s skyscraper office building.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay. Great. Well, thanks for the 
                        ride. 

                                 IAIN
                        Okay. And
                           (with what he hopes is

                        Ouch. Shit. Sorry. Bit creepy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fine, it was - nice. 

                                 IAIN
                        It was ‘nice’? Oh God, kill me now.

                                 IAIN
                        I’m sorry - if I - you know, a 
                        little too early? I was very 
                        excited. You’re an exciting woman.

                        I’ll call you. I need to get in. 

                                 IAIN
                        And you’ll be okay? Fox will rape 
                        your ideals and dreams, you do 
                        realize that? They’re dream 
                        rapists. They’re putting that on a 
                        banner ad.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey well, I’m not Noam Chomsky, I 
                        think I’ll be okay. 
                           (she gets her stuff 
                            together)
                        Well, thanks.

           He goes in for a kiss of farewell as she goes to open the car 
           door. It’s a mismatch. Then she goes back to kiss him as he 
           withdraws. They fumble a kiss and hand-shake. He watches her 
           go in. She is all about the day ahead, doesn’t look back.

                        140? 

           They travel in silence. But Matthew likes stirring things up.

                        I heard about this Chinese

                        Obviously I’m cool with it. I think 
                        it’s a James thing. It’s fine.  

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah. Be good to see him. Looking 
                        forward to it. Me and the old man.

                        Nothing! We’re cool now. He’s

                           (she looks at him)

                        Because nothing at all is wrong

                           (beat, then playfully)
                        With the obvious exception of 
                        everything he stands for. 

           Liz Looks at him. That’s a bit much. But she knows he’s being 
           playful. 

                                 MATTHEW (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding. Obviously I’m kidding. 
                           (then)
                        It’s got to be close though. Soon 
                        he’ll be able to stop building. I 
                        mean when is the company going to 
                        be finished?

           Liz smiles, then.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think Mum thought if she 
                        commissioned enough statues and 
                        bought enough houses and chairs and 
                        sofas he might eventually sit down 
                        on one and stop. But he’s never 
                        going to stop. He thinks if the

                        a slot.

           Clare is heading into the building. At the same time James 
           Murdoch is getting out of his limo. James marches in to the 
           building, just ahead of Clare. Holds the door for her. He 
           gets guided through to an open lift, heads off to the heights 
           of the building. 

           Clare stands, confused in the atrium, looking around at the

           INT. KRM’S CAR. DAY.

           KRM’s in his chauffeured car - heading through the New York 
           Streets towards the News Corp building. He’s talking to an 
           assistant, mid 30s. 

                                 KRM
                           (bit weary)
                        So, listen I looked at the numbers, 
                        but what’s the protein on this 
                        Chinese Facebook bollocks? What’s 
                        the buzz? 

                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                        Apparently there was a Beijing 
                        political reaction to the idea of 
                        being involved. You know - that 
                        you’re a ‘right-winger’. 

                                 KRM
                        We made their fucking website! The 
                        People's Daily website. We gave 
                        them Sky’s encryption and what did 
                        I get? I'm a right-winger? 

                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                        Uh-hu. 

                                 KRM
                        Do you want to go back scream that 
                        in their ears that they fucked me 
                        fair and square?

                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                        We could make a subtle - mention of 
                                 KRM
                        No nah. I’m a pretty hairy fucker 
                        but you don’t screw with China. 

           KRM laughs. His assistant chuckles.

           They zoom through the traffic. KRM looks at the papers. 
           Putting the prospective deal together in his head.

           KRM is at a desk, on a call. 

           James enters, he too is on a call. Rupert stands, they hug 
           one another, while both staying on the line.  

                                                        JAMES
                                            Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

           That’s all bad. None of that 
           is good, okay? Yeah? You 
           understand, all of that is 
           not good. 

           They end their calls. 

                                 KRM
                        Hey, how are you doing son?

                                 JAMES

                                 MURDOCH
                        What already? You’ve been here one 
                        minute and already you want me to 
                        throw my money at something? 

                                 JAMES
                        Chinese Facebook dude, its hot. It

                                 MURDOCH
                        Yeah yeah. I’ve seen plenty of 
                        Chinese Facebook sites. Problem is - 
                        they all look the same. 

                                 JAMES
                        Did you look at the numbers?

                                 MURDOCH
                        Yeah I looked at the numbers.
                                 JAMES
                        Exciting. Today’s the day to pounce 
                        right? 

                                 MURDOCH
                        Look. Do you really want to get 
                        into this right away? 
                           (James does)
                        What about this line?
                           (pointing to a line in a 
                            bundle of printed out 
                            spreadsheets)
                        And this line is flakey when you 
                        examine it. And this line is just - 
                        I mean who do they think I am? 
                        Uncle Cunt? Where does this go? 

                                 JAMES
                           (looking too)
                        That? Is that even - that’s a 
                        projection that ... is that ... 
                        that’s okay isn’t it? 
                           (then)
                        Look Dad, you can interogate the 
                        figures lots of ways but I mean, if 
                        it feels right, do it, yeah?

                        But Dad man it’s got to be today. 
                        It can be slid through on the down-
                        low today. We won’t crow about it,

                                 MURDOCH
                        Sure, and it’s all very nice. Till 
                        the shit starts to fly.

                        This is right. You know when 
                        sometimes you just feel it?

                                 MURDOCH
                        Yeah I’ve felt it a lot of times. 
                        About half the time I was right. 
                           (picks up phone)
                        And Wendi, can you get Wendi for 
                        me?

                        Guh.
                           (beat to James)
                        I think Wendi’s input might be 
                        valuable.

                                 JAMES

           Lachlan is walking into the same lobby we saw James walk 
           through. He heads over to a lift in the far corner James used 
           (his assistant carried his swipe card.) 

           He hits a button but a security guy heads over to intercept 
           him.

                                 SECURITY GUY

                        I can call up - who are you here to 
                        see?

                        Well it is necessary.

           Another functionary/receptionist has spotted the situation

                                              (picking up the next 
                                              phone)
                                            Senator, so what you hearing, 
                                            who’s saying what?
           Yeah, exactly, that’s all I 
           want, that would be cool. 
           Well, whenever, no drama, 
           just make it happen, yeah 
           dude? 

           The door opens Lachlan is there. He is speaking to an exec 
           who is out there.

                                 LACHLAN
                           (hanging at the door)
                        Great to see you man. Brilliant to 
                        catch up.  

           Lachlan comes in. 

                                 KRM
                        What kind of a fucking surprise 
                        party is this? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Hey Dad, love you man. 

                                 KRM
                        Love you Lachlan. What’s going on?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Just thought I’d pop in.

           James and Lachlan hug.
                                 JAMES
                        Cool. You pining after the old 
                        place? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Are you kidding? Nah man. Nah. I 
                        did my time. No, this is like - 
                        coming back here is - it’s I’m ... 
                        what’s the word?

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know?

                                 LACHLAN
                        I’m nonchalant. I’m just - 
                        nonchalant dude. I’m just sitting 
                        here peering in at the hamster 
                        hutch. 

           KRM and James choose to accept this gloss.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                           (re the papers)
                        So, what’s happening? 

                                 KRM
                        Oh just looking at some figures. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Uh-hu, what? 

           James and Rupert look at one another.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, what, commercially sensitive, 
                        from me? Are you shitting me?

           There’s a brief beat.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck? You scared of 
                        getting corporately raided?

                                 JAMES

                                 LACHLAN
                        Oh dude, seriously? Nah. The 
                        internet’s over. 

                                 JAMES
                           (incredulous)
                        The internet is - over? 
                                 LACHLAN
                        It’s maturing. The gold rush is 
                        over. It’s a new paradigm. That’s 
                        my analysis. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. FOX NEWSROOM. DAY.

           Claire is with Sophia a producer they are in the quiet hive 
           of activity which is the Fox newsroom. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Okay - you’ll be over in that area. 
                           (motions vaguely)
                        Do you have a login?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Okay, it’s hard getting a login.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right, how do I ...?

                                 SOPHIA
                        I don’t have time to babysit a 
                        media studies grad Claire. Am I 
                        going to need to babysit? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        No. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Good. It’s hard okay. Ask around. 
                        Now, what I need is ...

           She waits.

                                 SOPHIA (CONT’D)
                        You might want to write this down?

           Claire grabs pen and paper.

                        them off by asking stupid 
                        questions. What’s a stupid 
                        question?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Give me an example of a dumb 
                        question you’re not going to ask?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh - uh, I guess, I don’t know, 
                        stuff, we already know, details we 
                        already have? 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Sure. That’s a basic stupid 
                        question. Plus I have a hole. I 
                        need someone tasty for 5.15 on 
                        BattleLines. I have a hole there. I 
                        need a piquant little pepper to go 
                        up against John Kendal on the 
                        environment there. A tree-hugger, 
                        an owl toucher. But one thing - 
                        spare me the boredom, yeah? When 
                        you tap up some contacts just think 
                        - ‘is this person boring?’ 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Of course.

                                 SOPHIA
                        As you speak to them, ask yourself, 
                        are you experiencing boredom? 
                        Because if you are, then - good 
                        luck to them but they’re not going 
                        on television. There’s enough pain 
                        in the world. All set? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Uh-hu? 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Any questions, just ask. Don’t free-
                        lance it. But I will be very hard 
                        to contact. 

           And she’s off. 

           Claire is left in her ‘area’. 
           She looks around. There are computer terminals and keyboards. 
           She hesitates. Goes to one - next to a harassed looking guy, 
           it looks free. He’s on the phone. 

                                 FOX JOURNALIST
                        Yeah I said to graphics ‘a pie 
                        chart with a flag on it’ and they 
                        go, ‘which flag?’ and I said, ‘take 
                        a flying fucking guess dipshit’.

           Claire motions - can I sit here? He looks at her, hand over 
           mouthpiece. 

                                 FOX JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
                        No. 

           He carries on his conversation. Claire backs off. Moves 
           around the corner to where there is a spare terminal. She 
           sits, hits a key. ‘Enter login name and password.’ She has 
           none. She hits another key. Nothing. 

           She looks around for help. There is none. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. NEWS CORP HQ. DAY.

           James and Lachlan are there, KRM is looking out of the 
           window, down far, far below to the huddle of journalists who 
           are smoking out at the back of the building. 

                                 KRM
                        Look at them. There they go. 
                        Killing themselves on my time. 

           Claire comes out of the doors and joins the huddle. Another 
           guy heads off across the street.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Now where's he going? Get a sarnie 
                        before you start mate! Guh.

           Murdoch’s assistant pops her head in. 

                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                        Hi. Alan wanted you to know the 
                        papers he’s been preparing for 
                        Wendi and you? They’re through for 
                        you to have a look over and sign 
                        off. 
                                 KRM
                        Tell him if they’re right I don’t 
                        need to look at them, if they’re 
                        not, he needs to look at them. 

                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                        And Peter and Kennedy and the rest 
                        are here. 

                                 KRM
                        Okay. Fine, send ‘em in. 

                                 JAMES
                           (to Lachlan)
                        Okay, well dude, this is it - we’re 
                        getting down to the nitty gritty.
                           (and it is therefore time 
                            for you to go)

                                 LACHLAN
                        Okay, well if you want my input?

           This hangs in the air. KRM pretends to be fascinated in a 
           newspaper headline. James looks at him.

                                 JAMES
                           (definitely not)
                        Yeah - that could be cool, but it 
                        might not be that cool. 

           Lachlan looks to his Dad. Is he going to trump his younger 
           brother? KRM, looks up, pretend to be oblivious.

                                 LACHLAN
                           (gives up on staying)
                        Okay, cool, Dad, I’ll surprise the 
                        shit out of you later?

                                 KRM
                        You’re going? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Love you Dad.

                                 KRM
                        Love you Lachlan. 

                                 LACHLAN
                           (he embraces James)
                        Love you dude.

                                 JAMES
                        Totally. 
           There’s an uncomfortable beat as a guy from legal, a guy from 
           finance and a banker arrive. They all know Lachlan.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Guys. I’m just ... Later guys. 

           Lachlan goes slowly, James watches, him smiling, friendly, 
           but waiting till he’s left and closed the door to start 
           speaking. 

                                 JAMES
                        So, I guess we know the business 
                        paradigm we envision in the short 
                        and medium and long term and the 
                        figures we might expect from a 
                        social networking site in an 
                        immature market it’s just a 
                        question of finalising our offer 
                        based on ...

                                 KRM
                        Look. I’m not sold on this 
                        whatsoever, but if we go. We offer 
                        75 bucks a share.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s a lot.

                                 KRM
                        That would be the bid. 

                                 JAMES
                        Because?

                                 KRM
                        If we go, you want the shareholders 
                        getting hard-ons the first time 
                        they hear our number. It’s got to 
                        be a sexy number. Once you've 
                        counted up how much you might be 
                        getting out the piggy bank- it's 
                        fucking hard to forget. 

                                 BANKER
                        And are you happy with the 
                        commercial environment?

                                 KRM
                        No.
                           (hits intercom)
                        Is Wendi still there? Can you get 
                        Wendi?
                                 MURDOCH’S ASSISTANT
                           (over intercom)
                        She’s in the bathroom. 

                                 KRM
                        We’ll wait.

           There is silence. They all look at one another for a few 
           beats. It’s uncomfortable. KRM clearly doesn’t mind silence 
           or discomfort. 

                                 JAMES
                           (to the guys)
                        Be interesting to get her take.

                                 BANKER
                        Absolutely.

                                 WENDI

                        Rupe? You got your strength back 
                        honey? 

           KRM doesn’t react. The three functionaries manage to keep 
           their faces still. 

                                 KRM
                           (didn’t totally hear)
                        What?
                           (then)
                        Wendi you’re on conference here.

                                 WENDI
                        Oh - hi?

                        Hi?/Hi Wendi/Hello.

                                 KRM
                        Just want your input Wendi. If we 
                        go for this deal, what’s your take 
                        on the situation - can we grow a 
                        business with a Chinese Regional 
                        Authority, is that a viable model, 
                        in your opinion? 

                                 WENDI
                        I think it’s a waste of money 
                        Rupert.

                                 KRM
                        Do you think? 
                                 WENDI
                        You gotta spend all this money and 
                        what do you get? 

                                 JAMES
                        Potential Wendi ... You get ...

                                 WENDI
                        Maybe but I don’t see it. I don’t 
                        think you’ll ever make your money 
                        back. I think you’ll lose some 
                        money on this. 

                                 JAMES
                        We were really asking for inside 
                        info on the Chinese system of ... 

                                 WENDI
                        I think you won’t make money, 
                        you’ll lose money. Okay?

                                 KRM
                        Thanks for that Wendi. Thanks 
                        honey. 

           The call is over.

                        She’s right you know? You suck up 
                        to these guys. How many copies of 
                        Deng Xiaoping’s fucking biog have 
                        we pulped? Half the cardboard boxes 
                        in China are made from that big 
                        bastard book. But what do you get? 

                                 JAMES
                        But the opportunities ... In the 
                        long run

                        Hi. Leo, just a heads up. There’s a 
                        hitch with the lead - if you can 
                        get something - soon, then there’s 
                        a slot - but obviously, it does 
                        need to be big. 

           Michael Rowle, the editor, is watching, Cassie needs to be 
           more precise, though she finds it distasteful.

                        I mean I wouldn’t say this if we 
                        both didn’t know that I’m not 
                        really saying it and I don’t mean 
                        it as it sounds, but if it is 
                        African dead, obviously there will 
                        need to be - it needs to reach a 
                        certain threshold for Michael to 
                        feel like it’s a story he can 
                        highlight.

                        what makes a newsworthy number. 
                        That would be horrible - to even 
                        try. So I’m not about to.

                        of these things if you could let us 
                        know if it’s going to be over a 
                        hundred or so, that would be 
                        something for us to think about?

           Prudence, KRM’s eldest child, 46, is there. She is playing 
           dolls with Chloe and Grace by the couch, as her husband 
           Alisdair looks at the papers. Elizabeth and Matthew Freud are 
           watching Prudence play - drinking orange juice. Lachlan is 
           pacing the room. His wife, Sarah, and James’ wife, Kathryn 
           Hufschmid are talking. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        And then this little girl says - 
                        ‘teacher I want to go to go 
                        outside!’ 

                                 CHLOE
                           (defiant, taking doll)
                        No. She doesn’t want to go outside. 

           Wendi arrives from fixing more drinks and overhears this 
           fragment of defiant sounding dialogue. 
                                 WENDI
                        Chloe - no! Don’t be rude, play 
                        nicely with your sister here. 

           Prudence, older than Wendi, takes this in. Just then James 
           arrives, breathless, he’s dashed ahead of Rupert. 

                                 JAMES
                        He’s on his way! Everyone!

                                 WENDI

                            side of the apartment)
                        Wouldn’t we be better obscured this 
                        side? Then we can all just step 
                        out?

           He has a point.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Or - behind the couches - that 
                        might be nice cos we could jump up? 

                                 WENDI
                        No I was just thinking ...

                           (the man of action)

                        The couches would be cool? 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        He’s coming.

                        Go for it.

           Wendi goes through a doorway to where she was planning. 
           Lachlan behind the sofa, James to his side of the room. The 
           others go to join them - Chloe and Grace with Wendi, Prudence 
           and Alistair too. Lachlan and Sarah, Liz and Matthew behind 
           sofas, James and Katherine to his side of the room.  
           KRM enters. He is playing a role, knows what is coming.

           Rupert seeks out Wendi’s eye. He's is carrying a package of

                        going on my 23rd birthday 
                        celebrations. And since you’re all 
                        here, can I just - ask all the 
                        adult children - 
                           (to Grace and Chloe)
                        I’ll fill you in later girls, it’s 
                        boring - to come to my study for 
                        five? 

           They all look at one another.

           Everyone is filling in. Matthew hovers, almost joins the 
           queue to enter but is subtly blocked by KRM. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        I thought? ... Shall I just?
                        Is this a biggie, ‘cos Liz would 
                        probably like me to ...?

                        Matthew, I don’t want to waste your 
                        time. 

           KRM’s not letting Matthew in. He being cut out of the action 
           but slides away. Rejoins Alisdair.  

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m just going to leave them to it. 
                        Keep my nose out that’s what I’ve 
                        learned.

           The kids chat to one another, something of a buzz. Rupert 
           closes the door, looks at some papers, sits on the corner of 
           a sofa as the kids joke.

                        Look - that was then. And the money 
                        was sorted and obviously, it’s all 
                        equal financially with Grace and 
                        Chloe. And everyone’s very happy 
                        and I don’t want to upset the apple 
                        cart cos, as Anna wanted, you’re 
                        all on the board with voting rights 
                        for News Corp and they’re not.  
                           (beat)
                        Well, that was a decent deal for us 
                        all then. But - things have 
                        changed? So I was thinking, I’d 
                        like to make a technical amendment 
                        so Chloe and Grace get voting 
                        rights, on the board. Okay?

           There is silence. 

                                 JAMES
                        When they’re adult?

                        Yeah.
                           (like it’s nothing)
                        Wendi naturally would take the 
                        votes till they’re 30.

           This sinks in.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We’d be on one vote each, right?

                        And Wendi would have two? And - if 
                        it wasn’t real clear who was in 
                        charge of the firm?

                        Wendi would have a lot of power? 

                                 JAMES
                        A fuck of a lot. Five of us. Her 
                        with two votes? She’d be the 
                        kingmaker Dad. She’d be picking the 
                        new you.

                                 KRM
                        Look. It’s what I want. It’s my 
                        company. I think it’s fair.

                        asking you to sign up now. 

                                 JAMES
                        When do you want us to sign? 

                                 KRM

                        So. I asked them.

                                 WENDI
                        Just like that?

           his arm. It’s clear situations like this don’t bump him, they 
           adrenalize him.

                                 WENDI

                        much. Isn’t it? Won’t they react? 
                                 KRM
                        Course they’ll react.

                        I thought you’d do it slowly. 

                                 KRM
                        I can handle it. This is just

                           (trying to be respectful)

                                 YOUNG MINER
                        I never got signed up. I was in 
                        Lusaka when the money guys came. I 
                        need to get paid up my friend? I 
                        need the hundred dollar hush-hush.

           Leo’s minder steps in. 

                                 MINDER
                        He just wants to make money. He’s a 
                        bad man. He’s well known as a bad 
                        man. He makes love to the chickens. 

                                 LEO
                        What?

                                 MINDER
                        I don’t know, but people say he 
                        makes love with chickens.  

           The minder guides them away, but Leo looks back.

           INT. RUPERT’S PRIVATE OFFICE. DAY

           The kids are still reeling. After a long beat. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        So. What do you think? What are we 
                        going to say? 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh right - you’re going to lead the 
                        response? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Dude, I’m just saying? We can’t sit 
                        here in fucking silence, I’m just 
                        intrigued to know what you all 
                        think. 

                                 JAMES
                        Look - let’s cut the crap. We all 
                        want to say no - why wouldn’t we 
                        want to say no? Only thing is - 
                        who’s scared of Daddy. Right? Well, 
                        fuck that shit. No. It’s a no.  

           James looks round.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Or shall I get Mum on the line? I 
                        mean, after what she did for us? 
                        The divorce. This is her deal. It’s 
                        a no, right? 

           Silence. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        It’s not that simple though is it? 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        It is his birthday. They are his 
                        kids? 

                                 JAMES
                        Nah. Look - he never worries what 
                        people think of him. That’s one of 
                        his super powers. He isn’t always 
                        thinking what will people think of 
                        me if I do X, if I shaft Y. Same 
                        should go for us. One question. Do 
                        you want this?  

           There’s silence. 
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Look. What would you say you were 
                        going to say if you weren’t going 
                        to be boxed in by that answer 
                        subsequently? If you didn’t have to 
                        actually say what you say you want 
                        to say, what would you say?

                                 LACHLAN
                        If I didn’t have to say what I was 
                        going to say but I could just say 
                        anything? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        This is classic. 

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He throws a hand grenade in, locks 
                        the door, and pisses off?
                        He wants to play happy families - 
                        but he also wants us to have a 
                        survival of the fittest Twister 
                        match. 

                                 JAMES
                        It’s a no right? Is anyone here not 
                        happy with a no?  Cos I think we 
                        need a joint position on this? 

                                 LACHLAN 
                        The head of the family speaks.

                                 JAMES
                        I was just fucking saying. 

                                 LACLAN
                        Sure whatever. 

                                 JAMES
                        ‘Sure whatever’. Fuck you. C’mon 
                        man we need to get on this. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Look - I don’t give a fuck James. 
                        I’m out of it all yeah? Sure I care 
                        about Mum, but the power play? The 
                        board? Who’s the right guy, person, 
                        to run the firm, if Wendi’s in 
                        there, it’s no big potatoes. 
                        Whatever. 
                                 JAMES
                        But you’re also cool with a no?

                                 LACHLAN
                        What-fucking-ever. 

                                 JAMES
                        Liz? Pru? Status quo? Shall we say 
                        no?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        You’re all against?

                                 ELIZABETH
                           (to James)
                        You’re going to tell him?

                                 JAMES
                        Sure I’ll tell him. I’ll tell him 
                        right now. We say no, yeah? 

           Liz wants to say no. Prudence doesn’t want to be isolated.

                                 ELIZABETH/PRUDENCE
                        Sure./Well okay.

                                 JAMES
                        Okay. Thank you. 

           James goes out.

                        Have you done Fox before Sharon? 
                        ... Okay well you’d be on against, 
                        not against, with, John Kendall at 

           Sharon is in the small book-lined office of her New York 
           apartment. We cut between them.

                        Oh, I’d be against John Kendall.

                        Yeah? Do you feel you could make 
                        some good points against him? 

           A colleague approaches Claire. She’s hot-desked into his 
           place. 

                                 SHARON GEORGSON
                        I would eviscerate the guy. He’s a

           All the while, Claire is trying to walk with a fixed phone 
           round the corner of the long desk, to find another work area. 
           At one point she has to unplug the phone and then run round 
           and slot the cable back in, Claire is still talking.

                                 KRM
                        So? 

                                 JAMES
                        Look Dad, here’s how it breaks 
                        down.

           Rupert reads it in James’ face.

                                 KRM
                        What? You’re kidding? Who’s 
                        against? 

                                 JAMES

                        Look just - don’t say it. 

                                 JAMES
                        But it’s a no. From the group. 

                                 KRM
                           (doesn’t hear)
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        It’s a no. 

                                 KRM
                        I said don’t say!
                           (then)
                        That’s not the answer.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s the answer.

                                 KRM
                        No, no it’s not.

                        Look - I don’t want to talk out of 
                        school, but between us - I tried. 
                        But it’s a no.
                                 KRM
                        Okay. Fine. That’s the initial 
                        response. 

                                 JAMES
                        That’s our response. 

                                 KRM
                        That’s your initial position.

                                 JAMES
                        No Dad. 

                                 KRM
                        I’ve noted your initial position 
                        and we’ll come back to it. 

           Murdoch gets up to head out. 

                                 JAMES
                        Where are you off?

                                 KRM
                        Just these Chinese figures.

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 KRM
                        I want to run them again
                        They starting to look flakey as

                        keep him happy in case I ever 
                        wanted to - but I don’t want to 
                        ever, be back in, right? Plus why 
                        should the two little ...
                           (Chloe walks through)
                        Hey there sweet cheeks.
                           (he waits)
                        I mean the blood and energy I put 
                        in, why should I ...

                                 SARAH
                        Right?

                                 LACHLAN
                        But James - I mean, I’m cool with 
                        James, but maybe ... it’s just the - 
                        the request - it’s got a fuck of a 
                        lot of angles.
                           (thinks)
                        Man! I’m playing 3-D chess with a 
                        fucking octopus with the brain of a 
                        Stephen Hawking dolphin here baby.

           He’s thinking hard. Back inside Elizabeth is talking to 
           Matthew.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What’s going on, Liz, what’s 
                        happening?? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m thinking. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Who dropped the stink bomb? What 
                        was it? Who’s fucking who? Is there 
                        a body under the floor? Do I need 
                        to manage this shit for you Liz? 

           Liz walks off, catches her Dad, they head out onto the roof 
           garden as Lachlan and Sarah come off it. There is an awkward 
           series of smiles. 

           At the door, Cal Pawsey, long time News Corp courtier and 
           also family friend arrives with a gift. Wendi greets him. He 
           pays her elaborate court. Kisses her hand.

           Lachlan watches with distaste.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Oh fucking great. The Man Who Would 
                        Be King. The corporate cock 
                        cleaner. 
                                 SARAH
                        Lachlan, it’s okay. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        What on his birthday? The turd in 
                        the punch-bowl. He pushes me out 
                        the firm, and then rolls in. Is he 
                        family now or what? This is 
                        bullshit. 

           Cal waves to Rupert through the glass, he waves back. 

           James arrives where Wendi is greeting Cal.

                                 JAMES
                           (apparently totally 
                            polite, re the catering 
                            and party set-up)
                        Wendi, I have to say, you’ve 
                        arranged everything beautifully. 

           There’s a beat, she could take it another way. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Well done. Congratulations. Thank 
                        you.   

                                 WENDI
                           (ignoring any potential 
                            edge)
                        Thank you James - I hope it’s a 
                        nice party. 

                                 JAMES
                        Well it is a nice party. So you 
                        should be very pleased.

                                 WENDI
                        Well I am pleased. 

                                 JAMES
                        Of course, and so you should be.
                           (uncomfy beat, then)
                        Cal, when you have a moment, can I 
                        get five?
                           (explaining to Wendi)
                        It’s just a corporate issue. 

                                 WENDI
                        Of course. I keep out myself. You 
                        know?
           She motions to business stuff whistling over her head,  
           smiles. 

           Back with Lachlan and Sarah:

                                 SARAH
                        So what did you say?

                                 LACHLAN
                        We said no. 

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. That’s what your Mum would 
                        want right? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I know.

                                 SARAH
                        Then it’s all settled? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I guess. 
                           (beat)
                        I feel sick. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is it bringing it all up again?

                                 LACHLAN
                        No.

                                 SARAH
                        No?

                                 LACHLAN
                        No. I just don’t know. I mean, Dad, 
                        the poor guy, the shit he takes, 
                        the crap he catches, for us. You 
                        know, he’s suffered a lot for us - 
                        to make it all possible. Doesn’t he 
                        deserve a bit of sugar now? 

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF TERRACE. DAY.

           Elizabeth and Rupert are out on the roof terrace. 

           As caterers take round some nibbles, each of the kids is 
           hyper aware of where every other one of their siblings is. 
           Liz having Rupert alone is a big deal for them all. And as 
           they all try to carry on talking normally, enjoying the 
           family occasion. But their eyes all flick out to the roof 
           garden, checking the body language, the atmosphere, between 
           Liz and Rupert. 

           Rupert is looking down to the street again. 

                                 KRM
                        Look at them all down there. 
                           (beat)
                        You know  ...?

           He pauses. She lets the grand old patriarch finish expanding 
           his philosophy. We maybe feel he’s on the verge of some 
           thoughts. On mortality? On life? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes?

                                 KRM
                        It’s a fucking long way down.

           Liz clocks Cal. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        So Cal came in on his Learjet? 

                                 KRM
                           (mishears, testy)
                        Cal ‘called me Lear again’?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 KRM
                        King Lear?

                                 ELIZABTH
                        No. Learjet. He's come in on the 
                        Learjet? 

                                 KRM
                        Right. Sure. Cos I'm more fucking 
                        Romeo than whatever.

                                 ELIZABTH
                        Right. You've never stayed awake 
                        through either of them.
                                 KRM
                        If Shakespeare was alive now, he'd 
                        be working on the soaps, he'd be 
                        writing the fucking - Simpsons. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, I tend to think if 
                        Shakespeare was alive now he'd 
                        actually be a shoo in for director 
                        of the Royal Shakespeare Company. 

           KRM chuckles.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Look Dad? How long did the divorce 
                        negotiation take? Hasn’t this has 
                        all been settled. Why drag it up? 
                        What’s changed. 

                                 KRM
                        Well you know, Grace and Chloe ... 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        They’re six and eight Dad.

                                 KRM
                        Exactly, I think they’re ready to 
                        step up to board level.

                                 ELIZABETH
                           (doesn’t appreciate the 
                            joke in these 
                            circumstances)
                        This is bullshit. 

                                 KRM
                        Liz, one thing depends on another 
                        thing. A good deal today is a bad 
                        deal tomorrow. Everything depends. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah, so we sign up today - then we 
                        get shafted again tomorrow? 

                                 KRM
                        Everything’s always changing. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dad, we’re not - you know - the 
                        Monopolies and Mergers that just 
                        has to be squared and, and, then 
                        everyone goes back to sleep as you 
                        cold-cock them and the Sunday Times 
                        or whatever. We’re not the Bancroft 
                        family to be flipped and dicked? 

                                 KRM
                        Course you’re not. You’re  - you 
                        know I - love you.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Or are we? Just the next bunch of 
                        suckers to get taken in by you 
                        looking them straight in the eye 
                        and telling them a lie they want to 
                        believe?

                                 KRM
                        There’s one thing I regret Liz. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

                                 KRM
                        I’ve changed pretty quick in my 
                        life, but maybe I’ve been slow 
                        about women? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh please.

                                 KRM
                        Really. Maybe it would be good 
                        having a bit more woman power in 
                        the firm? Earlier.

                                 ELIZABETH
                           (sniffs)
                        Um. I smell carrot. Are you 
                        dangling me a carrot now? 

                                 KRM
                        Who’s built the biggest business 
                        outside the fold? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Uh-hu. 
                                 KRM
                        I’m just saying. You have. Is your 
                        no a firm no? Are you negotiable. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Look everything is negotiable.
                           (he looks at her)
                        That’s just a fact. But yeah it’s a 
                        firm no.  

                                 KRM
                        I’m not blowing smoke up your ass, 
                        I’m just saying, if and when I’m 
                        not around,  you’ve proved you can 
                        do it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                           (looks down)
                        You know what Matthew reckons?

                        I don’t know? Does he reckon you 
                        can sell ethical flapjack on a 70% 
                        mark-up? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He reckons cos Gran’s still alive, 
                        it makes you think you’re still a 
                        kid. A teenager.

                        Uh-hu. Thanks for the insight, how 
                        much do I owe him? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Like - nothing you do, really, 
                        actually, ever finally, actually 
                        really when it comes down to it 
                        actually, matters, you know?

                                 KRM
                        Right. Brilliant. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And maybe today and - everything, 
                        all the buying and the selling. 
                        Maybe you’re looking for your Mum’s 
                        attention. Love. 
                                 KRM
                           (enough)
                        Alright thanks a bundle for the 
                        second-hand third-generation 
                        Freudian analysis, he may want to 
                        do his Mum but I’m normal in that 
                        department okay?

           There’s a tense beat. Then Prudence comes out on to the roof 
           terrace. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Look can I just say something? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Shall I go? 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        I don’t mind. But Dad, you might 
                        prefer it?

                                 KRM
                        I’m easy, I’m not playing any 
                        games, you can say anything in 
                        front of Liz you want. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Okay, it’s just Dad, I was looking 
                        at you out here from in there and I 
                        just thought, you know, please, 
                        please, really, you’ve got to stop 
                        doing the dyeing on your own, you 
                        need a professional job. You just 
                        do. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM. DAY. 

           Cal Pawsey and James are plotting in the only private space 
           they could find. The medium sized bathroom off the entrance 
           hall. James is sitting on the closed toilet, Cal is pacing. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Today’s the day for the China deal 
                        man. What is he saying? It’s pay or 
                        play. 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah. It’s in the balance. 
                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Really? Still? Man. I can’t believe 
                        it. I mean who’s looking after the 
                        ten year strategy? The fifteen year 
                        strategy?

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        I mean whoever’s running the firm 
                        then ...

           He motions to James.

                                 JAMES
                        Right. Or ...

           He motions to Cal. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You’re too kind. But you know, 
                        China, India, these are the markets 
                        we need to be hitting, right? We 
                        need to get him on- board.

                                 JAMES
                        Right. Sure. It’s just today. 
                        Today’s kind of a weird one. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Uh-hu.

           Someone tries the door. Cal and James don’t say anything. 

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Hi?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                           (then)
                        Hi? 

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Cal?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Uh-hu. Lachlan? 

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        You seen James, Cal?

           James and Cal look at one another. No way out here. They need 
           to admit James is in there.
                                 JAMES
                           (beat, then)
                        Hi bro. 

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        James?

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah?

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        Cal?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Uh-hu? 

                                 LACHLAN (O.S.)
                        You two fucking each other?

                                 JAMES
                        Uh-hu. That’s right. 

           Outside the door, Lachlan walks away. Past Matthew.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Cal and James fucking. 

           Back in the bathroom.

                                 JAMES
                        I mean, I guess you’re going to 
                        hear anyway so ...

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        What?

           Decides in the mathematics of things, he doesn’t lose 
           anything by giving Cal the full down-load.

                                 JAMES
                        Dad’s talking about tearing up the 
                        divorce agreement. Give Chloe and 
                        Grace voting rights. 

           Cal doesn’t take long to process.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Uh-hu so Wendi’s got two seats till 
                        they’re what?

                                 JAMES
                        Thirty. 
           This changes a few things. Cal thinks. James clocks him 
           thinking.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        You trying to remember what you 
                        bought her for Christmas? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Hahhah. I’m just a humble servant
                           (beat)
                        So is this happening? 

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know. We don’t know. No, I 
                        don’t think so. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        But no one wants to upset the big 
                        Silverback right? 

                                 JAMES
                        No, I rolled in and I said no. I 
                        took it on the chin. But you know, 
                        there may be repercussions. 

           Cal is momentarily pleased. He reckons his position has been 
           advanced by this turn of events. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Nice for you, you have clean hands. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Oh? What. Nah. Nah. 

           James returns to more pressing concerns.

                                 JAMES
                        But you know what, on China, 
                        nothing changes. We both need to 
                        push, yeah?  

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        He’s not focused. You know he was 
                        talking with Gary about more 
                        papers. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know. Jesus. That’s a great 
                        business model. ‘Hey dudes you know 
                        all the news you get free on the 
                        web? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        How would you like to pay for that, 
                        but the good bit is - it'll all be 
                        between 12 and 36 hours out of 
                        date? Cool huh?’

           Cal laughs. They head out of the door. 

           James takes a call, nips around the corner. Leaving Cal to 
           bump into Lachlan.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Hey. Lachlan. Let’s do a proper 
                        catch up later? I might grab a word 
                        with your old man. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I think he’s busy. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Family business?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Oh dude, it’s all family business 
                        in the end, you know that. 

                                                              CUT TO:

           EXT. ZAMBIAN LOCAL ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. DAY. 

           Leo is finishing up an interview on the steps of a building. 

                                 LEO
                        So no collapse? Nothing. Nothing to 
                        report. 

                                 LOW LEVEL OFFICIAL
                        Bits and bobs. Bits and bobs but 
                        nothing of a major complexion. 

                                 LEO
                        Well, thank you for your help. 
                           (heading off, under his 
                            breath)
                        Yeah, fuck you very much for your 
                        help.

           Leo heads off with his minder. They are making their way 
           through a small crowd of people checking out what is going 
           on. 

           Leo stops to buy a coke from a vendor. 
                                 VENDOR
                        Here you go. Good day? 

                                 LEO
                        Not really. 

                                 VENDOR
                        Uh-hu. They’ve all been paid up. 

                                 LEO
                        Uh-hu.
                           (realises this could be 
                            something)
                        How do you mean? 

                                 MINDER
                        Okay, we should go. 

                                 LEO
                        Give me five. 

                                 MINDER
                           (taking Leo aside)
                        This guy is not reliable. He’s 
                        known for that. 

                                 LEO
                        You know him?

                                 MINDER
                        Yes yes. He’s a goat fucker. 
                        Unfortunately he is not reliable. 

                                 LEO
                        Oh okay. Well will you go and check 
                        the phone?
                           (the minder doesn’t want 
                            to go, then)
                        I think the phone needs checking. 

                                 MINDER
                        What needs checking?

           Amongst the family, Cal Pawsey makes contact with Rupert.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Happy Birthday boss. 

                                 KRM
                        Guh. So. 
                           (brightening)
                        .. what’s the news, what’s everyone 
                        saying? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Oh - not much. The trade commission 
                        thing is up in the air. Senator 
                        Shitface is squealing.
                           (beat)
                        But listen, boss, can I just say, 
                        the Chinese thing, that to me is 
                        hot button news. 

                                 KRM
                        Uh-hu. Sure.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        I just wanted to say that.  

                                 KRM
                        Guh.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        I mean, you know me, I’m a friend. 
                        And this is your thing, but I was 
                        talking to James.
                                 KRM
                        Okay. Yeah.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        And he’s got this - obviously he 
                        told me about your proposal which I 
                        imagine is okay with you?

           KRM gives a look which might be read as assent. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY (CONT’D)
                        So, I guess, just as a friend I’d 
                        say, boss, is this the right time? 
                        Are you doing the right thing? 

                                 KRM
                        Okay. Thanks.

           This really is the limit. But Cal pushes on. KRM makes to 
           move off. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Or should you be more focused on 
                        the China thing which I really, 
                        really think is a toe- hold on a 
                        gold-mine you know? 

           Pawsey is giving too much advice. 

                                 KRM
                           (heading off)
                        Thanks for the advice Cal. 

           Following KRM.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        I hope I haven’t crossed a line, I 
                        just wanted to ... 

                                 KRM
                        Exactly. Brilliant.

                        Dad?
                                 KRM
                        Yeah look - James gave me the 
                        initial response and I have to say 
                        I’m very disappointed. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Oh. Right. 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah. I’m pretty angry and I just 
                        want to knowif you feel it’s a good 
                        way to respond to your father?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Oh I don’t know. Maybe you should 
                        speak to your three children?

                                 KRM
                           (beat)
                        You still annoyed about that?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        I’ll always be annoyed about that. 

                                 KRM
                        It was a slip of the tongue in a 
                        bullshit interview.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Yeah you make a lot of slips of the 
                        tongue don’t you? You’re always 
                        letting your mouth run away with 
                        you. It’s cos you’re so unguarded 
                        and freewheeling. A big dumb hippy 
                        spouting off the first thought that 
                        floats into your soft head. That’s 
                        you all over. 

                                 KRM
                        I guess I never thought you were as 
                        interested in the business so I 
                        guess, that’s why I talked about 
                        the ‘three kids’ so - I’m sorry.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Yeah well. 

                                 KRM
                        So might you have a rethink though 
                        about Chloe and Grace? I mean.

                        That’s the bottom line honey, I 
                        think - why shouldn’t everyone - 
                        all my children get treated exactly 
                        the same? 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Yeah that sounds nice.

                                 KRM
                        Exactly. And I mean I know you’re 
                        not a business head but - Alisdair 
                        and the kids. I’d love to see them 
                        prosper.

           She lets this hang there. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Your light touch is like a gorilla 
                        with a baby hamster, you know that? 
                        You think you’re petting, and then 
                        there’s a squeeze and a squeak and 
                        all you’ve got left is a bloody 
                        smear on your hand.    

           She heads off, she walks through the apartment, we follow her 
           as she thinks, she crosses past Lachlan.

                        for a hush up and I reckon I could

                        So, how did he take it?

                                 JAMES
                        He didn’t take it.

                        How d’you mean? 

                                 JAMES
                        He just fucking wouldn’t take it - 
                        said that was just an initial 
                        position.

                                 JAMES
                        He’ll get the message though, 
                        eventually. If we keep a united 
                        front. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Yeah right. About that. 

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 LACHLAN
                        I’ve been having a think. 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh for fuck’s sake?

                        Is this a power-play? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Relax bro fucking hell, we’re just 
                        two brothers having a chat. There’s 
                        no power play. I just wonder if 
                        maybe we shouldn’t have a think 
                        about  what’s fair?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Oh you’re the champ, right? Okay. I 
                        get it. Everyone tells me you’re 
                        the ‘real thing.’ The fucking coca 
                        cola kid. Well if you’re the real 
                        thing, what does that make me? A 
                        long glass of piss. The unreal 
                        thing. The phoney?

                                 JAMES
                        Look, if you want to talk about 
                        this. Let’s go to it. Let’s have a 
                        fucking bar fight, don’t skulk 
                        around like a bitch making out it’s 
                        about ‘fair’. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        It is about being fair. 

                                 JAMES
                        You’re trying to make eyes at the 
                        big fucker.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Everything isn’t a fucking 
                        powerplay James - I just think ... 

                                 JAMES
                        Bullshit. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Look I walked away. I was there, I 
                        walked. I don’t want the firm, the 
                        firm is fucking yours if you want 
                        it. 

                                 JAMES
                        Sure. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Just cos you’re a little fuck-me 
                        operator that doesn’t mean everyone 
                        is. 
                                 JAMES
                        How do you think Mum would feel? 
                        Shall we get Mum on the line? 

           He gets his phone out.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Don’t fucking wave mum at me.

                                 JAMES
                           (pretends to talk)
                        Hey Mum! Yeah, we’re thinking of 
                        fucking you. Yeah for some 
                        momentary advantage. Is that cool? 
                        If we fuck you?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Don’t act the white knight, dick.

                                 JAMES
                        Don’t dick me, bitch.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Bitch. 

                                 JAMES
                        Dick.

                                 LACHLAN
                           (after a beat)
                        Well it was nice having this chat. 
                        Fuck you.

           Starts to go. 

                                 JAMES
                        That’s right - hand the power to 
                        Wendi, she’s the wise-apple. Suck 
                        up to new-mommy-Cultural-

           Lachlan is heading out. KRM has walked in hearing the last 
           words 

                                 KRM
                        Go on? 

                                 JAMES
                           (covering)
                        We were just talking about the 
                        Cultural Revolution. 
                                 KRM

                                 KRM
                        Oh that is nice. That is fucking 
                        nice. In my apartment? I heard you 
                        called her that, but here? Very 
                        fucking suave.

           Lachlan doesn’t help his brother out. 

                                 JAMES
                        What? Dude, Dad it’s just a name, 
                        wasn’t that her name? We get on 
                        great now so ..

           Wendi is there. 

                                 WENDI
                        We might do the presents now? 

           She has heard a bit of the discussion. 

                                 KRM
                        Sorry honey.

                                 WENDI
                        It’s fine. Wen Gi means Cultural 
                        Revolution. I changed my name. I’m 
                        not ashamed. If you were called 
                        ‘Holocaust Murdoch’ you might 
                        change your name right?

                                 JAMES
                        Wendi, honestly. I was horsing 
                        around.

                                 WENDI
                        And maybe you mock me cos you’re a 
                        bit scared of me, right? But 
                        there’s nothing to be scared about 
                        James. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know. Wendi I know.   

           Wendi heads off. Rupert goes after her.

           Claire is pitching her candidates for the show slot she’s in 
           charge of to Sophia her producer. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        So I think the best candidate for 
                        the enviro-slot is probably - 
                        Sharon Georgeson. You know her?

                                 SOPHIA
                        Have we used her before?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Er, not so that I know, she fronted 
                        a half hour for somewhere and that 
                        was ...?

           Claire looks through her notes.

                                 SOPHIA
                        Is she TV? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Urgh, yeah, I think, she’s bright, 
                        she’s articulate.

                                 SOPHIA
                        But she comes over?

                                 CLAIRE
                        On the phone I thought, she’s just 
                        good value. Very factish. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Okay, cos we want the protein, I 
                        love giving value but the item 
                        needs to zing?  It can’t just lie 
                        there like a box of dead kittens on 
                        CNN? I mean this woman is she 
                        sparky?

                                 CLAIRE
                           (no)
                        Er, yeah I’d say, yeah, yes. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Great. Just maybe keep an eye out 
                        for a back- up? Someone who people 
                        will see and just go - ‘Yeah! 
                        Okay!’ 
                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay. 

                                 SOPHIA
                        Plus we do need to throw John a 
                        bone? Somebody he can chew on. Not 
                        easy pickings ..

                                 CLAIRE
                        Not easy pickings? 

                                 SOPHIA
                        No, not easy pickings, but he’s a 
                        great host for us so we want 
                        somebody he can get into? Not 
                        someone who’s going to make a fool 
                        of themselves, but not somebody who 
                        is necessarily not going to make a 
                        fool of themselves?

                        Michael?

           Michael Rowle is on the phone, he has lots of figures spread 
           out before him. We cut between him and Rupert. 
                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Yeah, so listen the figure, the 
                        figure I was after was 4%. Four per 
                        cent - up if you compare a like-
                        week with a like-week - because if 
                        you strip out Easter and ... 

                                 KRM
                        Guh. 

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        So. Thought I’d let you know that. 
                           (beat silence)
                        Yeah. And the paper’s looking 
                        great. 

                                 KRM
                        Oh right. And what’s the lead, 
                        what’s the word?

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Well actually we’ve got this 
                        African mine collapse. But it’s 
                        looking big and looks like we’ve 
                        got an exclusive. 

                                 KRM
                        Right. 

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        And it’s not just all - ‘the 
                        horror, the horror!’? There’s a 
                        connection. The mining firm’s 
                        Chinese. Party leaders’ firm and 
                        they’ve hushed it all up, so, it 
                        has an angle.

                        to be American, and it turns out 
                        Australian was just an initial 
                        position.

                        No. Nah. He can come across 
                        autistic. But he gets it. He gets 
                        blood. Families. Vanity. The Carrs,

                                 MATTHEW

                        coarsened the public sphere - the 
                        debate - in the UK, by I don’t

                        four or five percent in the US and 
                        overall improved it by two percent

           Michael is on the phone to another editor in another country.

                        What’s he thinking? Have you talked 
                        to anyone about what he’s thinking? 
                           (listens)
                        Gary says he’s talked to James and 
                        he might not be thinking anything?  

           He ends his call. Enters a small room off his office, Jo is 
           there

                        Thanks Jo, yeah, just wanted to run 
                        this past you cos I was on the line 
                        with Rupert and it was like this

                            seconds)
                        Like that.

                                 JO
                        Right?

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        What do you think? I mean I’ve 
                        known him go sort of
                           (leaves a pause of three 
                            seconds)
                        Loads of times and it usually means 
                        something, but
                           (does a four second pause)
                        That is pretty big isn’t it? 

                                 JO
                        That is a very lengthy pause.

                        Dead right it is. I mean ...

                            seconds)
                        It’s for fucking ever.

                        Do you think I should spike the

                        That’s definitely what you were

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE

                        things circulation, there was some

                        Fuck. What if he was you know, 
                        flossing his teeth and then I spike 
                        it? And his attitude is, ‘why the 
                        fuck did you spike that?’ when 
                        someone else picks the story up?

                        I think I have to go with it. I 
                        think I just have some balls. And 
                        he likes it sometimes when people 
                        stand up to him? Apparently. I’ve 
                        heard that. Sometimes he respects 
                        that. That’s my decision. We roll.

           Sitting amongst the assembled family, KRM has unwrapped a 
           bunch of ties and small silver objects, wine decanters and 
           personalized bathrobes. Now he’s unwrapping another small 
           silver object.

                        What’s this -  a - a - a fountain

                        what comes out of here? What’s it

                        this a cheese pen James? 

           He wants everyone to laugh. Wendi and Prudence do a bit, 
           Chloe and Grace too - and James and Lachlan’s wives, but 
           James, Liz, Lachlan, Matthew, they’re not in jovial mood - 
           not willing to play the game and court their father’s good 
           humour. Rupert tests the pen - starts writing

                        won’t.   

                                 JAMES
                        Has it frozen?

                                 WENDI
                        It’s charged.

                                 KRM
                        Yeah it’s - it just ... that’s not 
                        good.  

           Rupert motions to a phone. 

                                 JAMES
                        Let me look.
                           (takes it)
                        Yeah it’s frozen you need to ...

                                 KRM
                           (he dials,)
                        Can you get me Steve Jobs, Kristen 
                        please?

           He puts the phone down. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Looky looky, what’s next? 
                                 PRUDENCE
                        You’re calling Steve Jobs about a 
                        busted ipod?

           Grace gives him a gift.

                                 KRM
                        Ah thank you sweetheart, so what is 
                        this? 
                           (starts to unwrap)
                        Cuff-links. Oh that’s nice - those 
                        are nice. I’m going to take these 
                        ones off and puts these on cos ...

           The phone goes.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Guh?
                           (listens)
                        Put him on.
                           (then, playing to the 
                            gallery)
                        Hi, Steve?  Yeah so my wife got me 
                        an ipod and it’s a piece of junk 
                        mate. 
                           (listens)
                        I don’t know. It’s black.  
                           (listens, asks)
                        How many gig is it? 
                           (then)
                        What does it matter how many gig it 
                        is? The piece of junk’s frozen. 
                           (beat)
                        What do I want you to do? I want 
                        you to tell me what to do. 
                           (listens)
                        Okay. Whatever. I’m only doinking 
                        you Steve, alright? Selling your 
                        crapola all over the world.  
                           (listens)
                        Okay. Guh.

           Phone down.

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        He’s gonna send over some more. 
                        Honestly. 

           The caterer whispers in Wendi’s ear.
                                 WENDI
                        Okay, lunch. Are we ready for 
                        lunch? 

                                                              CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM. DAY.

           The family are all gathered around the dining table. 

                                 KRM
                        Well, what a day. Great to have you 
                        all here and can I just say -
                           (raises a glass, then, 
                            wryly)
                        happy birthday to me. 

           They all raise their glasses.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Happy birthday, to you. 

           They all clink. 

                                 KRM
                           (tucking in)
                        So - what’s anyone heard, what’s 
                        the news and reviews. What’s 
                        everyone saying?

           There’s a beat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I guess everyone’s a bit pre-
                        occupied, Dad. 

                                 KRM
                        We can still have a chat, right?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sure.

           Cutlery clinks. The party has been soured by Rupert’s request 
           to the kids, but he won’t let it lie.  

                                 KRM
                        Okay - fine, come on then, if no 
                        one’s got any gossip. Let’s play 
                        Family Fortunes. Okay, come on, 
                        pitch me kids. What should we be 
                        doing at the firm. News Corp?

                                 KRM (CONT'D)
                        What’s the next hundred years all 
                        about?  

           Silence.

                                 CHLOE
                        I think you should do more cartoons 
                        Dad. 

           There are chuckles.

                                 KRM
                        You see - someone’s broken rank. 
                        Dead right Chloe. Good girl. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                           (attempting a light tone)
                        Well can I just say. Could we have 
                        a think about the name? 

                                 KRM
                        Guh.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        ‘News Corp’? Could we not have 
                        spent five more minutes on the 
                        name? Are we going out of our way 
                        to make it as ugly as possible?

           There are chuckles but Rupert doesn’t see it as that funny. 

                                 KRM
                        I suppose you’d have me drop 10 
                        million on a company make-over? 
                        Glad I got you covering corporate 
                        strategy. 

           As always, he’s joking and not joking. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        C’mon let’s play, what’s the pitch? 
                        Brains trust? 

           The kids are all judging what they should say. Pru jumps in - 
           playing the role she has taken, the straight talker.

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Well, if I’m honest, I think you 
                        should re-balance Dad. America. 
                        Sure. But remember Asia? Alisdair 
                        was saying - go on Alisdair?

           He’s not about to start laying down the law to his boss. He 
           demures.

                        What do I think? Well ...

                            anticipation)
                        keep going. You’re doing a good 
                        job.  

                                 KRM
                        That’s - it? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m serious. Don’t necessarily 
                        listen to some young buck who says, 
                        ‘sink everything into some 
                        Indonesian fibre optic’ or 
                        something. Do what you do well.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, here goes, if we’re playing 
                        parlour games, I’ll tell you what 
                        we should do with the firm. 

                                 KRM
                        Okay here we go. 

                                 JAMES
                        Get out of papers.

                                 KRM
                        Right?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re addicted Dad dude. The Post - 
                        has any media operation ever lost 
                        as much money as your New York 
                        Post?

                        Maybe only his London Times?

                        People think you’re a hard nosed 
                        bugger but you’re putty for a 
                        paper.

                        Five, ten year strategy get out of 
                        papers before they curl up and die. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Nah, get out of all news. Into 
                        entertainment.

                                 JAMES
                        Dude, news is entertainment that’s 
                        the whole insight. An opposition is 
                        an old paradigm. We're a brand that 
                        has a relationship with a community 
                        of customers. We’ve got to embrace 
                        that. But constantly re-evaulate 
                        it. We’ve got to say, ‘today we're 
                        going to eat change for breakfast, 
                        for the sake of it.’ 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah, so out of papers? Get rid of

                        I like this guy, what’s his name 
                        again? 

                                 JAMES
                        Everyman should kill what he most 
                        loves. A wise man once said that, 
                        and that’s right. We oughta take 
                        the brands, hollow out the papers - 
                        leave them as cash husks and  
                        project the value online. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        I have to say, obviously I disagree 
                        with what he says, in many ways, 
                        but big picture. I think James is 
                        talking real words there.

           KRM looks at Lachlan.

                                 LACHLAN 
                        Look, I don’t want to play. 

                                 KRM
                        You’ve got to play.

                                 JAMES
                        Leave him alone Dad. He already had 
                        a go.  

                                 LACHLAN
                        What? 
                                 JAMES
                        I’m just saying you already had 
                        your go - running the train set. 

           Lachlan gets up. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        What? What?! I never ... had the 
                        train set. 

                                 JAMES

                        Cal had the train set. Dad set up 
                        the track. I was on points but ... 
                        the timetable ... was -

                        This metaphor is really not working

                        Just - look man, just, fuck you.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah okay, now I get it.

                        I apologise, Dad, Chloe, Grace. I 
                        apologise. I love you.

           INT. INTERNET CABIN - ZAMBIA. DAY

           Leo is at a terminal. Typing at an old grey keyboard. A few 
           people are around checking him out as they do their emailing.  

           Leo is on his mobile.

                                 LEO
                        Yeah the file didn’t attach. And it 
                        won’t take a dongle. There’s no 
                        stick hole. So I’m typing it into 
                        the body of an email.

                        But this keyboard is fucked so 
                        where there are dollar signs - 
                        those should be U’s and where 
                        there’s colons put commas. Except 
                        the third colon which is a colon. 
                        Yeah? I’ll call when I send. 

           He types some more. Hurriedly. Then suddenly the screen 
           blips. Goes dark. There is a general sigh of discontent in 
           the cabin. Then the power blips on again. The cursor blinks 
           as the machine boots up.

                        Fucking .... What? Did this just 
                        ...?

           But everyone else is getting on with re-typing their emails. 
           Leo makes another call. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I just lost my webmail page. 
                        I’m out of here.

           Leo leaves a few bank notes at the front desk and heads out 
           onto the street. Sits on a bench with his notebook. 

                                 LEO
                        Okay I’m going to have dictate the

           After Lachlan’s outburst people are hushed in knots talking. 
           Murdoch comes out of his bedroom in gym gear. 

           He comes down a flight of stairs. He’s in sour mood. 

           Everyone wonders what he’s going to say or do. But he walks 
           through the room. Says a few words to Wendi and then heads on 
           through to his gym up a corridor.

           KRM is pounding away on a running machine. His feet hit the 
           track - slap slap slap - and sweat drips onto the belt. He 
           looks at himself in the mirror. He’s not happy.
           Things are looking bleak. He is feeling tired. He looks like 
           he might switch the machine off.  

           But he hits the button in front of him to take it up a notch. 
           AS Cal Pawsey enters. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You okay Boss?

                        Guh. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Wendi said maybe you’d like a word?

                                 KRM
                        Uh.

           Cal checks KRM’s speed. Rupert takes it up another notch.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You okay. Not - too much?

                        What?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        All that? Bit of a shit storm? 
                        It’ll be okay though.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Yeah. I reckon, you want my 
                        opinion, I do not think this is the 
                        correct strategy right now, the 
                        Chloe and Grace thing, you know 
                        that?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        But strategically speaking, if you 
                        push through I guess, you’ve got 
                        Pru on-board? Liz, I think, is 
                        persuadable. James, I don’t know, 
                        but he’s inside. Lachlan’s the one 
                        though. He’s going to be tough. 

           KRM pounds away in silence.

                        Yeah so I’ve been thinking.

                        rise. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Okay, well - gut reaction? I think 
                        that will work! Great. Shares or

                        And maybe moved up a level? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Okay? Sounds good. Up to the

           KRM jumps his feet to the sides of the machine and heads off 
           to grab a towel and a shower. 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah? Good?

                                 KRM
                        Good.

           Cal isn’t sure what just happened. He looks around the room. 
           He’s gobsmacked. Murdoch exits.

                        wasn’t the one who - f-f-farted. 

           KRM looks at him, Lachlan feels like a petulant kid

                        Exactly. Plus he was unlucky, you 
                        know? If it was raining cunt he'd 
                        get hit by a poof. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        So, what? His corpse is a peace 
                        offering? 

                                 KRM
                        No. Just business.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Dad I’m happy doing my own thing. 
                        There’s lots of opportunities. I’m 
                        gonna be rich, don’t worry. 

                                 KRM
                        Whatever. Rich is easy. Every bone 
                        head you meet has 10 million 
                        sitting on fucking deposit.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Rich is easier if you start rich. 

                                 KRM
                        Money’s just the mercury in the 
                        thermometer mate. Where’s the fun? 
                        Power. There’s no one in the whole 
                        wide world from the pope on a rope 
                        to the Queen of fucking England who 
                        wouldn’t take a call from that 
                        phone. 
                           (he points)

                                 LACHLAN
                        What?

                                 KRM
                        That’s just a hell of a lot of fun. 
                        So think about it son. Think about 
                        coming back in, yeah? 

           Lachlan thinks. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        You really fired him? 
                                 KRM
                        Yeah. But the cunt’s so thick I 
                        don’t think he clocked it yet. 

           KRM heads off to his bedroom.

           addressing a public meeting.

           Behind her watching is another more senior researcher, Dan.

                        What do I think? 

           Dan looks at Claire - will he help or lie? Further his own

                                 MICHAEL ROWLE
                        Well they should be, I think and I 
                        think ... 

                                 KRM
                        Mike, it’s just a question. Do 
                        whatever you think. Huh?

           Phone down. 

           Michael is left standing there. Wondering what to do. 

           INT. MURDOCH’S APARTMENT - ROOF GARDEN. DAY.

           Lachlan is thinking hard. He sees James out on the roof 
           garden with Cal.

           James is on his mobile. Cal is looking down towards the 
           street. 

                                 JAMES
                        Okay okay. Cool. That is definitely 
                        cool.  
                           (ends call, to Cal)
                        Looks like it’s going to fucking go 
                        man! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        The owners are not not going to 
                        accept the bid and Beijing aren’t 
                        gonna kick up a shitstorm!

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Uh-hu?

                                 JAMES
                        Chinese Facebook motherfucker. We 
                        did it. I did it. You did it! 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                           (depressed)
                        Congratulations. 

                                 JAMES
                        Cal man, are you sure you’ve even 
                        been fired? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                           (pathetic)
                        I don’t know, what do you think? 

           It’s obvious he’s been fired. They look at one another. 

                                 JAMES
                        I think, this is still a massive 
                        achievement. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Fuck. He’s such a  - he’s a 
                        terrible manager you know that? He 
                        makes good deal - but he breaks 
                        people. He has these absurd 
                        favourites who think they're king 
                        dong. These tin pot Hitlers, who 
                        get shit poured on them and then 
                        it’s a cavalcade of shit cascading 
                        down the ranks. Then he gets bored 
                        and chops their nobs off and leaves 
                        them as these eunuchs bleeding to 
                        death while the caravan moves on. 

           James smiles. Now is not the time to defend his Dad. Lachlan 
           emerges. He’s by the edge of the railing. Cal tries to smile 
           at James. He heads past Lachlan. AS he does so he stops for a 
           beat. Puts his hands on Lachlan’s shoulders. 

           For a beat things feel a little out of control. Cal is 
           emotional. Lachlan’s on the edge of a roof garden 50 stories 
           up. Cal has him gripped by the shoulders. Cal leaves it a 
           beat. 
                                 CAL PAWSEY (CONT’D)
                        Good luck.  

           And he heads back inside. Lachlan is in a new mode, he 
           approaches James. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        So dude. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey! You okay.  

                                 LACHLAN
                        Oh yeah. Hell yeah. I’m good.

                                 JAMES
                        Good. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        And look - sorry if things got a 
                        bit rich, earlier.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Yeah. No worries yeah? 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh sure, no worries. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I guess this whole thing would be a 
                        hell of a lot easier if we didn’t 
                        know whatever we agree will end up 
                        on the front page of all the 
                        papers. 

                                 JAMES
                        Not all the papers. The Post and 
                        the Journal and the Sun and the 
                        Times, they tend to show some 
                        delicacy, you know? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Well, they’re quality papers aren’t 
                        they mate? 

                                 JAMES
                        Exactly. Old school. Fucking old 
                        school. 

           They laugh. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        It’s like Dad always says, they 
                        wouldn’t be this interested in us 
                        if all we ran was a sausage 
                        factory, would they? 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah and it’s like I always say, we 
                        don’t run a fucking sausage factory 
                        do we? We run the biggest news 
                        outfit in the world, so. 

           Lachlan wants things to stay cosy.

                                 LACHLAN
                        You know, I tell you what I think 
                        was an interesting time period. 

                                 JAMES
                        Right? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        After, after the Visigoths and so 
                        on - the Roman Empire. The - the 
                        Byzantines and the Western Roman 
                        Empire. 

                                 JAMES
                           (scarcastic)
                        Oh fuck yeah. Let’s get into all 
                        that. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Serious. I mean that worked pretty 
                        well, right? Two Emperors.

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t think so. Didn’t they all 
                        get totally fucked? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        No I mean, look I can’t remember 
                        but I think it lasted a thousand 
                        years or some shit? 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh right?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Look - say it did, the two Empires 
                        set up? Say that lasted like a 
                        thousand years - that would be 
                        pretty impressive wouldn’t it? 
                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, I guess? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        So that’s something to think about? 

                                 JAMES
                        You’re warbling six kinds of shit 
                        dude. I’m getting nauseous. I’m 
                        going to throw up. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        I just think, if and when Dad 
                        should - you know? 

                                 JAMES
                        Right.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Maybe. I might be inside?

                                 JAMES
                        Oh. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Maybe he might want me back and 
                        maybe I might want to come back? 
                        And maybe it wouldn’t have to be a 
                        blood bath. We could talk about 
                        spheres of influence?

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, right? Two Emperors? Right? 

                                                              CUT TO:

                                 KRM
                        Just make the bid. Yes I’m happy.
                           (listens)
                        That’s how much anything costs - 
                        too much. Everything’s over -
                        priced, pal. Just make the bid, 
                        that’s my instruction.

                        Always. But not for you. 
                           (re phone)
                        Just business and a fucking editor.

                        Nah nah. If you have to grab the 
                        pen off a guy, you hired the wrong 
                        guy. Only a jerk has to grab the 
                        pen. 

                                 PRUDENCE

                           (after a beat)
                        So?, what’s the news? Chloe and 
                        Grace?

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Look ...
                           (beat, she looks at him)
                        Dad, you know me, I’ll always help 
                        you out when I can. 

           This says it all for Rupert.

                                 KRM
                        Oh that’s great news honey!

                                 PRUDENCE
                        The others though? 

                                 KRM
                        Oh, right? Yeah?  

                                 PRUDENCE
                        I think it’s tough. It’s tough for 
                        them. 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah? 
                                 PRUDENCE
                        Yeah. But, I mean I’ll do what I 
                        can. 

                                 KRM
                        That would be amazing. 

           Before she goes. 

                                 PRUDENCE
                        Quick quiz though?

                        That’s alright. 

                                 KRM
                        But seriously, your kids. Alistair, 
                        you know it’s great to have the 
                        hubby on the firm. Sometimes I 
                        wonder if he hasn’t actually been 
                        held back by his relationship - to 
                        the firm. He’s talented. Be great 
                        to see that flower.

           Prudence look at him. It’s a carrot but there’s just the hint 
           of a threat there too. 

           Just then Cal knocks and enters. 
                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Right, so look, I think that’s me 
                        done. 

                                 KRM
                        You’re going? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Well yeah I think I’m going, so. 

           Cal is getting annoyed by the subtext. Pru heads out past 
           Cal. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, so just before I go. Can I 
                        just check, am I sacked? I was 
                        sacked right? 

                                 KRM
                        I just think it might be time for 
                        you to move up. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        So that’s it?

                                 KRM
                        That is it. 

           Cal is pumped up and ready to pop. But instead of keeping him 
           in the private office, KRM shows him out - walking him into 
           the living room. They’re in the public arena. Cal’s all 
           flustered. He picks up the wrong coat. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        This isn’t my - where’s my coat?
                           (gathering his stuff, to 
                            himself)
                        Fucking bullshit. 

           Wendi takes the young kids out, but the older ones start to 
           notice this disturbance in the room, start to gather, or pay 
           closer attention. 

                                 KRM
                           (did he mishear or is he 
                            poking?)
                        What’s that mate?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                           (louder)
                        This is fucking bullshit. 
           For a quiet life Rupert should show him out, but for some 
           reason he needles him a little. 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah, you see it’s for insights 
                        like that I’ve always enjoyed 
                        having you round. 

           Wendi has looked out another coat. She hands it to him. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        This isn’t my coat alright! It 
                        isn’t the right fucking coat!! 

                                 KRM
                        Did you even have a coat?

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You fuck everything, don’t you? 

                                 KRM
                        That’s right Cal. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You fucked Australia. You fucked 
                        the UK. Now you’re fucking me and 
                        the USA. That’s what you do isn’t 
                        it?

                                 KRM
                        Oh okay? You’ve been taking the pay 
                        but now let’s hear what you really 
                        think big man? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        You take the papers and the cable 
                        stations and the - fucking anything 
                        - and you hollow them out and you 
                        pump them up full of shit and then 
                        you sell these baubles of shit and 
                        you fuck them. 

                                 KRM
                        You were happy enough til today. 
                        Funny that. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Yeah well, I thought I could do 
                        something. I thought we would do 
                        something. I guess I thought there 
                        was something fucking decent here. 
                        But you know what it’s just a big 
                        fat bauble of shit.   
           This is too much for Lachlan. He’s boiling up. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Two billion people can get their 
                        news from us Cal. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Yeah, whatever. Someone else would 
                        have done it. What's he done 
                        that'll last? 

                                 JAMES
                        Bullshit.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Do you know what you are Rupe? 
                        You’re a fucking sub. 

                                 JAMES
                        C’mon mate, fuck off now. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Once a sub - always a sub.  He's 
                        fucking Beeverbrook’s sub at heart. 
                        It's all about the strap-line, 
                        isn’t it Rupe?

                        promise of content. The most

                        up one single gram of media 
                        protein. 

                                 JAMES
                        Mate. Come on dude.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        That's what he's does. He slaps a 
                        fat stupid strap-line on everything 
                        and the whole world goes, 'oh shit, 
                        better have a look.' 

                                 KRM
                        If I’m the problem, Cal? Who are 
                        the good guys, eh? Who are these 
                        guys you want running the news? The 
                        good old days? Hearst? Fat Bob 
                        Maxwell? Nazi Rothermere? Are these 
                        the guys you want?

                        Conrad Black in jail? Russian 
                        spooks buying up London? Are these 
                        the guys I should sell out to? Cos 
                        I tell you one thing, it’s not 
                        going to be the Scott-Trust-
                        Sulzberger-Bancroft family selling 
                        wedges of National Public Radio 4 
                        on eco-friendly shit roll. It’s 
                        going to be some hard nosed bastard 
                        who gives people what they want. 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        And you know, don’t you? You always 
                        know? 

                                 KRM
                        No. No I don’t. But I tell you 
                        what, you find out. Cos people 
                        don’t buy what they don’t want.

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        People buy the shiniest shit on the 
                        shelf - and that’s what we sell. 

                                 KRM
                        You know who the cynical fuckers 
                        are? Not me giving people what they 
                        want, it’s the pricks who think 
                        they know what people want. I trust 
                        the man on the street. They hate 
                        him. They think he’s getting - 
                        reprogrammed by Fox and jerking off 
                        to page three, but I know it’s just 
                        not that fucking serious, Cal. He’s 
                        listening to this, he’s listening 
                        to that, and he doesn’t want some 
                        toffee nosed cunt telling him 
                        what’s what? 

                                 CAL PAWSEY
                        Yeah well, see you around. 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah go on Cal. No need for a 
                        thanks. No need for that. Who built 
                        this firm? Who is this firm. It’s 
                        my firm, I do what I like, mate. 

           Cal is gone, but this is aimed at the kids too. 

           KRM heads to the kitchen to get a coconut milk drink from the 
           fridge.

                        Bring your pens.

           Wendi follows KRM, concerned.

                        Rupe. Rupe, you okay? 

           She catches his arm. She expects him to be a bit shaken by 
           this big bust up. Who wouldn’t be? But he seems very calm. 

                                 KRM
                        Oh sure.

                        I was worried, you don’t normally 
                        do - that stuff? 

                                 KRM
                        Well I guess, today ain’t a bad day 
                        to circle the family wagons, right?

                        You should be careful Rupert. You 
                        think everything is a game. 

                                 KRM
                        Everything is a game though honey.

                        playing?

           Cassie, the foreign editor is on the phone.

                        How are you doing?
           Leo is in the internet shack we saw him at earlier. We cut 
           between them.

                                 LEO
                        Great. Just - writing up a bit of 
                        eyewitness first person stuff 
                        colour. Might not make it for today 
                        but it could work as a follow up 
                        next week?  

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, the thing is Leo I just 
                        think, we’re spiking the story.

                        Yeah, his thing is, sure, maybe it 
                        does, but does it?

                        Yes! 
                           (then)
                        Look, I’ve got, what, three sources 
                        on this - I’ve seen the place, I’ve 
                        got the doctor’s quotes. I’ve got 
                        all that hard stuff about the 
                        Chinese investment ...
                                 CASSIE
                        But, isn’t it hard to ever really 
                        know what happened, I mean actually 
                        happened anywhere?

                                 LEO
                        This happened. After a week of rain 
                        a side of a cobalt mine collapsed. 
                        170 people died. The Chinese owners 
                        stopped it making news. That 
                        happened. 

                                 CASSIE
                        But - if a tree falls in the forest 
                        and ... and it kills 170 people - 
                        but afterwards everyone says, apart 
                        from a few people, that it did or 
                        didn’t - is that a news story? 

           Cassie looks pained at Michael Rowle who is studiously 
           pretending to not be able to hear. 

                                 LEO
                        I’m not really following you.

           Cassie looks to Michael for support. But he’s talking to Jo.

                        I’m excited. I’m excited about 
                        China. I wasn’t sure, but I’m glad 
                        to have been able to do this for

                        I wasn’t sure about China. You

           KRM goes into his study. He’s feeling pretty great. He’s 
           pulling it all together. He grabs a pen, starts crossing and

           layouts.

           An angry young man stands by himself in the corner. There’s a

           in. But Matthew’s got his task in mind. His pitch, his brief.

                        So, what are you thinking? Still,

                                 MATTHEW
                        Indeed. There is an issue of 
                        fairness. Of almost, racial 
                        equality at stake here. 

           She’s finding Matthew a little odd.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I feel that. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ebony and ivory - side by side on 
                        the piano keyboard, oh lord, why 
                        can’t we? 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Have you - why are you - has my Dad 
                        spoken to you? 

                                 MATTHEW
                        He was eager that you say yes - and 
                        you’re up for saying yes so. That’s 
                        cool.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Right?

                                 MATTHEW
                        So a great way to finesse this 
                        would be that you were wavering and 
                        I added the key argument. That 
                        would pimp my ride. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                           (pissed off)
                        Right?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh honey - come on. Then it’s 
                        double bubble. Triple bubble.

                        You me and him all get bubble. It’s 
                        a bubble bath. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He took you on to PR his own 
                        fucking daughter?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey easy. Spin control, watch it, 
                        that’s just a nasty way of putting 
                        something nice. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        That’s un-fucking believable.

           Michael Rowle is handed a layout of the front page, he looks

           The headline we see is ‘Collision Course on EU Treaty’

           A large impersonal room. It’s full of mid-level Chinese media 
           monitoring officials scrolling through foreign news web-sites 
           and watching news feeds. Making notes. 

           Our guy clicks on a page and the headline we’ve just seen in 
           London. He makes a note on a keyboard hooked up to another 
           computer. 

           Behind him another official is doing his rounds.

           Sharon is waiting in a room with a few easy chairs and 
           couches, masses of fruit and a range of still and sparkling 
           waters.

           She is fingering her notes from Leo. And looking up 
           occasionally to check the oddballs in the green room with her 
           and watch a little of John Kendall doing his previous segment 
           on BattleLines. She’s nervous. 

           Angle on the TV: 

                                 JOHN KENDALL
                        Next up: is it time to wipe away 
                        the era of top-down environmental 
                        protection and instead let the 
                        market look after the greenery?   

           Claire joins Sharon in the Green Room. 

                                 SHARON GEORGSON
                        Okay, I’m ready to roll all over 
                        this asshole.

                        got another - guy, to put up some

           On screen a hippy guy with some dreadlocks is sitting 
           opposite John Kendall. 

                                 JOHN KENDALL
                        Let me ask you one question to 
                        start with. Is environmental 
                        protection in this country working?

                        A tree never started a war. A tree

                        So a carpet of trees from sea to 
                        shining sea, and where will the 
                        folks get jobs, Mr Vonk?

                        I’m sorry. You’ll get your fee and 
                        travel expenses even if you don’t

                        you’re putting the squeeze on.

                        this way for the signing! 

           He is ushers his kids towards his office. But as they go in 
           he just goes to have one final word with Lachlan. As James 
           and Pru head in, KRM takes him aside for a final firm-up.

                        son? 

           This is just a bit too much for Lachlan. He laughs.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Yeah right.

                        Napoleon didn’t have a fucking 
                        career development officer, right?

                        Fine. I don’t want to get into the

                        I knew what I was doing before Dad, 
                        I knew what I was fucking doing, I

                        Well I fired Cal didn’t I?

           Lachlan wants to let things lie, but he can’t quite let this 
           go. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        Today. Today you fired him, when

                        Oh come on, hold on ... but, no, 
                        Liz sweetheart ... 

           James and Pru come and check out what’s going on.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s up?

                                 LACHLAN
                        She’s saying no.

                                 JAMES
                        You’re saying no? 

                                 KRM
                        No she’s not. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes I am. 

                                 KRM
                        This is hasty. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        But Dad, why? Ah? What’s it all 
                        for? All the, the acquisitions and 
                        the deals and the - this today - 
                        bullshit? What are you building, 
                        what shape is it even meant to 
                        fucking be? 

                                 KRM
                           (dry)
                        The final shape hasn’t been 
                        determined. C’mon kids let’s get in 
                        there and ...

                                 LACHLAN
                        But what the fuck is it all for? 
                        Why have you built this fucking 
                        Noah’s ark of money and fucking 
                        newspapers and us?

                                 KRM
                           (joking trying to keep it 
                            light)
                        Keeps me alive. A few more deals I 
                        reckon I can go to 120. 

           He’s joking. But a bit of him isn’t. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        But Jesus Dad, is it worth it? I 
                        mean, what ... profits a man if he 
                        gains the world but, but, but, 
                        fucks his family in the jam-hole?  

                                 KRM
                        Are you’re looking for rosebud 
                        Lachlan? Ah? The key to it all? 
                        Well, fuck rosebud. The yankee 
                        dollar, that’s all rosebud is, a 
                        hundred dollar bill mate. So stop 
                        worrying your heads and let’s sign 
                        up.

                                 LACHLAN
                        I don’t buy it. 

           Rupert can feels things slipping. Then, to all the kids:
                                 KRM
                        You know what the whole world is to 
                        me, family. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Yeah it’s your greatest 
                        achievement. Funny how we all live 
                        on different fucking continents 
                        isn’t it? 

                                 KRM
                        This is a good family. How many 
                        billionaires do you know without a 
                        smackhead kid? Without one who’s 
                        gone tits up on booze or God?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Yeah this family is better than 
                        Harvard business school. But how 
                        come you had to sow the seeds of 
                        fuck in everything? Did we ever 
                        have a game that wasn’t a  
                        competition? Ah? And if it’s all 
                        about the family - was it a good 
                        idea to have three different ones? 

                                 KRM
                        That’s too much.

                                 LACHLAN
                        So, you know what? No. I’m not 
                        signing up so you can keep things 
                        sweet here. I’m not a turkey and 
                        I’m not voting for Christmas. So 
                        screw you Dad. I love you Dad. 

                                 KRM
                           (Re Liz and Lachlan)
                        So. That’s two on ice. You two, 
                        we’ll sort out the deal we need  to 
                        make later. But you two. 
                           (to Pru and James, as he 
                            goers into the study to 
                            get the legal papers)
                        Okay? Signing up. 

           He looks at James and Prudence.

                                 JAMES
                        Well it’s academic, right?
                                 KRM
                        No, no, cos, critical mass of  
                        opinion, and they’ll be signing 
                        later and ...

                                 JAMES
                        It doesn’t work for me Dad. How 
                        would this fit into my strategy?  

                                 KRM
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        China works. China stands or falls 
                        on it’s own. And so does this and 
                        it’s a shitty deal. That’s all it 
                        is Dad, it’s not a personal thing 
                        it’s just a shitty deal. 

           Pru looks at the others. She smiles at her dad but she 
           doesn’t want to be left on her own, shrugs an apology. 

           KRM consider for a beat. There’s something else. He doesn’t 
           want to do this, but he has another card to play. 

                                 KRM
                        Okay. Look, come in, come in here, 
                        I have something to tell you in 
                        private. Something important. 

           The kids look at each other - Lachlan makes it into the 
           office. KRM closes the door. 

                                 KRM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. So, here’s the thing. I 
                        didn’t want it to go this way but, 
                        today. Everything. The story is I’m 
                        dying. 

           There’s shock. Lachlan laughs a squeak of embrrassed, shocked 
           laughter.  

                                 JAMES
                        Are you serious? 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah I’m serious. So. I just really 
                        want to get a few things straight 
                        and signed off. I need to get 
                        things straight. 
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Really? What? Are you - How long? 
                        For sure? 

                                 KRM
                        Yeah. Could be soon, could be 
                        later? 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Right and you tell us now? 

                                 KRM
                        I didn’t want to do this but ...

                                 LACHLAN
                        The only way you can tell your kids 
                        you're going to fucking die is when 
                        it’s a negotiating tactic. 

                                 KRM
                        No. Nah Lachlan. That’s not the 
                        situation. But look, now you know 
                        the situation, can we sign this 
                        stuff up?

                                 LACHLAN
                        You hold this in reserve? Did that 
                        make you feel big? I guess it was 
                        nice knowing you had the warhead in 
                        the locker. 

           KRM clicks a pen. The kids look at the papers.

                                 JAMES
                        Look, I’m going to need to see some 
                        medical evidence. 

                                 KRM
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        Look - I’m sorry and this is a 
                        weird day, and Dad we’re going to 
                        beat this, and we’re going to get 
                        through this, and we all love you 
                        Dad, but before I sign anything, 
                        can you get your Doc on speaker 
                        phone? 

                                 KRM
                        No. I’m your fucking dad and I’m 
                        telling you I’m dying. 
                                 LACHLAN
                        We’re all dying. 

                                 JAMES
                        Dad, let’s not let things get mixed 
                        up here. Can we see something?

           KRM considers he’s seething. But he’s not about to call his 
           Doctor. Because he can’t or he won’t face the humiliation?

                                 KRM
                        Go on, fuck off out of it. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dad? Are you okay? Do you want to 
                        talk about this?

                                 KRM
                        No, no I don’t. Go on. Piss off.  

           The kids step outside the door. 

           KRM glowers. Shifts in his seat. Was it a tactic? Is he 
           dying? He looks at a flat screen monitor. Looks at the 
           newspapers on his desks. Suddenly he punches the flat- screen 
           monitor. It hurts his aged fist. It topples over pathetically 
           backwards. 

           ENDS
