           FADE IN:

           EXT. “NATIONAL TIRE” MANUFACTURING YARD - NEW JERSEY - DAY

           A blur of shapes.  SOUNDS of a manufacturing plant working full 
           tilt.  CREDITS BEGIN, as we come to FOCUS on... 

           TIRES.  Black rubber circles, stacked thousands-high.  An 
           industrial yard outside Manhattan.  Into frame comes... SAM 
           HARPER.  Late-20's, good looks, restless intelligence.  Last 
           year’s Brioni suit off the rack, but still a Brioni.  He walks 
           through the yard with BEN, a less well-dressed VP OF SALES.  
           Ben's distracted, this isn’t a meeting he has time for --

                                 SAM
                        Those the P-30’s?  How many?

                                 BEN (VP OF SALES)
                        ... hundred thousand.

                                 SAM
                        A hundred thousand?  Wow, that is a 
                        mountain of tires, Man.  Please don’t say 
                        you’re offloading to a liquidator --

                                 BEN (VP OF SALES)
                        We use Polski Brothers.  Look, I’m 
                        pressed for time--

                                 SAM
                        -- Polski Brothers? -- nono -- for ten 
                        cents on the dollar?  Two percent of your 
                        wholesale cost?  Then what?  They promise 
                        to take your excess inventory out of 
                        North America, “don’t worry, we won’t 
                        impact your new line” -- but a week 
                        later?  Seven discount stores are filling 
                        their windows with them.  Now you roll 
                        out the P-40’s at two hundred fifty bucks 
                        but Costco’s advertising the old P-30’s -- 
                        the tires you just got rid of -- for 
                        half.  They’re right back in your 
                        distribution chain and you’re 
                        cannibalizing your own sales -- 

           Ben takes pause -- Sam’s reeling him in -- as they ENTER:

           INT. “NATIONAL TIRE” FACTORY WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           MOVING -- through the TIRE PLANT -- past extruding machines -- 
           STEAM and PRESSURE as rubber’s molded -- 
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        -- I can make your problem go away and 
                        pay you a hundred cents on the dollar.  
                        Your full wholesale cost, and guarantee 
                        to re-market overseas.  All we take's a 
                        30 percent commission. 

                                 TIRE GUY
                        30 percent?  What is it you do?  You buy 
                        tires? 

                                 SAM
                        Among other things.

                        facilitator. 

           AND WE BEGIN A SERIES OF CUTS AS CREDITS CONTINUE: Sam pitching 
           to various MANUFACTURERS throughout the Tri-State -- handing his 
           CARD to another VP OF SALES at a BOTTLING PLANT:

                        commerce -- 

           By a vat of swirling paper pulp in a TOILET PAPER FACTORY:

                        Any company has leftovers: last year's 
                        electronics, ketchup bottles, kitten 
                        calenders, toys that didn’t sell at 
                        Christmas -- 

           At a TOY MANUFACTURING PLANT, in front of unsold boxes of...

                        Furbys?  No problem, we can off-load them 
                        in Russia, they love anything with fur --

           As liquid resin pours through tubes at a PLASTICS PLANT:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        -- anything with a shelf life, an 
                        expiration date, questionable baby 
                        formula, plastic dishware filled with 
                        PBA, there’s a market for that --

           The cuts come FAST AND FURIOUS now:
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        -- we help companies like yours get full 
                        value for their products, clients who can 
                        trade you their goods and services, 
                        whatever you need to run your business --  

           Over corrugated box manufacturers/ cork suppliers/ glass bottle 
           reps:

                        with the biggest in the world --  

           And finally, our CREDITS END with Sam and Ben, the National Tire 
           Sales VP: two figures standing on a gangplank overlooking a 
           massive, automated tire assembly line.  Ben now deep in thought, 
           on the hook; Sam not pressing, common-sense intimacy:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        ... because in this economy?  Paper is 
                        paper, but goods are good.  Unlike the 
                        dollar, barter doesn't depreciate one... 
                        single... percent.  
                              (the clincher)
                        It's the new money, Ben, that’s how you 
                        need to think of it: you’re getting in on 
                        the ground floor... of money.  

           Ben weighs his choice, looks over at Sam... and finally, with a 
           little smirk, offers his hand.  Sam grips firmly and SHAKES as 
           "Magic Man" peaks and --

           INT. ATWOOD/RICHARDS - EMPLOYEE BACK ROOM - DAY

           BAM!  Sam’s hand SLAMS down a hand of CARDS, victorious: 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the American workplace, Ladies 
                        and Gentlemen!  

           FELLOW SALESMEN surround, laughing, cash on the table.  We're in 
           an office back room.  BENNY, 22, slumps in defeat:

                                 BENNY
                        -- shit.  You were bluffing?

                                 PLAYER #2
                        -- you're surprised?  We've been here two 
                        years, that's all he does -- 

           Sam’s cell RINGS -- a (213) area code.  He knows who it is.  
           Doesn't wanna answer.  Hits “IGNORE” as a woman named PEGGY 
           enters, all bitch:
                                 PEGGY
                        You know what would be good?  If you guys 
                        took a --
                              (finger quotes)
                        -- longer break.  

                                 SAM
                        Hey, Peg?  It'd be --
                              (finger quotes)
                        -- great if you didn't always speak with 
                        ironic -- 
                              (again:)
                        -- quotes around everything you said. 

                                 PEGGY
                        Quote... "fuck you."  Get outta my chair, 
                        Richards wants to see you.

           Now one of the fellas “oooohs” ominously, someone starts humming 
           the Darth Vader theme -- but Sam does a funny little ass-shake:  

                                 SAM
                        Oh no, friends, this is a victory lap.  
                        Know why he wants me?  I closed National 
                        Tire.  Suck it.

           He "humps" the table and sweeps up his winnings --  

           INT. RICHARDS’ OFFICE - DAY

           JIM RICHARDS, late forties, is absorbed in spreadsheets.  Sam 
           knocks and enters, grinning:

                                 SAM
                        I closed National Tire.  Million-two in 
                        product.

           Richards starts gathering things on his desk -- keys, coat -- 

                                 RICHARDS
                        You shipped a hundred thousand cases of 
                        Tomato Bisque to Ecuador.

                                 SAM
                              (beat: oh, that)
                        Northwest Soup had overstock, they had to 
                        dump. 

                                 RICHARDS
                        You shipped by train.

                                 SAM
                        Half as much as Air Freight.  What’s the 
                        prob--
                                 RICHARDS
                        -- through Mexico.  Hundred and fifteen 
                        degrees.  Every can exploded.  They said 
                        the freight car looked like a crime 
                        scene. 

                                 SAM
                              (a beat, thrown)
                        ... Shit.

                                 RICHARDS
                        Yeah, shit.

           Richards abruptly walks OUT as Sam's cell BUZZES, the same (213) 
           area code -- he hits “IGNORE,” following him out to:

           THE OUTER OFFICE

           Richards weaves through busy cubicles -- passing, first, his 
           SECRETARY:

                                 RICHARDS (CONT’D)
                        Dolores happy?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Very happy, sir.

                                 RICHARDS
                        Good.  
                              (chucks Sam’s shoulder)
                        Cause it’s all.  About.  Dolores.

           Sam’s brow furrows: who’s Dolores?  As he keeps FOLLOWING --

                                 SAM
                        Look, we’re fine, we transported through 
                        the buyers, we’re insured -- 

                                 RICHARDS
                        That’s not the problem: when you put a 
                        swimming pool’s worth of soup on a train 
                        to Ecuador in the middle of fucking 
                        summer and it goes bad, you violate about 
                        nine provisions of the Sanitary Food 
                        Transportation Act -- 
                              (notices a WORKER at a 
                               cubicle -- sees 
                               something on the guy’s 
                               screen)
                        Fix That.

           As they keep MOVING -- 
                                 SAM
                        It was canned, a hundred percent non-
                        perishable--

                                 RICHARDS
                        Til 99 percent of it spilled out of the 
                        fucking can.  You just handed the Federal 
                        Trade Commission a flashlight, my friend  
                        -- a klieg light -- which they’re all too 
                        eager to shine on us, even when we have 
                        nothing to hide... and everyone has 
                        something to hide. 

           Richards hits the elevator call button -- it opens -- he hits 
           down -- Sam shoots out an arm to STOP it from closing -- 

                                 SAM
                        I’ll go down to Northwest and talk to 
                        Phil Highmore, their VP of Sales, he 
                        loves me -- 

                                 RICHARDS
                        Who do you think’s threatening to call 
                        them?!  

                                 SAM
                              (losing ground)
                        I’ll-- I can throw him a deal on 
                        corrugated for his next shipment --

                                 RICHARDS
                        He doesn’t want corrugated.  He wants an 
                        addition to his house.  

                                 SAM
                        He... huh?

           The impatient elevator door BUZZES, so Sam steps in, it CLOSES:

           INT. ELEVATOR - RIDING DOWN - CONTINUOUS

                                 RICHARDS
                        New wife.  I dunno, she has some problem 
                        with the old master suite.  Needs a whole 
                        shitload of lumber.  Piping.  Hardware...

                                 SAM
                              (getting it now)
                        ... Dolores...

           Richards grins: bingo.  Door opens.  They cross --

           THE LOBBY
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re bribing Phil Highmore not to 
                        report us to the FTC by buying him an 
                        addition to his house?   

                                 RICHARDS
                        Actually, you are.  You said a million-
                        two from National Tire?  That's an 
                        $84,000 commission.  Buys a lot of wood. 

           Sam STOPS cold, as Richards exits the lobby through a door -- 

                                 SAM
                        Whoa... wait, nonono --

           -- he follows through the door into:

           THE PARKING LOT

           Where Richards is approaching his shiny red Porsche GT3 --  
           BLEEP-BLIP as he keys off the alarm:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, no, I'm not giving away my 
                        commission, that money’s mine --

                                 RICHARDS
                        Actually, it’s mine, unless and until I 
                        decide to give it to you.  Read your 
                        contract: your commission’s 
                        discretionary, and my discretion tells me 
                        if I lose my business over tomato soup?  
                        I will murder you with an axe.

           He gets in his car.  VROOOOM goes the engine.

                                 SAM
                        ... please, Man... I need that money...

                                 RICHARDS
                        Then work harder.  

           And DRIVES OFF, leaving Sam standing in the parking lot.  He 
           looks down: Richards was in a handicapped spot.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DUSK

           Sunset over the Brooklyn Bridge.  A shitty '97 Chrysler drives 
           across.  Sam at the wheel, wide-eyed.  Now what?

           INT. SAM'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - RED HOOK, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           Sam unlocks his apartment mailbox.  Just BILLS.  A COLLECTION 
           AGENCY NOTICE.  Fuuuuck.
           INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sam enters the starter apartment he's about 4 years too old for.  
           Down the hall, a WOMAN rises from a chair.  Ashen.  HANNAH 
           LINSON, late 20's.  Tolerant, kind, and cool -- always hoping 
           for the best in Sam.  He can tell by her posture:

                                 SAM
                        -- what?  What’s wrong.

                                 HANNAH
                        Your mom’s been trying you...

           Hannah stares, wishing she didn't have to say the words she's 
           about to... and before we get to hear them, CUT TO:

           INT. SAM AND HANNAH'S APARTMENT - RED HOOK - NIGHT

           "Be Remembered.Com/ Order 7-10 Minute Custom Eulogy for $100.00/ 
           24 hr. Assistance."  

           In CLOSE UP, a blinking cursor next to "DECEASED:"  Then, the 
           cursor types: "FATHER."  Slowly, we ANGLE AROUND to... SAM, face 
           lit by the screen's blue glow.  Expression strangely distant.  
           Whatever it is, it runs pretty deep.  He scans the site's 
           "Family Typology" section, reading OPTIONS: 

           1.) Balanced.  2.) Traditional.  3.) Disconnected.             
           4.) Emotionally Strained.  He clicks 2.  Then 3.  And... 4. 

           Hannah enters.  Sam instantly CLICKS to a different window, 
           hiding the site.  She slips her arms around him from behind... 
           kisses his neck compassionately... he half-smiles:

                                 SAM
                        You don't have to come.  I'll be back in 
                        48 hours.

           Hannah.  Taken aback.  Pulls away... 

                                 HANNAH
                        Of course I'm coming.  

           He shifts around to her, bigger smile now, re-calibrating:

                                 SAM
                        Came out wrong.  I told you, we, uh... 
                        weren't close.  I haven't been home in a 
                        while.  It's 48 hours, in and out.  
                              (as if that clinched it)
                        But thank you.

           She just blinks:
                                 HANNAH
                        "Thank you" is for when someone hands you 
                        a fork.  
                              (soft, but tough)
                        I'm coming.

           A fight he isn't prepared to fight and surely won't win.  Covers 
           with an uneasy smile.  The sound of a JET ROAR rises -- 

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - TERMINAL - MORNING

           JFK at morning rush hour.  Sam and Hannah reach the front of the 
           check-in line.  She gives the e-ticket to the attendant:

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Picture ID's?

           Hannah hands hers over.  Sam reaches for his wallet -- it isn't 
           in his pocket -- he searches -- 

                                 SAM
                        Shit, oh, man -- don't do this to me --

                                 HANNAH
                        Check your bag -- 

                                 SAM 
                              (he does; to the 
                               attendant)
                        Look, I... think I... don’t have it.  

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Sir, we can’t let you board the plane 
                        without ID -- 

                                                       HANNAH
                        SAM
           -- what?  Really?
                                           -- wait, no wait -- it's his 
                                           dad’s funeral -- 

                                 ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
                        I'm so sorry, but it’s a federal law -- 

           Hannah gets more upset, Sam protests, as we DRIFT AWAY... MUSIC: 
           The Duchess And The Duke's "Out Of Time" --

           LATER: Hannah watches Sam pace, on his cell, leaving a MESSAGE 
           for his mother: "I'm really sorry, we'll try and get the next 
           flight..."  Hannah's heart breaks.  What a cruel act of fate.

           EXT. "PARK-'N-RIDE" LONG TERM PARKING LOT - DAY

           Sam's car is parked in an endless lot.  The trunk pops OPEN as 
           he loads his bag in, moves to the driver's side, gets in... 
           ANGLE - THE REARVIEW - SAM'S EYES

           FLICK UP to make sure Hannah's still loading the trunk -- his 
           arm shoots to the glove box -- and there it is:

           HIS WALLET

           He knew where it was all along.  Drops it under his seat as she 
           gets in... he starts the car, as she looks down and notices:

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh shit!  There it is -- oh my god -- 

                                 SAM
                              ("realizes" too)
                        ... oh...

                                 HANNAH
                        We can still make it -- 

                                 SAM
                        That was the last flight -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        Nono, there's the one from Denver that 
                        got delayed -- we can catch it and maybe 
                        get in on time -- at least close. 

                                 SAM
                        ... Uh... sure.  Absolutely.  

           But he pauses strangely... then gets out like a shot, as if 
           she's lagging.  Hannah holds a beat, sensing something odd but 
           unsure what... as out the window, A PLANE rises into the sky...  

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                        Some things our human will cannot change, 
                        no matter how much we wish, or try...

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A MINISTER at a podium, beside a casket. The mourners are an odd 
           lot: ex-Music Industry types, old-school 70’s and 80’s outcasts. 
           We drift to a WOMAN, alone in the front pew:

                                 MINISTER
                        Certainly you, Lillian, did the right 
                        things in caring for Jerry...

           This is LILLIAN HARPER: once extremely beautiful, in her fifties 
           she's still very striking with an almost soldierly quality of 
           "anything's possible when you're in control."
                                 MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        ... you worked magic to give meaning to 
                        his life, three times as long as medical 
                        people believed possible... but magic is 
                        never enough.

           Lillian glances at the empty seat beside her: no Sam.  A few 
           people stare sympathetically.  She keeps her head high.

           INT. TAXI - LOS ANGELES - MOVING - NIGHT 

           LOS ANGELES reveals itself in REFLECTIONS off a taxi window.  
           RACK FOCUS TO SAM, as the cab stops in front of a run-down 
           Craftsman in the Miracle Mile.  One he was on bad terms with 
           when he left.  Hannah squeezes his hand:

                                 HANNAH
                        What do you need?

                                 SAM
                              (long beat)
                        An escape hatch.

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A catering crew carries out rental chairs, passing Sam and 
           Hannah in the doorway.  One of them stops, apologetically...

                                 CATERER
                        The wake's sort of over.

                                 SAM
                        I sort of live here.

           He drops his bags and looks around: swap-meet couch, mismatched 
           furniture, debris from the wake... a surreal homecoming.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE on a pair of scissors, held by Lillian as she cuts out an 
           article: "JERRY HARPER, RECORD PRODUCER, DIES AT 63."  A stamp-
           sized PHOTO of JERRY HARPER in younger, happier times.

                                 SAM  (O.S.)
                        ... Hi, Mom.

           She looks up.  He enters sheepishly.  Her eyes are cold and 
           mournful.  Not just because of the funeral.  

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I left a message.

                                 LILLIAN
                        I got it.  
                                 SAM
                        I'm sorry.

                                 LILLIAN
                              (not an apology)
                        So am I.  

           She seems to be clenching those SCISSORS still in her hand.  
           Neither of them move toward each other.

                                 SAM
                        ... this is Hannah.

                                 HANNAH
                              (a little too big)
                        I'm so sorry...

           But feeling she's already flubbed it, Hannah's suddenly TEARING 
           UP.  Sam STIFFENS as she instantly shakes it off, embarrassed, 
           another strike-out on the first impression checklist:

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I mean I'm sorry for your loss, not-- 

           -- but Lillian HUGS Hannah, putting her at ease, genuine warmth:

                                 LILLIAN
                        Don't be.  Now I have a face to the 
                        voice.  

                                 HANNAH
                        I should be hugging you... 

                                 LILLIAN
                        I'm glad you're here.  Sam didn't tell me 
                        you were coming.  

           They both look over at him -- suddenly, unexpectedly, unified.  
           Hannah's eyes say: you didn't?

                                 SAM
                        Yes I did.

                                 LILLIAN
                        No.  You didn't.  

           Awkward silence.  Hannah cuts in, trying for "light" -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        We, uh, screamed at the American Airlines 
                        Supervisor -- I’m pretty sure we’re on a 
                        government watch-list now.
                                 LILLIAN
                        How long are you staying?

                                 SAM
                        Gotta get back soon.  Hannah's got a law 
                        school interview.

           Hannah's face goes slack.  Now he's using her as an excuse?

                                 LILLIAN
                        I thought Sam said you were acting...?

                                 HANNAH 
                        No, that didn't... I'm clearly not very 
                        good.  Kinda came to terms with reality.  
                        It's actually a nicer place than I 
                        thought it would be. 

           That registers on Lillian.  A sensible girl.

                                 LILLIAN
                        Well, your parents must be proud.  I 
                        don't think I know where you're from?  

                                 HANNAH 
                        Georgia.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        Huh.  Get home to them much?

                                 SAM
                              ("stop")
                        Mom.

           Silence.  Hannah takes the cue to excuse herself.  Sam stares: 
           "don't leave."  But she's already gone.  Lillian turns away, 
           abruptly busies herself with dishes:

                                 LILLIAN
                        He would've liked her.

           Guilty, he joins her, washing dishes together.  Saying nothing.  
           Finally, he turns toward her just as she turns; the plate's 
           knocked out of her hand -- CRASHES to the ground.  Sam looks 
           down at the broken pieces, looks up at her... and suddenly she 
           SLAPS him.  Fucking hard.  All he can do is stare back, mute and 
           yielding.  And for the longest time, nothing is said... until:

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Linens are in the closet upstairs. 
                              (a squeak of affection)
                        I’m glad you’re home.

           And gone.  Sam stands there.  Wanting to run.
           INT. LINEN CLOSET - NIGHT

           The closet OPENS revealing Sam staring in.  Looking for towels, 
           he's hit with a whole lot more: pill bottles, catheter tubes, 
           adult diapers.  A bag of JOINTS (medical weed).  The thundering 
           reality of all he’s missed comes crashing.  He grabs towels and 
           quickly SHUTS the door --

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

           RECORD ALBUMS stacked in floor-to-ceiling bookcases.  Thousands 
           of LP's stored in plastic covers.  Jerry's beloved, decades-old 
           collection.  Hannah, in awe, drifts past file labels: “RARE 
           JAZZ.”  “BLUES.”  “FUSION.”  “KLEZMER.”  “ONE HIT WONDERS.”  And 
           there are PHOTOS.  Jerry -- with Captain Beefheart, Grace Slick, 
           Charlie Mingus.  Sam appears, hanging up his cell -- staring at 
           it with strange curiosity:  

                                 HANNAH
                        -- “Hannah’s gotta get back for an 
                        interview?”  Really?  

                                 SAM
                        I didn’t know what to say.

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s a first.

           He looks at her, apologetic.  After a beat she relents, waves 
           her hand in a priest's absolution...  

                                 SAM
                        Got a message from dad's lawyer, he wants 
                        to see me about the will.  Can you stay 
                        with Lillian in the morning?  

           She nods, okay.  Gestures to the photos:

                                 HANNAH
                        Grace Slick?  

           He looks around, confronting the pictures warily:

                                 SAM
                        He managed 'em for like five minutes, 
                        before they dumped him and 'broke.'

           Something on the desk catches his eye.  Among the photos, 
           there's one of Sam as a kid, looking up at his stoic dad with a 
           worshipful gaze.  Hannah comes up behind him, softly:

                                 HANNAH
                        ... what?
                                 SAM
                        No, I'm just-- it's stupid.  I had this 
                        flash of... we used to go to this park on 
                        Sundays.  It was like our one ‘thing’ 
                        when I was a kid.

                                 HANNAH
                              (encouraging)
                        ... that’s nice...

                                 SAM
                        He never got out of the car.  

           She looks at him.  Confused.  He shrugs off-handedly:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        He'd sit and watch me so he could listen 
                        to demos.  But hey, y'know, that's how he 
                        discovered Kajagoogoo.  So he did make a 
                        major contribution to the human race.

           He turns off the light, ending the conversation.  BLACK.  

           INT. GARAGE - NEXT MORNING

           LIGHT FLOODS THE SCREEN as the garage door slides up, revealing 
           Mom's beat-up Volvo... then Dad's cherry red 1970 Mercedes 280 
           SL.  Mint.  Sam's eyes light up -- CUE HARD-DRIVING GUITAR:

           Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song."  A keychain hangs on a tool rack: 
           two eighth notes having sex, the phrase: "Musicians Do It With 
           Rhythm."  Sam swipes the keys --

           EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - MORNING

           The Benz whizzes down the street as Robert Plant screams his 
           wild abandon wail.  Sam burns right through a "Stop" sign, 
           oblivious --  

           INT. ART'S DELI - DAY

           We're watching from a distance as Sam stiffly shakes hands with 
           ISAAC RAFFERTY, Jerry's lawyer.  LATER: they're mid-conversation 
           at a booth.  Sam's knee bounces:

                                 ISAAC
                        Under reciprocal beneficiary law, the 
                        house and its personal effects go to your 
                        mom... he left you his record collection, 
                        valued in excess of thirty thousand 
                        dollars.  That figure's from a 1987 
                        appraisal, so it's probably appreciated.

           Sam's motor revs to speed, sensing the inevitable fuck-over:
                                 SAM
                        Wow.  His records.  They come with the 
                        discwasher brushes?  

                                 ISAAC
                        There’s something else.  

                                 SAM
                        Eight tracks?  No, really, they should go 
                        to The Smithsonian...  

           Isaac just stares.  POPS open a briefcase, takes out a manila 
           BANK ENVELOPE.  Slides it across the table... 

                                 ISAAC
                        It's a key to a deposit box.  A week ago 
                        he asked me to come see him.  His life 
                        insurance was anemic, his will was a  
                        mess -- he wanted me to add that in a 
                        codicil, an addendum.  Then he told me to 
                        give it to you.  

                                 SAM
                              (confused beat)
                        ... what's in the box?

                                 ISAAC
                        You’ll have to open it.

                                 SAM
                        You won’t tell me?

                                 ISAAC
                        He wouldn't tell me.

                                 SAM
                        What d’you mean “he wouldn’t tell you?”  
                        He gave you the key.

                                 ISAAC
                        He wasn't very coherent.  All he said 
                        was... it was something he'd been working 
                        on a long time.  And that you'd 
                        understand.  

           This is suddenly fucking weird.  Sam blurts a nervous CHUCKLE:

                                 SAM
                        Well Mom knows, I mean--

                                 ISAAC
                        -- that’s why I wanted us to talk 
                        privately.  He didn't want her to know.  
           Sam feels the ground slipping out from under him, but doesn't 
           have a clue why.  His eyes drift to his father's car keys on the 
           table -- the eighth notes fucking and the stupid "Musicians Do 
           It With Rhythm" slogan... 

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Look... I knew him 35 years.  He was a 
                        great guy, a connector, a spark plug -- 
                        but the only thing you could count on him 
                        to do was make messes.  Your mother, me -- 
                        we always cleaned up.  I remember a 
                        night... he took me out, we met Charlie 
                        Mingus, Joan Baez, and some Congressman 
                        from Chicago; Jerry stiffed me for a 600 
                        dollar bar tab, I had to fish his watch 
                        out of a sewer grate and confiscate his 
                        car keys.
                              (beat)
                        Whatever's in that box, if he kept it 
                        from your mom too... I thought you should 
                        have the benefit of being prepared.  

           Sam's in the Twilight Zone -- and starting to feel scared:

           INT. WELLS FARGO BANK - VARIOUS - DAY

           The DEPOSIT BOX KEY inserts in a lock.  The BOX is pulled from 
           the wall.  Alone, Sam stares at the closed lid, bracing 
           himself... lifts it to find... 

           AN OLD, WORN "BAY RUM" LEATHER SHAVING DOP-KIT.  The hell?  He 
           pulls it out.  Something's inside.  He unzips it, flips it OPEN:

           STACKS OF MONEY.  Thousands and thousands of dollars haphazardly 
           rolled in rubber bands.  And a HANDWRITTEN NOTE: 

                              Please get this to Josh Davis.

                      Regal Arms Apartments, #2A, 1124 S. Reseda Blvd

                                  Take care of them.

                                                                  - J

           ON SAM.  His eyes dance over the note, trying to make SENSE.  
           Keeps coming back to that name: "Josh Davis."  Says OUT LOUD:

                                 SAM
                        -- who the fuck.
           EXT. MULHOLLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL - POOL AREA - DAY

           JOSHUA DAVIS, 12, stringy spiky hair, is huddled by a POOL with 
           a group of BOYS (DANNY, SIMON, DEREK).  In Josh's hand is a 
           brown crystalline rock -- 

                                 DANNY
                        -- what is it, crack?

                                 JOSH
                        Wish.  Sodium from the science lab.  It 
                        hits the pool, it'll totally detonate.

                                 DEREK
                        Bullshit.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m telling you, it’s chemical.

           To prove his point, Josh HURLS the sodium rock into the pool -- 
           it hits with a BLOINK and sinks... nothing.  The boys lean over 
           the edge, waiting... the rock bubbles like Alka-Seltzer:

                                 SIMON
                        Shit.  Shit.

                                 DEREK
                        I told you noth--

           KA-BOOOOOOM!  They’re FLUNG BACKWARD in a shower of plaster 
           fragments.  The FIRE ALARM sounds -- the kids pick themselves 
           up, dazed but okay... to find A HUGE CHUNK is gone from the side 
           of the pool.  Water POURS out, spreading over the ground:

                                 DEREK (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit!

           The other boys RUN.  Riveted, Josh stares down into the water:

           ANGLE -- UNDERWATER -- RIPPLING -- ON JOSH

           His grinning face distorted, as MUFFLED SOUND is heard: the 
           ALARM, racing footsteps -- it comes to a CRESCENDO as:

           EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           SCREECH!  A beat-up Jetta BREAKS HARD behind a line of carpool 
           moms.  Out comes a woman in a mini-skirt and heels: 

           FRANKIE DAVIS, 30: capable and strong-willed, damaged but 
           proud... and smart as they come.  Since 19, she's been groping 
           through single motherhood, slowly lowering expectations that 
           life won't disappoint.  Today isn't helping.
           Frankie catches disapproving stares from the moms and grabs a 
           cardigan from the backseat, trying to hide her cleavage -- which 
           only makes it more conspicuous.  Stalks onward, head high. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

           Frankie sits across from a principal: MRS. HANEY -- a bottom-
           line civil servant with a hostile gaze.  Frankie SMILES against 
           it, working to make some kind of in-road:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m sure you deal with your share of 
                        working moms -- more than your share, 
                        trying to raise a-- 

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        -- vandalism, destruction of school 
                        property -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- I know it's my fault, you’re right to 
                        think that.
                              (the woman's eyes go to 
                               her cleavage)
                        I tend bar.  
                              (no response)
                        So we can figure something out, right?  

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        Ms. Davis --

                                 FRANKIE
                              (sweetly)
                        Frankie. 

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        I’m not interested in being “disarmed.”  
                        Nothing you can say is relevant to Josh's 
                        expulsion --  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Expul -- are you seriously thinking of--

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        You expected a slap on the wrist?  
                        Policies are policies.

           And that’s that.  Except, it isn’t.  Backed against a wall, 
           Frankie’s gears TURN -- suddenly very calm, focused:  

                                 FRANKIE 
                        Where’d Josh get the sodium?
                                 MRS. HANEY 
                              (beat; nervously)
                        Obviously from the science lab -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Is that one of your “policies?”  Leaving 
                        explosive material out for kids to, 
                        y'know, toss in a pool?  

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        I’m sure you’d like to shift the blame 
                        here to--

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- his teachers?  ‘Cause I wonder where 
                        he learned it explodes in water -- 

                                 MRS. HANEY
                        I don’t like your tone -- 

                                 FRANKIE 
                        I don’t like your lazy-ass rules, which 
                        were -- thank God -- uncovered by my son 
                        before someone lost an eye.  Or a hand.  
                        Or a shitload of Board of Ed funding.  
                        ‘Cause some parent just might be worried 
                        enough to find a lawyer -- like the tough 
                        pro-bono ones who stare at my tits all 
                        night in the bar.  

           Frankie holds her gaze, as she unbuttons one more button on her 
           blouse to show even MORE boob.  A power play.  Grins:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Y'know what I mean?

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           And WHAM, on the cut Frankie YANKS Josh clumsily out the door, 
           her cool reserve suddenly and completely gone around her son:

                                 JOSH
                        OW!  You're hurting me!  Don't!

           INT. FRANKIE'S CAR - DAY

           Josh chews gum obnoxiously as Frankie weaves through traffic -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What is the matter with you?!

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever.
                                 FRANKIE
                        NOT "whatever!"  This is where you thank 
                        me for getting your principal not to 
                        expel you.  How'm I gonna pay for that 
                        pool, huh?!  And she wants you to see a 
                        shrink, are you kidding me?

                                 JOSH
                        I'm not doing that, Carol -- 

           Carol?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, you ARE!  Cause it's that or they 
                        ship you off to a school for teenage 
                        rapists and retards!  Is that what you 
                        want?!

                                 JOSH
                        ... no.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I ASKED YOU A QUESTION!

                                 JOSH
                        I said NO!  

           The car WHIPS ON through frame as -- 

           EXT. R GAL ARMS APARTMENTS - VAN NUYS - DAY

           The "REGAL ARMS" with the "E" missing.  Sam pulls up, nervously 
           grabs the Bay Rum dop kit (full of cash) off the passenger seat.  
           Locks it in the trunk.  Moves to the DIRECTORY and finds:

           "2A............ DAVIS."  Starts climbing to the upper landing.  
           Moves to "2A."  Pinned to the front is an old CHRISTMAS 
           DECORATION.  A string of SLEIGH BELLS, rusted brown.  It's June.  

           He peers through the window: no one's home.  SOUND of BRAKES 
           below.  Frankie's Jetta has pulled up -- she and Josh get out.  
           As they approach, Sam retreats around the corner... witnessing 
           these strangers for the first time:

                      FRANKIE
                                                        JOSH 

                                           -- whatever, Carol -- 
           Get inside!  No TV, no 
           computer --
           -- cut the 'Carol' shit -- and 
           stop saying 'whatever,' I'm 
           sick of it!
                                           -- Whatever, CAROL -- 
                                              (she GRABS his arm)
                                           Get off, you stupid bitch!
           -- Don't you EVER talk to me 
           like that!  I'm your mother, 
           don't you ever!
           Josh shakes free, runs in -- she races after him.  Sam 
           reapproaches the window, sees Josh SLAM the door to his room, 
           Frankie SHAKING the handle:

                                 FRANKIE
                        OPEN THE DOOR, JOSH! 

           INT. JOSH'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Josh backs away from the door.  Actually scared, knowing he 
           messed up as his mom SHOUTS at him from the other side:

                                 FRANKIE (O.S.)
                        OKAY, STAY IN THERE CAUSE YOU'RE 
                        SERIOUSLY GROUNDED, D'YOU HEAR ME?!  

           EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           SAM'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW: Frankie's phone RINGS.  She snatches 
           it angrily:

                                 FRANKIE
                        'lo?
                              (flustered beat)
                        Hey, Jenny, can I call you back?  It's a 
                        really bad-- whu?  What article?

           The voice on the other end says something that stops her cold.  
           She listens... then blurts a weird LAUGH.  Nodding... 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        -- no, I'm okay, I'm okay -- don't worry.   
                              (listens)
                        Okay, I'll go right now.  Call you later.

           Hangs up.  Mind spinning.  Shaky.  Strangely vulnerable.  

           AT THE WINDOW, Sam still watches.  Her intensity draws him 
           deeper.  And SUDDENLY -- 

           Frankie exhales a big breath and SWEEPS her hands in front of 
           her face, literally clearing the air -- TURNS toward the window  
           -- Sam DUCKS -- shit -- she's heading for the door -- 

           EXT. APARTMENTS - CONTINUOUS

           Sam hides around a corner as Frankie BURSTS out onto the upper 
           landing -- KNOCKS on a neighbor's door.  TED answers: mid 30's, 
           very good looking in a boyish sort of way.  His UNIFORM tells us 
           he's a security guard who's off-duty:

                                 TED
                        Frankie, hey -- 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry, Ted, d'you have yesterday's 
                        newspaper? 

           -- as he RUMMAGES, finds the PAPER on a table -- 

                                 TED
                        Which section?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I dunno -- 

           As she, somewhat frantically, tears through sections -- 

                                 TED
                        Must really need that horoscope, huh?

           SAM peers out around the corner -- watching her scour the paper.  
           Now she finds it under "Local News."  The SAME ARTICLE Lillian 
           was cutting out: "JERRY HARPER, RECORD PRODUCER, DIES AT 63."

           FRANKIE'S FACE.  Sees Jerry's face in the photo.  She's shaken, 
           but strangely distant.  Impossible to read.  

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Frankie? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Can I keep this?

                                 TED
                        You okay?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Any chance you can watch Josh for like an 
                        hour?  Last time, promise, it's kind of 
                        an emergency... 
                              (before he can really 
                               nod)
                        You're a life-saver, thanks -- 

           As she quickly moves off -- 

                                 TED
                        But so... maybe we could have dinner 
                        sometime?  Or something?

           Frankie's caught.  Ted laughs a little self-deprecating laugh at 
           his own bad timing...  

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... yeah, sure.  Back in a hour, kay?

           Ducks into her apartment, grabs her keys and SHOUTS: 
                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Josh!  I gotta go out, Ted's next door -- 
                        do not leave or I swear to God!

           She exits as fast as possible, gets in her car.  SAM PURSUES -- 
           moving fast -- hops in the Benz, starts to follow her... 

           INT. THE BENZ - MOVING - DAY

           Sam drives fast, trying to keep up with the Jetta.  His cell 
           rings: "ATWOOD/RICHARDS & ASSOC."  Lets it go to voicemail, then 
           listens to the message:

                                 RICHARDS
                        Where are you, Harper?  Phil Highmore 
                        says if we don't get him what he needs by 
                        the end of the week, he's "slinging" us 
                        at the FTC -- so my condolences on your 
                        father, but get the fuck back here NOW -- 
                              (as he hangs up)
                        Cindy, this goddamn BLT doesn't have any 
                        avoca--

           CLICK.  This isn't helping the tailspin Sam's already in -- as 
           up ahead, Frankie approaches an intersection -- distracted, Sam 
           looks up -- YELLOW LIGHT -- she SPEEDS UP, runs the red.  Sam's 
           forced to do the same or lose her.  Horns HONK --

           EXT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

           Frankie's car pulls into a CHURCH PARKING LOT.  She gets out 
           urgently, goes inside.  Sam pulls in... scans the sketchy 
           neighborhood and decides not to leave the money in the car.  
           Grabs the leather dop kit from the trunk, follows her into...

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A full room of people in folding chairs.  It's an AA meeting.  
           Frankie enters, takes a seat.  Sam sits a few rows behind her, 
           staring intently at the back of her head.  What's he doing here?  

           A MAN is sharing at the podium -- kind face, humble:

                                 GUY
                        -- and he says, 'That wasn't coke, Man, 
                        it’s my wife's powdered acrylic nail 
                        polish remover.'  Hardened in my nose... 
                        to a fuckin' bee-utiful shine...
                              (couple small laughs)
                        Doctor said I was lucky to get air into 
                        my lungs... anyway, I went from the 
                        business end of a nail file to a steady 
                        job and a happy marriage ‘cause of these 
                        rooms, so... thanks.
           Applause. 

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        Thanks, Brian.  Before we take a break, 
                        does anyone have a 'Burning Desire'?

           Frankie's hand SHOOTS UP.  Takes the podium, newspaper in hand:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hi.  My name’s Frankie and I’m an 
                        alcoholic.

           Voices: “HI, FRANKIE.”  She sniffs, manic -- her words tumble: 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t planning on coming today.  
                        Supposed to be at work, at the bar.  
                        Temptation being the mother of all... 
                        something something, I forget.  But the 
                        timing wasn’t so hot for my ‘fearless 
                        moral inventory’ this month.  Neither's 
                        my bank balance.  Or imbalance.  
                        Whatever, pays the bills.  I don’t really 
                        have any office skills anyway.  Plus I’ve 
                        had myself on a sort of... hermit/ house 
                        arrest/ horticultural program.  So it’s--
                              (looks up)
                        -- are these full-spectrum fluorescent 
                        lights?  Jesus.  Unsurvivable.  

           All she wants to do is CRY.  But she reels it in, defying it:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I feel a 'Burning Desire.'  Big fuckin' 
                        emphasis on ‘Burning.’  I mean, am I 
                        gonna put a bullet in my head?  No.  But 
                        I’d definitely love to hit the 'fuck it' 
                        button and get faded... which I guess is 
                        the same thing.  

           People wait patiently.  Frankie EXHALES a nervous breath:

                        My son blew up a pool at school today.  
                        With salt.  Yup, Mr. Wizard turned a 
                        condiment into a bomb.  And I'm screaming 
                        my lungs out at him, and he’s hating me 
                        for being his mother -- direct quote -- 
                        then I get a call from my sponsor who 
                        tells me-- well, here:

           She SLAPS the paper on the podium.  Reads the article aloud:
                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        “American record producer Jerry Harper 
                        died in Los Angeles Tuesday after a long 
                        battle with cancer.  He was 63.”
                              (beat, taking it in now)
                        Cancer... shit.  
                              (then)
                        “Harper was known as a pioneering 
                        producer and A&R man who never achieved 
                        the fame or credit he deserved.”

           To that last line, she half LAUGHS, half SNARLS.  Then steels 
           herself for whatever she's about to read next... 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        “He is survived by his wife and son.”
                              (closes paper)
                        So unless I just got a sex change, it’s 
                        official: I don’t exist.  Woo-hoo!  

           ON SAM.  He leans forward.  Confused, alerted to something -- 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Guess the editors at the LA Times are 
                        even bigger pricks than my dad was.

           Sam’s face.  What’d she just say?  Her dad?

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway.  I feel... numb is all.  I feel 
                        nothing.  So why is it I want five or 
                        twelve dirty martinis to drown out 
                        something I can’t even feel in the first 
                        place? 

           She takes a quick, cleansing breath:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Huuuuuuh.  Blah blah.  Fuck it.  
                              (beat)
                        All right.  All I got.  Thanks a lot.

           APPLAUSE.  

           Sam.  Stone cold SHOCK.  Brain overload.  Holy shit.  He BOLTS --

           INT. CHURCH BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- and BURSTS into a stall, locks the door, sits there clinging 
           to the dop kit -- his wide-eyed look conveys the blunt reality 
           he's only beginning to understand: 
           1.) Jerry's her father too.                                      
           2.) Josh is his nephew.                                           
           3.) Frankie’s his fucking sister.

           Outside, people spill out for the break.  A few enter the 
           bathroom, talking, laughing outside Sam's stall.  He just sits 
           there, paralyzed... 

           EXT. CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY 

           A fog of cigarette smoke hangs over the AA crowd.  People thank 
           Frankie for her share, she smiles appreciatively, still raw.  
           Sam walks out.  She senses someone looking at her and turns.  He 
           stiffens with the dop kit, smiles vaguely, adrenaline pumping:

                                 SAM
                        ... hi.

           She lights a new smoke off her near-dead cigarette butt:

                                 FRANKIE
                        You new?

                                 SAM
                              (like he's caught)
                        Knew what?

                                 FRANKIE
                        No, N-E-W -- a newcomer--?  I've never 
                        seen you at this meeting.

           His words tumble out, a thoroughbred bullshit artist:

                                 SAM
                        Oh, this meeting, this one, no; started 
                        in Tarzana... moved over to Culver 
                        City... Studio City was way too sceney.  
                        But I heard great things about this one.  
                        I try to move around, helps me to-- to-- 
                        to --
                              (he's running out of 
                               gas)

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... stay anonymous...

                                 SAM
                        Yes.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You picked a good group.  Lots of em are 
                        packed with industry losers.  It's like, 
                        I'm not trying to get a job writing for 
                        your suck-ass sitcom, y'know?  
                                 SAM
                        The worst.

           A moment.  She offers him the pack: only one left.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        It's your last one.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I can pretend I didn't smoke the whole 
                        pack.

           He takes it.  She lights her smoke, then his, TOUCHING HIS HAND 
           to cover her lighter from the wind.  CLOSE on Sam's face -- it's 
           an intense moment he tries to conceal.  

                                 SAM
                        ... I'm Sam.

                                 FRANKIE 
                        Whoops, there goes anonymous. 
                              (small smile)
                        Frankie.  

           People start heading back inside.  Before Frankie joins them, 
           she throws Sam an encouraging nod:  

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Welcome.  If you decide to stay.

           An unexpected kindness.  This is like being in a waking dream.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah, thanks... we'll see... 

                                 FRANKIE
                              (re: the dop kit)
                        And you don't really need to bring your 
                        toiletries next time.

           As he watches her walk off, all he wants to do is STOP her... 
           but she disappears inside with the crowd.  Sam stands there.  
           What just happened?  

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - DUSK

           Hannah sits in the kitchen, waiting.  The back door opens and 
           Sam enters, freaking, hoping not to run into Lillian -- both 
           start talking AT ONCE:

                       HANNAH
                                                         SAM
                                           -- where's mom?
           Cell phones: the great thing 
           is, you can turn them on -- 
                                 HANNAH
                        Upstairs: why do you have aneurysm-face?

                                 SAM
                        Come outside with me.  Please.

           Something in his voice.  She's starting to get a little scared -- 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           THUD!  Sam drops the shaving kit on the car hood, unzips it, 
           wide enough to show Hannah the cash.  She looks at it.  At him.  

                                 SAM
                        How awesome is this?  I mean, how 
                        spectacular a move is this?

                                 HANNAH
                        ... what is that?

                                 SAM
                        A hundred and fifty grand.

                                 HANNAH
                              (mind spinning)
                        Your dad left it to you?

                                 SAM
                        To a kid... whose mother's my--
                              (he can't say the word 
                               "sister")
                        -- in theory, the kid's my nephew. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What're you talking about?  What nephew, 
                        you don't have a brother or a sis--

                                 SAM
                        -- guess what?  I do now -- 

           INT. LILLIAN'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Lillian pulls back a curtain to see the silhouettes of Sam and 
           Hannah in the garage.  Sam gesticulating, Hannah reacting.  
           Lillian strains, but can't hear what they're saying:

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

                                 SAM
                        -- first I thought she was his mistress --

                                 HANNAH
                        -- tell me again what she said, word for 
                        word-- 
                                 SAM
                        -- that he's her father, that’s all I 
                        know -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        -- oh my God, your mom... what're you 
                        gonna say?

                                 SAM
                        "Surprise!  Dad started his own Partridge 
                        Family!"  I don’t know --

                                 HANNAH
                        -- well she’s gonna find out you’re 
                        giving away her husband's money -- 

                                 SAM
                        -- I'm not giving away shit.

           She stares.  What?  Trying to absorb -- 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m the legitimate one. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Are you... serious?

                                 SAM
                        Four hours ago they didn't even exist -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        She’s got a kid -- 

                                 SAM
                        He left me shit.  I need this, you don't 
                        know how fucked I am -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        Honey... just-- I know this is insane, 
                        but he obviously cared enough to--

                                 SAM
                        -- don't do that, I was invisible to that 
                        man.

                                 HANNAH
                        Maybe he’s trying to make up for it --

                                 SAM
                        Like this?  A hundred fifty grand in a 
                        shaving kit for some alcoholic love child 
                        he neglected to mention?  Which I’m now 
                        required to hand over with a smile on my 
                        face?  
                                 HANNAH
                        Hey, I'm not the bad guy here -- 

                                 SAM
                        You don't get what I'm telling you: I'm 
                        buried under a shitpile of debt -- I was 
                        gonna get this commission to help dig me 
                        out except now Phil Highmore's new wife 
                        needs an addition to her deck and-- 

                                 HANNAH
                              (so confused)
                        -- who the hell is Phil Highmore--?

                                 SAM
                        National soup, just got remarried, 
                        doesn't matter: point is I need that 
                        money -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        The point is she's your sister -- 

                                 SAM
                        I don't have a sister, I have collection 
                        agencies up my ass!  So excuse me if I 
                        sound selfish or, y’know, insensitive, 
                        but a thimble of Goddamn understanding 
                        would be nice.

           He’s so blind with rage he doesn’t see how much he STUNG her:

                                 HANNAH
                        So... your family has to pay because you 
                        can't figure out what you wanna be when 
                        you grow up?

                                 SAM
                        They're not my fucking family.  I knew we 
                        shouldn't have come out here --

           And Hannah freezes.  Realizing something in this instant with 
           chilling clarity -- literally steps back:

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh my God... under the seat...

           He looks at her, not understanding:

                                 SAM
                        ... what?

                                 HANNAH
                        You left your wallet in the car on 
                        purpose so you could avoid coming here.  
                                 SAM
                        Okay, that is bullshit--

                                 HANNAH
                        Yes, it is.  It's complete fucking 
                        bullshit --

                   HANNAH (CONT’D)
                                                         SAM
           -- you shoved it under your 
           seat cause you were too much 
           of a pussy to go to your dad's 
           funeral!!!
                                           -- you saw me find it -- you 
                                           witnessed the moment where I 
                                           was like 'hey, there it is'... 
                                           that's what happens when you 
                                           find things!

           She spins -- stalking past him -- he PURSUES -- 

                                 SAM
                        -- where're you going --?  This is ridic--

                                 HANNAH
                        Why'd you run me through that whole 
                        charade at the airport?  Why'd you even 
                        get on the plane?!  I mean who the hell 
                        are you?  

           And BAM -- she's taking off -- 

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           A taxi driver puts Hannah's suitcase in the trunk.  As she gets 
           in the cab, he touches her arm -- 

                                 SAM
                        Come on, Han, don't do thi-- 

           -- she YANKS away.  Looks him in the eye.  A look that levels:

                                 HANNAH
                        I know there's something deeper in you 
                        than the glib, manipulative asshole 
                        everyone thinks you are.  And the thing 
                        that kept me in it?  Deep down, you love 
                        me.  
                              (beat)
                        But you're too fucked up to show it... so 
                        I just wasted a year of my life.  

           Gets in the car.  Door SLAMS.  Through the window, heartbroken:

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I was the fuckin' prize, Dude.  

           She signals the driver, drives off.  HOLD on Sam --
           INT. HARPER HOUSE - CLOSET - NIGHT

           Sam opens the closet, snatches the bag of medical weed -- 

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           -- LIGHTS UP a joint as he scours his father's desk, searching 
           for some kind of clue, some kind of answer.  Nothing unusual, no 
           leads.  He finds... a money clip stuffed with what look like 
           rolling papers.  Turns it over: 

           They're FORTUNE COOKIE FORTUNES.  Wow, he saved them over a 
           lifetime.  Sam tosses them aside, they spill onto the floor... 

           CUT TO THE RECORD COLLECTION.  Sam, high, rips through it, vinyl 
           flying.  A needle thuds onto Sabbath's Reunion LP: "Electric 
           Funeral" -- shredding guitar SCREAMS -- Sam rips the needle off 
           the record, flings it on the floor -- a process he REPEATS and 
           REPEATS: Fela Kuti/ Coleman Hawkins/ Syd Barrett/ Pere Ubu... 

           Now he notices... on the couch, a PILLOW retains the impression 
           of his father's head.  Sam touches the indented space, eyes 
           wild... as the music BUILDS to its CRESCENDO and:

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - NEXT MORNING

           SILENCE.  Sam asleep on the pillow.  Trying to blink himself 
           into consciousness.  A leaden feelings hits -- last night wasn't 
           a dream.  He sits up, rubbing his eyes.  Lost.  Looks down...

           One of the FORTUNES: "The time is right to make new friends."  

           Sam staring, thinking.  A SIZZLE SOUND takes us to -- 

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Lillian’s frying eggs as Sam enters, looking like hell...  

                                 LILLIAN
                        There’s coffee.

           He opens the fridge, rummages...

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Hannah's gone?
                              (he nods)
                        I heard you fighting... 

           His heart skips, wondering if she heard everything.  Pours some 
           coffee, cagey...

                                 SAM
                        Looks like I need to see a client while 
                        I'm out here.
           She's looking at him, but he's not looking at her.  Odd. 

                                 LILLIAN
                        ... for what?

                                 SAM
                              (barely a beat)
                        Sporting goods distributor out in 
                        Alhambra.  My company just did a deal to 
                        donate a million soccer balls... to 
                        Catholic Relief Services for kids in the 
                        Sudan.  

           He sips his coffee.  She stares.  Knows he's lying.

                                 LILLIAN
                        Noble job.  

                                 SAM
                        It is, it's great -- anyway, if it's 
                        cool, maybe I'll stay a couple extra 
                        days.   

           She stares, what is this?  So much she wants to say, but she's 
           holding it back.  And yet, she wants him here... 

                                 LILLIAN
                        Long as you like.  

           INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

           A small placard reads: "DR. AMANDA GOLDSTEIN, PSYD. CHILD & 
           ADOLESCENT EVALUATION AND COUNSELING."  FRANKIE'S HAND hits the 
           call button.  A therapist's office is the last place on earth 
           she wants to be.  Josh grabs a 'Redbook' magazine, reads... 

                                 JOSH
                        You'd like this... it's for the 'young 
                        working woman struggling to maintain a 
                        balance between her career and her 
                        personal life.'

           The door opens: DR. AMANDA GOLDSTEIN -- 30's, warm, dedicated:

                                 AMANDA
                        Frances and Josh?  I'm Amanda.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry we're late, traffic was insane.

                                 AMANDA
                        Come in... 
           INT. AMANDA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           As they enter...

                                 AMANDA
                        Sit wherever you're comfortable.

           Josh goes right to her chair and sits.  A challenge.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Out.

                                 AMANDA
                        Y'know?  Today, sit anywhere.

           Point: Amanda.  Frankie still smiling, but suspiciously so.  
           Amanda pulls up a folding chair, sits... 

                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                        So, Josh.  Whatever you're feeling right 
                        now's totally okay.  You can say 
                        whatever's on your mind, or nothing at 
                        all... but we're gonna be together for an 
                        hour, alright?

           No answer.

                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                        Well, I know why you're here...

                                 FRANKIE
                        He got himself in serious trouble.

                                 AMANDA
                        Let's get to that later.  For starters, 
                        Frances --

                                 FRANKIE
                        Frankie.  It's Frankie.

                                 AMANDA
                        Okay.  Tell me some good things about 
                        Josh.

           Point two: Amanda.  Frankie's thrown, realizing this woman isn't 
           the ally she might've hoped for...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Is this like a trick question?  I mean 
                        he's got lots of good qualities...

                                 AMANDA
                        Like what?  Anything that comes to mind.
           Josh's face.  Staring.  Yeah, like what?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Like... okay, he was a perfect baby.  
                        From the minute he was born, he'd sleep 
                        right through the night.  No crying, 
                        nothing, y'know?  So that's good... um... 
                        aren't you supposed to be asking him 
                        questions?

           Josh looks off.  This is gonna be a long road. 

           EXT. MULHOLLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Josh paints a fence in front of school, part of his punishment 
           for destroying the pool.  Self-conscious as other students pass 
           and gawk -- the pariah everyone wants to distance themselves 
           from.  And there's a sense that SOMEBODY'S WATCHING... a 
           disembodied FIGURE comes into FOCUS behind a car windshield:  

           SAM.  Sitting in the Benz, snacking from a bag of chips as he 
           observes the kid.  Intrigued.  Josh sees the BOYS he got busted 
           with coming out of the main building -- Danny, Simon, Derek:

                                 JOSH 
                        ‘ssup, guys?

           The biggest kid, Derek, makes a sudden MOVE like he's gonna hit 
           Josh, but doesn't -- Josh flinches:

                                 DANNY
                        You're an idiot.  Told you you'd get 
                        nailed.

                                 DEREK
                        You say anything, I'll smash your 
                        mothafuckin face in... 

           He pushes Josh HARD, knocking him on his ass.  Sam reacts.  Josh 
           stares up from the grass, confused by their cruelty...

                                 SIMON 
                              (the bench:)
                        Missed a spot, bitch.

           The boys head off, leaving him there.  

                                 JOSH
                        Suck my dick, faggots!

           Josh picks himself up, alone.  Spirit crushed, he heads back 
           into school.  Sam watches, uncomfortable at feeling the first 
           gnawing pains of empathy for a kid he doesn't even know.   
           INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY

           Josh washes a skinned elbow in the sink.  ON MIRROR -- his own 
           reflection, staring back.  Humiliated.  Reaches down and does 
           something odd... 

           He loosens his belt buckle, then pulls it tight around his 
           waist, to its very last notch.  Winces a little, but settles 
           into the feeling.  A comfort ritual.  Pulls his shirt over the 
           belt.  Exits.  

           EXT. MULHOLLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Josh runs to catch an LA TRANSIT BUS.  Sees the guys climbing up 
           the rear entrance, so he enters from the front.  As the bus 
           drives off, Sam pulls out behind it... follows... 

           INT. LA TRANSIT BUS - MOVING - DAY

           Josh up front, headphones on, trying to ignore the posse as they 
           mess with a plain-looking eighth grade girl, DIERDRE FULLER -- 
           afflicted with a last name that parallels her VERY BIG BOOBS:

                                 DEREK
                        Dierdre Fuller, getting fuller by the  
                        day --

                                 SIMON
                        -- they’re prob'ly not even real -- 

           Dierdre keeps her eyes locked on the passing scenery, trying to 
           deflect the trauma.  Derek lunges for her chest, she SLAPS his 
           hand away --

                                 THE GUYS
                        Oooooo...

           Throughout, Josh has been watching.  As the bus comes to a stop, 
           the guys get off and hurl final insults: "Later, Milkbombs!"  
           The bus pulls out again.  Dierdre notices Josh staring...

                                 DIERDRE
                        What?
                              (he takes off his 
                               headphones: hmm?)
                        What’re you looking at?

                                 JOSH
                        ... Nothing.

                                 DIERDRE
                        That’s what I thought.

           Pause.  
                                 JOSH
                        If you wanna piss off Derek, tell him you 
                        know his sister gave two guys in upper 
                        school blowjobs and they both got Mono.

           And slips his headphones back on.  Dierdre stares, caught a 
           little off-guard.  Not what she expected.  MUSIC: "The King Of 
           Carrot Flowers" by Neutral Milk Hotel -- 

           EXT. AMOEBA RECORDS - SUNSET BLVD. - CONTINUOUS

           Josh gets off the bus, heads into Amoeba.  As the bus pulls out 
           again, we find SAM pulling to the curb... debating what to do.

           INT. AMOEBA RECORDS - CONTINUOUS

           "King" is playing over speakers in Amoeba.  The top of Josh's 
           head moves past rows of CD's.  He glances around, unzips his 
           backpack, slips a couple in.  Eyes the magnetic alarm readers, 
           gauging their distance to the exit and the SECURITY GUARD.  He's 
           about to run for it, when -- 

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        You won't get ten feet out the door.

           Josh turns, sees a STRANGER:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Nobody steals CD's anymore.  Nobody buys 
                        CD's anymore.  

           He grabs Josh's backpack, unzips it, pulls out the CDs in 
           disgust:

                    JOSH (CONT’D)
                                                         SAM
           Hey -- 
                                           Three outta four Ramones are 
                                           turning over in their graves 
                                           cause of shit like this --

           -- tosses the backpack back to Josh, who's now just confused:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        There.  Now you have a future.   

                                 JOSH
                        D'you work here?

                                 SAM 
                        Probably only a matter of time.  You're 
                        Josh, right?

                                 JOSH
                              (suspicious)
                        ... yyyyyeah...?
                                 SAM
                        I'm Sam.  I sorta know your mom.

           Josh moves off quickly, a little freaked, out the door.

           EXT. AMOEBA RECORDS - LATER 

           Sam exits the store carrying an Amoeba bag filled with CD's.  
           Spots Josh across the street heading into Jack In The Box...  

           INT. JACK IN THE BOX - DAY 

           Josh pays for food and takes a seat.  Starts unwrapping his 
           burger.  Sam approaches.  Josh looks up, about to take a bite, 
           as Sam sets the bag down on the table...

                                 SAM
                        This right here's what you're looking 
                        for.

           Josh starts looking around for someone to intervene:  

                                 JOSH
                        Dude?  If you try and grab my balls --

                                 SAM 
                        I’m not gonna grab your balls.  Jesus.  
                        Open the bag.  

           A tentative beat.  Finally, Josh peers into the bag of CD's...

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        That shit you were gonna steal isn’t 
                        punk; nothing with a stylist on the 
                        payroll’s punk.  You’re welcome.

           Josh just stares...

                                 JOSH
                        How d'you know Frankie?

                                 SAM
                        Met her at a meeting. 

                                 JOSH
                              (warily)
                        What step you on?

           "Step?"  Oh, right.  Randomly:

                                 SAM
                        Eight.
                                 JOSH
                        Make your list yet?
                              (Sam stares: list?)
                        Of people you fucked over.  

                                 SAM
                        Halfway through -- it's a long one so 
                        I'll probably be on eight awhile.  You 
                        know all the steps?

                                 JOSH
                        Carol has em on the fridge. 

           Sam sits.  Long pause.  Finally takes a fry off Josh’s plate, 
           dips it in ketchup, eats.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Do that again.  I’ll bite your finger 
                        off, swear to God.

                                 SAM
                        I just spent a hundred bucks on your 
                        musical edification, you can lemme score 
                        a fry.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s “edification”?

                                 SAM
                        Like education, but more... epic.  
                        “Enlightenment.”  

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever.

           Twin stares.  A contest of wills.  

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        I would've made it out the door, you 
                        know.

                                 SAM
                        No doubt.

                                 JOSH
                        They can't bust me, I don't qualify for 
                        juvie yet -- legally they can't even take 
                        my picture.  

                                 SAM
                        How old're you?

                                 JOSH
                        Twelve.
                                 SAM
                        What grade’s ‘twelve’?

                                 JOSH
                        Sixth.  Duh.

                                 SAM
                        Sixth grade.  I admire your courage.  
                        What do six graders do these days?

                                 JOSH
                        I blew up a pool.  

                                 SAM
                        Nice.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.  I threw in a sodium rock and it 
                        blew up.  Well, part of it.  The deep 
                        end.  Carol was piiiiissed.  

           Sam chuckles.  Josh is startled he could make a grown up 
           actually smile.  An odd moment of connection. 

                                 SAM
                        Who’s Carol?

                                 JOSH
                        Frankie.

                                 SAM
                        Why d'you call her Carol?

                                 JOSH
                        Carol’s our fat-ass building manager, has 
                        a moustache and smells like deep-fried 
                        farts.  Frankie hates it when I call her 
                        that, so I do it as often as possible.

           Sam grins.  Beat.  Then he's reminded: what's he doing here?  
           Doesn't even know what to ask.  Suffering some sort of emotional 
           hiccup, he's abruptly on his feet:  

                                 SAM
                              (the CD's:)
                        Start with Gang Of Four, The Buzzcocks, 
                        Joy Division, Can, finish up with 
                        Television.  In that order.  
                              (beat)
                        You gonna remember the order?

                                 JOSH
                              (buck all authority)
                        Maybe.  
           Sam starts to walk off.  Josh is suddenly OUT of his chair too, 
           following -- 

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, wait... you got a car?  

                                 SAM
                        -- huh?

                                 JOSH
                        Gimme a ride.  

                                 SAM
                        What?  No.  Definitely not.

                                 JOSH
                        C'mon, Esse, don't make me take public 
                        transportation, it's real human-tragedy 
                        shit.

                                 SAM
                        No.  No way.   

           MUSIC SLAMS IN: Gang Of Four, 'Damaged Goods' --

           EXT. RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY

           The song BLARES from the radio as the red car drives through the 
           Deep Valley.  We PAN with it... 

           INT. BENZ - DRIVING - DAY

           Sam glances in the rearview at Josh in back, who's feeling an 
           adrenaline rush from the blasting music:

                                 JOSH 
                              (attempting 
                               indifference)
                        Yeah, I don't hate it.

           EXT. R GAL ARMS - LATER

           The Benz pulls up in front.  They sit there an awkward beat.

                                 JOSH
                        My abode.

                                 SAM
                        She home?

                                 JOSH
                        Work.
                                 SAM 
                        Where?

                                 JOSH
                        That hotel, The Standard.

                                 SAM
                        She’s not worried about you being home by 
                        yourself?

                                 JOSH
                        I know how to microwave pizza.  Plus Lucy 
                        from downstairs watches me: seventeen, 
                        Mexican, goes bra-less -- it’s a win-win. 

           Josh hops out.  SLAMS the door closed.  They stare at each other 
           through the window a beat.  Then, Josh holds up the bag of CD's:

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Gang Of Four, Buzzcocks, Joy Division, 
                        Can, finish up with Television. 

           Sam half-smiles -- the kid was listening.  

                                 SAM
                        Well played, Sir.  But if you really 
                        wanna penetrate the musical-industrial- 
                        complex, there's ten things you gotta 
                        know.

                                 JOSH
                        ... ten things?

                                 SAM
                        Ten things.  
                              (then, a grin)
                        Maybe I'll tell you one day.  

           Josh kinda grins too -- he LIKES this guy.  

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks for not kidnapping me.

           And heads up the stairs.  Sam finds himself oddly drawn in -- a 
           new sensation for him. 

           INT. STANDARD HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           MUSIC: "Gold Digger," Kanye/Foxx.  Ultra-hip crowd.  Sam enters, 
           not exactly sure what he's doing here.  Spots FRANKIE serving 
           drinks behind the bar -- an animal in her natural habitat, she 
           exudes a smoky sensuousness men can't keep their eyes off of.  
           Seeing Sam, she double-takes:
                                 FRANKIE
                        ... Oh, hey... it's Mr. Anonymous.

                                 SAM
                              ("surprised")
                        Hey... wow, you work here?

                                 FRANKIE
                        So I've been told.  

                                 SAM
                        I'm Sam.  You're--?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Frankie.  
                              (cautiously)
                        And you're in a bar.

                                 SAM
                              (so?  Then, remembering)
                        Oh, yeah -- no, I'm good -- still sober -- 
                        just waiting for a friend.  Work meeting.  
                        7 PM.
                              (off her look)
                        What?

                                 FRANKIE
                        When people aren't telling the truth, 
                        they always over-invent details...

           He almost speaks.  Then doesn't.  She knows he knows -- sizes 
           him up, grinning:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        That was a joke.  Which you took 
                        seriously.  Because apparently you are 
                        lying...

                                 SAM
                        I'm not.

                                 FRANKIE
                        So... you want something?  
                              (then)
                        That they sell here?

           And with some terror, he realizes what she's assuming:

                                 SAM
                        Oh, wait, no, you think-- I swear to you 
                        on my life, and the life of every person 
                        I've ever met, I am not and will never 
                        hit on you.
                                 FRANKIE
                              (beat, laughs)
                        Thank you for what I can only assume was 
                        meant to reassure me.

                                 SAM
                        No-- I mean-- I'm in a committed 
                        relationship.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What's his name?

                                 SAM
                        What?  No, I--

                                 FRANKIE
                        Here's why you're fun to fuck with:
                              (leans close)
                        It's really... really... easy.

           He grins -- this woman, like no one else, really throws him off 
           his game. 

                                 SAM
                        I'll have a Coke.  

           His phone BEEPS with a voicemail.  As she pours him the Coke:

                                 FRANKIE
                        It's your 'meeting.'  Calling to say he 
                        doesn't exist.  

           She moves off, he watches her go.  Hits "play" -- it's his 
           colleague from the card game: 

                                 BENNY (V.O.)
                        Yo, it’s Benny: some FTC guys came 
                        looking for you with a subpoena, Man, 
                        Richards is on the warpath.  You gotta 
                        get back here--

           Sam's stomach drops.  He SKIPS to the next message --

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Mr. Harper, this is Jane Roe with the FTC 
                        Bureau of Consumer Protection.  We’ve 
                        received a complaint from the National 
                        Soup Company about fraudulent business 
                        practices concerning you and your firm.

           -- "Delete."  Sam swallows.  Containing his panic.  FADE TO: 
           HOURS PASS: Sam drinking coke after coke... watches Frankie lean 
           over the bar talking to a BUSINESSMAN, whispers something in his 
           ear, gives him a flash of cleavage as she touches his arm 
           devilishly and laughs.  For this, the man gives her a LARGE TIP.  
           She folds it neatly into her apron... and drops the act the 
           second she turns away.  The man studies her ass as she CLICKS 
           off in her heels.  

           LATER.  As the MUSIC kicks into lower gear: Stevie Wonder's R&B 
           gem, "As."  Sam's on his jillionth Coke, knee bouncing.  The 
           bar's emptied out.  Frankie takes off her apron, depleted.  
           Sorts her cash, filling out paperwork... he smiles...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sixteen more Cokes, I'm cutting you off.

                                 SAM
                        How was your night?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hell on Earth.  

           She fills a glass with ice, hops OVER the bar onto a stool.  
           Takes off her heels, presses a cube to the bottom of her foot:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Sexy, huh?  Blood blisters -- they used 
                        to let us wear sneakers til management 
                        decided we didn’t look ‘upscale-skank’ 
                        enough. 

                                 SAM
                        You do alright here?

                                 FRANKIE
                        The waitresses tip me out twenty percent, 
                        I split the bar with another girl, throw 
                        the barback a few bucks.  

                                 SAM
                        How long?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Six.

                                 SAM
                        Months?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Ha -- years.  Your "friend" never showed?

                                 SAM
                        Cancelled.  
                                 FRANKIE
                        Nice.  Strand the alcoholic near 
                        firewater.

                                 SAM
                              (a grin)
                        Least I don't work here.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I'm a veteran, immune to its charms.  

           Smiling at each other.  Now's his moment -- but at the same 
           time, something about this guy STRIKES Frankie, something she 
           can't quite put her finger on -- they speak IN UNISON:

                        SAM
                                                       FRANKIE
                                           -- you ever go to the meeting 
                                           on Colf--?
                                           -- no, you --
           Listen, there's something I 
           should--
           -- oh, sorry--
           -- you--

           And they half-laugh awkwardly -- 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        No, I was just gonna ask if you ever went 
                        to the meeting on Colfax...

                                 SAM
                        Uh... nope...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Moorpark?  Cause you're sort of... 
                        weirdly... familiar.

           He forces himself not to react.  Shakes his head, no:

                                 SAM
                        Just came out from New York.

                                 FRANKIE 
                        A 'New Yohkuh'?  

                                 SAM
                        Me and my girlfriend live in Red Hook, 
                        but I grew up out here.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (maybe that's how I know 
                               him?)
                        Yeah?  Where?

                                 SAM
                        Mid-Wilshire.  Miracle Mile.
                                 FRANKIE
                        I was right over the hill.  On the 
                        Burbank/Hell border.

           Sam smiles, feeling the cosmic irony.  All that time: so close.  
           As she empties Maraschino cherries into the bar caddy... 

                                 SAM
                        You shouldn’t use Maraschinos.  They’re 
                        soaked in brine with artificial food dye, 
                        some people get allergic reactions -- 
                        most companies switched to natural.   
                              (off her look)
                        My job.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Cherries?  

                                 SAM
                        No, I’m a-- facilitator.

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... you’re a robot sent from the future 
                        to kill me?

                                 SAM
                        Corporate Barter.  
                              (her brow furrows)
                        Y'know, barter, the original form of 
                        commerce: “Oh, you’re a goat shepherd?”  
                        “Sweet, I’m a chicken farmer.  I’ll trade 
                        you 25 chickens for a goat.”  

                                 FRANKIE
                        So you... get one company to trade their 
                        thing to another company for their thing?  
                        Like... a swap. 

                                 SAM
                        No, it’s-- well, it’s more complicated 
                        than that.  Cause Goodyear doesn’t want a 
                        million Twinkies and Hostess doesn’t want 
                        a million tires -- but: they both use 
                        Polyethylene Terephthalate to make their 
                        products --

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- which is disturbing on every level -- 

                                 SAM
                        -- no, I mean they wrap Twinkies in 
                        plastic and make tires with-- whatever, 
                        I’m just the leverager.
           A beat.  She grins:

                                 FRANKIE
                        So you’re a bookie.

                                 SAM
                        Well... that's not how I'd-- I have a 
                        business degree.  Which I use to sell...

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... cherries.

                                 SAM
                        Someone’s gotta.

           A moment -- there’s a natural connection here.  It gives him the 
           courage to say... 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about your dad.  

           She turns away, stuffing wads of cash into envelopes.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, well.  Don't be.  He was a fuck.

                                 SAM
                        Why a fuck?

           She punches keys at the register, tries to affect a breezy 
           indifference... 

                                 FRANKIE 
                        He bailed when I was little, I think that 
                        pretty much qualifies him for 'fuck' 
                        status. 

                                 SAM 
                        How old were you?

                                 FRANKIE
                              (she knows exactly)
                        Seven, eight, I dunno.  

           He sees her retreating and it sucks him in deeper -- 

                                 SAM
                        How-- how often did you see him? 

                                 FRANKIE
                              (still trying to be 
                               nice)
                        Know what?  It's not my favorite topic.  
                                 SAM
                        Sorry, I'm just trying to understand.  He 
                        was in your life eight years?  

           And there is a build here, boundaries being breached.  Frankie 
           pushes the register closed, grabs her cash and papers --  

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don't really wanna talk about it.  

                                 SAM
                              (backing off)
                        Sorry.  I didn't mean to-- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It's cool.  Cokes are on the house, 
                        facilitator.  All eleven thousand of 'em.  

           She forces a smile and heads back into the kitchen.  He gives a 
           little wave, then rolls his eyes at his own lameness. 

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Sam pulls in, dazed.  Gets out.  Notices through the window... 
           JOSH'S BACKPACK, forgotten in the backseat.   

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Sam unzips the backpack, rummages... among binders and school 
           folders -- a therapy workbook: 

           "WELCOME TO PEOPLE: ANGER MANAGEMENT FOR KIDS." Pages filled 
           with writing exercises (IE: "Helper words"; "Let's Talk About 
           Bully Behavior"; "Violence Prevention Pledge")...

           And tucked into the back flap, a CD labeled: "I CAN RELAX!"

           QUICK CUTS: Sam slips the CD into a player/ pulls the bag of 
           joints from his dad's drawer/ pinches the end of one as a 
           SOOTHING FEMALE VOICE comes from the stereo:   

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        Hi there!  Have you ever lost your 
                        temper?  Did you yell and scream or want 
                        to hit someone?  Maybe your little 
                        brother played with your toys without 
                        permission, or maybe your teacher gave 
                        you too much homework.  That made you 
                        angry!  

           A match IGNITES.  Sam inhales as the Soothing Voice CONTINUES:
           INT. FRANKIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Frankie sleeps.  Her eyes suddenly open.  Something in her has 
           been disturbed... a distant echo she doesn't want to identify. 

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        You may think you’re the only person out 
                        there who feels angry, but everyone feels 
                        that way sometimes.  It’s part of being 
                        human.  So welcome... to people!

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Sam drags off the joint -- stymied, agitated, unhappy with           
           himself.  With his life.  Every cell in his body on fire.

                                 SOOTHING VOICE 
                        We’re about to learn some simple 
                        relaxation tools to calm those angry 
                        feelings... ready?

                                 SAM
                              (big exhale)
                        Abso-fuckin-lutely.

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        Good!  First, make a fist with each hand 
                        and clench tight -- as hard as you can.
                              (he does)
                        Now let go.  Feel the difference?    

           He flexes his palm, it actually feels looser...

           INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A light POPS on.  Frankie turns a full ashtray upside down, 
           emptying two dozen butts into the trash.  Lights a smoke, doing 
           the things you do while you're trying to avoid your mind -- 
           watches TV/ sits/ stands/ sits/ stands/ smokes/ and finally, 
           opens the cabinet below the sink, grabs cleaning products... 

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        Next, frown and squint your eyes as hard 
                        as you can...

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Riding his buzz, Sam's staring at his reflection in a mirror, 
           face scrunched -- a bizarre, comical sight:

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        Now take a really deep breath and hold 
                        it... then let it all out.
           He takes a HUGE HIT off the joint, holds it, then exhales a 
           cloud of pot smoke onto the mirror.  His face DISAPPEARS.  

           INT. FRANKIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           3 AM.  Frankie scrubs tiles with agitated focus.  It isn't 
           helping.  She hears a CAR pull up outside, glances out the 
           window, sees her neighbor TED in his security guard uniform, 
           coming off a late shift.  She gets a sudden impulse --  

           EXT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie KNOCKS on Ted's door.  He opens it, surprised, smiling:

                                 TED
                        ... you're awake?

                                 FRANKIE
                              (flirty smile)
                        Yeah... got a minute?

           INT. TED'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They're having sex.  Frankie's dissolving into it, turning it 
           into a scalpel and cutting away her anxiety.  She presses her 
           hands against his temples, her fingers dig into his hair and 
           against his skull as: 

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        Let the relaxation spread like a wave 
                        through your whole body... your 
                        stomach... your chest... your arms... 

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Sam stares at us, smoking... slowly, we PULL AWAY, RISING UP... 

                                 SOOTHING VOICE
                        ... until you feel totally and 
                        completely... relaxed. 

           By now we're overlooking Sam staring up at us, clutching Josh's 
           backpack to his chest like a safety blanket... eyelids 
           closing... falling... asleep...

                                 LILLIAN (O.S.)
                        Sam--?

                                 SAM
                              (sits up suddenly)
                        Uh-- just a sec--
                              (slides the ashtray 
                               away, turns off CD)
                        Okay!
           Lillian enters in a bathrobe.  Takes a whiff...

                                 LILLIAN
                        You found his meds.

                                 SAM
                              (caught)
                        I believe so.  

                                 LILLIAN
                              (a beat)
                        I got pretty good at rolling those for 
                        him.

           And we CUT TO: 

           INT. KITCHEN - QUICK SHOTS:

           Lillian expertly rolls a joint, licks the seam, lights up -- 

           INT. REFRIGERATOR - NIGHT

           Suddenly: BRIGHT LIGHT -- we're in a refrigerator that's just 
           been opened -- Sam peers in, bunny-eyed -- rummages and GRINS:

                                 SAM 
                        Mmmmmmmmarble cake.

           -- he takes the whole cake and -- 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MIRACLE MILE - NIGHT

           Sam and Lillian walk through the neighborhood, highly stoned.  
           She notices he's happily taking bites from a fistful of cake:

                                 LILLIAN
                        What're you doing?

                                 SAM
                        Eating to win.

                                 LILLIAN
                        Have you talked to Hannah?

                                 SAM
                        Please do not upset the fragile balance I 
                        am striving to achieve.  

           Lillian slows, seems a little dizzy.  

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        ... you okay?
                                 LILLIAN
                        Why do you ask it like that?  I’m fine.

           But she doesn't seem fine.  Sits on a knee-high cement wall to 
           steady herself, takes another BIG hit off the joint.  He sits 
           beside her.  They're both wobbly, a million things unsaid...

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Why'd you come here?

           He blinks.  Blurry.  Wipes his eyes.  

                                 SAM
                        Well, I-- lived here.  
                              (beat)
                        My dad died.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        Not what I'm asking.

                                 SAM
                              (deflecting)
                        Why'd you come here?

                                 LILLIAN
                        Where?  To LA?

                                 SAM
                        Okay, sure.  

           She looks off.  Remembering.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        I wasn't any different from anyone else 
                        who ever came to LA... I heard Joni 
                        Mitchell's voice on my hi-fi and thought, 
                        why can't that be me?  Then I met your 
                        dad and... then I met Joni Mitchell.  
                        Laura Nyro, David Crosby... these were 
                        his friends, I loved the ride... rubbing 
                        shoulders...
                              (the joint)
                        ... sharing these... it was like I was 
                        about to give a little bow and jump back 
                        into the record player with them.

           She takes another hit, savoring the sense of promise she once 
           felt.  But this next part hurts... 

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        One night, we were all sitting around, 
                        joking and singing... your father pushed 
                        me toward the piano.  So I sang.  
                              (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        And after that... it never felt like 
                        those people were my friends again.

           Long pause.  Sam stares, rapt.

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn't know if he was being nice, 
                        giving me my shot... or just proving a 
                        point.

           He just looks at her.  Struck:

                                 SAM
                        You never asked...?

                                 LILLIAN
                        Didn't wanna know.  

           She hands him the joint.  He takes a drag.  Oddly together.

                                 SAM
                        He was good at that.  Not telling you 
                        things.  Just... showing you.  
                              (beat)
                        So you couldn't ever talk back.

           She blinks, snapped back to reality.  And LAUGHS: 

                                 LILLIAN
                        By the way?  That cake you're eating?  
                        It's from his wake.  

           He stops chewing mid-bite. 

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I kept a seat open.  I was the only one 
                        there with an empty seat next to them... 
                        that was fun.  Didn't have to answer any 
                        weird questions about that. 

                                 SAM
                              (chuckles)
                        Ahhhhhh, there's the sarcasm... I 
                        remember that... 

                                 LILLIAN
                        Yeah?  Well, what you probably don't 
                        remember?  Is the image of me shoving a 
                        plastic bag up his abdomen so his shit 
                        wouldn't leak.  
                              (SNAPS her fingers)
                        Oh, now I know why you don't remember: 
                        you weren't here.
                                 SAM
                        Wow, Mom... that was like a double 
                        twist... on the high degree of difficulty 
                        on that... insult dive... 

           As he hands her back the joint... nobody raises their voice... 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And I wasn't here cause he didn't want me 
                        around...

                                 LILLIAN
                        Is that what you tell yourself?  

                                 SAM
                        He didn't.  And you... let him.  Not want 
                        me around. 
                              (blinks, dazed)
                        Am I angry?  Is this a fight?  Or is this 
                        a talk?  Are you a pothead?

                                 LILLIAN
                        There are so many things about me you 
                        don't know... you were gone... eighteen 
                        years old, out the door...

                                 SAM
                        ... whose fault was that?

                                 LILLIAN
                              (laughing)
                        Yeah: I think we are fighting.

                                 SAM
                        This shit is awesome...

                                 LILLIAN
                        Cancer weed's the best.

                                 SAM
                              (looks down, to "hell")
                        Thanks, Dad!

                                 LILLIAN
                        He did more for us than you'll ever know. 
                        You have no idea how lucky you are.  

                                 SAM
                        You mean lucky that I left?

           Pause.  Something else.
                                 LILLIAN
                        No.  No.  That is not what I meant.
                              (then)
                        What is it you even do for a living?  One 
                        minute I'm telling people it's real 
                        estate, then a t-shirt business, now it's 
                        soccer balls to the Sudanese... I hope to 
                        God you're teaching them how to cook 
                        'em...

           He's on his feet.  Enough.  

                                 SAM
                        I remember this -- I forgot about -- I 
                        forgot about mom and her Samurai swords --
                              (SWINGS his arm:)
                        She slices!  She dices!  It's like a-- 
                        what's the one on the internet?  Not the 
                        Pocket Fisherman.  A Ginsu?  You're a 
                        Ginsu.
                              (a bow)
                        Sayonaraaaaaa.

           He stumbles off.  She calls after him:

                                 LILLIAN
                        Yeah... we'll finish this later.  Like 
                        everything else in your life.  

           ON SAM, gut-punched -- turns the corner, gone.  HOLD on Lillian, 
           alone now.  Quietly trembling with anger.

           INT. AMANDA’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Amanda, Josh's therapist, sits waiting in her office.  The door 
           to the sitting area opens and Frankie hustles Josh in, rushed 
           and harried.  Amanda steps out to meet them... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry, huge accident on the 101... 

                                 JOSH
                        No there wasn't.

           Frankie glares at Josh, who shoots one right back at her.

                                 AMANDA
                        Josh, I need a second with your mom, 
                        okay?  Would you wait out here?

           He watches, uncertain, as Amanda gestures for Frankie to join 
           her in the office...
           INT. AMANDA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           ... Frankie steps inside, Amanda closing the door for privacy.  

                                 AMANDA 
                        Why don't you take a seat.

           Frankie does, aware of the walls tightening around her.  She 
           does not like being the one in the chair.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Look, I know what you’re thinking --

                                 AMANDA
                        This is the third time you’ve been late.  
                        The third time in three sessions.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry, I come straight here from AA, 
                        sometimes it runs over.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Obviously I’m completely supportive of 
                        your sobriety, but can you find a meeting 
                        at a different time?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Wish I could, but I gotta get him from 
                        school, my shift starts at 3:45 and I’ve 
                        been going to this meeting for years...

                                 AMANDA
                        My job's to help Josh, Frankie.  And 
                        showing up ten minutes late isn’t letting 
                        me do that.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Aren’t we wasting more time having this 
                        little "chat"?

           On the defensive, her eyes bounce around the room, taking in 
           details: rolled yoga mat, family photo on a ski slope -- 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m willing to start a little later, if 
                        you’re willing to show me this is 
                        important to you.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What d'you mean, "show" you?
                                 AMANDA
                        Look, this can't be easy for you.  I'd be 
                        happy to make a referral for your own 
                        therapist... or, maybe you'd get 
                        something out of a parenting class.

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... a parenting class.  

                                 AMANDA 
                        It might help you give a structured 
                        approach to re-directing Josh's behav--

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- stop.  I'm happy your life gives you 
                        the flexibility to go skiing -- do Yoga -- 
                        but frankly, it's a miracle I fit this 
                        into my day.  And if that's a problem for 
                        you?  Maybe you can refer us to someone 
                        who's a little less punctual.  

           She's out the door -- into the waiting room -- 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Let's go.

           Josh looks at his mother.  At the steady, conciliatory face of 
           the therapist.  Frankie quickly ushers him out. 

           INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Frankie's face WHIPS UP INTO FRAME as she splashes herself with 
           water.  Upset.  MUSIC: Liz Phair, "Canary" --    

           INT. MINI MART - 10:00 PM

           Miserable fluorescents.  The repetitive BEEP -- BEEP -- BEEP -- 
           of six or seven cigarette packs running under a price scanner.  
           Frankie watches a MINI MART CLERK ring her up:

                                 MINI MART CLERK
                        Anything else?

           Her look drifts past him, to the shelves of BOOZE BOTTLES.  Her 
           eyes are wide open, her heart beginning to POUND.  

           INT. THE BENZ - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON SAM, sitting in his parked car.  We're not sure where 
           we are, as he listens somberly to a voicemail:
                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Jane Roe again from the Federal Trade 
                        Commission, Mr Harper -- this is my 
                        second call.  If you don't call me back 
                        to assist in our investigation, we'll be 
                        forced to seek injunctive relief in 
                        federal court against you -- 

           He hangs up, fucked.  CROWD SOUNDS -- Sam looks up and we reveal 
           he's across from the CHURCH where he first met Frankie.  People 
           pour out of AA.  Sam sees her.  Sighs, gets out of the car...

           EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           A hundred cigarettes ignite at once.  Frankie takes a huge drag, 
           channeling her agita.  

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           She turns.  Sam behind her, grinning...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey... 

                                 SAM
                        I just wanted to say... g'bye.  I'm 
                        heading back to New York.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh.
                              (beat)
                        Cherry season?

                                 SAM
                        Something like that.
                              (beat: so much he wants 
                               to say, but --)
                        Anyway... it was nice meeting you.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You too.

           He lingers a beat.  Fuck.  Nods, and turns away.  Heading off.  
           Shit.  He turns back --  

                                 SAM
                        You said I was... familiar to you.  
                              (beat)
                        I know what you mean.
                              (beat)
                        I just wanted to tell you... you seem 
                        like a great person.  And whatever your 
                        dad did... or didn't do... 
           Long pause.  Searching for the words...

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You deserved a lot better.  

           Out of nowhere, Frankie's overwhelmed before she knows what hit 
           her.  Words she needed to hear, now more than ever.  He gives 
           another final goodbye nod and walks away.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Um.
                              (he turns back)
                        What're you... doing now?

           INT. "FOUR N' TWENTY"  COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           Sam and Frankie at a booth.  He drinks coffee, she eats a bowl 
           of soup:

                                 FRANKIE
                        If they heated this, it'd taste a lot 
                        like soup.  

                                 SAM
                        Is there anywhere in L.A. to get good 
                        food at--
                              (checks watch)
                        -- twelve-nineteen in the morning?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Know what?  There’s nothing worse than a 
                        New Yorker complaining about L.A.

                                 SAM 
                        Ever been to New York?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, twice a year me and Josh jet off to 
                        the Plaza for a weekend of shopping and 
                        theater.

           The WAITRESS stops by, refills coffee. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        You need to eat more vegetables, your 
                        skin’s kinda pale and yellow-y.

                                 SAM
                        So’s yours. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I smoke too much.  What's your excuse?
                                 SAM
                        For being yellow?  Uh... envy.

                                 FRANKIE
                        That's green.  Yellow's for cowards.

                                 SAM
                        That too.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (jokingly)
                        What're you afraid of?

           He pauses.  The answer is: "What happens when I tell you the 
           truth."  She reads his face -- 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, now you're red.  What's that about?

                        SAM
                                                       FRANKIE
           Shame --
                                           -- rage?

           They both CHUCKLE -- 

                                 SAM
                        I'm angry because I'm ashamed.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I promise you, whatever you're ashamed 
                        of, I can top.

                                 SAM
                              (the plunge)
                        I lied to avoid a funeral.  

                                 FRANKIE
                              (dismissive wave)
                        Psh... the other night, I really wanted 
                        to do coke?  So instead I did my 
                        neighbor.  

                                 SAM
                        Nice.  That's like a... "seven."

                                 FRANKIE
                        Welcome to the twisted, mis-wired vortex 
                        that is my psyche.

                                 SAM
                        Sometimes I hate my girlfriend for loving 
                        me.  
                                 FRANKIE
                        And the more she loves you, the more you 
                        resent her...

                                 SAM
                              (yes!)
                        ... which makes me feel sorry for her...

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... which makes you hate her more...

                                 SAM
                        And this is the best relationship I've 
                        ever had.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        I give that a... six.

                                 SAM
                        Six?!  Fuck you, six.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I sometimes think about leaving my kid in 
                        the apartment, driving up the PCH, and 
                        never turning back around.

                                 SAM
                        Eh... Four.  Cause it's not like you do 
                        that.

           Beat.  She looks at him guiltily:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I always turn back around.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, six.  And a half.  But I still have 
                        you beat: if I had a ton of money, I'd 
                        only date whores.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Really?

                                 SAM
                        No.  Well...?  No.

           She exhales.  Looks at him:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I... have... no idea who Josh's father 
                        is.  None.

           He stares.  Then pantomimes "sliding his cards back to the 
           dealer": 
                                 SAM
                        I fold.  

           And she outright LAUGHS --

           EXT. FOUR 'N TWENTY COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           As they walk to their cars, the comfort growing between them...

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... I was kind of a nightmare when I got 
                        pregnant: wake up, drink, score, bump, 
                        get laid, black out, rinse, repeat.  
                        Never got a number so... pin a tail on 
                        the sperm donor.

           She stops at the Jetta.  Her eyes go down...

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought about giving him up... or 
                        something.  But I got a feeling?  Like 
                        the universe gave me this... gift.  After 
                        everything I did to my body.
                              (beat)
                        It got me clean.  

           He smiles softly.  Encouragingly.  She notices a basket of 
           LAUNDRY in her backseat:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit, I was gonna do that tonight.

           EXT. "SIT AND SPIN" LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

           Sam and Frankie sit, side-by-side, silently watching laundry 
           tumble in the machines.  

           LATER: Now they're folding laundry.  He finishes off a t-shirt: 

                                 SAM
                        This?  Is extremely well-folded.  

           But she doesn't respond.  He looks at her, witnessing her 
           intense inner struggle to open a door she's kept locked for so 
           long.  Finally, quietly... as she keeps folding... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        We never knew when the phone was gonna 
                        ring.
                              (beat)
                        Mom'd scramble to cook dinner, have his 
                        vodka tonic waiting... he'd stay a few 
                        hours, then vanish.
           Here we go.  Sam stepping through the door with her, eagerly... 

                                 SAM
                        ... how'd they meet?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Backstage at a King Crimson concert.  Mom 
                        was this LA scenester.  A groupie 
                        basically.

           The laundry folding continues.  The HUM from a row of dryers 
           behind them...

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes... he’d come on Sundays and 
                        we’d go to church and have a picnic.  
                        After he left for good, she kept taking 
                        me... think it’s how she held onto him.

           Her eyes drift somewhere private.  This part gets more painful.  

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I tried to see him once when I was 
                        fifteen.  Got it in my head we’d have 
                        dinner.  I actually buy a dress... take 
                        the bus to this studio... he keeps me an 
                        hour in the waiting room.  Me and some 
                        sax player: man, woman, couldn't tell.  
                        Maybe both.  
                              (beat)
                        Finally he comes out.  We get in his car 
                        and he turns on the radio.  Loud, 
                        drowning me out so we can't even talk to 
                        each other...

           Sam is gutstruck: she felt it too. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        ... we get to some house in Los Feliz, 
                        some guitarist.  I'm standing in the 
                        corner, in my discount prom dress, 
                        staring at my shoes.  They’re smoking, 
                        pouring booze, and I’m saying to 
                        myself... do not give this man your 
                        tears.  Cause it’s like I’m not even 
                        there.  Not even in the room.
                              (a beat)
                        Then he goes, ‘time for dinner’... takes 
                        me to this drive-through: 'what d’you 
                        want on your burger?'... and I’m nearly 
                        choking on it, trying to get it down my 
                        throat without crying.  He drives me home 
                        like that.  Music just blasting.  Ready?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        "If It Makes You Happy."  Y'know, Sheryl 
                        Crow?  
                              (Sam nods soberly)
                        He gives me a fifty dollar bill.  And my 
                        last image of him?  His tail lights... as 
                        he drove off to his other fucking family.

           Sam just stares.  Ashamed of his father.  Humbled.  And quietly 
           furious.  Full of things he wants to say but can't.  

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Most mind-fucky part is, you don't ask 
                        what's wrong with him, you think -- 
                        what's wrong with me?  Why am I so...

           She searches for the word.  He knows what it is -- quietly:

                                 SAM
                        ... disposable.

           She nods.  Yeah.  Gently:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        There's nothing wrong with you.  

           Beat.  She SNAPS herself out of it, shrugs, half-smiles:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mostly I'm still pissed he got me in a 
                        dress.  

           Starts stacking the clothes, placing them back in her basket.  
           How can he keep lying to her about this?

                                 SAM
                        Frankie...
                              (struggling...)
                        The other family.  He never talked about 
                        'em?

           She shakes her head.  We feel her ANGER:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don't wanna know.  
                              (definitively)
                        Fuck 'em.  They got him.  

           That drops him, hard.  If only.  All he wants to do is tell her 
           how wrong that is.  Stuck, he shifts away from it -- 

                                 SAM
                        What about your mom?  
                                 FRANKIE
                        Died a couple years ago.

                                 SAM
                        ... oh.  I'm sorry.

                                 FRANKIE
                        She never said a bad word about him.  

           Pause.  

                                 SAM
                        Can I just say... your life?
                              (beat)
                        Is ass.

           That gets her to smile.  It's an amazing smile, like a lamp 
           turning on.

                                 FRANKIE 
                        ... thanks.
                              (blurts a laugh)
                        Don't laugh at me.

                                 SAM
                        No, I was-- just thinking.
                              (beat)
                        How strong you are.  

           ON FRANKIE.  It is rare -- if ever -- that she gets real 
           encouragement.  Shrugs:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don't feel strong.  

           They stare at each other quietly.  She picks up the laundry 
           basket, on instinct shielding herself from the connection she's 
           feeling to him... 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, if you ever come back to LA, look 
                        me up.

           He pauses.  Wants so badly not to walk away.  And makes a 
           decision:

                                 SAM
                        Actually, uh... there's some shit I gotta 
                        figure out, so... maybe I'll stick around 
                        a little longer. 

           And that seems to make her happy.  As the look between them 
           HOLDS... 
           EXT. "SIT AND SPIN" LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT

           WIDE ANGLE: outside the laundromat, under the neon glow, we look 
           in at them through the window.  A warm, peaceful image. 

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - DAY

           Sam's finger glides down a row of records, finding Dylan's 
           "Blood On The Tracks."  Slides the record out.  Slots it on a 
           turntable.  The needle DROPS, playing "Tangled Up In Blue."  The 
           music resonates powerfully, framing the following scenes:

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

           Sam and Lillian go through old storage boxes in the basement.  
           Jerry's things.  Sam finds OLD MUSIC SHEETS.  Dog-eared pages 
           with Jerry's handwritten scribbles.

           Lillian uncovers an old movie projector and a roll-up screen.  A 
           box filled with spools of 8mm film.  Curious, she starts sorting 
           through... 

           EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - BACKYARD - DAY

           As MUSIC continues, Frankie tends to a patch of FLOWERS in a 
           dirt section of her building's cracked cement yard.  It isn't 
           much, but it's her sanctuary, a place to give tenderness and 
           feel hope in total privacy... 

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Does anyone know that gardening gives you 
                        a God complex?  Yesterday I got buck with 
                        a pair of tree shears and now I can sit 
                        around and read in my hammock...

           EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - BACKYARD - DAY

           Frankie sways in the hammock, staring at clouds:

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        ... and catch the smell of Jasmine on the 
                        breeze.  For the first time in a while, I 
                        feel like I'm taking it easy...

           INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rain pelts the window; Frankie smokes, filling out I-9 forms:

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        ... doin' taxes, listening to the rain...  

           She looks up.  Thoughtful.  Peaceful.
                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Is it weird that I like doing taxes?  
                        It's like doing laundry and finding a 
                        twenty in your pocket...

           INT. "FOUR N' TWENTY" COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           Sam and Frankie sit, talking, eating a late-night meal.  The 
           "Four n' Twenty" is becoming their regular haunt.

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Anyway, I'm not really one for 
                        "resolutions," I'm not setting up my own 
                        demise like that.  

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - AA MEETING - NIGHT

           Frankie, in CLOSE UP at the podium.  The words we've been 
           hearing are her latest "share":

                                 FRANKIE
                        So I guess I'll just... keep on keepin' 
                        on.  

           She smiles.

           EXT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Frankie and Josh emerge from the apartment -- he's amped:

                                 JOSH
                        C’mon, let's go, let's go...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Will you relax a minute?

           Josh skips quickly down the stairs as Frankie locks the door.  
           Lingers a beat, clearly stalling.  Finally, she turns and 
           follows him down to...

           Sam waiting out front, convertible top down.  Josh arrives first 
           -- Sam leans toward the window, "c'mere" -- quick/nervous:

                                 SAM
                        Dude -- the ride I gave you?  Home from 
                        Amoeba?  Maybe don’t mention it, okay?

                                 JOSH
                              (strange look)
                        -- why?

           -- but before Sam can answer, Frankie’s there.  Smiles, slightly 
           awkward.  Not used to a day off with her son, much less her son 
           and a new friend:
                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey. 
                              (introductions:)
                        Josh, Sam.

                                 SAM
                              (”casual”)
                        Hey.

           There’s a PAUSE -- we’re not sure how Josh is gonna handle this  
           -- is he gonna lie?  And why’s he being asked to?

                                 JOSH
                              (finally)
                        ‘ssup.

           She opens the door, Josh climbs in the back.  As Frankie buckles 
           up, Sam and Josh MEET EYES in the rearview... and Josh gives a 
           conspiratorial SMIRK.  So does Sam, relieved.   

           The Benz glides away to REVEAL the trunk of a nearby car closing 
           -- TED unloads groceries.  Watching them go, a little heartsick.  

           EXT. PCH - DAY

           "Tangled Up In Blue" keeps building as the Benz rockets up the 
           coast --  

           EXT. NEPTUNE'S NET CRAB SHACK - DAY

           A roadside shack on the PCH filled with bikers and the women who 
           love them.  Sam, Josh, and Frankie sit at a table: 

                                 SAM
                        Used to come here in high school...

                                 FRANKIE
                        What, you and all your biker buddies?

           A WAITER drops off three plates of GARLIC CRABS.  Thrilled, Josh 
           picks up his mallet, grabs a crab, BANGS away:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey hey HEY --

                                 SAM
                        Carefully.  It’s a simple pleasure.  
                        Appreciate it.

           Sam sets up the crab, aims, then bangs it open and methodically 
           shows Josh how to extract the meat.  Josh reenacts Sam’s move, 
           including body language.  Unaware that...   
           His mother’s eyes never leave the two of them.  Witnessing 
           something momentous.  She blinks when she realizes her own 
           emotion and purposefully goes back to her crab.

           INT. NEPTUNE'S NET - BATHROOM - DAY 

           Frankie washes her hands, grabs a paper towel, steals a glance 
           in the mirror.  Brushes away a strand of hair, not liking how 
           she looks.  We watch the struggle in her as she fixes her 
           appearance.  Annoyed with herself for even caring, she exits.  

           EXT. NEPTUNE'S NET - CONTINUOUS

           Josh is looking at a BROCHURE DISPLAY.  Sees something that 
           interests him and grabs it... 

           OUTSIDE, Sam and Frankie share a smoke as Josh bounds out:

                                 JOSH
                        Check it out!

           He hands them a brochure: “VISIT THE OFFICIAL CENTER OF THE 
           WORLD: FELICITY, CALIFORNIA!” 

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        We gotta go, it'll be radness...

                                 FRANKIE
                        It's like an hour and a half away, I 
                        gotta be at work at four.

                                 JOSH
                        It's the center of the world.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I would?  Except I'm already on the shit 
                        list for missing a shift when you went 
                        all unabomber at school.

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever, Carol.

                                 SAM
                        Dude, she can't -- somebody might laugh 
                        or have fun and that goes against her 
                        Judeo-Christian work ethic.  

           Tested, she angrily pulls out her cell, starts punching buttons:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Get your shit, get in the car.

           Josh rolls his eyes: he knew it.  Someone answers on the other 
           end of Frankie's cell and she sounds suddenly, deeply in pain:
                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Todd, it's Frankie?  I had a filling fall 
                        out and it hurts so bad I wanna throw up.  
                        I gotta get to a dentist... I'll work 
                        both those weddings next week, okay?  
                        You're the best.

           She hangs up, gives them both a glare, stalks off.  They share a 
           surprised look.  She rips the car door open.  Gets in.  SLAM.  

                                 SAM
                        Now she hates me.

                                 JOSH
                        It's not possible to please that woman. 

                                 FRANKIE
                              (to no one)
                        CENTER OF THE WORLD!!!

           EXT. “CENTER OF THE WORLD” PLAZA - DAY

           A sign proclaims "THE CENTER OF THE WORLD."  Then a smaller one 
           next to it: "REAL HANDCRAFTED SANDWICHES."  Not making this up: 
           the avowed center of the world (www.felicity.us/home.html) 
           consists of two small buildings, an odd PYRAMID, and -- yes -- a 
           section of the Eiffel Tower.  Sam pulls up and they all hop out.  
           We notice that Frankie's step lightens...

           INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY

           Josh yanks a disposable camera off a rack as Frankie approaches 
           an OLD MAN behind the counter... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sir.  Can you please explain how this in 
                        any way resembles the center of the 
                        world. 

                                 SAM
                        Yeah... Earth’s round.  So anyplace is 
                        the center depending on where you look.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Well, then this is the center.

           Beat.  Staring. 

           EXT. 'CENTER OF THE WORLD' EXHIBIT - DAY

           A TOURIST FAMILY stands admiring the Pyramid.  Josh approaches 
           in high spirits, Sam and Frankie trailing... 
                                 JOSH
                        Hi.  Can you take a picture of us?

           They shrug and respond in GERMAN, not understanding English.  

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                              (holds up camera)
                        Would.  You.  Eat.  My.  Balls.  With.  
                        This.  Camera?

                                 GERMAN FATHER
                        Oh, camera, yes.

           IMAGE -- Sam, Frankie, and Josh pose in front of the pyramid.  
           Frankie tugs at Josh’s shirt which is half tucked in.  CLICK.

           INT. 'CENTER OF THE WORLD' PYRAMID - DAY 

           The pyramid's point is lost in shadow far above.  Rays of light 
           filter down through dotted openings onto our threesome...

                                 SAM
                              (whispers, heavy 
                               melodrama)
                        We... are at the Center of The World.  
                        Can you feel it?  The power?  The pull?  
                        The intensity?  It's almost... maddening.

           Silence.  Only the slight echo of their breathing.  Of the wind 
           outside.  Then: PPFFFTHHHHFFFT -- Josh rips a huge FART.

                        SAM
                                                       FRANKIE
           Aw, man...
                                           Josh, gross!

                                 JOSH
                        You can run from it, but it's real.

           EXT. DESERT - DUSK

           From a distance, we see the Benz doing slow, jerky figure-8’s 
           off the highway.  Hear Frankie’s PANICKED VOICE, Josh LAUGHING:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay, stop!  That’s enough!  I said stop!

           JUMP CLOSER: Josh is driving.  Time of his life.  Sam tells him 
           when to brake, how to pop the clutch.  Frankie can't help but 
           laugh too, despite herself...

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        OKAY, OKAY, OKAY -- SERIOUSLY, PULL OVER, 
                        I MEAN IT!  STOP THE CAR!
           WIDE: laughter, shouting, the car does its slow circles beneath 
           the setting sun... as 'Tangled' reaches its perfect end.

           INT. THE BENZ - MOVING - NIGHT

           Heading home.  Josh is asleep in back.  Sam and Frankie are mid-
           conversation, animated:

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- potted plants, big ass plants in 
                        massive pots -- I find a lot of six-inch 
                        worms -- I call 'em Wormulons, like a 
                        Star Trek prehistoric worm combo.

                                 SAM
                        “Wormulons.”

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s mellowing to be a human sprinkler.  
                        In another life?  I could've be like... a 
                        landscape architect or something.  
                        Gardens, or parks.  Maybe own a 
                        greenhouse.  I get freaky when there’s a 
                        lack of flora in my life.  

                                 SAM
                        Why another life?  Why not this life?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Cause in this life, I'm too busy being 
                        the fertilizer.

                                 SAM
                        An easy shit joke about yourself?  I 
                        expected more.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        You're right, lame.  
                              (shrugs it off)
                        I'd need a degree.  Whatever.

                                 SAM
                        By the way?  Career advice from me?  Be 
                        afraid.  Be very, very afraid.

           She looks at him a beat.  Soft smile:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Thanks.  For today.  

           They sit there, appreciating each other.  HOLD on Sam --
           something's percolating in him.   Prelap a RINGING PHONE: 
           INT. JERRY’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Stillness.  In the corner, lamp light shines on Sam in a leather 
           armchair.  A few more RINGS, he’s about to hang up... when:

                                 HANNAH (V.O.)
                        Hello...

           Takes a beat before his soft...

                                 SAM
                        Hi.  It’s me.

           INT. APARTMENT - RED HOOK, BROOKLYN - INTERCUTTING:

           Hannah, sitting at a laptop in the kitchen nook.  Says nothing.  
           Sam chuckles nervously...

                                 SAM
                        How are you?

                                 HANNAH
                        You know me: party, party, party.
                              (beat)
                        There’s a million messages on the 
                        machine.  Some guy from your office and a 
                        woman who doesn't sound very nice.  
                              (worried)
                        What's going on, Sam?

           Takes a beat before his soft...

                                 SAM
                        Minor glitch.

                                 HANNAH
                        Did you give her the money?

           Silence.  Not the answer she was looking for, but the one she 
           expected -- 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Why'd you call?  What do you want me to 
                        say?  "There there, it's gonna be 
                        okay...?"  It's not.  

                                 SAM
                        I just wanna hear... I didn't lose you.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, I can't say that.
                              (no response)
                        I should go -- 
           As she's about to hang up -- 

                                 SAM
                        She tried so hard to get his attention.  
                        Get him to notice. 
                              (beat)
                        It’s almost like... we did grow up in the 
                        same house.

           That sounded pretty raw.  It stops her, reaches her through 
           mixed emotions.  She struggles over what to say...

                                 HANNAH
                        Except you ran away from him.  She didn't 
                        have a choice.
                              (softly)
                        You're gonna hurt this woman... you know 
                        that, don't you?

           Yeah, he does.  And his defenses go up again:

                                 SAM
                        I’ll see you, Han.

           He hangs up.  An elevator DING takes us to:

           INT. RAFFERTY AND YOUNG LAW OFFICES - RECEPTION - DAY

           Sam emerges from the elevator with purpose, the SHAVING KIT of 
           money in his hand.  As he passes a wall placard, we HOLD on it: 
           "RAFFERTY AND YOUNG LAW OFFICES."  What's he doing?

           INT. LA TRANSIT BUS - DAY

           Josh sits on the bus, headphones on.  A few rows back, DIERDRE 
           FULLER gets up... slides into the seat behind him... 

                                 DIERDRE
                              (loud, in his ear)
                        Hey.

                                 JOSH
                              (startled)
                        Hey... 

                                 DIERDRE 
                        You were right.  Derek’s sister gives 
                        Mono blowjobs.  I told him if he ever 
                        talked to me again, I’d text the whole 
                        seventh grade about it. 

           They share a conspiratorial smile.  
           EXT. DIERDRE’S HOUSE - DAY

           A tree-lined block in Sherman Oaks.  Paradise compared to the   
           R GAL ARMS.  Dierdre pulls a key from behind a planter, opens 
           her front door.  Josh follows her in tentatively....

           INT. DIERDRE’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She drops her stuff by the door, goes straight for the kitchen.  
           A GOLDEN RETRIEVER comes barrelling at Josh...

                                 DIERDRE (O.S.)
                        That’s Gus.  He won’t bite, but he might 
                        pee on you.  Want something to drink?

                                 JOSH
                        Kay... 

           Josh lets the dog lick his fingers, looks around at the plush 
           furniture, family photos -- increasingly aware he's an outsider.

           INT. DIERDRE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A lighter ignites an incense stick.  Josh watches Dierdre move 
           around the room, close the blinds, turns on her stereo -- Regina 
           Spektor's "Human Of The Year":  

                                 DIERDRE
                        My brother Jeb?  He’s in Iraq?  He sent 
                        me a bunch of stuff from when he visited 
                        India.  Ever been? 

                                 JOSH
                        No... but I went to the Center of The 
                        World.  

                                 DIERDRE
                        Really?  Where’s that?

                                 JOSH
                        Some town.  

                                 DIERDRE
                        Yeah, I’ve been to Colorado, New York and 
                        New Hampshire.  Those are the only 
                        states.  And to France once but I was two 
                        so I really don’t remember it at all.

                                 JOSH
                        Cool.
                              (beat)
                        I don't think I'm ever gonna leave L.A.

           She pulls out a cigarette, lights it, inhales deeply... 
                                 DIERDRE
                        Want some?  They're cloves.

                                 JOSH
                              (trying to act casual)
                        I quit.

           She exhales smoke right in his face.  He coughs a little.  

                                 DIERDRE 
                        You’re kinda cute.

           He can't look her in the eye.

                                 DIERDRE (CONT’D)
                        So like, why’d you blow up the pool?  I 
                        mean, it’s not like a bomb threat where 
                        everyone woulda got sent home.  

                                 JOSH
                              (beat, shrugs)
                        I thought it’d be funny.  Something 
                        everyone could talk about I guess.

                                 DIERDRE
                        Well, it was kinda lame.  They should’ve 
                        expelled you.

           Josh looks confused.  Dierdre laughs, turns up the music, kneels 
           by his crotch.  Touches it.  Josh is paralyzed by her contact 
           with his body.  His hands sort of float helplessly.

                                 DIERDRE (CONT'D)
                        I can feel your boner.

                                 JOSH
                        ... okay.

           She pulls his shirt up a little.  Goes for his belt, notices how 
           tight he's pulled it.  

                                 DIERDRE
                        This is really tight.

                                 JOSH
                              (caught, self-conscious)
                        Well I wear my pants pretty loose so...

                                 DIERDRE
                        Yeah, but it’s digging into your skin --

           Then, to her disturbing surprise, she sees WELTS around his 
           stomach where the belt's been tearing in.  He pulls away. 
                                 JOSH
                        Stop.

                                 DIERDRE
                              (realizing)
                        ... you do that on purpose?

                                 JOSH
                        I dunno.  It's a... thing where... um...

                                 DIERDRE
                              (tender)
                        Why?

           His eyes suffer through humiliation, unable to meets hers.

                                 JOSH
                        I dunno.  Y’know, it makes me feel, um... 

                                 DIERDRE
                        Makes you feel what?  Tell me.

                                 JOSH
                        ... I should go.

           He moves to the door.  She stops him gently.  

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        Can I please go?

           She takes his hand and puts it on her breast.  It's an act of 
           mercy.  Josh blushes.  His heart about to explode.

                                 DIERDRE
                        Open your lips.  

                                 JOSH
                              (defensive)
                        I know how to kiss.  

           She leans in, kisses him.  Soft.  Touchingly awkward.   

                                 DIERDRE 
                        You taste like cranberry juice.
                              (kisses him again)
                        You can’t tell anyone about this, okay?  
                        It’s weird for me ‘cause you’re younger.

                                 JOSH
                        By like a grade.

                                 DIERDRE
                        Promise.
           He nods.  She kisses him, heavier.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Sam pushes a shopping cart through the aisles; Josh walking 
           beside him, eating a Ding Dong:

                                 JOSH
                        -- then she grabbed my beef whistle, her 
                        tig ol’ bitties were in my face -- it was 
                        pimp. 

                                 SAM
                              (skeptically)
                        You're a poet.  

                                 JOSH
                        You know it.  So like, how many women 
                        have you ploughed?

                                 SAM
                        I dunno -- eighteen, maybe nineteen. 

                                 JOSH
                        Details, I'm not a child. 

                                 SAM
                        Actually, you are a child -- but so am I.  

           Josh throws the ding dong wrapper in a trash can:

                                 JOSH
                        DUDE!  I'm so hot I’m on fire!  My fire's 
                        on fire!  When's the last time you busted 
                        a full-on bone sesh?

                                 SAM
                        It’s not about the last time, my man.  
                        It’s about the next time.

                                 JOSH
                        Ever boned a hooker?

                                 SAM
                        Maybe I was in Amsterdam once. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sweet.  Black chick?

                                 SAM
                        Yup.

                                 JOSH
                        Orgy?
                                 SAM
                        Si.

                                 JOSH
                        Sick!  With guys?

                                 SAM
                        My college girlfriend and her Women's 
                        Studies TA. 

                                 JOSH
                        Dude, that's a three-way, not an orgy, 
                        nice try.  Chowed kitty while a chick was 
                        on the rag?

                                 SAM
                        We need to discuss your extreme potty 
                        mouth.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, sorry: “Dined on clitora marinara 
                        during M’lady’s ovulation cycle?”

                                 SAM
                        Sometimes it's just the wrong thing not 
                        to do.

                                 JOSH
                        Gross!  That's like some serious Hell's 
                        Angels initiation shit!

                                 SAM
                        Breakfast of Champions -- 

           Josh cracks up, as Sam pulls a box of Wheaties off the shelf:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        What.  Get your mind out of the gutter.  

           AT THE CASH REGISTER, a nose-ringed CASHIER GIRL rings them up:

                                 JOSH
                        You got a girlfriend or what?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.  I dunno.  Sometimes.

                                 JOSH
                        How d’you "sometimes" have a girlfriend?

                                 SAM
                        It means... I don’t always... give her 
                        everything she needs, I guess.
                                 JOSH
                        Like anal?

           The cashier glances up -- Sam grins:

                                 SAM
                        He has Tourettes.
                              (to Josh)
                        No, not like anal.  Like everything else.

                                 JOSH
                        Oooooh, the emotional shit.  Why don’t 
                        you just give her what she needs?  You 
                        seem like a mature adult.

                                 CASHIER
                        $65.97.

                                 SAM
                              (pulls out wallet, edgy)
                        Not having this conversation with you.

                                 JOSH
                        Who needs a hug?

                                 SAM 
                        Get outta here.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m here for you, Man.  Bro’s before 
                        Ho’s.  

           As Sam pays, Josh THROWS his arms around him -- to the cashier:

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        I love this guy!  We met an hour ago on 
                        the internet, but isn’t he awesome?!

           INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They’re unpacking groceries, stocking the kitchen:

                                 JOSH
                        So when're you gonna tell me how to 
                        penetrate the musical-industrial complex?

                                 SAM
                        Ah, yes: the ten rules.  
                              (considers)
                        Nah, you're not ready.

                                 JOSH
                        Come on.  Where'd you learn all this 
                        shit?
                                 SAM
                              (beat, quietly)
                        I knew a guy.  

            He pulls a Chinese take-out container from the fridge, sniffs:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        OH GOD!  How long’s this been in here?!  
                        It’s full of... 
                              (he SHOVES noodles into 
                               his mouth)
                        ... mold... and... maggots... 

           Josh cracks up.  The front door opens and SHUTS harder than 
           usual as Frankie enters, clearly troubled by something...

                                 JOSH
                              (weatherman voice)
                        Hurricane Carol finally made landfall 
                        today, pulverizing Southern California --

           She puts down her things and turns to the kitchen.  Stops.  
           Taking in that they’ve filled her house with food... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What is this?

                                 JOSH
                              (holds it up:)
                        This is a salami sampler.  

                                 SAM
                        We went shopping.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (upset, but contained)
                        I was gonna go to the market.  

                                 SAM
                        It was on our way home.

                                 FRANKIE
                        How much do I owe you?  

                                 SAM
                        Forget it.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I wanna pay you.

                                 JOSH
                              (mocking)
                        She wants to pay you.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Awright, out, go do homework or 
                        something.  

                                 JOSH 
                        Why?  You didn't even finish high school.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Josh?  Not now.  Please.

           He rolls his eyes, goes into his bedroom.  Door SLAMS.   

                                 SAM
                        ... he can’t live off chicken wings.   

                                 FRANKIE
                        Do I look like I can’t provide for my 
                        son?  I work.

                                 SAM
                        I know, double shifts -- you’ve got your 
                        hands full.  
                              (genuinely)
                        I’m just trying to help.  

           And he did -- which she’s grateful for and increasingly bothered 
           by.  Starts distracting herself by putting away the rest of the 
           food.  He reads her, there’s something else:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        ... what?

           She pauses.  Still reeling from it...

                                 FRANKIE
                        A lawyer called today.  My dad left Josh 
                        a hundred and fifty grand.  

           And we realize, Sam gave her the money.  

                                 SAM
                              (a little big)
                        Wow.  That's... great!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don't want his dead bribe money. 

           Uh... what?  He blanches: 

                                 SAM
                        You can’t say no to a hundred and fifty 
                        grand, Dummy: move someplace nicer, pay 
                        off the pool, whatever -- he wanted you 
                        to have it.
                                 FRANKIE
                        -- you're on his side now?

           She's CUT OFF by MUSIC blasting from Josh’s room.  WHIPS around:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Josh, turn it down, Goddammit!!

                                 SAM
                        Frankie.

           His eyes say: "chill."  Flush, she looks at him.  The music 
           lowers.  Calmer now, but direct...

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... what is this for you? 

                                 SAM
                        What.

                                 FRANKIE
                        This.  What're you doing here, with us.  

                                 SAM
                        I like spending time with you guys, is 
                        that wrong?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Why don't I know anything about you?

                                 SAM
                        What's with the twenty questions?

                                 FRANKIE
                        How come you never talk about your 
                        recovery?  Most of us can't talk about it 
                        enough.

           He takes a long pause -- 

                        SAM
                                                       FRANKIE
           I dunno, look, this is--
                                           -- and why d'you always take 
                                           weirdly long pauses before you 
                                           answer --? 

                                 SAM
                        The world doesn't need another AA sob 
                        story.  Is that a good answer?  

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... fuck, that is so arrogant and 
                        patronizing -- I'm a sob story?   
                                 SAM 
                        Nooo... an alcoholic working a bar?  
                        What, you hate the idea of making your 
                        life better?

                                 FRANKIE
                        You're one to talk Mr. Fucking Twinkie 
                        Leverager -- is that you "realizing your 
                        potential?"

                                 SAM
                        -- all I’m saying is you could have more, 
                        so could Josh -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- ya think you might not be in the best 
                        position to hand out parenting advice?  
                        Have you even kept a goldfish alive?  Do 
                        you even comprehend what it's like to be 
                        responsible for someone besides you?  

                                 SAM
                        How many questions can you ask in a row?
                              (off her GLARE)
                        Yes, I comprehend -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Really?  Cause you stock my fridge, cart 
                        him around like you're atoning for I 
                        don't know what with this guardian angel 
                        shit -- what happens when you go back to 
                        New York?  How's he gonna deal with that? 

           That shuts him up.  She moves closer...   

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        What d'you want from us?  You want me to 
                        tell you to stay?  Is that what you're 
                        looking for?

                                 SAM
                        I said -- I just want you to be happy.  

                                 FRANKIE
                              (a little courage)
                        Is that... all you want?

           The hair on the back of Sam's neck stands up.  There's a kind of 
           paralyzed silence... until he clears his throat:

                                 SAM
                        I gotta go.  
           She turns to the dishes, starts scrubbing them intensely -- raw, 
           embarrassed:  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.

                                 SAM
                              (dying)
                        It's just late, Frankie.

           He leaves.  We STAY with Frankie, rejection overcoming her.  

           EXT. R GAL ARMS - NIGHT

           Sam moves at lightning speed toward his car: 

                                 SAM
                              (to himself)
                        Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckyoufuckingass
                        hole -- 

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam enters, drops keys on the table.  Slumps onto the stairs and 
           lets his body sag against the rail, mind spinning... A SOUND 
           startles him: LILLIAN'S down the hall, sitting on the floor, 
           against the wall.  He's quickly on his feet, concerned:

                                 SAM
                        Mom?  What's wrong?

                                 LILLIAN
                        At least the view from the mat is 
                        educational.  There are six cracks in the 
                        ceiling.  Two that intersect.

                                 SAM
                        ... are you high?

                                 LILLIAN 
                        In fact, low.  
                              (then)
                        Just lost my balance.

           Unnerved, Sam offers a hand.  She tries to raise her arms.  Too 
           hard.  

                                 SAM
                        I'm calling a doctor...

                                 LILLIAN
                        Please, no violins, I'm fine.  
           INT. CT SCAN LAB - DAY

           Lillian slides into CLOSE UP on a gurney.  An MRA machine 
           (Magnetic Resonance Arteriography) scans her upper body.

           INT. DOCTOR TRAVIS' OFFICE - DAY

           Lillian's X-Rays in a lit view box.  She and Sam listen to DR. 
           TRAVIS, who speaks casually:

                                 DR. TRAVIS
                        It's called Arteriosclerosis, a buildup 
                        of plaque along the coronary walls that 
                        leads to circulatory blockage, which is 
                        why you're feeling dizzy.  How long's 
                        this been going on?

                                 LILLIAN 
                              (dodgy)
                        A little while.  What's causing it?

                                 DR. TRAVIS
                        Genetics, high cholesterol, age... it 
                        gets worse in times of high stress. 
                              (indicates X-RAY)
                        And since it's gone undiagnosed, 
                        you have a fair amount of calcium 
                        blockage here...

                                 SAM
                        Meaning what?

                                 DR. TRAVIS
                        Meaning, treatment.  

                                 LILLIAN
                              (that word haunts her)
                        "Treatment."  
                              (a breath)
                        Bullet points.

                                 DR. TRAVIS
                        Balloon Dilation -- we insert a tiny 
                        balloon into the artery to relieve the 
                        obstruction.  

                                 LILLIAN 
                        Heart surgery?

                                 DR. TRAVIS 
                        It's a surgical alternative.  You're 
                        awake for the whole thing, we give you a 
                        sedative and thread the balloon through a 
                        catheter.  Three hours tops. 
                                 LILLIAN
                        And if I'd rather not?

           The doctor looks to Sam, both of them knowing it's not optional.

                                 DR. TRAVIS 
                        Well, then it's really a question of how 
                        much discomfort you're willing to live 
                        with.  

           She nods, with her trademark pleasant-smile.  Sam stares -- 
           seeing her, right now, as a stranger.  

           INT. CAR - DAY

           They drive.  We hear the quiet like a time bomb ticking.  Sam's 
           near a breaking point.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           They enter, not saying a word.  Lillian heads for the stairs...

                                 SAM 
                              (finally)
                        How could you go so long without dealing 
                        with this?  

                                 LILLIAN
                        What I can't seem to get through to you 
                        is, I was a little busy taking care of 
                        your dying father--

                                 SAM
                        Oh, Christ, quit protecting him!  Still.

                                 LILLIAN
                        I’d be more comfortable if you didn’t 
                        yell at me --

                                 SAM
                        I’d be more comfortable if you just admit 
                        you’re scared to death.  Let the doctor 
                        do what he can to help you --   

                                 LILLIAN
                        I've had enough doctors for a lifetime -- 

                                 SAM
                        Great, suck it up -- suffer in silence -- 

                                 LILLIAN
                        At least I do it in silence -- 
                                 SAM
                        That's why you and dad got along: you 
                        didn't wanna talk, he didn't wanna listen 
                        -- how can you fight if nobody ever says 
                        a fucking word?!

                                 LILLIAN
                        Fine.  I'll have the operation.  You win.  
                        Happy?!

                                 SAM
                        I don't enjoy watching you suffer --

                                 LILLIAN 
                        Could've fooled me -- 

           And now she's moving upstairs, he follows -- 

                                 SAM
                        WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!

                                 LILLIAN
                        A little gratitude, I think we've earned 
                        it --

                        -- what exactly was I supposed to be so 
                        incredibly grateful for?!

                                 LILLIAN
                        Clothes on your back, food on the table-- 

                                 SAM
                        -- no: you keep saying how lucky I was, 
                        what's the real reason--? 

                                 LILLIAN
                        I don't know what you're talking about!

                                 SAM
                        I'm not lucky cause of who I am, I'm 
                        lucky cause of who I'm not. 

           She has stiffened; and for the first time in this stoic woman, 
           true fear.  He needs to hear what he knows in his heart:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Tell me why I'm lucky. 
                              (she just stares, 
                               paralyzed)
                        Say it.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        -- say what?!  
                                 SAM
                        Say her name --

                                           -- It's Frankie -- 

                                           -- HER NAME'S FRANKIE -- 
                      LILLIAN
           No, no, I will NOT talk about 
           this with you!
           -- Who told you that --?! 
           -- I’m telling you if you 
           pursue this there’ll be 
           consequences!  We moved past 
           it a long time ago!  It’s 
           over!  

           Sam freezes.  Breath leaves him.  He's trembling.

                        His responsibility was to this family!

                        It’s what he wanted!  He made peace with 
                        it!  

                                 SAM
                        He hid a hundred and fifty thousand 
                        dollars in a bank --

                        you do?!! 

                                 LILLIAN
                        Will you just SHUT UP?!

           She stops in her bedroom doorway.  This is too much for her.

                        You've worn out your welcome here.  

           And closes the door on him.  He stands motionless for a beat.  

           In shock.  

                                                                 SLAM TO:

           Sam dumps clothes in a bag with feverish intensity -- puts 
           Jerry’s albums in cardboard boxes -- stuffs them in the back of 
           a MINIVAN CAB -- the cab hauls ass away, away, away.

           EXT. MULHOLLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Josh waits at the bus stop.  Sam pulls up in the taxi, leans out 
           the back window -- manic:

                                 SAM
                        C’mon, I’m driving you home.

           Big grin from Josh as he hops in, confused:

                                 JOSH
                        Where's the Benz?

           The cab drives off -- 

           INT. FRANKIE’S APT - CONTINUOUS

           Sam finishes carrying in the album boxes with Josh, rattles off:

                                 SAM
                        They’re arranged by genre: old school 
                        R&B, obscure mid-70’s funk shit -- jazz, 
                        world music, some West African drumming -- 

                                 JOSH
                        Where'd you get all this?

                                 SAM
                              (pushing onward)
                        In here: Elvis, Stax, British Invasion -- 
                        this one's a mishmash: soundtracks to 
                        French pornos, late '60s psychedelia, 
                        bluegrass, country, and every disco 
                        record that ever mattered, which sounds 
                        lame now but it’ll rock your world later.    

                                 JOSH
                        Cool.  Total edification.

                                 SAM
                        Lotta rare shit, it's worth money.
           Josh nods, serious.  Grabs a root beer from the fridge -- 

                                 JOSH 
                        I could be in a band.  Know what I'd call 
                        it?  "Vitamin Semen."  Or "My Friend's 
                        Band." Like: "You gotta hear 'My Friend's 
                        Band'"... "I'm going to see 'My Friend's 
                        Band.'"  People'd be so confused!
                              (no response)
                        Let's hook up the record player, listen 
                        to shit really loud ‘til she gets home.

                                 SAM
                        Can’t.

                                 JOSH 
                        C’mon, dude -- pizza, ‘Grand Theft Auto,’ 
                        throw on the ‘Throbbing Gristle’ CD you 
                        got me, which kicks ass FYI -- maybe I’ll 
                        even do a little homework... 

                                 SAM
                        I can’t.  I gotta go.  

                                 JOSH
                        Alright cool, well, when can you?

                                 SAM
                        I dunno...

                                 JOSH
                        Let’s make a plan.  How ‘bout on--

                                 SAM
                        Will ya drop it!  
                              (mocking him)
                        'Let's eat pizza, Sam!  Let's play video 
                        games, Sam!'  I have real shit to deal 
                        with!  I can't babysit you just cuz you 
                        don't have any friends!

           Josh stands there, pierced.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Don't look at me like that! 

           But Josh is an open wound.  Sam fights his breaking heart to 
           sound detached, grabs his things to leave:

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’m going back to New York tomorrow -- it 
                        sucks.  I suck.  The hell with me.  Tell 
                        Frankie I’ll call her when I get there.
           Josh shuts down.  Picks up a box, carries it into his room.  

                                 JOSH
                        You tell her, douche.  I’m not your 
                        fuckin’ secretary.

           Sam looks lost, walks out.  Feeling shitty in a hundred ways.

           INT. LUCKY EIGHT MOTEL - DUSK

           A central Burbank, forty-five-dollar-a-night motel.  Sam wheels 
           his suitcase into the lobby.  

           EXT. SHERMAN OAKS STREET - DUSK

           Josh walks in the early evening to Dierdre's house.  Lost in his 
           own lonely thoughts. 

           EXT. DIERDRE’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Josh rings the bell, clearly in need of someone to lean on.  
           Dierdre’s MOM answers:

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.  Is Dierdre home?

                                 DIERDRE’S MOM
                        You must be Evan...

                                 JOSH
                              (Evan?)
                        ... no, I’m Josh.

                                 DIERDRE’S MOM
                        Oh, okay --
                              (calls into house)
                        -- Dierdre, Josh is here!

           Awkward beat, then Dierdre appears, mom leaves.  And instead of 
           inviting him in, Dierdre steps out, closes the door behind her.  

                                 DIERDRE
                        Hi.

                                 JOSH
                              (clears his throat)
                        Hi.  I just... wanted to stop by... um... 
                        to see if you were home.  

                                 DEIRDRE
                        Well, I am.
                                 JOSH
                        Are you-- I mean, can you hang out?  To 
                        talk or-- 

                                 DIERDRE
                        Um, it’s just not a good time.

                                 JOSH
                              (pause)
                        Who’s Evan?

                                 DIERDRE
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        Who’s Evan?

                                 DIERDRE
                        Just... a kid I know from around.  

                                 JOSH
                        Where does he live?  Evan.

                                 DIERDRE
                        Like two streets over.

                                 JOSH
                        Is Evan your boyfriend?

                                 DIERDRE
                        Not really.  Sort of.  I dunno.  

           He nods a few times, getting the message.  In that silence, 
           Dierdre looks at him uncomfortably... and makes a decision:

                                 DIERDRE (CONT'D)
                        So.  I should go back in.  

                                 JOSH
                        You’re a fucking lying bitch cunt whore 
                        and I hate you.

                        upset.  

                                 FRANKIE

           Sam watches scenery pass from the back of a cab, listening to 
           another VOICEMAIL now:

                                 MAN'S VOICE
                        Mr. Harper, I'm an attorney calling on

                        counsel immediately. 

           CLICK.  Sam's eyes close.  In deep.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           CLOSE on a science textbook -- as Josh draws a BULLSEYE on the 
           front.  A discomforting distance in his eyes.  Looks up...

           To DEREK a few rows ahead, the kid who pushed him down.  He 
           jokes with some other kids, they eye Josh and SNICKER -- that's 
           it.  Josh gets up.  Textbook in hand.  Starts walking, bullseye 
           poised.  The teacher turns from the chalk board to see:

           JOSH SWING THE TEXTBOOK, SLEDGEHAMMERING DEREK IN THE FACE.  The 
           sickening CRACK becomes:

           INT. STANDARD HOTEL BAR - DAY

           THE RINGING PHONE on the bar.  Frankie, polishing champagne 
           glasses, picks it up --

                                 FRANKIE
                        Standard.
                              (beat, alert)
                        Yes, it is... 

           Slowly, her face sinks into stunned panic.  TIMECUT: Frankie, 
           unravelling, is face-to-face with her MANAGER:

                                 MANAGER
                        How many times do we have to have this 
                        conversation?  I can’t keep letting you 
                        come and go like this -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What’m I supposed to do?  It’s my kid, I 
                        gotta go, so--

                                 MANAGER
                        Then maybe... you shouldn’t come back.

           Frankie stares.  She's being fucking fired?  Catches glances 
           from the cocktail waitresses, who quickly look away.  Flush with 
           anger, she drops her rag on the bar and says to them:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Thanks for backing me up -- guess I'm the 
                        only one who never sucked this guy's 
                        dick.
           And out she goes, trying not to crumble.

           INT. LAX AIRPORT - DAY 

           Sam moves to the front of the check-in line.  Echoes of our 
           opening.  The smiling ATTENDANT says:

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Picture ID, please?

           Sam takes a beat.  Ironic grin.  Slides his license over... 

           INT. LAX - SECURITY GATE - MINUTES LATER

           Sam moves through the security gate, taking off his shoes, belt.  
           As he drops his cell in the tray, it RINGS: “FRANKIE.”  He 
           wrestles with himself.  Can he really leave without a word?  
           People behind him are waiting.  Fuck it, he answers -- 

                                 SAM
                        Hey... I was gonna call you --

           INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           INTERCUT: Frankie moving fast through the police station, 
           searching for the "Juvenile" sector -- maxed out and desperate:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Josh got arrested, he broke some kid's 
                        nose, the parents are pressing charges -- 

                                 SAM
                              (stomach dropping)
                        Oh, Jesus...

                                 FRANKIE
                        I'm at the North Hollywood station, can 
                        you come?  I’m freaking out --

           He looks up.  The Security attendant gesturing, “Hang up and 
           move.”  Angry passenger eyes behind him.  

                                 SAM
                        I’m, uh, at the airport...

           Beat.  Frankie clamps up, quickly:

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay, sorry, forget it.  

           She hangs up.  Sam stands frozen.  Someone says “come on.”  His 
           things are going through the X-ray conveyor. 
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Sir, you have to move...  

           But Sam's hypnotized.  Can't move.  No idea what to do.  

           INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - LATER

           Frankie sits alone, preparing herself for whatever’s coming.  
           The station doors slide open.  She picks up her head to see...

           Sam walking toward her, dragging his suitcase.  She rises, eyes 
           filled with gratitude.  He stops in front of her.  And says... 

                                 SAM
                        Where’s Lucifer?

           INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - JUVENILE SECTOR - NIGHT

           Josh is fingerprinted.  He looks up at the officer taking his 
           prints, fearful...

           INT. PRECINCT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           A DOOR opens: OFFICER SARKISSIAN moves to Frankie and Sam in a 
           corridor.  He's kind, but a firm hand:

                                 SARKISSIAN
                        Ms. Davis, I’m Officer Sarkissian with 
                        Child And Family Services.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        What's -- what’s going on?

                                 SARKISSIAN
                        When Josh was being questioned, one of 
                        the officers noticed some marks on his 
                        body.  Around his waist.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (the fuck?)
                        Marks, what d’you m-- what kind of--

                                 SARKISSIAN
                        Bruises.  
                              (that stuns her)
                        Is there anything you can tell me about 
                        them?

           The ground beneath her crumbles all over again.  

                                                       FRANKIE
                        SAM
           Wait a minute... 
                                           Are you accusing me of --
                                 SARKISSIAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m not accusing you of anything.  
                        Josh says they were self-inflicted and I 
                        believe him.  But I have to ask these 
                        questions, okay? 

           Frankie’s about to protest, but she’s stopped by Sam’s eyes.  
           It’s a powerful look that tells her to shut up and listen.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (finally, mind tumbling)
                        ... why would... he do that?

                                 SARKISSIAN 
                        His principal says she agreed to let him 
                        stay at Mulholland on the condition he 
                        went to counseling.  But apparently, you 
                        pulled him out... can you tell me why?  

           She's about to throw out an excuse, spin the situation like 
           always... but she can't.  The jury's already in.  

                                 SARKISSIAN (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Davis.  This is your wake up call.  
                        You need to help him control his 
                        aggression... or it becomes my problem.  
                        And you do not want that.  Understand?  

           She looks at him.  Heart sinking.  Nods.   

           MINUTES LATER

           Sam and Frankie sit on a bench, waiting for Josh to be released.  
           She tilts her head back, quietly hating herself...

                                 FRANKIE
                        What, does he feel like he... deserves 
                        pain?  Am I such a failure as a--

                                 SAM
                        Just don't go there. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No, it's my faul--

                                 SAM
                        -- don't.  Do not.
                              (beat)
                        You don't deserve it either.

           That sits in silence.  She half-smiles gratefully.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You wanna be a good mother?  Listen.
                                 FRANKIE
                              (a beat, confused)
                        Listen... what?

                                 SAM
                        No.  Just listen.

           That LANDS on her.  Powerfully.  

           A door down the hall opens and JOSH is lead out by an officer.  
           Sam and Frankie get up.  The kid keeps his eyes down, ashamed, 
           expecting her to unleash hell.  Instead, she speaks with feeling 
           he’s never heard...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hi.

           He looks up.  A little surprised.  

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You okay?

           And all the emotion shoots into Josh’s throat --

                                 JOSH
                              (choked, almost crying)
                        ... yeah... 

           She smooths back a strand of his hair.  Puts an arm around him 
           and leads him off.  It’s a first.  Sam follows them out the 
           door.

           INT. FRANKIE’S APARTMENT - JOSH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Josh gets in bed, drained.  Frankie and Sam in the doorway.

                                 JOSH
                              (after a beat)
                        They’re not gonna let me back at 
                        Mulholland, huh...

                                 FRANKIE
                              (gently)
                        No.  We gotta find you a new school.
                              (beat)
                        We'll talk about it tomorrow.  

           Josh is filled with regret.  Nods.  Sam lingers in the doorway, 
           remorseful.  Josh looks at him.  The kid needs a pick-me-up bad.  
           Sam looks to Frankie as if to say: give us a sec?  She nods, 
           leaves.  He moves deeper into the room...
                                 SAM
                        Ten rules.  And listen up, cause I don't 
                        know if I'm gonna be able to tell you 
                        again.

           Josh sits up -- what does that mean?  Sam sits on the bed...

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        These are from my father.  He did a 'ten 
                        questions' in a magazine once.  
                              (beat)
                        #1.) If you like something cause you 
                        think other people will like it, it's a 
                        sure bet no one will.  #2.) Corollary to 
                        one: if you hear something no one else 
                        can hear, but you like it -- it doesn't 
                        mean you're wrong, it just means they're 
                        deaf.  

           ANGLE - AROUND THE CORNER - FRANKIE

           Quietly listening down the hall.  Moved.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        #3.) Art comes from pain, not suffering.  
                        Suffering's for assholes...  

           BACK TO SAM

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        #4.) Everything you're doing that you 
                        think's important, isn't.  And everything 
                        you're doing that you think is 
                        unimportant, is.  #5.) You gotta wear a 
                        flack jacket 24-7.  I think he meant that 
                        metaphorically.  
                              (beat)
                        You probably don't know what flack jacket 
                        or metaphorical means -- but I think it 
                        means people are gonna be hurling shit at 
                        you all the time, so you gotta let it 
                        bounce off.  Also: Don't ever obsess over 
                        one song.  Talent is a river, not a well.

                                 JOSH
                        ... what's that mean?

                                 SAM
                        I dunno.  Something about....
                              (makes a "flowing" 
                               gesture)
                        ... "If you got it, there's always more 
                        where that came from."
                              (rattling them off now)

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Cleverness is the enemy of truth.  Be 
                        more wary of a stranger's love for you 
                        than their hatred.  Don't shit where you 
                        eat.

                                 JOSH
                        Huh?

                                 SAM
                        I think there's a metaphor there too.  
                        Bear in mind, my dad wasn't all that 
                        successful.  Oh!  My favorite: Never fuck 
                        someone who has more problems than you 
                        do.

                                 FRANKIE (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Frankie re-appears at the door, stern-faced -- but undeniably 
           AMUSED.

                                 SAM
                              (to Josh: "busted")
                        And... always assume your mother's 
                        listening.

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... actually?  That is a rule.
                              (heartfelt)
                        Your mom is always listening.  

           Sam chokes back emotion -- how deeply bittersweet this is.  
           Clears his throat, stands:

                                 SAM
                        Anyway, those were the rules.  Management 
                        bears no responsibility for improper 
                        useage of said rules.  So... good luck, 
                        Champ.  

           Smiling a little, his heart breaking, Sam turns off the light.  
           Last look at Josh.  And goes.  

           INT. FRANKIE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Sam and Frankie come into the living room.  She smiles, so very 
           grateful for what he just did... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Your dad was in a magazine? 

                                 SAM
                              (swallows)
                        We have to talk.
           But she just moves to him and without words, pulls him into an 
           emotional hug.  Words freeze in his throat.  Her look tells us 
           it’s the moment she’s been waiting for... and wanting. 

                                 FRANKIE 
                        ... please don’t go.  Stay with us.

           Her face is inches from his.  Intimacy.  Heat.  He pulls away 
           fast.  Knows there’s no way out.

                                 SAM
                        I’m a fuckin' horrible person...

                                 FRANKIE
                              (confused)
                        ... what're you...?
                              (he's summoning courage)
                        What?  Say it, what is it?  Whatever it 
                        is, it’s okay -- 
                              (she touches his cheek)
                        Look, I'm afraid too-- 

                                 SAM 
                        -- don’t.  Don’t.  
                              (then)
                        Can I get a cigarette?

           She gives him one.  He lights it with trembling hands.  The last 
           smoke before execution.  She watches him unravel.  

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You.  Are gonna hate me.

                                 FRANKIE
                              (kind, softly defiant)
                        How d’you know what I’m gonna feel?  Are 
                        you me?

           He stares.  An ironic, desperate chuckle...

                                 SAM
                        ... kind of.

           She is, in her gut, alerted to something ominous.   

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                              (finally)
                        I'm his son.  

           We watch the insane, impossible moment of Frankie realizing what 
           he's saying -- her brain scours the last few weeks in a 
           nanosecond.  The air leaves her chest.
                                 FRANKIE 
                              (backing away)
                         -- Oh God--

                                 SAM
                              (ashamed, sorry from his 
                               heart)
                        I wanted to tell you, I should’ve told y--

                                 FRANKIE
                        You fucking... 

                                 SAM
                        I gave you all the money, I want you to 
                        keep it--

                                 FRANKIE
                        You get the fuck out of here... 

                                 SAM
                        Frankie, please...

                                 FRANKIE
                        GET OUT!  GET OUT!  WHY’RE YOU STILL 
                        STANDING THERE?!!  GET OUT, GET OUT OF MY 
                        HOUSE YOU FUCK!! 

           And she ATTACKS him, unhinged, fists flying -- SMASHING HIM IN 
           THE MOUTH:

           INT. JOSH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Josh jolts upright in bed, hearing things CRASH and his mother’s 
           horrific SCREAMS.  Scared, he goes to the door, peers out:

           ON JOSH

           Scared, not understanding as he watches Frankie give Sam a world 
           class beating.  It’s all played on THE KID'S FACE.  SLOW PUSH 
           IN.  We hear her throw Sam out, the front door finally SLAMS. 

           CAMERA ROTATES AROUND...  

           The apartment’s a wreck.  Frankie collapses to her knees and her 
           face falls forward into her hands... not crying, weeping.  
           Inconsolable.

           Sensing something... she finally lifts her head.  Josh stands in 
           front of her, crying now too, but trying really hard not to.  
           She pulls him in and holds him tight.  
           EXT. APARTMENT - UPPER LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           Sam stands there, shellshocked -- every apartment door open, 
           every NEIGHBOR staring at him.  He limps forward, past them all.  
           And up ahead, a WOMAN.  Massive.  Vague moustache.  

           Sam stops at her, realizing who this is.  He half-smiles, 
           bleeding -- a hoarse whisper:

                                 SAM
                        ... hey, Carol.

           And limps past her, leaving CAROL flummoxed.  Who the hell is 
           this guy and how's he know my name?  

           EXT. HARPER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lillian opens the front door to find her son standing on the 
           stoop with his face beaten to shit.  She reacts.  So much left 
           to say... but not now.  Now, it's enough he's come home.    

           He walks into the house.  Up the stairs.  Closes the door.  She 
           stands there a beat, then closes the front door too.

                                                                FADE OUT.

           MUSIC: Sufjan Stevens, "Sister" --

           INT. FRANKIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           BRIGHT SUNSHINE.  CAMERA PANS the wrecked apartment to 
           discover... Frankie and Josh asleep on the floor.  Haven't moved 
           since last night.  Frankie stirs, eyes opening.  After a beat, 
           the horrible crush of memory.  Her head turns to... Josh.  His 
           sleeping face.  She watches a strand of hair rise and fall 
           beneath his breath.  

           Somehow, despite everything, it steadies her.  

           INT. SHOWER - MORNING

           Frankie showers.  Suddenly, the pipes RATTLE and the water just 
           TURNS OFF.  Frankie stands there, at first choked with fury... 
           but then LAUGHS: a surprising moment of clarity.

           INT. RAFFERTY AND YOUNG LAW OFFICES - DAY 

           Elevator doors OPEN and out steps Frankie, looking nervous.  
           ISAAC approaches to greet her.  They shake hands.  

           INT. R&Y LAW OFFICES - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           Isaac closes the door behind Frankie as she's left alone with 
           her father's shaving kit.  His monogrammed initials: "JRH."
           Slowly, very slowly, she pulls back the zipper to find... the 
           hundred and fifty grand.  Rolled in rubber bands.  All she can 
           do is stare, overwhelmed.  And we PUSH IN as her face runs the 
           gamut... until finally we're in MAXIMUM CLOSE UP for what looks 
           very much like 'resentment.'  She makes a decision:

           She gets up.  And leaves the money on the table.

           INT. BAR - DAY 

           "Wheel Of Fortune" is on.  Sam, at the bar, nurses a shot and 
           watches the TV, smiles ironically to himself.  The bar's dark 
           but through a small slit in the door we see it's a bright, sunny 
           day outside. 

           Prelap a ringing PHONE... then, HANNAH: "Leave a message..."   

           LATER: PHONE BOOTH IN BAR - Sam clears his throat, drunk:  

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        You there?  Hannah?  This is your cell 
                        phone... so I guess it'd be weird if you 
                        could hear me.  
                              (beat)
                        Can you? 
                              (beat)
                        I've had a little to drink.  
                              (beat)
                        Wow, I'm gonna hate that I made this call 
                        later... but it's-- no, this is exactly 
                        what I needed to light an ass under my 
                        fire... anyway, my mom's going into 
                        Cedars tomorrow; uh, Cedars is a 
                        hospital, not a forest... so... it's for 
                        this thing... and I wanted to let you 
                        know... 
                              (growing emotional)
                        And also... there's another reason I'm 
                        calling.  To tell you, to say that, uhm--

           BEEP.  The voicemail tells him: "Your message time has expired."  
           Sam laughs, hangs up.

           INT. HARPER HOUSE - MORNING 

           Lillian packs a small suitcase for the hospital.  Searches the 
           closet, unable to avert her eyes from the racks of her husband's 
           clothes hanging there.  And that projector and box of 8mm films.   

           Something stirs in her...
           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Lillian's in a wheelchair, being wheeled toward the O.R. by a 
           nurse.  Sam follows, looking like hell.  They still haven't 
           spoken.  The nurse stops at double doors.  Lillian summons 
           courage.  Sam sees her fear... 

                                 SAM
                              (forces a smile)
                        Be here when you get out.

           She looks at him for an emotional beat, before the nurse wheels 
           her off through the doors.  He watches her go.  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

           It's late at night and Sam sits under fluorescent hospital 
           lights, staring off, lost.  A shadow passes, then someone stops 
           in front of him.  Slowly, he looks up... 

           HANNAH.  He draws back, the last person he expected to see.  

                                 HANNAH
                        Finish your sentence.  What's the other 
                        reason you were calling?

           He swallows.  Gets up the nerve.  To say... 

                                 SAM
                        I'm sorry I lied.   
                              (voice cracks)
                        That I'm just so... so sor--

           He loses all restraint and just plain loses it.  It's a total 
           release of everything that's been building inside him. 

           Hannah holds him as he cries.  He keeps repeating the words "I'm 
           sorry... I'm sorry..." -- and we feel in the depth of his 
           regret, it isn't just Hannah he's talking to now...

           INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - LATER

           The cafeteria's empty except for the two of them, drinking 
           coffee.  He taps his hand nervously on the table.  She reaches 
           out, gently puts her hand over his to stop him.  

                                 SAM
                        Sorry, I'm just nervous... pretty sure I 
                        don't deserve you coming back again...

                                 HANNAH
                        That's true.

           She's smiling warmly.  Brushes a strand of hair from his face.
                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        You look like all kinds of shit.

           He nods, he knows.  

                                 SAM
                        I gave her the money.

                                 HANNAH
                              (soft, simply)
                        I knew you would.

           He's struck.  Smiles gratefully.

                                 SAM
                        I think you're the only person who ever 
                        believed in me.  
                              (beat)
                        Including me.

           Staring at each other.  Connected.  Then... 

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re not coming back.  Huh?

                                 SAM
                        Well, that may be up to the fine people 
                        at the Federal Trade Commission.  You 
                        might be harboring a fugitive right now.  
                        Hard to say.

           He kind of half-smiles, but she's really worried.  A soul 
           searching pause before he says, with certainty:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I'll dig my way out.  One mess at a time.  
                              (beat)
                        But this is where I'm supposed to be.

           She's sad, but honestly touched.  

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And I was thinking, maybe you could stay?  
                        We could try again.  

                                 HANNAH
                        I got into NYU. 
                              (beat)
                        I start in the fall.

           It's quiet.  His heart sinks.  But he fights it all the way:
                                 SAM
                        Han, that's... great.  Congratulations.
                        Wow.  

           He looks away for a beat, then back... meaning it when he says:

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Good for you.  Good for you.

           He smiles a little.  

                                 HANNAH
                              (eyes welling)
                        Your timing sucks, y'know?  Right when 
                        you turn out to be a halfway decent guy.

           He reaches across the table for her hand... she offers it, 
           squeezing tight... 

           INT. BIG BLUE BUS - MORNING 

           Josh stares out from the back of a bus as it nears a JUNIOR HIGH 
           somewhere in the valley.  He steels himself for a new beginning. 

           INT. JOSH'S NEW SCHOOL - MORNING

           Josh makes his way through the hall, passing other kids 
           flirting, laughing, putting books in lockers.  No one's really 
           paying attention to him -- he's plankton on the food chain. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           CLOSE on a teacher's hand, passing out COURSE CURRICULUMS to 
           students at desks -- we don't SEE the teacher, nor are we wide 
           enough to see the students as we TRACK down the aisle -- 

                                 TEACHER
                        Our course materials are designed with 
                        the career-oriented student in mind...

           As we come to... FRANKIE.  Sitting at a desk.  We're not with 
           Josh at all, but in an ADULT EDUCATION COURSE at LA CITY 
           COLLEGE... as Frankie skims the curriculum tentatively... unsure 
           about being here... 

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Our first semester covers Landscaping in 
                        the Age of Technology, pricing your 
                        proposed design, interior plantscaping... 

           Her cell BUZZES: "Josh."  
           EXT. JOSH'S NEW SCHOOL - DAY 

           Frankie crosses the empty school yard, worried.  JOSH sits 
           against a wall.  She gives him a little grin, sits beside him.  

                                 FRANKIE 
                        What's up, Kid?

           He looks down at the cement, plays with a twig.

                                 JOSH
                        I don't wanna be here.

                                 FRANKIE
                        ... what happened?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing.  I just don't wanna be here.

           He struggles, some emotion slips out of hiding... longing.  

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        It's not fair.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What isn't?

                                 JOSH
                        Everything.  

           She thinks about it.  Nods...  

                                 FRANKIE
                        It isn't.  None of it's fair.   
                              (beat)
                        But you know what?  
                              (then, gently)
                        I'm glad you called me.

           He looks at her.  Appreciates that she didn't argue, or try to 
           give him some bullshit pep talk.  They stay there like that.

           EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - MORNING

           Lillian, recovering but okay, slowly walks the courtyard holding 
           Sam’s arm.  All around them, sunlight and children playing... 

           She lowers herself onto a bench.  He sits beside her, in 
           silence.  Finally:

                                 SAM
                        I need to know.
                              (beat)
                        How you could defend him to me.  
           She considers the edge she's about to drop off.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        I told him to choose... and he chose us. 

           There it is.  He stares off, angry.  Sad.  

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I gave up everything for him.  I wasn't 
                        about to let him ruin the one thing I 
                        created, my family, the only thing that 
                        made sense. 

           He takes it in, struggles with it.  Years of things unsaid, 
           finally on the table...

                                 SAM
                        If you were me... would you understand?

                                 LILLIAN
                        I hope you never have to.  That you never 
                        know what it’s like to love someone, then 
                        find out you weren’t enough.  You never 
                        feel safe.  You feel crazy.  I wanted to 
                        protect you from ever feeling that.

           For the first time, he registers her heartbreak over his anger.  
           A sad little chuckle:

                                 SAM
                        Kinda backfired, huh?  Every time he 
                        looked at me... he saw her.  
                              (beat)
                        I’d’ve avoided me too.

           She knows.  Of the many facets of her guilt, this is worst.  

                                 LILLIAN
                        You can hate me, but don’t you think I 
                        believed I was flying to your defense?  
                        With all the courage in my heart?  You’re 
                        my son, Sam.  My son.  I did the only 
                        thing I could do.

                                 SAM
                        We’re just... never gonna agree on that. 
                              (soft and true)
                        But I don't hate you, Mom...

           She CLASPS his hands, needing this connection... 

                                 LILLIAN
                        When you were little, you always told me 
                        everything... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LILLIAN (CONT'D)
                        when you were upset, I made it better... 
                        I don't know how to do that for you 
                        anymore... 

                                 SAM
                              (a beat)
                        Maybe... it's my turn. 

           That gets her.  She looks off.  He can't see her face, but her 
           eyes get shiny and start to tear.  The sound of kids playing 
           across the quad.  Distant laughter, squeals...

                                 LILLIAN
                        I told him it was my fault.  That you 
                        were always so far away.  
                              (beat)
                        He said... 'Just watch.  Sam's gonna 
                        surprise you.'

           And that brings him right to the edge...  

                                 LILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I found something you should see.  It's 
                        in his study.  

           He stares, curious.  MUSIC: Ray LaMontagne, "Shelter."  

           INT. JERRY'S STUDY - DAY

           Sam enters.  On the desk is the film projector and a single reel 
           of film.  Curious, he picks it up. 

           Sam pulls the shades/ sits in a chair/ turns on the projector.  
           Light BLASTS as the film's projected on the wall... 

           The images flicker across his face.  MOVE IN on him, never 
           seeing what he sees... this is all about his reaction: at first 
           confused, then, stunned... the projector light BECOMES...

           EXT. R GAL ARMS - DAY

           Dappled sunlight reflecting off the windshield as Sam pulls up 
           outside the R GAL, determined.  Cut to --   

           FRANKIE'S DOOR.  Sam knocks.  No answer.  Knocks again.  He 
           peers through the window... empty.  All furniture gone.  He auto-
           dials her on his cell: "The number you have reached is no longer 
           in service..."

           INT. THE STANDARD - DAY

           Sam at the bar, talking with Frankie's manager:
                                 MANAGER
                        ... she never picked up her last check... 

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Sam waits outside the church as an AA meeting ends and people 
           flood out.  He searches faces, none of them Frankie... 

           INT. JOSH'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

           A RECORD spins, playing "Shelter."  DRIFT PAST moving boxes to 
           JOSH unpacking the albums in a NEW HOUSE -- small, but a house.  
           His eyes fall on something in a box: 

           The PHOTO of him with Sam and Frankie at the center of the 
           world.  

           Josh sees Frankie in the kitchen.  As before, she cleans.  
           Agitated, trying to erase old demons.  Josh makes a decision:

           CUT: he pulls the plastic off a new phone book... his finger 
           traces a line down a page, stops on: JERRY HARPER.  An address.

           EXT. HARPER HOUSE - DAY 

           And still the SONG plays as Josh walks down the block, comparing 
           house addresses to a piece of paper.  He stops in front of the 
           Harper house.  Rings the bell.  A beat... the door unlocks...

           LILLIAN answers.  Surprised to find a child there.

                                 LILLIAN
                        Yes?

                                 JOSH
                        Is Sam here?

                                 LILLIAN
                              (sensing something)
                        No, he's out.  Who're you?

           Josh offers her a hand, going formal.

                                 JOSH
                        I'm Josh. 

           And it hits her.  Who this is.  Who she's looking at.  
           Everything catches in her throat.  She looks away, bearing a 
           hundred emotions with dignity... then shakes the boy's hand:

                                 LILLIAN
                        I'm Lillian. 

           The moment holds, until Josh lets go and unzips his backpack:
                                 JOSH
                        Um, can I leave him a note?
                              (he rummages)
                        I don't have a pen.  

           Her moment of choice.  Will she let this boy inside?  Into her 
           life.  Finally, yes, she opens the door wider.  He steps in.  
           She closes the door behind them.  

           INT. FRANKIE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Josh and Frankie are coming back from the market.  Grocery bags 
           in the back seat.  Josh has opened a bag of chips and eats them 
           in handfuls, crumbs tumbling everywhere...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Seriously, enough, we're having dinner.

                                 JOSH
                        They're "Sour Cream Green Onion."  That's 
                        like milk and vegetables -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don't even try.  

           She grabs a handful herself.  He grins.  Something new here 
           between them: an easy flow.   

           EXT. FRANKIE'S NEW HOUSE - DAY 

           Frankie pulls into the driveway, BRAKES suddenly.  Sitting on 
           the stoop is SAM.  Nervous.  He rises... Frankie swings around 
           to Josh, realizing, angry:

                                 FRANKIE
                        You did this?
                              (he just stares)
                        Goddamnit.

           Josh opens the car door.  Hops out, passing Sam, who gives the 
           kid a grateful look.  Josh goes in the house.  Frankie’s still 
           in the car, looking for a way out, but she's cornered -- FLINGS 
           her door open, Sam jumps back to avoid getting hit as she 
           hurtles past -- he pursues close behind, OVERLAPPING URGENTLY:

                  FRANKIE (CONT’D)
           -- fuck off -- 
                                                         SAM
                                           -- I’m sorry!  I am so sorry, 
                                           what I did makes me sick--

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        -- are you kidding me?!  You want 
                        sympathy?! 
                                 SAM
                        I want a little room for inconsistency!  
                        Temporary insanity!  You knew your whole 
                        life he had another family --  

           She WHIRLS on him, looking like she's gonna throw a punch -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s your excuse?

                                 SAM
                        You wanna hit me again?  Go ahead, I 
                        deserve it --   

           Fuming, she keeps marching for the house -- he keeps following -- 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to tell you... so many times -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It wasn't optional!  Were you just gonna 
                        lie to us forever?!  Jesus, you’re worse 
                        than he ever was --  

                                 SAM 
                        Probably, but I’m still your brother -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No: you don't get to play that card now 
                        cause it's convenient, it means nothing -- 

                                 SAM
                        It means I’m the only one in the world 
                        who knows what it was like to be his kid 
                        too -- 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Stop talking.  I hate you.  Hate.  Leave.

           She turns away again, moving off -- something in him just SNAPS:

                                 SAM
                        STOP TURNING YOUR BACK ON ME!  I'VE HAD 
                        ENOUGH OF THAT FOR ONE FUCKING LIFETIME!

           The force of that stops her.  He exhales...

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                              (quiet plea)
                        ... haven't you?

           She stands there, fighting her heart.  He looks away, almost 
           wistful... 
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Man, I just wish... we’d even had a 
                        chance to watch out for each other when 
                        we were kids.  You know?  Taken care of 
                        each other... like we were supposed to.
                              (his voice cracks)
                        I think we really could've used that.

           That starts to bend her resolve.  He takes a step closer... 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And if you walk away now, all that shit 
                        inside you -- you‘ll never let it go.  
                        Never.  I swear to you.  You'll be going 
                        along in ten years, or twenty, and it'll 
                        hit you: what is my life?  I am alone. 
                              (beat)
                        Is hating me worth that?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don't try and bullshit me into thinking 
                        this is all for me...

           Long silence.  He nods:

                                 SAM
                        Yes.  You're right.  I want... to know 
                        you. 
                              (beat)
                        I just... I wanna know you.

           She sighs.  Looks off.  Is he getting through?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I left the money on the table.  I 
                        thought: ‘fuck him, he’s trying to buy my 
                        forgiveness.’  
                              (beat)
                        Got all the way to the elevator.  And it 
                        hit me: I couldn’t do that to Josh.  He 
                        deserves... more than what we had.

           "We."  He takes another step, wary but hopeful... 

                                 SAM
                        He wanted that too.  For all of us.

           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper.  It's 
           Jerry's note.  Her eyes dance, reading her father's last words: 

                                         Take care of them.

                                                                 - J
                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You said... he took you on picnics.  Your 
                        mom kept taking you after he left.
                              (she doesn't understand)
                        Lemme show you something... please.

           And for a long beat, we don’t know WHAT she’s gonna do... 

           INT. FRANKIE'S NEW HOUSE - DUSK

           WHOOSH: curtains are drawn.  The room gets dark.  Sam clicks on 
           the projector.  

           Frankie stands at a distance from him, arms crossed.  Still not 
           giving in.  Josh slides onto the floor munching Doritos... 

           Numbered leader flickers across the white wall: 5... 4... 3... 
           2... hand-held, grainy 8mm footage.  We're behind the steering 
           wheel of a PARKED CAR.  The MAN behind the camera is GLIMPSED as 
           a reflection in the rear-view mirror... 

           We recognize his EYES: it's Jerry.  

           Seeing him, Frankie's rocked.  Stares with cold fascination as: 

           ON SCREEN: CAMERA PANS to the passenger window, looks out on a 
           PARK.  Kids on a playground... ZOOM to a BOY on a swingset: 
           EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SAM.  Serious-looking, with thick glasses -- Sam 
           runs on the playground, playing tag... now the camera TURNS, 
           finding a new focus across the park:

           FRANKIE, EIGHT YEARS OLD, is having a picnic with her MOTHER. 

           FRANKIE’S FACE, OUR FRANKIE: a start of intense amazement... 
           tears well in her eyes, she fights to keep them from spilling... 

           ON SCREEN, Little Frankie runs off to join the other kids... 
           CAMERA FOLLOWS as she climbs the monkey bars, right next to... 

           LITTLE SAM.  That’s why Jerry never got out of the car.  It was 
           the only way to see his kids together.  A profound act of love 
           neither of them can deny...

           As Frankie keeps watching the film, she takes a few steps closer 
           to Sam, though she isn't even aware of it.  

           ON JOSH.  Who smiles.  Because he sees... 

           The siblings standing side-by-side, mirror images of each other.  
           Watching themselves play as kids a lifetime ago.  

                                                                FADE OUT.
