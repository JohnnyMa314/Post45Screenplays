           EXT. MONTANA. INTERSTATE 90 WEST - NIGHT

           A Royal Blue 745 BMW, headlights OFF, bullet holes in the 
           windshield, speeds down the highway in darkness. The farm 
           fields frame the asphalt like black quilts.  

           WILL REACHER, 29, shirtless and bloodied, clutches the 
           steering wheel, his eyes fixed on the dark road as an Ipod 
           blasts music through the speakers.  

           Will slams the brakes. On the horizon the farm fields are 
           engulfed in FLAMES. Will absently eyes the rearview.

                                 WILL
                        It’s all on fire now. All of it. 

           Will looks back at the road, barely contemplating. A second 
           later he hits the gas, accelerating as fast as he can. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. BMW DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW rockets into the fire zone at 130 MPH. Burning embers 
           dance off the windshield like fire flies, the blazing fields 
           lighting the interstate like a HARVEST MOON.  

           Will grips the wheel, eyes darting to the side. 

           A WOMAN, burning from head to toe and frantically waving, 
           runs out from the highway’s shoulder. The BMW hits the woman 
           at full speed, catapulting her body into the air. 

           Will slams the brakes and eyes the woman’s lifeless body in 
           the rearview. The wind whips flames across the highway. 

           Will gets out of the BMW. Standing in the middle of the 
           highway he sees a barn, several homes, and behind that AN 
           ENTIRE TOWN ON FIRE. Then his eye catches-  

           PEOPLE, hiding in the corn stalks yet to burn. They’re caught 
           in an orange halo and watching him. 

           BANG! A bullet whizzes over Will’s head. 

           Will stares. Rage in his eyes. He should get in the BMW and 
           drive away. Instead he pulls a GLOCK semi-automatic handgun 
           from his waist. Another BULLET ricochets off the BMW. 

           Will starts screaming, aiming as his finger compresses the 
           trigger. The Glock’s muzzle flashes a rapid burst of bullets. 
                                 WILL
                        Fuck you!!!

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT. SEATTLE  - MORNING

           The loft is the picture of success at a young age. Will, 
           wearing a business suit, pours a cup of tea. He’s got a 
           charmed confidence that borders on blessed; like life has yet 
           to deal him a real obstacle.     

           Will’s wife, SAM REACHER, 28, walks out in her bath robe. She 
           glows, pregnant, rubbing a bump on her tummy. 

                                 WILL
                        Tea for mama to be.  

                                 SAM
                        Good morning. 

           Will places his hand on her stomach. 

                                 WILL
                        How we doing in there?

                        Growing.

           Sam pulls Will close and gives him a wet kiss on the mouth. 

                                 SAM
                        You good?

                                 WILL
                        I’d be better if I could tell your 
                        dad.  

                                 SAM

                        days. Don’t jinx us.     

                                 WILL
                        Didn’t the doctor say it was a 
                        grape?

                        Umm, “it”? I think you mean our 
                        child, thank you very much. 
                        Besides, grape was week ten. You 
                        nervous?   

           Will grabs his luggage.

                                 WILL
                        I love fruits and vegetables. 

                                 SAM
                        You know what I mean.  

           Sam plants a sensuous kiss on his lips.

                                 WILL
                        I love you. 

                                 SAM
                        You better. I’m pregnant.

                                 WILL
                        Are you serious?

           Sam’s face goes slack, disappointed. But after a second she 
           starts cracking up.

                                 SAM
                        Get out of here.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll call you when I get in.

           A perfect afternoon on a beautiful rolling course set along 
           Lake Michigan.

           TOM HUMPHREY, 56, Will’s boss and father-in-law walks the 
           18th hole with a group of CLUB EXECUTIVES. Tom’s handsome and 
           fit, yet wrinkles suggest a hard life. He places a titanium 
           lawn mower attachment on the 18th hole’s green, launching 
           into a sales pitch.

           Tom crouches, running his fingers along the finely cut grass.

                                 TOM
                        It stores the data from each hole. 
                        Enter the hole and voila, optimal 
                        turf consistency forever. 

           Will parks a Golf Cart next to the hole. He runs over doing 
           his best chipper salesman.

                                 WILL
                        Will Reacher. Good to meet you. See 
                        you’ve met the product already. 

                                 TOM
                        Will brought an Ivy league degree 
                        in engineering to my ideas. He’s 
                        been with True Turf since, well, he 
                        married my daughter, Sam.

                        It’s very impressive.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you. The design platforms

                        you can see for yourselves. 
                        Will, you mind making a run to 
                        Starbucks while I do the demo? 

           Tom holds his BMW keys out. 

           INT. STARBUCKS. MILWAUKEE - AFTERNOON

           Will waits in line, talking with Sam on his cell phone. She 
           sits on a windowsill in their Seattle loft. 
                                 WILL
                        I’m at Starbucks getting coffee for 
                        the clients. He’s going to get his 
                        biggest order in a decade and I’m 
                        getting coffee like an intern.  

                                 SAM
                        Sweetie, it’s bad enough you stole 
                        his baby girl, now he has to let 
                        people think you’re running the

                        I am running the company! He takes 
                        it for granted. 

           People stare. 

                                 SAM
                        Honey, relax. He’s still my dad, 
                        remember? Trust me, he’ll change 
                        when we have the baby. If he 
                        doesn’t I’ll put him in an old 
                        folks’ home. Ok? 

           Will smiles. Sam’s cool. 

                                 WILL
                        Sorry. I’m done venting.

                                 SAM
                        I think you’re just nervous about 
                        the baby. 

           Will pauses. Stares at the phone. 

                                 WILL
                        Sweetie, seriously, if we have a 
                        boy, I don’t know if he’ll grow up 
                        to be a Navy Seal like your dad. 
                        I’m not exactly-

           Sam starts talking but is interrupted by a LOUD CRASH. She 
           looks out the window at Seattle. 

                                 SAM  
                        There was just a car accident. The 
                        traffic lights are out.

                                 WILL
                        It’s probably the musicians on the 
                        second floor. They blew a fuse last 
                        week too. Call me later.

           Sam stares out at the powerless city, curious. The window 
           starts to rattle. THEN- 

           A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE shakes the building. The windows 
           shatter. Cracks zigzag across the loft’s walls. A ceiling fan 
           falls and Sam barely jumps out of the way. 

           Sam hits the wood floor hard, protecting her pregnant 
           stomach, her eyes shot with terror. The brutal quake 
           continues as car alarms and people’s screams fill the air.

                        You’ll have the finest greens in 
                        Wisconsin. Trust me. 

           The lights begin to flicker. Then the club’s electricity cuts 
           completely. Tom cracks a smile. 

                                 TOM
                        Gentlemen, if this fine club can’t 
                        pay its utilities I might have to 
                        reconsider your terms.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE - SUNSET

           The office towers reflect the setting sun. The whole city is 
           in a BLACK OUT. Traffic jams for miles. 

           INT. MILWAUKEE HILTON - NIGHT

           Diesel generators hum noisily, powering the hotels’ critical 
           loads. Agitated guests mingle at the bar.  

           Will and Tom sit at a quiet table in the corner. Will holds 
           his cell phone.
                                 TOM
                        When did the electricity go out in

                                 WILL
                        When I was at Starbucks. Her 
                        phone’s been busy for hours.  

           Tom gets up.

                                 TOM
                        Network’s overloaded. Some massive 
                        transformer must have blown. Get 
                        some rest. We have a big day 
                        tomorrow.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The city is dark though Emergency vehicles provide pockets of 
           light. Will sits on the curb with his laptop, trying to get 
           WIFI. Nearby a group of young hotel guests enjoy a makeshift 
           tail-gate party.

                        blackout party without beer!!!

           Will watches the tail-gate party, curious. But then an 
           incredibly LOUD RUMBLE shakes the air and everyone looks up. 

           A UNITED BOEING 777 flies over the adjacent office park, only 
           TWO HUNDRED FEET off the ground. The 777 turns and its jet 
           engines fire, blowing out the windows in an office tower as 
           it disappears from view. 

           INT. WILL’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Will sits on the edge of the bed, nervous, a static channel 
           on the television. Suddenly an image starts to form. Will 
           snaps to and quickly turns up the volume. 

           A CNN broadcast fights for reception. “Breaking News” 
           graphics on the ticker. A female newscaster holds an ear 
           piece, listening. Behind her the newsroom is in chaos. She

                        thereafter the west coast power

           The TV turns snow white. Holy shit. Will quickly dials Sam on 
           his cell phone. Gets a busy signal. He looks out his sixth 
           floor window. On the horizon there’s a huge BILLOWING CLOUD 
           OF BLACK SMOKE.

           EXT. HILTON PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Fire trucks scream down the highway as the smoke fills the 
           sky. There’s a particular way fuselage burns and this is it.

           Will runs to his RENTAL CAR, passing the tail-gate party. He 
           grabs the Garmin GPS unit from his rental’s dashboard. 

           Will stands with the GPS while it acquires data. Suddenly it 
           lights up with a map of Milwaukee. But then the longitude and 
           latitude coordinates begin to jump. Will points at the black 
           smoke, turning to a guy at the tail-gate party.

                                 WILL
                        That’s north, right? Where the 
                        airport is? 

                                 GUY
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 WILL
                        It’s not registering on my Garmin. 

           The guy stares, at a loss. Will walks the parking lot, 
           watching the GPS try to load.

           INT. LOBBY. MILWAUKEE HILTON - MORNING 

           Impatient guests wait to check out. The hotel’s clerk uses 
           triplicate carbon copies to run credit cards.
           Will sees Tom at the door, holding his cell phone. 

                                 WILL
                        You get through?

                                 TOM
                        I can’t get a signal.   

           EXT. HILTON PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Tom gets in his Royal Blue 745 BMW. Will puts the GPS unit on 
           the dash.

                                 WILL
                        From my rental.    

                                 TOM
                        Good. Satellites work.  

                                 WILL
                        Look closer. Lake Michigan’s to our 
                        right, Canada to the north. The GPS 
                        coordinates keep switching.

           Tom stares at the Garmin unit. He pulls out his Iphone and 
           tries to get the GPS app to load. On the Iphone screen we see 
           a PHOTO of Sam and Will, a barn in the background.

                                 TOM
                        It’s just a glitch.  

                                 WILL
                        CNN said there was a massive 
                        earthquake or explosion off the 
                        west coast. Planes crashed here, 
                        Spokane, in Los Angeles. I don’t 
                        know what happened but I’m driving 
                        home. I have to get back to Sam.    

           Tom pauses, mulling it over. 

                                 TOM
                        Relax. Everything’s going to be 
                        fine. The power will come back and 
                        we’ll find out what happened. Now 
                        let’s get some breakfast and stay 
                        calm. Ok?    

           Will stares at him, trying to keep his shit together. 
           EXT. MILWAUKEE SUBURB. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Tom drives Will in the BMW. The city is frantic outside the 
           car. Traffic lights down. People honking. It’s not good. 

                                 TOM
                        A Denny’s or Ihop would be good.   

           Across the street’s a 7-11 convenience store. Men and Women 
           cut each other off, grabbing items off the shelves like 
           vultures. 

                                 TOM
                        What a joke. Things get a little 
                        sideways and people turn into a 
                        bunch of animals. 

           Will sees a Walmart, its parking lot overflowing with cars.

                                 WILL
                        Drop me off. I want to get 
                        supplies. 

                                 TOM
                        Sam’s fine, Will. She’s probably 
                        safe at my ranch. Give it a couple 
                        hours. Someone will know what 
                        happened.    

                                 WILL
                        I want you to drop me off. Now. I’m 
                        serious.

           Tom nods.

                                 TOM
                        I can see that. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT. WALMART SUPER CENTER- MORNING

           Will passes A WOMAN, 25, wheeling a cart of supplies. The 
           Woman sees her car is blocked by an SUV, driven by a TEENAGE 
           GIRL. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Hello? You’re blocking me.

                                 GIRL
                        I’m trying to find a fucking 
                        parking space! 
                                 WOMAN
                        Then back up! 

           The Woman shoves her cart into the SUV’s bumper. The Girl 
           gets out from the SUV. A couple of her GIRLFRIENDS get out 
           from the backseat. 

                                 GIRL
                        You wanna play tough bitch!
                             (to her girlfriends)
                        Take her shit.

           The Girl grabs the woman by the hair and drags her to the 
           ground. Starts kicking her. In the woman’s car we see her TWO 
           CHILDREN in the backseat, helplessly watching.

           INT. WALMART SUPER CENTER - SAME

           The store runs diesel generators for power. Will grabs two 
           red, plastic GAS CANISTERS. Next to him we see a UPS DRIVER 
           holding a serrated survival knife, eying it for purchase.

           EXT. EXXON STATION. MILWAUKEE  - MORNING

           The line of cars spills down the block. Diesel generators 
           power the pumps.

           Will fills the gas canisters with regular unleaded: $7.40 a 
           gallon. When he stops pumping an Attendant speeds over. The 
           total shows $146.20. Will pulls two bills from his wallet: a 
           hundred and a fifty.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Call it two hundred. 

                                 WILL 
                        That’s not what it says.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Supply and demand. Sorry buddy.

                                 WILL
                        You’re kidding?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        The fuck I am. Say the Middle 
                        East’s behind this shit. What then?

           The line of cars starts honking. People yell. 
                                 GUY IN CAR
                        Hey asshole! Pay the guy or leave!  

           Will shrinks back. He hands the Attendant another fifty. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT. BANK OF AMERICA - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom leans against the BMW, watching Will lug the two heavy 
           canisters of gas through the parking lot traffic.

                                 TOM
                        The Bank’s getting run. They’ll be 
                        out of cash in an hour.   

                                 WILL
                        I need to get back to my rental. 

                                 TOM
                        I’ve decided to drive you. In the 
                        BMW. Seeing I just drove here, it’s 
                        probably better to take a car you 
                        can trust. Happy now?

           Will loads the gas canisters in the trunk, sweating.

                                 WILL
                        You gonna let me drive at least?

                                 TOM
                        Doubt it. My car. But maybe if I 
                        get tired. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever. Let’s just go. 

                                 TOM
                             (looks around)
                        Yeah, Milwaukee’s getting old.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90, WISCONSIN - AFTERNOON

           Tom and Will drive, leaving the outskirts of Milwaukee. 
           Eighteen wheelers line the shoulder.

                                 TOM
                        Buy any Springsteen? 

           They see an OLDER COUPLE next to their RV, trying to flag 
           them down.  
                                 WILL
                        Should we stop?

                                 TOM
                        And do what?

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WISCONSIN ROADBLOCK - AFTERNOON

           Two ARMY HUMVEES block the highway, reducing it to a single 
           lane. YOUNG SOLDIERS, with M-16 ASSAULT RIFLES, talk to each 
           car before waving them on.

           A SOLDIER signals the BMW forward. Steps to the driver’s side 
           window.   

                                 SOLDIER
                        Afternoon, Sir. Can I ask where 
                        you’re going?

                                 TOM
                        Heading home to Seattle. What’s 
                        going on? 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Due to the power outage, sir, we 
                        don’t have our usual resources on 
                        the road. The next few exits have 
                        plenty of hotel rooms. Some of them 
                        have generators. We’re encouraging 
                        people to stay off the roads. 

           Will leans across. 

                                 WILL
                        What if we drive?

                                 SOLDIER
                        That’s up to you. We’re here to let 
                        you know, if you get a flat, 
                        anything like that, don’t expect a 
                        response. Personnel is tied up in 
                        the towns and cities. 

                                 TOM
                        So no speed limit?

                                 SOLDIER
                        You’re on your own out there.

                                 TOM
                        Do you know what happened? You can 
                        tell me, soldier. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I’ve got a pair of fatigues just 
                        like those in my closet.

           The Soldier glances at the other Soldiers, sees they’re busy. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Look, there’s maximum security 
                        prisons over the next couple 
                        hundred miles. We don’t know the 
                        status there. Ok? 

                                 WILL
                        What happened to the power?  

           The Soldier takes a breath.

                                 SOLDIER
                        We’re told a utility plant went 
                        down, triggering a grid collapse. 
                        It’ll be up and running soon. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re told? What about the 
                        earthquake off the west coast? 

                                 SOLDIER
                             (stares purposely at Will, 
                              waving them on)
                        Didn’t hear about that, sir. You 
                        all drive safely. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Tom accelerates the BMW past the roadblock. 

                                 WILL
                        Did you see that? He practically 
                        told us he was lying.

                                 TOM
                        I know.  

           Tom continues to accelerate, hitting the cruise control 
           button when they reach 90 MPH. 

                                 WILL
                        We’ll get better mileage at sixty. 

                                 TOM
                        If we do sixty I’ll shoot myself.
           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WISCONSIN - AFTERNOON

           The BMW flies down a stretch of barren highway, passing the 
           ‘Welcome to Minnesota’ billboard. Will spots a white horn 
           deer, hopping with a baby doe. Then he sees-

           A MILE LONG TRAIN running parallel to the Interstate. Box 
           cars have been replaced by flatbeds of heavy Army equipment: 
           TANKS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, HUMVEES, MISSILES. Soldiers are 
           perched in some of the vehicles, manning M-60 GUN TURRETS. 

                                 WILL
                        Any idea what that means?

                                 TOM  
                        Yeah. We’re not the only ones 
                        heading west. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE AFTERNOON

           The BMW passes a sign for a “REST STOP”. Tom sighs in relief. 

                                 TOM
                        I need to stretch my legs.  

           EXT. REST STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

           Tom enters the Men’s bathroom. Aside from a couple RVs parked 
           in the distance, the stop looks deserted. 

           Will leans against the BMW, studying a map of I-90. 

           LIZA, 19, daisy dukes, bleached hair, sneaks up behind Will. 

                                 LIZA
                        Nice car, cutie. 

           Will flinches, caught off guard. The girl licks her lips.

                                 LIZA
                        What’s that cost, like a hundred 
                        grand? I bet I’d like driving fast 
                        with you. 
                             (giggles)
                        Cat got your tongue?

           Will holds up his wedding ring. 

                                 WILL
                        Sorry.
           Liza shifts gears. 

                                 LIZA  
                        Hey fuck you, mister.  

           AN ‘86 FORD BRONCO peels out from the other side of the rest 
           stop. Speeding over.   

                                 LIZA  
                        Now I’m gonna have to tell my 
                        brothers.  

                                 WILL
                        Hey c’mon.    

           The Bronco skids next to the BMW. The doors swing open. CHAD, 
           24, and RANDY, 20, both scrawny farm kids. They shouldn’t be 
           intimidating sans the obvious factor: Crystal Meth.  

                                 CHAD
                        What’s the matter, sis?

                                 LIZA
                        He called me a slut. All I said was 
                        nice car. 

                                 CHAD
                        That right?

                                 WILL
                        That’s not what happened. I misread 
                        her.   

                                 RANDY
                        Fucking yuppie. 

                                 WILL
                        C’mon, I’m just trying to get home 
                        to my wife. I’m sorry. Ok?
                             (to Liza)
                        I apologize. 

                                 CHAD
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Chad grabs a CROW BAR from the Bronco. Prepares to swing at 
           the BMW’s windshield.

                                 WILL
                        Wait!!! What do you want?

                                 CHAD
                        Now that depends whatcha got?
           Tom walks up to the BMW, taking in the scene. 

                                 TOM
                        Hey now. Don’t break my window. 
                        We’ve got a long drive ahead of us.

                                 RANDY
                        Shut the fuck up old man. 

           Tom stares the boy down with little concern. Will whips out 
           his wallet, shoving a few hundred dollar bills at Chad. 

                                 WILL
                        Take it. Just let us go. 

           Chad grabs the cash. Tom stares at Will, not quite believing 
           he gave him the money.

                                 CHAD
                        Give it up, pops. You too. 

                                 TOM
                        That’s not enough for you?  

           Chad grips the crow bar. Tom hits the car remote and the 
           trunk pops open.

                                 TOM  
                        Money’s in my luggage. 

           Chad walks Tom to the trunk. Holds the crow bar up high.

           Liza giggles at Will.

                                 LIZA
                        He aint even my brother. I don’t 
                        fuck my brother, dumb ass.

                                 CHAD
                        Liza, shut up. 

           Tom leans into the trunk and quickly peels a Velcro lining 
           off the wheel well. Inside we see a GLOCK semi-automatic 
           HANDGUN. Tom spins, holding the Glock to Chad’s forehead.

                                 TOM
                        I couldn’t find my wallet. 

                                 WILL
                        Holy shit. What are you doing?

                                 TOM
                        Get in the car, Will. 
           Tom glances at Randy and Liza. Cocks the gun.

                                 TOM  
                        You two. Start walking that way. 
                        Hands in the air. 

           Tom shoves the gun into Chad’s temple. 

                                 CHAD
                        Do what he says!

           Tom itches the trigger, inches from Chad’s eye. 

                                 TOM
                        Do you think I got this car by 
                        letting scum like you walk over me 
                        and my family? Do you?! Answer me! 

                                 CHAD
                        Please... 

           Tom grabs Will’s money from Chad. 

                                 TOM 
                        Start running. Now!

           Chad bolts down the parking lot.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE AFTERNOON

           The BMW speeds down the highway, passing agriculture farms in 
           southern Minnesota. Tom breaths hard, a little constrained. 

                                 TOM
                        You’ve been awful quiet, Will.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe you should have told me you 
                        had a gun. 

                                 TOM
                        And then? What? 

                                 WILL
                        What if they had guns? 

                                 TOM
                        You suddenly an expert on risk? 

                                 WILL
                        No, I forgot. I’m just the lucky 
                        shit that married your daughter.
           Tom smirks.

                                 TOM
                        I’ll grant you lucky. I never 
                        called you a shit. 

           EXT. FLYING J’S REST STOP. INTERSTATE 90 - EVENING

           The BMW speeds down the highway passing the FLYING J’S. The 
           packed trucker’s stop is filled with cars and frantic people. 
           The line for gas stretches onto the highway’s shoulder. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - SAME

           Will and Tom stare at the FLYING J’S from the highway. 
           There’s a PETROLEUM TANKER parked by the underground storage 
           tanks. A crowd of ANGRY MEN circle. The tanker’s scared 
           DRIVER waves the crowd back, holding a baseball bat.   

                                 WILL
                        Are they going to attack him?   

                                 TOM
                        I’m guessing they are. Will, people 
                        are capable of things you can’t 
                        imagine. Trust me. We can’t 
                        hesitate. Not until this is over.   

           Tom wipes his brow. Stares ahead at the highway.

                                 TOM
                        Listen, being a good man, dad, 
                        husband, it doesn’t mean shit if 
                        you can’t survive. You have to be 
                        good and survive. That’s the rub. 
                        We’re all a step away from being 
                        evil. You understand me? In times 
                        like this, if someone’s not doing 
                        the right thing, fuck them. It’s 
                        that simple.   

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - SUNSET

           Will looks out the window. Ahead he sees a roadside sign: 
           MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON AREA: NO HITCHHIKERS. 

           Will turns to Tom, pausing to collect himself. 

                                 TOM
                        You got something to say, say it. 
                                 WILL
                        I gave them the money because Sam’s 
                        pregnant. I can’t take any risks. I 
                        have to get back to her. 

           Tom stares at Will and then ahead at the road. Silent. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry to tell you like this.

                                 TOM
                        How did you plan on telling me?

                                 WILL
                        Sam planned a surprise dinner for 
                        you. Next week.

           Tom eyes Will. A small smile. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. MINNESOTA - SUNSET

           The sun’s setting rays light up the desolate farm fields. The 
           745 BMW is parked outside a boxcar Diner next to the freeway. 
           Will and Tom exit carrying to-go boxes.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           Tom drives with the headlights on. His face is constricted 
           and he has the AC cranked. 

                                 WILL
                        You ok? It’s freezing.

                                 TOM
                        I haven’t pulled a gun since before 
                        Sam’s mom died. 
                             (smiles at Will)
                        I’m fine.   

           Tom turns the AC down just as-

           A STATE TROOPER’S LIGHTS AND SIRENS flash up behind the BMW. 
           Tom and Will flinch.

                                 WILL
                        So much for no speed limit.

           Tom studies the rearview. The Trooper is hugging his bumper. 
           Tom pulls the Glock from his waist. 
                                 TOM
                        Put it in the glove compartment. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90 - SAME

           The BMW stops on the shoulder. The State Police Car pulls in 
           behind them. Tom and Will wait as nothing happens. 

           Will checks his cell phone. No signal. 

                                 WILL
                        He’s not checking our plates. He 
                        can’t. Let me see what he wants.

           Will opens his door and gets out.

           Tom eyes the rearview, watching the Officer behind the wheel. 
           As the Officer’s getting out he sees his uniform doesn’t 
           quite fit. And there’s a tattoo on his neck.

                                 TOM
                        Shit.

           Tom grabs the Glock from the glove compartment.

                                 TOM
                        Will!!! Back in the car!

           Too late. Will freezes as the Officer grabs a SHOTGUN and 
           aims.

                                 TOM
                        Don’t fucking move!!

           Tom exits the BMW, pointing his Glock. The Officer swings his 
           shotgun away from Will and FIRES at Tom!

           Will ducks down, jumping back into the BMW, not seeing the 
           shotgun blast SHRED into Tom’s right shoulder and chest.

           Tom slams back against his door and slumps into the BMW, in 
           shock. But then, without missing a beat, he puts the car in 
           reverse and guns back at the cruiser. 

           The fake Officer jumps out of the way as the BMW slams into 
           the Police car’s door. 

           Tom puts the car in drive and slams the gas pedal, peeling 
           off the dirt shoulder. 

           BOOM! Pellets from another shotgun blast pierce the BMW. 
           Tom swerves, getting onto the highway. Will sees the POLICE 
           CAR start to speed after them.  

                                 WILL
                        He’s coming!

           Tom accelerates the BMW to 110 MPH.

                                 TOM  
                        The Glock’s ammo is in the trunk! 
                        In the wheel well!

                                 WILL
                        It wasn’t loaded before?!

                                 TOM
                        It didn’t need to be before. Now 
                        get it!  

           Will grabs the Glock, now seeing Tom’s shoulder covered in 
           BLOOD.  

                                 WILL
                        Holy shit! You’re shot! He shot 
                        you! 

                                 TOM
                        Stay calm! I’m fine! Get the ammo.

           Will starts crawling in back. 

                                 TOM
                        Get down!

           The POLICE CAR rams their bumper. Tom hits the gas again, 
           swerving, sending Will face first into the backseat. 

           Will gets the seat down and scrambles to the trunk’s wheel 
           well, grabbing the ammo clip. 

           THE POLICE CAR pulls right next to the BMW. Tom glances over 
           and sees the driver aiming the shotgun as he drives.  

           Tom slams the brakes, skidding out. He quickly hits the gas 
           and loops the BMW behind the Police Car in a horseshoe. 

                                 TOM
                        Put the magazine in and shoot! 

           Will slides back into the backseat and jams the clip in 
           backwards as Tom powers down the windows.  
                                 TOM  
                        Shoot! 

           Will gets the clip in and points the Glock at the Police Car. 
           He pulls the trigger. Nothing. 

                                 TOM  
                        Shoot them! 

                                 WILL
                        It’s not working! 

                                 TOM
                        Take the safety off! You can do 
                        this!

           Will finds the safety and clicks it off. He points blindly 
           out the window. BANG!    

                                 TOM
                        Again! But use two hands and aim! 
                        Shoot the tires!

           Will aims at the rear tire and SHOOTS, just missing. The 
           Trooper skids to a stop before accelerating again. 

                                 TOM  
                        Good job! Put your seat belt on! 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Seat belt!

           Tom hits the gas. Will finds a seat belt, staring at Tom’s 
           gunshot wound.

           Tom engages the wheel’s trip-tronic shifting paddles and  
           upshifts like he’s driving a formula one car. 

                                 TOM  
                        C’mon German engineering!
                        C’mon!

           The BMW drives down the desolate highway at an insane speed. 
           The wind whipping through the windows. 

                                 TOM
                             (fighting back the pain)
                        Can you see him?!
                                 WILL
                        No. 

           Tom sees a dirt road coming around a bend. It runs 
           perpendicular to the interstate. 

           Tom slams the brakes and turns onto the dirt road, heading 
           off the highway. He turns the HEADLIGHTS OFF and speeds the 
           BMW down the dirt road in darkness.  

                                 TOM
                        Where is he?! 

           Tom slows slightly. Will sees the Police Car miss the dirt 
           road’s turn off and continue speeding down the interstate.

                                 WILL  
                        He didn’t turn! He didn’t turn.

                                 TOM
                        Did he see our lights?

                                 WILL
                        No. He’s gone!

           Tom turns the headlights ON. And in a flash: 

                                 WILL
                        Look out!

           A HERD OF ELK freezes in the middle of the road. Tom slams 
           the brakes and swerves! The BMW skids off the dirt road and 
           crashes into a gully, its headlights still framing the Elk.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           INT. TOM’S BMW - ONE HOUR LATER

           Tom stirs. He flicks on the cabin light, gritting his teeth. 
           He’s pale and slumped over the steering wheel. 

                                 TOM
                        Will.

           Tom glances under his arm at the backseat. He sees blood 
           streaming from a large GASH atop Will’s forehead.

                                 TOM
                        Will!

           Will rolls his head, barely cognizant.
                                 WILL
                        Are you ok?

                                 TOM
                        Whatever happens, keep going! Say 
                        you will! 

           Will wipes the blood from his scared eyes. 

                                 WILL
                        I’ll keep going.

                                 TOM
                        Remember what I said! You have to 
                        be stronger than them! Do you hear 
                        me?! I believe in you.  

           Will starts to nod but then passes out again. 

                                 TOM
                        Shit.

           Tom wheezes for air; his lungs sound punctured. He looks to 
           the sky, eyes filling with tears and pleading.   

           Tom digs in his pocket and pulls out a PEN and a scrap of 
           paper. He fights through the pain and begins to write.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM. SEATTLE HOSPITAL - WILL DREAMING

           Sam Reacher is on the delivery table. Screaming. Sweating. 
           Pushing her baby into the world. 

           Will strokes her hair, encouraging her, loving her, about to 
           become a parent with her. 

           A Doctor is kneeling between her legs. Sam pushes with all 
           her might, squeezing Will’s hand until the tendons flex. 
           FINALLY- the first screams of a newborn. 

           Will loses himself in Sam’s eyes as she inhales like never 
           before. 

                                                             SMASH CUT:
           INT. KOOTENAI MEDICAL BUILDING - THE NEXT MORNING

           Will jolts awake from his dream, sweating. He’s on an 
           examiner’s table. A BANDAGE on his forehead. The room’s 
           medical equipment is outdated, but the lights are ON. 

           RICKY LEE, 17, tan skin, shy and skinny, sits across from 
           Will, listening to his Ipod. When he hears Will wake he takes 
           off his headphones, apprehensive.     

                                 WILL
                        Where am I?

                                 RICKY
                        I... I found you last night. My 
                        father’s reservation. The Kootenai. 
                        On the border of South Dakota, 
                        before the Badlands. 

                                 WILL
                        The power’s back on?

                                 RICKY
                        It’s a generator.   

           ISRAEL LEE, 53, Native American, cowboy boots and belt, 
           enters, all business. He sees Will awake. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Ricky. Find something to do with 
                        yourself.

           Ricky walks past his dad, avoiding eye contact.

           Will props himself up, turning to Israel.

                                 WILL
                        Where’s my friend? 

           EXT. KOOTENAI MEDICAL BUILDING - MORNING

           Israel leads Will outside and into the morning sun, the light 
           blinding and amplifying Will’s headache. They’re surrounded 
           by makeshift structures. A school. A general store. 

           Israel opens the door to a storage shack. Inside there’s A 
           BODY, covered by a blue plastic tarp. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        He was dead when Ricky found you.  
           Will spins. At a loss. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Why were you on my land? 

                                 WILL
                        We were being chased. We turned off 
                        the highway and crashed... Where’s 
                        the car?

                                 ISRAEL
                        We towed it in. It’ll drive after a 
                        little work. You’ll take the body 
                        with you? 

           Will grimaces, crushed by his headache and grief. He takes a 
           knee, shielding his eyes and trying to gather himself.

                                 WILL
                        Sorry. Yes. I’ll bury him.  

           INT. ISRAEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will wakes on a cot in the small cabin. Israel sits, watching 
           Will, sipping from a tumbler of whisky. The only thing on the 
           wall is a cow skull bejewelled with Jade rock. 

                                 WILL
                        What time is it?

                                 ISRAEL
                        There’s something you need to see. 
                        Or hear. Before you decide to go.

           INT. ISRAEL’S HOUSE. RADIO ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Ricky sits at a communication board of short wave radios. We 
           hear multiple voices communicating. Ricky turns another knob 
           and Morse code messages tap at a frantic pace. 

           Will stands behind Israel and Ricky.

                                 ISRAEL
                        A gift from The Department of 
                        Defense. When they wanted to 
                        communicate Morse in Navajo. In the 
                        1940s. Been quiet in here until 
                        now.
                             (sips his whiskey)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        My son is the only one who really 
                        knows how to use it. See how you 
                        come in handy, Ricky? 

           Ricky keeps his focus on the radio controls and away from his 
           father. 

                                 WILL
                        What are they saying? Where are the 
                        voices coming from?

                                 ISRAEL
                        Ricky?

                                 RICKY
                        Dirt crickets. 

                                 WILL
                        Who?

                                 RICKY
                        Hippies. Off grid folks trying to 
                        get news. And the Army. The 
                        military is using short waves.  

                                 ISRAEL
                        It’s like the good ol’ days.

                                 WILL
                        Look, I saw an Army train heading 
                        west. CNN said there was an 
                        earthquake. Nothing seems to work. 
                        Do we know anything?

           Israel drains his drink, swaying.

                                 ISRAEL
                        We know everything! We know no one 
                        knows a damn thing. And by itself 
                        that’s a very bad thing. 

           Will stares at the equipment. Absorbing it all. He sees a 
           chair in the back of the room.

                                 WILL
                             (to Ricky)
                        Can I listen with you? 

           Ricky nods at Will.

                                 ISRAEL
                        It’s better than tv, huh Ricky?.. I 
                        asked you a question. Answer me.
           Ricky glares at his dad.

                                 RICKY
                        Yes. It’s better than tv.   

                                 ISRAEL
                             (to Will)
                        Don’t mind him, he can be a little 
                        pussy. But he gets in front of the 
                        radio and thinks he’s important.

           Israel leaves, closing the door. Will takes a seat. 

           LATER IN THE NIGHT-

           The radio taps in Morse code. 

                                 WILL
                        You know Morse?

                                 RICKY
                        A little. It’s mostly relayed 
                        reports, tower to tower.   

           The radio crackles as voices fight to be heard. Ricky plays 
           with the knobs, cranking the volume. 

                                 RICKY
                        This is from far away, you can hear 
                        the delay. 

           Loud, frantic voices come to life in quick succession.

                                 ARMY VOICE ON RADIO
                        We have two battleships, just 
                        swallowed whole! Two miles out it 
                        was five hundred feet tall! Three 
                        hundred men. I’m in a Chinook 
                        transport. Los Angeles is... 
                        it’s... Switch to channel 2 and 
                        give me updates.

                                 FEMALE VOICE ON RADIO
                        People are on top of buildings! I’m 
                        twenty miles in from the shore. 
                        It’s like a river! The cars are 
                        everywhere! No one got out! Please 
                        God! What the fuck is going on?!!!

           The transmissions cut. Ricky plays with the knobs but he 
           can’t bring back the voices. There’s a long silence as Will 
           and Ricky struggle to comprehend what they just heard. 
                                 RICKY
                        You still going?

           Will nods.

                                 RICKY
                        Do you know where Yakima is? Near 
                        where you live in Seattle?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

                                 RICKY
                        My mother lives there. She just got 
                        out of jail. I want to go there. 

           Ricky gets up. Slow to his feet. He stares at Will and then 
           takes a folded piece of paper from his pocket. 

                                 RICKY
                        I forgot to give this to you. It 
                        was in his hand when I found you. 
                        It’s instructions. And a note for 
                        your wife. I’m sorry.

           Will takes the paper, unfolding it, seeing a bloody 
           fingerprint of Tom’s. 

           INT. ISRAEL’S HOUSE - LATE MORNING

           Will sits in the cot, head aching, reading TOM’S NOTE. He 
           hears Israel SCREAMING at Ricky in the other room. When Ricky 
           starts to speak his father yells over him.

           Israel comes through the door, slamming it behind him, 
           clearly nursing a hangover. He sees Will awake. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        You have kids?

                                 WILL
                        My wife’s pregnant.

                                 ISRAEL
                        If you get back to her, good luck. 
                        They’re more than you bargain for. 

           Will stares at Israel, not sure of his meaning.

                                 ISRAEL
                        Ricky’s finished with your car. 
                        Leave when you’re ready.  
           EXT. KOOTENAI RESERVATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Will walks to the BMW and inspects the car. He gets in the 
           driver’s seat and turns his attention back to Tom’s note.  

           EXT. RESERVATION ROADS - MORNING 

           Will charges the BMW down the reservation’s dirt roads. He 
           changes gears with the trip-tronic shifters and drifts into a 
           corner, out of control. 

           Will slams the brakes to prevent crashing. He spins the wheel 
           and tries again. At the next corner the BMW holds its 
           velocity, barely skidding out.

           Will speeds down a straightaway, passing a billboard 
           advertisement for the tribe’s ‘CASINO/RESORT’ some miles 
           away. After the billboard’s a bullet riddled 35 MPH SIGN. 

           Will stops in front of the sign and gets out with the Glock. 
           He aims at the MPH sign, holding the gun with one hand. He 
           pulls the trigger but the recoil rips his arm back. He fires 
           again, still missing.

                                 WILL
                        Fuck. 

           Will gets back in the BMW. But as he moves for the ignition 
           button he notices the floor mat under the steering wheel. 
           It’s covered in Tom’s BLOOD.  

           Will gets back out and eyes the sign, focused. He grips the 
           Glock with two hands like Tom told him. He pulls the trigger 
           and the bullet rips through the edge of the metal sign. 

           EXT. BMW. KOOTENAI SHACK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Will reads Tom’s instructions. He takes a flat head 
           screwdriver and leans inside the BMW’s trunk. He pops out the 
           brake and tail lights, unscrewing the bulbs. 

           Ricky watches from across a dirt soccer field. Kids his age 
           play and hang out but Ricky’s a loner, isolated from the 
           others and listening to his Ipod.  

           Will sees Ricky and waves him over. Will gets in the BMW and 
           starts the car.  

                                 WILL
                        See any lights?  
           Ricky nods no. Will puts his foot on the brake. 

                                 WILL
                        How about now?

                                 RICKY
                        No. 

           Ricky walks to his garage. He comes back holding a clear 
           plastic hose, six feet in length. 

                                 RICKY
                        Gas stations are closed. You might 
                        need a siphon.

                                 WILL
                        Thanks.
                             (eyes the storage shack)
                        You mind helping me?

           Will and Ricky carry TOM’S BODY and load him into the trunk 
           of the BMW. 

                                 RICKY
                        When are you leaving?

                                 WILL
                        Soon as it’s dark.

           EXT. KOOTENAI RESERVATION - SUNSET

           Members of the tribe surround a bonfire that casts shadows 
           across the reservation. Will walks over to Israel, who’s 
           nursing a beer.

                                 WILL
                        I’m heading out. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Ricky ask you already? 

                                 WILL
                        Ask me what?

                                 ISRAEL
                        He wants to go with you. To Yakima. 
                             (dismissive)
                        The boy’s mother is there. 

                                 WILL
                        What?  
                                 ISRAEL
                        According to him he’s a big man 
                        now. Maybe you heard him try and 
                        yell at me. He knows the risk. 

           Will stares at Israel, not sure if he’s being serious.

                                 WILL
                        Are you joking? He’s a kid. I can’t 
                        control what happens. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Nobody controls what happens, Will. 

           EXT. KOOTENAI RESERVATION - TWILIGHT

           Israel walks Will to the BMW. When they get to the car Israel 
           smirks; there’s no sign of Ricky. 

                                 WILL
                        So where is he?

                                 ISRAEL
                        He’s too scared to ask you. If you 
                        say no he’ll know I was right. 

           Israel points at two full gas canisters and several gallons 
           of water in the BMW’S backseat.

                                 ISRAEL
                        He gave you some gas and water. If 
                        things get back to normal, send me 
                        a check.

                                 WILL
                        I will. Thank Ricky for me. 

           EXT. KOOTENAI RESERVATION - NIGHT

           Will drives the BMW down the reservation’s dirt roads, 
           headlights ON, nearing the Interstate 90 turn off. He takes a 
           deep breath, but then-

           Sees RICKY, riding his bicycle in the middle of the road. 
           Will slams the brakes and quickly gets out, caught off guard.

                                 WILL
                        What are you doing?

                                 RICKY
                        I need to come with you.
                                 WILL
                        No way. You didn’t even say goodbye 
                        to your dad.

                                 RICKY
                        So? Would you?

           Will glances back at the car. 

                                 WILL
                        Get in. I’ll drive you back. 

           Ricky stares Will down. He points to the side of the road, 
           skid marks from when the BMW crashed. 

                                 RICKY
                        You owe me! 

                                 WILL
                        I can’t, Ricky. You have a choice 
                        in this. 

                                 RICKY
                        Your wife’s pregnant. I read the 
                        note. I already fixed the car once. 
                        I got you gas. I can help you. And 
                        you can help me get to my mom.  

           Will eyes Ricky, not sure what to do. There’s a tangible 
           desperation in the kid’s eyes.

                                 RICKY
                        I can help you get back to her, 
                        Will. Please. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BMW. KOOTENAI RESERVATION - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW reaches the turn off to Interstate 90 and stops. Will 
           grips the wheel and turns to Ricky. 

                                 WILL
                        Once I turn I can’t take you back.    

                                 RICKY
                        I don’t want to go back. I’m not 
                        afraid.

                                 WILL
                        Keep telling yourself that.
           Will turns the HEADLIGHTS OFF. He stares at Ricky as the BMW 
           blends into the dark night.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           The dashboard’s green display lights fade up on Will and 
           Ricky. A FULL MOON lights the fields and highway, granting 
           the BMW visibility as it drives without headlights.  

           Will sets cruise control at 65 MPH as they drive in silence. 
           They pass a billboard welcoming them to SOUTH DAKOTA. 

           A LIGHT flickers in the rearview. Headlights approach quickly 
           from behind. A single car.  

           Will brakes hard and pulls the BMW off the shoulder onto the 
           dirt. An SUV speeds past the hidden BMW.  

           Will pulls the BMW back onto the Interstate. 

           Will gets the car back up to 65 MPH. A new set of lights show 
           up in the rearview. Will eyes the cruise control.

                                 WILL
                        Fuck it.  

           Will hits the gas and the turbo boosts the car forward. 
           Ricky’s eyes widen as they accelerate in the darkness. He 
           glances at the speedometer: 90 MPH.   

           Will sees the taillights of the car that passed them: the 
           SUV. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m going to follow them. I can use 
                        their lights as a guide.

           Will checks Ricky out. Sees a flicker of nerves cross the 
           boy’s face. 

                                 WILL
                        They can’t see us.

           Will closes the gap to a hundred yards behind the SUV. He 
           slows to 80 MPH. Will toggles the INFO BUTTON on the steering 
           wheel. The display lights up: MPG, TRIP ODOMETER, GAS TANK: 
           220 MILES. 
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE NIGHT

           The BMW lurks behind the SUV’s taillights. Ricky glances at 
           the clock: 2:00 AM.

                                 WILL
                        We have seventy miles left.  

                                 RICKY
                        Then we use the gas canisters? 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. Which will give us about a 
                        hundred more miles.

           Will glances out at the sky as a bolt of lightning hits the 
           ground. 

                                 RICKY
                        And then?

                                 WILL
                        I have friends in Rapid City. We’ll 
                        stop there before we hit Wyoming.   

           Ricky glances at the dashboard clock. 

                                 RICKY
                        It’s two o’clock.

                                 WILL
                        And?

           Ricky meant it rhetorically. He looks at Will, at a loss. But 
           then he opens his backpack.

                                 RICKY
                        Teriyaki Jerky?

           Will shakes his head, grabbing a piece of jerkey, slightly 
           amused by the peace offering. 

           EXT. SOUTH DAKOTA BADLANDS. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           The sky is purple, lighting the other worldly rock formations 
           of the badlands. The Full Moon burns bright and tumbleweeds 
           dance across the highway. An enormous bolt of lightning 
           strikes down from a set of dark storm clouds.
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE NIGHT

           The BMW follows the SUV’s taillights. The SUV swerves, then 
           quickly corrects, like the driver is tired. 

           Will glances at Ricky and sees him pull a COMPASS from his 
           travel bag.   

                                 WILL
                        Say we’re heading west?

                                 RICKY
                        It just keeps moving. In circles.

                                 WILL
                        It’s giving you nothing?

                                 RICKY
                             (tapping the compass)
                        Yeah.  

                                 WILL
                        It’s the atmosphere. Maybe a 
                        magnetic storm. 

           A set of bright HEADLIGHTS appear coming at them. Fast.

                                 WILL
                        Are they on our side of the 
                        highway?

           Ricky looks beyond the taillights of the SUV and sees the 
           coming headlights. Again the SUV swerves slightly. 

                                 RICKY
                        I can’t tell.

           Will switches lanes so he can use the SUV’s headlights to 
           see. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t see them anymore. Does the 
                        road drop off?!

                                 RICKY
                        I don’t know!

           THE COMING HEADLIGHTS crest a hill, right in front of the SUV 
           on I-90W. 

                                 WILL
                        Shit!
           Will toggles the BMW’s HEADLIGHTS ON. 

           The SUV SWERVES but it’s too late. The coming car, a SEDAN, 
           clips the SUV as all the headlights converge in SLOW MOTION. 

           The SUV flips. TWO PASSENGERS are thrown from the vehicle.

           The SEDAN fish tails directly at the BMW. 

                                 WILL
                        Hold on!!!

           The BMW and the SEDAN swerve in opposite directions. The 
           Sedan’s wheels catch on the asphalt, the inertia flipping the 
           Sedan into the air. 

           Ricky whips his head around, seeing the passenger’s in the 
           Sedan, upside down, airborne.  

           The BMW careens off the shoulder into the dirt fields, flying 
           through bushes, heading straight for a Badland’s ROCK SPIRE.   

           Will jerks the wheel left and the wheels catch in the dirt. 
           They miss the spire by inches. 

           The BMW shoots back onto Interstate 90. Will slams the brakes 
           and the BMW screeches to a halt.

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - SAME

           The BMW is two hundred feet beyond the crash site. Will and 
           Ricky get out, shell shocked, staring at the wrecked cars. 

           A WOMAN lies flat, next to the SUV. Several feet away a 
           bloodied MAN is clawing his way toward her. 

                                 WILL
                        Jesus.

           Will sprints to the SUV, searching for a First-Aid kit. It’s 
           a mess. He sees Ricky staring at him, standing next to the 
           woman’s body.

                                 RICKY
                        They’re dead. 

           The dead Man’s outstretched hand is inches from the dead 
           Woman. Will stares at a wedding band on the man’s finger.
           Will and Ricky turn to the Sedan. The damage is horrific. 
           There’s A MAN AND TWO WOMEN trapped in the car, moaning and 
           bathed in blood. Will looks to Ricky as a bolt of lightening 
           lights up the sky.   

                                 RICKY
                        We can’t leave them like this.

           THREE NEW SETS OF HEADLIGHTS appear on I90W, speeding at 
           them. PICK-UP TRUCKS. 

                                 WILL
                        They’re going to die. We need to 
                        go.

                                 RICKY
                        No. We have to help them.

                                 WILL
                        We’re leaving! Now!

           The three trucks zig-zag on the road. Will sees the 
           silhouettes of people in the front truck’s bed, holding the 
           roll bar above the cab.

           Will starts sprinting but Ricky doesn’t move. 

                                 WILL
                        C’mon! Move!

           Will gets to the BMW and turns off the headlights. He quickly 
           drives the BMW off the highway, hiding next to a rock spire. 
           He yells back.

                                 WILL
                        Ricky! Now!

           Ricky moves to the side of the road, ignoring Will and 
           watching the trucks from where he’s hidden.

           The THREE PICK UP TRUCKS stop at the crash. A gang of young 
           MEN and WOMEN pile out, beers in hand.  

           A WOMAN, 20, walks to the Sedan, swinging a SHOTGUN like a 
           cheerleader’s baton. 

           Ricky retreats further into the brush, officially scared. He 
           starts sprinting at the BMW.

           Will watches in the rearview. He sees the Woman pull a MAN’S 
           BODY from the sedan. She removes his wallet. 
           Will opens the passenger door, slowly driving the BMW through 
           the spires and berms. 

           Ricky sprints amazingly fast and reaches the BMW. Once Ricky 
           jumps in Will slowly drives the BMW onto the highway.  

           Ricky stares back at the scene. A MAN, 22, sees the departing  
           BMW and raises his shotgun to shoot. 

           Will hits the gas. The BMW disappears down the highway as a 
           SHOTGUN BLAST echoes across the Badlands. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Will accelerates down the highway. Furious.

                                 WILL
                        Next time I’ll leave you! I swear 
                        to God!

           Ricky stares away, knowing he fucked up.

                                 WILL
                        You do what I say! I don’t have 
                        time for bullshit. We’ll fucking 
                        die. Do you get that now? Am I 
                        clear?! I’ll drop you off right now 
                        if not.

                                 RICKY
                        I’m sorry. From now on I’ll listen. 
                        I’m sorry. You were right.

           Will sees Ricky fighting off tears. Truly just a kid. 

           Will turns back to the road but not before catching a glimpse 
           of Ricky’s forearm, below his rolled up sleeve. The flesh is 
           covered in SCARS from cigarette burns. 

           Will focuses on the road and calms down.

                                 WILL
                        You ok? You run track in school? 
                        You ran pretty fast back there. 

                                 RICKY
                        I didn’t do sports.

           Ricky stares out at the storm, getting his bearings back. 
                                 RICKY
                        I got chased a lot. Among other 
                        things. 

                                 WILL
                        Other things?  

                                 RICKY
                        I didn’t exactly fit in.  

                                 WILL
                        Yeah well, most of us don’t.

           Will and Ricky share a small smile. 

                                 WILL
                        You think it’ll be easier with your 
                        mom?

           Ricky looks at Will and sees him staring at his forearm. 
           Ricky reflexively pulls his sleeve down, hiding the scars. 

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah. It’ll be better. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATER

           The purple sky is bright and ominous, yet also calm. The 
           quiet before the storm. Will nervously eyes the GAS GAUGE as 
           the BMW gets pushed by a wind gust. 

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW parks on the side of the road. The dark sky of the 
           storm right above them. Will removes the gas canisters from 
           the backseat. 

                                 WILL
                        Keep your eyes peeled. 

           Will pops the lid on the BMW’S gas tank and pours the first 
           canister. Ricky takes the cap off the second. 

           CRACK! An enormous bolt of lightning slams the ground like a 
           deafening flash photograph. Then another. Closer. 
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE NIGHT

           The BMW speeds down the highway as the sky swirls above them. 
           Suddenly the clouds unleash HUNDREDS of lightning bolts. Will 
           and Ricky’s eyes bulge.  

           On the ground electrical currents surge in patterns, 
           conjoining in the middle. When the currents connect ENORMOUS 
           BOLTS strike down. 

                                 RICKY
                        I’ve never seen a storm like this. 

           The currents are suddenly everywhere, zig-zagging across the 
           fields, even jumping the highway, shooting past the BMW’S 
           windshield. 

           What they’re seeing is not normal in any Discovery Channel 
           sense of the word. HAIL starts bouncing off the road.  

                                 WILL
                        We need to find cover!

           Will hits the gas and turns the BMW’S headlights ON. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - SAME

           Pellets of hail rain down on the highway, ricocheting off the 
           car. A giant piece of hail CRACKS the windshield in front of 
           Ricky’s terrified face. 

                                 RICKY
                        Holy shit. Holy Shit. 

           The BMW flies down the middle of the highway as lightning 
           shocks the ground. The car begins to SHAKE VIOLENTLY. Will 
           grips the wheel, slowing down. 

                                 WILL
                        We have a flat?!

           The shaking stops. Will speeds back up. A lightning bolt 
           lights up the horizon. A mile down the road is a BRIDGE. 

                                 WILL
                        There!
           EXT. BRIDGE. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW skids to a stop under the bridge. The storm rages on. 
           Will and Ricky sit, catching their breath, safe for now. 

           INT. BMW. UNDER THE BRIDGE - DAWN

           The dark purple sky fades. The lightning storm passing.

                                 WILL
                        A couple minutes and we go. 

           A lightning bolt hits next to the bridge, lighting up the 
           underpass. Will and Ricky freeze, seeing A WOMAN huddled with 
           her CHILDREN.   

           Without warning a MAN knocks on Will’s window. Will slams the 
           gas pedal and the BMW speeds away. 

                                 MAN
                        Ayende mi familia! Por favor!  

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - EARLY MORNING

           The sun breaks through the purple sky. Will and Ricky drive 
           in silence, upset. They pass a road sign: RAPID CITY, 40 
           MILES. Will eyes the gas gauge. 

                                 WILL
                        We’ll make it. 

           In a field next to the highway HUNDREDS OF COWS have herded 
           into a tight circle. WILD HORSES circle the cows, frantic.

                                 WILL
                        Remember the tsunami that hit 
                        Thailand? 
                             (Ricky nods)
                        Before the waves hit, people were 
                        still swimming, but the animals, 
                        somehow they knew and ran for 
                        higher ground. I don’t know how you 
                        explain that. 

                                 RICKY
                        Maybe because they’ve been around 
                        longer than us. 

           Will eyes an abandoned car on the Interstate’s shoulder. 
           Taped to the window: OUT OF GAS, OUT OF LUCK.
           EXT. EXIT RAMP. RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA  - MORNING

           The BMW drives off the highway, immediately greeted by 
           FLASHING LIGHTS. Rapid City police have set up a ROADBLOCK 
           into town.

           The BMW stops in front of the Police cars. The gas gauge 
           shows 7 miles left. 

                                 WILL
                        C’mon.   

           SHERIFF REYNOLDS, 66, walks around the car, sizing up Will 
           and Ricky.  

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Whereabouts you headed?  

                                 WILL
                        My friend lives here.

           Reynolds points at the roadblock. Six Officers have their 
           guns trained on the BMW. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        I look like I fell off the turnip 
                        truck this morning? Get back on the 
                        highway. It’s World War Three. We 
                        don’t have time for bullshit today. 

           Will glances at the gas gauge. The idle time has brought the 
           remaining miles down to six. Will whispers to Ricky:

                                 WILL
                        Keep your hands where they can see 
                        them.

           Will turns the car off.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Now I just finished telling you-

           Will opens his door. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Stay in the car!

           The Sheriff pulls his gun.
                                 WILL
                        Listen! My friend Jon Dumont lives 
                        in this town! Jon Dumont. I was a 
                        groomsmen in his wedding! 

           Will sees an enormous WHITE CROSS on the hill above town.

                                 WILL
                        Jon’s parents used to own the 
                        hardware store! His wife Meg has 
                        jet black hair and owns the thrift 
                        shop... We mean no harm. We’re good 
                        Christians. We just need to rest 
                        for a few hours.

           The Sheriff studies Will. Lowers his gun a few inches.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Alright, son. Relax. Officer 
                        Harris! Escort these boys to the 
                        Dumont’s place. They get turned 
                        away, bring em back. They hesitate, 
                        shoot em.
                             (back to Will)
                        We’re just trying to keep it safe 
                        here. Protect our people. 

                                 WILL
                        God bless.    

           EXT. MAIN STREET. RAPID CITY - MORNING 

           A POLICE CRUISER leads the BMW through the small town. Parked 
           cars line the street and people ride bicycles and mingle like 
           nothing’s happened. It’s surreal. The stores are even open. 

           Will follows the Cruiser as the sun heats up. Will’s nostrils 
           start to flare, smelling something horrible. Will eyes the 
           trunk as Ricky stares at the town’s big white cross.

                                 RICKY
                        Are you Christian?

                                 WILL
                        I am now.  

           EXT. DUMONT FARM - MORNING

           The Police Cruiser stops at the bottom of the driveway. At 
           the top of the hill is a house and a barn.
           EXT. DUMONT FARM - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW parks in front of the house. MEG DUMONT, 28, 
           strikingly beautiful in a modest spring dress, runs out in a 
           panic.

                                 MEG
                        Will!!! Oh thank God!

           Meg grabs Will and starts crying. Will hugs her back, seeing 
           something in her eyes. 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 MEG
                        Jon’s in New York. Was. I don’t 
                        know. He was meeting with clients. 

                                 WILL
                        He’s coming back.

           Meg looks at the BMW. It’s covered in dust and dents. She 
           chokes back her tears.

                                 MEG
                        Nice fucking car, Will. 

           INT. MEG’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Will and Ricky scarf down peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
           Meg leans against the sink. 

                                 MEG
                        What happened to your head?

                                 WILL
                        Sam’s dad and I crashed on Ricky’s 
                        reservation. 

                                 MEG
                        I guess that was good luck. Thank 
                        you, Ricky.

           Ricky looks out the window while nodding with a mouth full of 
           food. He sees two SUVs parked in the barn.

                                 WILL
                        His mom lives in Yakima. Inland 
                        from Seattle. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        Meg, have you been to town?  

           Meg smiles. She opens a drawer and pulls out a pack of 
           cigarettes.

                                 MEG
                        Yeah. After I decided to start 
                        smoking again. 

                                 WILL
                        It’s still normal here.  

                                 MEG
                        How long do you think that’ll last? 
                        An Army train came yesterday. The 
                        Sheriff said it’s World War Three. 
                        I mean, what the fuck does that 
                        mean?

                                 WILL
                        I saw the train in Minnesota. I’m 
                        not sure it’s true. There’s too 
                        many other things happening. Did 
                        you see the lightning last night?

           Meg nods. 

                                 MEG
                        Yeah. I felt the earthquakes too. I 
                        haven’t slept yet. Why would he say 
                        it’s war if it’s not?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. But what kind of war 
                        is like this?

           Meg lights a cigarette. Stressed. 

           Ricky goes to the fridge, staring at a PHOTOGRAPH under a 
           magnet. It’s a photo of two happy couples at a wedding: Will 
           and Sam, Meg and Jon. 

                                 RICKY
                        Is she your wife, Will?

           Will stares hard at the photo, allowing a smile. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. That’s her. 

           Will suddenly remembers something and looks at Meg.
                                 MEG
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        I need to bury Sam’s dad.

           Meg’s eyes goes wide. She glances out the window at the BMW.

                                 MEG
                        He’s in the trunk?

           EXT. DUMONT FARM - AFTERNOON

           The sun is blazing hot. Will and Ricky dig with shovels, 
           shirts off, drenched in sweat. 

                                 RICKY
                        What’s her deal? 

                                 WILL
                        Meg? I don’t know, she’s kind of 
                        crazy.

                                 RICKY
                        And her husband?

                                 WILL
                        Jon’s my friend. You’d like him. 
                        He’ll make it back here. 

           Will bends over, out of breath. Behind him we see Tom’s 
           decomposed body on the ground.

                                 WILL
                        It’s over a hundred degrees. In the 
                        middle of September.  

                                 RICKY
                        It’s ok. You can say it. 

                                 WILL
                        Say what?

                                 RICKY
                        “Indian summer”? 

                                 WILL
                        Very funny. Why do they call it 
                        that?

                                 RICKY
                        I have no idea.  
           Will laughs. Ricky sees this and starts laughing too. But 
           then they hear the sounds of PLANES and look up. There’s SIX 
           B-52 BOMBERS flying at low altitude. 

                                 RICKY
                        Why are they flying so low?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. Maybe they’re using I-
                        90 as a guide? It would make sense 
                        if their instruments are like your 
                        compass. 

           Will and Ricky stare as the B-52s disappear into the horizon.

           EXT. DUMONT FARM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Will and Ricky quickly shovel dirt on top of Tom’s body. Will 
           watches as Tom’s body disappears into the soil.

           A second later a small EARTHQUAKE shakes the ground.  

                                 WILL
                        Jesus. Enough. 

           Ricky lies down on his back, exhausted. He stares at the sky 
           suddenly alarmed.

                                 RICKY
                        Um, Will.

           THOUSANDS OF BIRDS form a migratory line to the horizon. 
           There’s a cacophony of squawks as the birds fly overhead. 

                                 RICKY
                        They’re all different types. Flying 
                        together. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. And they’re all going east. 

           INT. MEG’S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Will and Ricky enter, shirtless, covered in grime and sweat. 
           Meg smokes at the sink, eyeing the boys and sipping on a 
           boozy cocktail.

                                 MEG
                        I got warm beer in the warm fridge. 
                                 WILL
                        Not today. Wake me in two hours, 
                        ok?   

           Meg smiles, dragging off her cigarette. 

                                 MEG
                        Use my room. Bed’s up the stairs. 

           INT. MEG’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Will fishes his cell phone from his pocket, powering it on. 
           There’s no service but on the screen is a PHOTO of SAM. Will 
           stares at her image while closing his eyes. 

           INT. MEG’S BEDROOM - SUNSET

           Will sleeps on his side. Meg stands by the bed, watching him, 
           eyes filled with tears. She lays on the bed and spoons next 
           to him, placing his arm over her. 

           Will flinches awake. 

                                 WILL
                        What are you doing?

                                 MEG
                        Don’t be upset. Just hold me. 
                        Please, Will. I’m freaking out.

           Meg starts to sob. Will wraps his arm around her. 

                                 MEG
                        Are you scared?

                                 WILL
                        Of course I’m scared, Meg.

           Meg rolls over and buries her face in Will’s chest. Will 
           pulls her tight and her tears run lines through the caked 
           dirt on his shoulder. Meg laughs, seeing the streaks. 

                                 MEG
                        You should take a shower. You’re 
                        filthy. Sorry there’s no hot water. 

           INT. BATHROOM SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Will takes a cold shower, quickly scrubbing himself with 
           soap. He feels the bandage on his forehead.
           Will gets out, grabbing a towel. A knock on the door. 

                                 MEG
                        You decent?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

           Will wraps the towel around his waist. Meg opens the door, 
           holding a bottle of hydrogen peroxide. 

                                 MEG
                        Have a seat. I want a look at that 
                        cut. 

                                 WILL
                        Thanks. 

           Will sits on the toilet. Meg steps between his legs, the 
           flesh of her thighs touching his. She carefully removes the 
           bandage.

                                 MEG
                        Good news is I think you’ll live. 

           Meg starts cleaning the wound, leaning over him, her dress 
           revealing. She’s not wearing a bra and Will can’t help but 
           notice her breasts.  

           Meg applies a new bandage to his wound and gives his forehead 
           a kiss. 

                                 MEG
                        See? All better now.

           INT. MEG’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Will stands next to the chair with his clothes. Still wrapped 
           in the towel.

                                 WILL
                        You mind if I change?

           Meg steps out of the bathroom, coming closer.

                                 MEG
                        I want you to stay, Will. I can’t 
                        do this alone. Either can you.

           Meg closes the gap between them. She takes his hand and leans 
           into his ear. Her voice a whisper. 
                                 MEG
                        You won’t make it out there. It’s 
                        not safe. You’re lucky you even 
                        made it here. Stay with me. I can’t 
                        survive without you.

           Meg kisses Will on the neck. Will glances out the window and 
           sees the BMW in the driveway. 

                                 WILL
                        Stop.  

           Meg continues to kiss him. Her free hand slips her dress 
           strap from her shoulder. The dress hits the floor revealing 
           her perfect, naked body. 

           Will’s eyes drink her in. But when she moves to kiss his lips 
           he turns his head at the last second.  

                                 WILL
                        Don’t do that. Get dressed.  

           Meg looks at Will, confused. 

                                 MEG
                        We can survive here. Be smart.  

                                 WILL
                        Put your clothes on, Meg. 

           Will throws on his jeans and grabs his shirt from the chair. 
           Meg picks up her dress. Out of sorts. 

                                 MEG
                        Don’t tell me I’m supposed to feel 
                        bad. It’s not about that. Not now.

                                 WILL
                        We have to go. I need gas from one 
                        of your SUVs to leave. Ok?

                                 MEG
                        Whatever. Take it all.  
                             (suddenly tears)
                        The fucking world is ending, Will! 

           Will puts on his shoes. 

                                 WILL
                        You don’t know that. 
                                 MEG
                        Then what?! We don’t know shit! 
                        There’s fucking earthquakes and 
                        storms! The power’s out! The 
                        fucking army says it’s war! What?! 

                                 WILL
                        Jon is out there!  

                                 MEG
                        Fuck you, Will!!! Fuck you. 
                             (beat)
                        I love him! You know that!

           Will grabs Meg in an awkward hug.

                                 WILL
                        He’s coming back. 

           Will turns and walks out the door. 

           INT. BMW. MAIN STREET. RAPID CITY - TWILIGHT

           Will and Ricky stop at the top of Main street. It’s dark and 
           the BMW’s Headlights are OFF. They can see the flashing 
           police lights at the Roadblock. 

           Will eyes the gas gauge. Folded in his lap is a MAP. 

                                 WILL
                        We need more gas. Wyoming’s gonna 
                        be a desert. 

           Ricky stares at the cars parked along Main street. He climbs 
           into the backseat and grabs the hose.

                                 RICKY
                        American cars. I can reach the 
                        tanks.

           Will idles the BMW forward, stopping in front of a CHEVY 
           MALIBU. 

           Ricky shoves the hose into the Malibu’s tank. He breathes 
           into the loose end and then sticks it into the gas canister 
           in the backseat. Gas trickles into the canister.

                                 RICKY
                        Next.
           Will pulls alongside a SILVERADO pick up. Ricky repeats the 
           hose action. This time the gas comes fast. Ricky jumps the 
           hose to the second canister. 

           Will sees A MAN on the sidewalk a few storefronts down.

                                 WILL
                        Someone’s coming. 

           The MAN on the sidewalk shines a flashlight and sees Ricky 
           stealing the gas. The Man lifts an AIR HORN and BLASTS IT!

           A POLICE CAR peels off the roadblock. Speeds down Main 
           Street, directly at them.

                                 RICKY
                        We’re good!

           Ricky yanks the hose from the SILVERADO. Will slams the gas, 
           rocketing them down main street in the dark. 

                                 WILL
                        Seat belt! 

           Will guns the BMW at the coming Police car like it’s a 
           chicken race. Not hesitating. 

           At the last second the Police car brakes hard, cutting off 
           the road. 

           Will spins the wheel, shooting for the closing gap. The BMW’s 
           side mirror hits the hood of the Police car, shattering as 
           they pass!

           Will accelerates straight at the Roadblock. 

           The Police aim their weapons! An arsenal at the ready. 

           Will slams the brakes a hundred yards short of the Roadblock. 

           Will looks to his right. There’s a field between the 
           Roadblock and the ramp to the highway. Will spins the wheel 
           and accelerates.

           The COPS start firing. Shotguns. Rifles. Pistols. 

           The BMW speeds through the field, chased by bullet tracers.

           Will eyes the grass incline from the field to the highway’s 
           ramp. It’s steep.  

                                 WILL
                        Hold on!!!
           The BMW hits the lip and launches into the air!

           The BMW bounces down onto the Interstate. Suspension flexing. 
           Will gets control and speeds down I-90W.

                                 WILL
                        They coming?! Grab the gun from the 
                        glove!

           Ricky climbs into the passenger seat, looking back. 

                                 RICKY
                        They’re not coming. 

                                 WILL
                        You sure?

                                 RICKY
                        Yeah. 

           Will flashes Ricky a terror smile. Fucking A.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           There’s D.O.T. construction signs lining the shoulder. The 
           portable signs display yellow digital letters and are powered 
           by SOLAR PANELS.

           The BMW passes the first sign. The sign has been hacked. It 
           reads: “AMIGOS”. They hit the second sign: “U R FUCKED :)”.

                                 WILL
                        Great.   

           Beyond the second sign there’s an overturned DODGE METRO. A 
           pack of COYOTES lingers by the side of the wreckage. 

           Will accelerates the BMW to 100 MPH, speeding past the rest 
           of the signs, all of them hacked with messages. Will grips 
           the wheel and eyes the wedding ring on his finger.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           The horizon is a bright hue of YELLOW, like an impossible 
           rising sun. Impossible because it’s 11 PM. Will and Ricky 
           stare at the yellow horizon, on edge, yet entranced. 

                                 RICKY
                        Can I ask you a question?
                                 WILL
                        Yeah. 

                                 RICKY
                        What’s Sam like? 

           Will glances at Ricky, affected by hearing his wife’s name. 

                                 WILL
                        What’s she like? I guess she’s 
                        everything. She’s funny. She’s 
                        strong. She’s loyal. I got lucky. 

                                 RICKY
                        To get married?

                                 WILL
                        Anyone can get married. I got lucky 
                        because I found the right person. 
                        There’s a difference. 

                                 RICKY
                        How did you know?

                                 WILL
                        You just do. Just like you can tell 
                        if it’s not. I don’t know how else 
                        to say it.   
                             (beat)
                        What about your mother? What’s she 
                        like?

           Ricky reaches into his backpack and pulls out an Ipod. 

                                 RICKY
                        It’s been a while since I’ve seen 
                        her.  
                             (gestures to his Ipod)
                        I made a mix for the drive. If you 
                        want to listen to it. 

                                 WILL
                        Are you joking?

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky’s Ipod blasts music through the speakers as the BMW 
           passes a billboard welcoming them to WYOMING. 

           Will eyes the gas gauge: 55 miles. The yellow horizon is 
           getting brighter.   
                                 WILL
                        We’ll have to fill up before we hit 
                        whatever that is. 

           Will squints, studying the hood. It’s covered in a gray 
           residue. 

                                 RICKY
                        What?  

           Will glances in the rearview. There’s no cars behind them. He 
           flicks the Headlights ON. 

           Tiny gray particles swim in the headlights, dancing in the 
           air like snow. 

                                 RICKY
                        Is that ash?

           Will and Ricky eye the YELLOW HORIZON.

                                 WILL
                        We’re driving towards a fire. It’s 
                        all on fire. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE NIGHT

           The ash is RAINING down, reducing visibility to fifty feet. 
           Will drives at 30 MPH. Headlights and windshield wipers ON.  

           Gusts of wind push the BMW from lane to lane. A channel of 
           visibility appears through the ash. Will SLAMS THE BRAKES. 

           A WOMAN, early 60s, stands in the middle of the road, caught 
           in the headlights. She’s covered in ash and terrified. Will 
           and Ricky stare, caught off guard. 

           The Woman runs to Will’s window, yelling and pointing to her 
           AUDI Q8 SUV on the shoulder. 

                                 WILL
                        Get in! Just get in! 

                                 WOMAN
                        No!!!! 

           Will gets out and opens the backseat door. 

                                 WILL
                        Lady, get in the car! It’s raining 
                        ash! 
                                 WOMAN
                        I have a flat! I need help changing 
                        it!

           Will glances at the Audi and sees her rear tire is flat. He 
           eyes Ricky. 

           Will grabs the Woman by the arm, pulling her to the Audi. The 
           Woman’s fingers are covered with expensive jewelry.

                                 WILL
                        Pop your trunk! 

           Will grabs the SPARE TIRE from the Audi’s trunk. Ricky grabs 
           the TIRE JACK. 

           Will and Ricky turn around and TWO SHOTGUNS BUTTS slam into 
           their stomachs!  Will and Ricky drop to their knees, heaving 
           for air.   

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WYOMING - SAME

           TYLER, 35, and MARTIN, 40, hold the SHOTGUNS, wearing the 
           remnants of what were business suits. They’re normal looking 
           guys but who fucking cares. 

                                 WOMAN
                        I did it! Are you happy?! 

                                 TYLER
                        Shut up!!!

           Tyler turns to Will.

                                 TYLER
                        We’re taking your gas. 

           Martin runs over to the BMW. Tyler keeps his shotgun trained 
           on Ricky and Will.  

           Will stares at Tyler. He’s not much older than him. In 
           another world they’d sit together in business class. 

                                 WILL
                        There’s two canisters in the 
                        backseat. 

           Martin grabs the canisters and runs them up the highway’s 
           shoulder to a TOYOTA PRIUS.

                                 WILL
                        How you feeling? Good?
                                 TYLER
                        Please.   

           Tyler glances at the Toyota. Martin’s pouring the second 
           canister. 

                                 WILL
                        Where you going?

                                 TYLER
                        San Fran. 

                                 WILL
                        That hybrid working out like you 
                        thought? 

           Tyler cocks the shotgun! Focusing on Will. 

                                 TYLER
                        Shut up. 

           Martin runs back to the BMW with a canister and grabs the 
           HOSE from the backseat. He opens the BMW’s gas lid. 

           Ricky bolts to his feet.

                                 RICKY
                        No!!!

           Tyler spins, aiming his shotgun. 

           Will grabs the barrel, pushing it skyward. The SHOTGUN 
           BLASTS!!! Tyler carries the recoil’s momentum and SMASHES 
           Will in the face with the shotgun butt. 

           Will hits the asphalt hard. When he looks up the SHOTGUN 
           BARREL is inches from his face. 

                                 TYLER
                        Don’t!!! 

           Will spits out a mouthful of blood. 

           Martin holds his shotgun inches from Ricky’s face. He points 
           at the hose and canister. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Fill it. Now! 

           Ricky sticks the hose in the BMW’s tank. He BREATHES into the 
           hose, pulling it out ever so slightly. Gas sputters into the 
           canister. 
                                 TYLER
                        Shoot the tires! 

           Martin flashes the shotgun barrel from Ricky’s face and 
           BANG!!! The front passenger tire SHREDS. 

                                 WILL
                        I have a family! 

                                 TYLER
                        Shoot the back tire!

                                 WILL
                        It’s fucking murder!! We have one 
                        spare and no gas!!

           Martin looks at Ricky, then Will and the Woman. Hesitating. 

                                 TYLER
                        Fucking shoot the tire!  

           Martin grabs the canister and runs to the Prius, eyeing 
           Tyler.

                                 MARTIN
                        I’m not killing them. We agreed. 

           Tyler backs away, keeping his shotgun on Will and Ricky. 

                                 WILL
                        Have fun in ‘Frisco.  

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll send you a postcard. 

           Tyler jumps into the Prius.  

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WYOMING - SAME

           Will jumps to his feet, spitting blood and running. Ricky’s 
           already opening the trunk of the BMW.

           Will grabs the GLOCK from the glove compartment. He spins 
           just as the Prius’s taillights disappear into the ash.

                                 WILL
                        Fuck!!!

           The Woman looks at the gun and then Will, spitting venom. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Shame on you! All of you!
                                 WILL
                        You did this!!!

           Will runs to the BMW’s trunk. Ricky pulls out the spare tire. 

                                 WILL
                        If we don’t catch them we’re dead!

           Will jacks up the BMW’s frame. They’re covered in ash and 
           sweat. Will spins off the wheel’s bolts with the tire iron. 

           The Woman hovers behind them, insane and fidgeting. 

                                 WILL
                        Get in the car!

                                 WOMAN
                        No! 

           Will spins the last bolt off the flat. Ricky removes the 
           shredded tire. Will throws on the spare. Ricky releases the 
           jack. The woman paces in front of the BMW’s headlights. 

                                 WOMAN
                        I have grandchildren!!! 

                                 RICKY
                        They need you! 

                                 WILL
                        Get in the fucking car! You’re 
                        going to die out here!

                                 WOMAN
                        No! It’s not supposed to be like 
                        this! We’re supposed to be decent!!

           The woman crumbles to the ground, crying. She takes off a 
           GOLD RING and hurls it at Will. She’s a lost cause. 

           Will and Ricky jump in the BMW. Will maneuvers the BMW around 
           the Woman and hits the gas. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW accelerates like mad, hitting 120 MPH. The ash shoots 
           above the car like a FLOWING RIVER. Will and Ricky look at 
           the GAS GAUGE: 7 MILES remaining.  

                                 RICKY
                        I tried to pull the hose.
                                 WILL
                        I saw. Hold the wheel. 

           Will chambers a bullet in the Glock. 

                                 WILL
                        We’ve got one shot at them. Ever 
                        shoot a gun?

           Ricky nods, taking the Glock from Will. 

                                 RICKY
                        Everyone has a gun where I grew up.

           Will hits the gas, reckless, 130 MPH. The ash is blinding.

                                 WILL
                        They’re in a Prius. How fast can 
                        they go? 
                             (rubs his jaw)
                        Fuck!!! 

           Will quickly toggles the headlights OFF and stops the BMW. 
           There’s a TOLL BOOTH ahead. Solar powered lights. Each 
           highway lane has its own booth. 

                                 WILL
                        You see anything, fire. 

           Ricky powers down his window, gripping the Glock with two 
           hands. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t worry. We’ll be going too 
                        fast to hit.   

           Will slams his foot on the gas and hits 100 MPH. He stares, 
           concentrating on the toll’s narrow lane. Tunnel vision. The 
           BMW flies through the booth, scraping the barriers. Will 
           pounds his fist on the dash in an adrenaline outburst. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW speeds, headlights OFF. They both eye the gas gauge: 
           2 Miles left. A gust of wind clears the ash and they see the 
           Prius’s taillights. Will accelerates. 

                                 WILL
                        Hold on!

           The BMW rams the PRIUS’S BUMPER. 
           The Prius swerves but then speeds up. Will pulls flush to the 
           PRIUS. 

                                 WILL
                        Pull over!!!

           Tyler swerves the Prius at the BMW. Martin climbs into the 
           backseat with his shotgun.

           Will eyes the gas gauge: .5 MILES LEFT. At a 120 MPH.

                                 WILL
                        Shoot! Now!

           Ricky aims the Glock out the window, trying to steady.

                                 WILL
                        Shoot!!! 

           Ricky taps the trigger. BANG! BANG! BANG!

           With the third shot the Prius’s rear tire EXPLODES!   

           Will slams the brakes! 

           The Prius banks left in front of the BMW, shooting off the 
           drop off between I90W and I90E.

           The Prius is airborne before smashing the ground ten feet 
           below and rolling end over end. It settles on its roof, 
           totally destroyed.    

           Will and Ricky get out.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus. 

           A second later flames ignite under the Toyota’s hood. Will 
           and Ricky start sprinting down the incline. In the wreckage, 
           the two men are dead; their bodies twisted in a blood bath.

           Ricky crawls in the car’s backseat, over the exposed, upside 
           down PRIUS BATTERY PACK. He grabs their hose and gas 
           canister. 

           Ricky crawls out, pushing off the battery pack for leverage. 
           A lithium ion cell comes loose, the positive terminal hitting 
           another cell and arcing in sparks. 

                                 WILL
                        Get out!! 

           Ricky crawls out as the Prius is engulfed by flames. 
           Ricky grabs the hose, sticking it in the Prius’s gas tank. He 
           blows in the hose and the gas starts filling the canister.

           Will sees the fire bridge from the backseat to the engine 
           carriage, then to the tank. He grabs Ricky, pulling him away. 

                                 WILL
                        Go!!!

           Will grabs the canister of gas. They turn and run towards the 
           BMW.    

           The Prius tank EXPLODES!

           Will and Ricky get pushed by the explosion’s shock wave and 
           hit the dirt hard. Will loses his grip on the gas canister. 
           It hits the ground on its side, spilling. 

           The ball of flame retreats over their heads and Will grabs 
           the canister. Behind them the dead men melt in the flames.

           They run up the bank to the BMW. Ricky quickly pours the 
           canister into the BMW’S tank as Will eyes their surroundings. 
           The fire makes them sitting ducks.  

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - SUNRISE

           The sky is a sickly gray with bursts of orange coming from 
           the east. The air is clear but the road is covered in ash.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           Will drives, feeling his mouth and jaw, in pain. He toggles 
           the gas gauge button: 11 MILES in the tank. Ricky stares out 
           the window with tears in his eyes.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t think, Ricky. 

                                 RICKY
                        I killed them.  

                                 WILL
                        Bullshit! Look at me! They robbed 
                        us and left us to die! The woman is 
                        probably dead because of them!

                                 RICKY
                        I didn’t know it would be this bad. 
                                 WILL
                        Ricky. What you did. Pulling the 
                        hose out, running at him. I don’t 
                        give a fuck how you were treated at 
                        home. You’re the bravest kid I’ve 
                        ever met. I’d be dead if you 
                        weren’t with me. Ok?

                                 RICKY
                        I want us to make it. I want to see 
                        my mom. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re going to! You have to 
                        believe that. But we still have to 
                        find gas. We have to focus. Ok?

           The BMW passes a sign for A VIEW AREA in one mile.  

                                 WILL
                        I’m going to pull over. Maybe we’ll 
                        see something. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90 VIEW AREA - MORNING

           The view area’s on top of a canyon. Smoke fills the sky above 
           the Teton mountains. 

                                 WILL
                        That’s Yellowstone burning.

           Will turns and sees Ricky staring across the canyon. Several 
           BUFFALO are on the edge of a cliff. Suddenly a lone Buffalo 
           steps off, falling hundreds of feet. The other Buffalo 
           retreat from view.

           Ricky leans over and throws up.

           Will spreads the map on the hood of the BMW. 

                                 WILL
                        We need to find a shipping depot or 
                        an airport. Something with gas 
                        that’ll be near the Interstate.   

                                 RICKY
                        Or a Reservation.

                                 WILL
                        Exactly. If we don’t we’ll-

           Ricky’s eyes shoot at Will. 
                                 RICKY
                        We’re not robbing anyone! 

                                 WILL
                        I was gonna say ride bicycles! We 
                        haven’t robbed anyone and we’re not 
                        going to. Got it?  

           Ricky nods, shaking it off. He wipes his mouth with his tee 
           shirt. After a couple deep breaths he pulls it together. 

                                 RICKY
                        I’m glad it was you who crashed on 
                        the reservation. I would’ve gone 
                        with any asshole.

           Will cracks up. Ricky stares at the map and points to a spot. 

                                 RICKY
                        That’s the Adaba tribe’s 
                        Reservation. It’s fifty miles away. 
                        They might have gas. 

           Will fingers the scale key on the map. 

                                 WILL
                        We’ll head for the reservation. If 
                        we run out of gas we run out of 
                        gas. If the key’s right it’s eight 
                        hundred miles to Yakima. Nine to 
                        Seattle. We’re gonna make it. I 
                        promise. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           The BMW drives down a steep hill. Will shifts into NEUTRAL 
           and they coast down the hill at fifty miles an hour. 

           Below the hill it’s flat to the horizon. Glints of metal 
           sparkle on the plains.  

                                 RICKY
                        Cars?

           Will nods. He grips the Glock, nervous in the daylight. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           Will swings the BMW alongside an abandoned DODGE minivan. The 
           hood is propped open. 
                                 RICKY
                        Radiator bust. I don’t see anyone. 

           Ricky gets out with the hose and canister. Will stands with 
           the Glock, scanning three hundred and sixty degrees. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           The BMW speeds down the highway. Will checks the gauge: 33 
           miles. They see an RV driving on the road ahead of them. 

                                 RICKY
                        Where are they getting gas for 
                        that?

           Will hands the Glock to Ricky. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m passing them. 

           Without hesitating Ricky points the Glock out the window. 

           The BMW speeds alongside the RV. Each RV window is manned by 
           WOMEN and MEN, with rifles aimed at the BMW. 

           Ricky holds up a hand in peace. The Men and Women drop their 
           guns and wave them on. 

                                 RICKY
                        Speed up. We’re good.

           As they pass the RV’s DRIVER waves a cordial hello. Will and 
           Ricky wave back. Surreal. 

                                 RICKY
                        Something tells me they have gas on 
                        board.

                                 WILL
                        Ya think?

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           Will pulls the BMW behind an abandoned PT CRUISER. Ricky gets 
           out and siphons the gas.

                                 RICKY
                        This is good. It’s coming. 

           Will’s exhausted. He looks off the highway and sees a lone 
           gas station/general store about a mile away.
                                 WILL
                        We need food.  

           EXT. ROAD. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Will drives the BMW down a two lane blacktop, nervous as they 
           pull into the station’s desolate parking lot. 

           Will gets out with the Glock. They see the gas pump nozzles 
           dangling on the ground, already tapped. 

           Will and Ricky enter the General Store, seeing the cash 
           register open, the aisles turned over; the place was looted 
           and appears abandoned. But a second later they start to hear-

           A HARMONICA, playing a simple out of tune melody. Will and 
           Ricky eye each other. There’s an open door at the back of the 
           store, leading to the fields.

           Will holds out the Glock and together they follow the sound, 
           the melody growing more dissonant. Just outside they see-  

           A weathered OLD MAN, 91, in a chair. The man is blind, with 
           eyes like dark beads, but he senses them and stops playing.

                                 OLD MAN
                        My son aint come to work today. If 
                        you see him tell him I don’t 
                        appreciate it. You can leave money 
                        on the counter. 

                                 WILL
                        Sir, your store’s been robbed. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        That mean it’s free for you too? 

           A breeze blows a tumbleweed across the dirt. The Old Man 
           gestures to the Heavens.

                                 OLD MAN
                        My foolish friends say we at war 
                        with the Russians. But you can 
                        smell it in the air, can’t you?  

                                 WILL
                        Smell what?

           The Old Man laughs.
                                 OLD MAN
                        The dying sin. The Rapture. It’s 
                        come for you. Come for me. 

           The Old Man returns to playing his harmonica. Will signals 
           Ricky back inside as the dark melody picks up again. 

           Will picks up a jar of peanut butter from the floor. He 
           leaves a five dollar bill on the counter as they exit. 

           Will and Ricky walk back to the BMW. At the edge of the 
           parking lot they notice A BODY, covered in flies. It’s a MAN, 
           50, in a bloodied gas attendant’s uniform. DEAD.  

                                 RICKY
                        Think that’s his son? 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

           Will starts the BMW’S engine, drowning out the haunting 
           harmonica.

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - AFTERNOON

           The BMW drives across the MONTANA border, the billboard  
           welcoming them to ‘Big Sky County’. Indeed, the sky is a 
           hellish looking thing.  

           Will glances at the gas gauge: 30 miles. They crest a hill, 
           able to see the plains. 

                                 WILL
                        See anything?

           There’s a number of farms but also a small town miles off the 
           Interstate. 

                                 RICKY
                        I think that’s the reservation.

           Will spots ACRID, BLACK SMOKE pouring out of a deep ravine 
           that runs parallel to the interstate.   

                                 WILL
                        What is that?
           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Will drives the BMW off the highway onto a a dirt field. He 
           pulls up to the edge of the ravine. The black smoke pouring 
           up in front of them.

           Will and Ricky stare down the steep slope, eyes frozen in 
           disbelief. 

           It’s the ARMY TRAIN. The wreckage is a MILE LONG and they’re 
           at the front of the train. There’s passenger cars on fire, 
           Missiles, Humvees, Supplies, all scattered down the tracks. 

                                 WILL
                        The jeeps and humvees will have 
                        gas. C’mon.

                                 RICKY
                        We’re close to the reservation. We 
                        can come back if they don’t have 
                        gas.  

                                 WILL
                        On foot? 

           Will tucks the Glock into his waistline. 

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - AFTERNOON

           Will steps off the slope onto the tracks. Ricky behind him.

           A GANG of boys, 13-15, are at the front of the train, poking 
           the motionless body of a DEAD SOLDIER with a stick. 

                                 RICKY
                        What are they doing?

           Will grabs his Glock and starts sprinting at the boys. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey! Get away! 

           One of the boys holds up a .22 rifle, aiming at Will. 

           Will fires the Glock over their heads. 

           The boys jump on their BMX bicycles, riding away as fast as 
           they can. Will stops, fifty feet from the dead body. 
           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Will walks back to Ricky. He sees the switch signal along the 
           tracks. It’s battery powered but malfunctioning.

           Will and Ricky walk down the tracks together. Will looks 
           inside a burnt out passenger car. He reflexes, VOMITING, 
           waving Ricky off.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t. They’re all dead. 

           A cracked case of water sits by the tracks. Will washes his 
           mouth out, gulps down the water. 

           Will walks to a partially destroyed HUMVEE, attached by 
           cables to the twisted metal of a flat bed. An M-60 sits on a 
           turret in the Humvee’s bed. 

                                 RICKY
                        Too bad we can’t mount that on the 
                        BMW.  

           Will grabs the canister and hose from Ricky. He starts 
           siphoning gas from the Humvee’s tank.  

                                 WILL
                        See if you can find any gas cans. 
                        It’s a long hike up the hill.

           Ricky walks down a few box cars. Starts opening supply 
           crates. He finds a six pack of COKE cans. Glances at the sky. 

                                 RICKY
                        Warm cola. Thank you God. 

           Ricky opens another crate. Automatic weapons and grenades. 
           Ricky holds up an M-16, posing for Will.  

                                 RICKY
                        Check me out! 

           Will cracks a grin. Ricky turns down the tracks, smiling, 
           holding the M-16. 

           A SONIC ECHO shatters the canyon’s silence.

           Ricky’s left thigh EXPLODES! A bullet piercing his quad! He 
           hits the ground, yelling in pain. 

           Will jumps from the Humvee, running to Ricky with his Glock. 
           Will drags Ricky under a box car. Sticks his head out, 
           looking for the shooter. 

           A hundred feet down the tracks Will sees a bloodied FEMALE 
           SOLDIER, 35, hanging out of a wrecked Humvee. Rifle slumped 
           on her shoulder. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t shoot!!!! 

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        You crashed the train! 

                                 WILL
                        No!!! We just got here. We’re 
                        trying to get gas! 

           The Female Soldier goes quiet. Will rips the sleeve off his 
           tee shirt and ties a crude tourniquet around Ricky’s leg. 
           There’s blood everywhere.

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        I need water! 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck you!!!
                             (to Ricky)
                        I’m getting you out of here!

           Ricky stares at the soldier, steeling back the pain. He sees 
           she’s wounded, barely able to hold her weapon.

                                 RICKY
                        It’s ok. She didn’t know. Get her 
                        water.

           Will nods ok.

                                 WILL
                        I’m coming out!! 

           Will rises, Glock aimed. The Female Soldier drops her rifle.

           Will runs over with water. The Woman’s body is impaled in the 
           wreckage, a JAGGED PIECE of metal stuck in her stomach. Will 
           pours water in her mouth, frantic and angry.

                                 WILL
                        Why’d you shoot!?

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        They’re killing us.
                                 WILL
                        Who? How did you crash?

           Will hears A GUNSHOT down the tracks. He sees a pair of 
           binoculars on the Humvee’s dash. Will grabs them and looks. A 
           half mile down the tracks there’s A GANG OF MEN with M16 
           assault rifles. The Men execute several Soldiers. 

           The Female Soldier gasps and locks eyes with Will. 

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        Don’t let them come back for me. 
                        Please. Make it end.

           Will nods as the Female Soldier closes her eyes. He walks 
           behind her and puts his Glock to the back of her head. 

           Will pulls the trigger and a shot echoes through the canyon. 

           EXT. RAVINE - AFTERNOON

           Will carries Ricky up the hill on his shoulders, covered in 
           blood. He holds the canister of gas in his free hand. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Will drives the BMW like a maniac. His eyes dart back to 
           Ricky, lying in the backseat. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m so sorry Ricky! We shouldn’t 
                        have gone down there.  

           Will sees a dirt road turn off. He spins the wheel, skidding 
           onto the road.

           EXT. ADABA RESERVATION - AFTERNOON

           The BMW stops in front of the town’s buildings. Will jumps 
           out, frantic. 

                                 WILL
                        Help!!! We need help!!! 

           It’s a ghost town. Will scans around, confused. 

           Will runs to a building marked like the medical building on 
           the Kootenai reservation. He follows an electric cord to a 
           diesel generator behind the building. 
           INT. MEDICAL ROOM. - MOMENTS LATER

           Will carries Ricky from the BMW into the building, laying him 
           on a gurney. 

           Will quickly scans the cabinets. Finds a bottle of iodine. A 
           razor. Some gauze. 

           Will cuts Ricky’s jeans and sees the horrible wound for the 
           first time. He pours the bottle of iodine as Ricky yells in 
           pain. 

           Will wipes the blood away but more just spurts out. The 
           bullet hit Ricky’s femoral artery. 

           Ricky looks down and starts hyperventilating. 

                                 WILL
                        This is going to hurt. 

           Will sticks a ball of gauze into the hole in Ricky’s leg. He 
           quickly ties a new tourniquet as Ricky screams. 

                                 WILL
                        Just hold on!

           Will scans the medicine cabinet. He quickly discards boxes 
           onto the floor before finding a box of needles: Morphine. 

           Will stabs the needle into a vein in Ricky’s arm. Waits. 
           Ricky’s eyes bulge. 

                                 WILL
                        You feel it?

           Ricky swallows hard, trying to catch his breath. In the 
           silence they hear a short wave radio in the corner of the 
           room. S.O.S. taps in Morse as a muted voice yells in fear. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE ON RADIO
                        Hello? Anyone? My name is Henry 
                        Banks. I’m in the tenderloin in San 
                        Francisco. Everything’s burning and 
                        looters are killing! Can anyone 
                        hear me?! What is happening?! Is 
                        anyone coming for us?!

           Ricky stares at the radio. His breathing slows as the 
           morphine hits his blood stream.
                                 WILL
                        You feel it?
                             (Ricky nods)
                        We have to go. There’s no one here. 

                                 RICKY
                        Why?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. They must have left.

           Ricky cracks up, biting back the pain. He’s delirious and 
           lucid at the same time. 

                                 RICKY
                        I get it now, Will. 

                                 WILL
                        What? You get what?

                                 RICKY
                        We should’ve found out what 
                        happened. Something. But it makes 
                        sense. We wouldn’t know if it was 
                        really the end, right? Tell me the 
                        truth.

                                 WILL
                        About the stuff we’ve seen? 

                                 RICKY
                        Do you think it’s the beginning of 
                        the end?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, it probably is. C’mon.

           Will grabs the gurney and starts pushing Ricky outside. 

           EXT. ADABA RESERVATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Will quickly puts Ricky into the backseat of the BMW. Throws 
           the gauze, morphine and iodine on the front seat. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m going to find a hospital. We’re 
                        getting you help. 

           Will scans the Adaba buildings. He sees a GAS TANK with a 
           NOZZLE attached. 
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 -  LATE AFTERNOON

           Will drives the BMW at 110 MPH down the barren highway. Eyes 
           the gas gauge: 200 miles. 

           Will scans the Montana exit signs for towns, hospitals, 
           anything to help Ricky. 

                                 WILL
                        Talk to me.

           Will looks back. Ricky smiles in a cloud of morphine. 

                                 WILL
                        What’s so funny?

                                 RICKY
                        Play my Ipod. I’m fucking bleeding.  

           Will hits play on Ricky’s Ipod. A second later JAY-Z’s 
           ‘Public Service Announcement’ blasts through the speakers. 

                                 RICKY
                        Nice. 

                                 WILL
                        Good. Hold tight.

           Will cranks the volume and speeds up. The BMW hits 150 MPH 
           and for a minute the highway becomes a blur: hitchhikers, 
           farm fields, a burnt Police car, a dead body on the shoulder. 

                                 RICKY
                        There’s something I didn’t tell 
                        you... I never met my mom, Will. 
                        She left me.

           Will stares in the rearview, not believing him. 

                                 WILL
                        What? Why did you come with me? 

           Ricky’s eyes fill with tears. 

                                 RICKY
                        I want to meet her, Will. Maybe 
                        this is my last chance.    
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - EARLY EVENING

           The BMW flies down the highway. It’s getting dark and the air 
           is filled with SMOKE. Will glances in the rearview. Sees 
           Ricky conscious. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t see you smiling, friend?

           Ricky forces a smile. 

                                 WILL
                        Tell me about your mom, Ricky.

                                 RICKY
                        I found her on the internet.  

           Ricky smirks.

                                 RICKY
                        I guess she didn’t like life on the 
                        reservation. Or maybe my dad’s a 
                        dick. 

           Will and Ricky share a small laugh. Will looks back at the 
           road, tears streaming from his eyes.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - EARLY EVENING

           Will reads the gas gauge: 110 MILES LEFT. He eyes the 
           rearview: Ricky’s white as a ghost.  

                                 WILL
                        Talk to me. 

           Ricky just stares.  

                                 WILL
                        We’ll hit a town soon. I promise.

           Will sees the coming mountain’s forests burning. The smoke is 
           like FOG. 

           EXT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - EVENING

           The BMW nears the base of the mountain. The smoke is dense, 
           coming in gusts, forcing Will to drive at 30 MPH. 

           Will slows the BMW. There’s A TUNNEL: PIONEER MOUNTAIN PASS. 
           Will stares at a sign. The tunnel’s TWO MILES. 
           Will stops in front of the entrance. It looks like a black 
           hole. He sees Ricky’s barely conscious.  

           Will chambers a bullet in the Glock. Places it in his lap. He 
           idles the BMW into the tunnel, suddenly in complete DARKNESS.

           Will turns on the HEADLIGHTS. The tunnel’s filled with smoke. 
           Yellow tiles of grime line the walls and ceiling. 

           Will reverses the BMW out of the entrance. He grabs the 
           morphine needles off the passenger seat. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey friend? 

           Ricky’s fading. The backseat is stained. Ricky’s bleeding 
           out. 

                                 WILL
                        Just a prick, ok?

           Will sticks the needle in. Ricky’s eyes roll. Will pulls off 
           his shirt and makes a pillow for Ricky’s head against the 
           window. He brushes Ricky’s sweaty hair from his eyes. 

                                 RICKY
                        How far is Yakima?

                                 WILL
                        We’re close. Real close. 

           Will, now shirtless, puts the Glock back in his lap. 

           INT. BMW. I90 PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Will grips the Glock while accelerating. The engine reverbs 
           off the walls as the headlights pierce the darkness. 

           The BMW speeds on. Will loosens his grip on the Glock. Then:

           The TUNNEL’S OVERHEAD LIGHTS flicker on. 

           Will slams the brakes. Only the remaining section of the 
           tunnel is lit. The first half of the tunnel is still pitch 
           black. 

           Will eyes Ricky, sees he’s oblivious to the change in events.  

           Will stares ahead at the lights. It’s got trap written all 
           over it. Will takes a deep breath and hits the gas. The BMW 
           does 90 MPH.
           Will sees a CONTROL BOOTH along the left wall. He points the 
           Glock out the window and pulls the trigger!

           The Glock fires at the same moment a MAN pops out with A 
           SHOTGUN. The Glock’s bullet ricochets off the tunnel and the 
           man ducks down.

           Will accelerates. 110 MPH. Now or never. 

           There’s another CONTROL BOOTH. This one coming on the 
           passenger side. Will points the Glock to two o’clock. He 
           shoots the semi-automatic diagonally through the windshield! 

           The Control Booth’s glass shatters, falling on a MAN with an 
           M16. Next to the booth is a big HONDA DIESEL GENERATOR. Will 
           slows, realizing that’s the power source.  

           Will eyes the extra CLIP of seventeen bullets on the 
           passenger seat and then aims the Glock to twelve o’clock. 
           There’s an angled turn in the tunnel and he can’t see what’s 
           on the other side.    

           EXT. I90 PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW rounds the corner and slams the brakes. A hundred 
           yards ahead is A ROADBLOCK: A Black F-350 PICK UP blocks the 
           tunnel’s two lanes. Two MOTORCYCLES fill the gaps.

           The Men in the Pick Up get out, waving M16 automatics in a 
           sarcastic hello. The Men on the Motorcycles pull Military 
           Colt 45s. 

           The BMW’S engine idles. Will gets out, his naked torso 
           covered in Ricky’s blood.    

                                 WILL
                        I need to get through! Please! My 
                        friend’s been shot! 
                             (silence)
                        I’ve got six hundred dollars. 
                        Please! He’s gonna die! 

           The Pick Up’s DRIVER, 30, laughs. The echo spitting down the 
           tunnel at Will. 

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        We’ll take the money! It’s a toll, 
                        brother! 

           Will eyes the roadblock. There’s no way the BMW can get by 
           unless the truck moves. 
                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        Be smart, haas! Drive on up here! 
                        If you’re lucky we’ll let you drive 
                        out!

           Will looks at the men and their M16s. He flashes back to the 
           Army train. It’s the same guys. Will smiles to himself. 

                                 WILL
                        Ok! Don’t shoot! I’m coming up!

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        Good! Drive with your hands where 
                        we can see them!

           Will gets in the idling BMW. He sees Ricky aware and scared. 

                                 RICKY
                        What’s going on?

                                 WILL
                        Just hold tight. 

           Will takes a deep breath and grips the Glock. He slips the 
           BMW into reverse and hits the gas!   

           INT. BMW. PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The BMW accelerates in REVERSE. 40, 50, 60 MPH! Will turns, 
           staring out the rear windshield as he steers.

           The BMW approaches the first Control Booth. Will hits the 
           SUNROOF BUTTON. He sees the MAN with the M16 and points the 
           Glock out the sunroof FIRING BLIND!

           The Man with the M16 FIRES while retreating, his bullets 
           bouncing off the tunnel.  

           Will keeps speeding in reverse. He glances forward and sees 
           the TWO MOTORCYCLES closing on him! 

           Will sees the next Control Booth. He keeps firing through the 
           sunroof. The MAN fires his SHOTGUN. Pellets pierce the metal 
           of the BMW’S trunk. 

           The BMW reverses out of the light and into the PITCH BLACK of 
           the tunnel. Will slams the brakes, stopping at an angle. 
           EXT. DARKNESS. PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The MOTORCYCLES drive slowly through the black tunnel. Their 
           headlights the only source of light. 

           MOTORCYCLE 1 catches the glint of the BMW in its headlights. 
           The BMW is parked against the wall, abandoned. 

           The MEN get off their MOTORCYCLES and approach the BMW, COLT 
           45s aimed. Man 1’s WALKIE TALKIE beeps. It’s the Pick Up 
           Driver. 

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        What’s goin on?

           Man 1 takes his WALKIE from his vest’s cradle. 

                                 MAN 1
                        He ditched the car. Must be 
                        running.   

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        Get his fucking money. And I want 
                        that car. 

           Will slowly rises from his crouch, hidden in absolute 
           darkness. He’s standing on the other side of the tunnel. The 
           TWO MEN are twenty feet away, in profile.

           Will’s pupils adjust to the scene. He sights the Glock.  

           Will throws the BMW keys at their feet. The Men flinch, 
           turning at Will.

           BANG! Will shoots Man 1 through the chest. Killing him 
           instantly. He then hits Man 2 with two shots to the ribs.   

           The radio crackles.  

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        What was that? You shoot him?

           Man 2 is writhing in a puddle of blood. Will grabs the WALKIE 
           TALKIE. He flips the Man’s helmet visor and shoves his Glock 
           into the man’s face.  

                                 WILL
                        Say you shot me! Say I’m down! 
                        Otherwise you’re dead! 

            Man 2 nods. Will presses the Radio’s transmit button.
                                 MAN 2
                        He’s down. 

                                 PICK UP DRIVER
                        Fucking beautiful. Bring the car 
                        up. 

           Will tosses the radio. Man 2 struggles. 

                                 WILL
                        You need help. Where’s a hospital?

           Man 2 looks at Will, grateful. 

                                 MAN 2
                        Next exit. Thank you. 

                                 WILL
                        For what?

           BANG! Will shoots him in the face.

           INT. BMW. PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Will drives the BMW at 120 MPH, passing the first control 
           booth. The Man with the Shotgun doesn’t have time to fire. 

           The BMW approaches the second CONTROL BOOTH. Will aims the 
           Glock through the windshield and punches the trigger.

           The Man with the M16 ducks down. Will keeps holding the 
           trigger, firing, suddenly hearing CLICK! CLICK! He’s out of 
           bullets! 

           Will slows the BMW to an idle, grabbing the second CLIP off 
           the passenger seat. 

           Will eyes the rearview and sees the Man with the M16 standing 
           next to the HONDA GENERATOR. The M16 fires a volley of 
           BULLETS, hitting the BMW’s rear windshield. 

           Will gets out with the Glock and quickly fires. He hits the 
           man in the knee, putting him down. Will shifts his aim and 
           fires a quick burst at the Honda Generator. 

           The bullets hammer into the generator and the tunnel goes 
           black. No more lights. 
           INT. BMW. PIONEER TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Will lets the BMW idle forward, headlights OFF, eyeing the 
           wall for steering, the only light via the dash. He hears the 
           F-350 roar to life. 

           Will accelerates, hugging the side of the tunnel. He sees the 
           F-350’s headlights speeding at him.

           Will starts firing at the right side of the F-350. 

           The F-350 swerves, getting hit. Will floors it, shooting the 
           gap, scraping the BMW against the tunnel's wall.   

           The BMW makes it past the F-350. Will screams in victory, 
           speeding toward the light at the end of the tunnel. 

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - DUSK

           The BMW does a 150 MPH. There’s a town ahead: BUTTE, MONTANA. 
           The first exit sign has a blue ‘H’ logo for hospital. 

                                 WILL
                        We’re gonna make it! You hear me?!

           Will stares in the rearview. Ricky doesn’t respond.  

                                 WILL
                        Hey!

           Will skids to a stop on the shoulder. He jumps in the 
           backseat. Ricky’s head slumps over, covered in blood. Will 
           looks at the rear windshield. Sees the bullet holes. 

                                 WILL
                        No, Ricky. No! No!!!

           Will cradles Ricky’s body in his arms. Adrenaline turning to 
           horrific anguish. Ricky’s dead. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTANA. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           The BMW roars down the open highway. Will clutches the wheel, 
           face locked in a grimace, absent to Ricky’s Ipod blasting 
           music through the speakers. 
           The BMW rockets into the fire zone at 130 MPH. Burning embers 
           dance off the windshield like fire flies, the blazing fields 
           lighting the interstate like a HARVEST MOON.  

           Will grips the wheel, eyes darting to the side. 

           A WOMAN, burning from head to toe and frantically waving, 
           runs out from the highway’s shoulder. The BMW hits the woman 
           at full speed, catapulting her body into the air. 

           Will slams the brakes and eyes the woman’s lifeless body in 
           the rearview. The wind whips flames across the highway. 

           Will gets out of the BMW. Standing in the middle of the 
           highway he sees a barn, several homes, and behind that AN 
           ENTIRE TOWN ON FIRE. Then his eye catches-  

           PEOPLE, hiding in the corn stalks yet to burn. They’re caught 
           in an orange halo and watching him. 

           BANG! A bullet whizzes over Will’s head. 

           Will stares. Rage in his eyes. He should get in the BMW and 
           drive away. Instead he pulls the Glock from his waist. 
           Another BULLET ricochets off the BMW. 

           Will starts screaming, aiming as his finger compresses the 
           trigger. The Glock’s muzzle flashes a rapid burst of bullets. 

                                 WILL
                        Fuck you!!!

           TWO MEN run from the field, rushing the BMW. Will fires 
           repeatedly, dropping the men with multiple shots.  

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           Will drives. No music. Just silence. He glances back at 
           Ricky’s body. The BMW speeds past a jackknifed and looted 
           SHELL PETROLEUM TANKER. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. MISSOULA, MONTANA - NIGHT

           OIL DRUMS burn on the shoulder. Families huddle together. A 
           GIRL, 9, yells, seeing the dark BMW approach. People run onto 
           the Interstate, waving flashlights. 

           Will points the Glock straight ahead. At the last second the 
           crowd opens into a channel. Will speeds through, hearing the 
           people howl.   
           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - NIGHT

           The BMW crosses the border into IDAHO, lit by the glow of 
           forest fires. A dash ALARM BLINKS he’s out of gas. Will pulls 
           to the shoulder and grabs the canister he got from the 
           Humvee.

           INT. BMW. INTERSTATE 90 - MOMENTS LATER

           Will accelerates. The gas gauge registers 55 Miles. But then 
           the BMW’s engine down shifts, jerking Will forward. The car 
           shakes like it’s caught between gears. 

           The dash blinks RED SERVICE lights. Will’s eyes shoot to the 
           Gas Gauge. In an instant he knows what he did. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. IDAHO - NIGHT

           The BMW pulls off the shoulder. Will steers the BMW through a 
           set of trees, driving onto a small field. The FOREST FIRE 
           burns a hundred yards away. 

           Will grabs the canister and hose. He opens the BMW’s tank and 
           blows in the hose. A second later he’s refilling the 
           canister. 

           Will piles branches on the ground, laying the foundation for 
           a bonfire. He takes the gas canister and douses the wood.

           Will carries Ricky’s body from the BMW. 

                                 WILL
                        Humvees run on diesel, Ricky. BMW’s 
                        don’t.  

           Will places Ricky on top of the branches. He then walks back 
           and spills the rest of the diesel on the BMW. 

           The fire is closing. Embers rain down on the field. Will sees 
           an OWL perched atop a pine tree. The Owl stares at Will, the 
           orange sky lighting them both. 

           Will sobs, crouching next to Ricky’s body. An ember lands on 
           one of the branches and the BONFIRE ignites.   

           Will turns and sees the BMW catch on fire too. Soon the whole 
           forest is burning. Will continues to cry, his shirtless torso 
           lit by the fire as he watches the flames engulf Ricky’s body.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. IDAHO - DAWN

           Will walks on the shoulder, dehydrated, covered in soot. 
           Around him the trees are burnt to a crisp and smoldering.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. IDAHO - EARLY MORNING

           Will’s a zombie, stumbling. But the forests aren’t burning 
           anymore. An exit sign reads COEUR D’ALENE 5 miles. 

           Will stands at the top of a hill, looking down at Lake Coeur 
           D’Alene. The lake is massive and beautiful. A stark contrast 
           to the hell he’s been through.  

           Will turns, hearing a car. He holds the Glock, looking back 
           at the hill. 

           A four wheel HONDA ATV crests the hill. The driver’s a KID, 
           16, wearing ski goggles and carrying a rifle. There’s a DEAD 
           DEER strapped to the back of his ATV. The Kid smiles at Will 
           while speeding past.

           EXT. COUER D’ALENE - MORNING

           Will sneaks along a patch of trees lining the property to a 
           FARM. The land’s pitched down the bank from I-90. The fields 
           are filled with Llamas, Sheep, Cows and Horses. 

           Will hides behind a tree, studying the layout. There’s a main 
           house. A barn. A tool shack. Two old PICK-UP TRUCKS in the 
           driveway. Besides the animals the place looks deserted. 

           Will crouches down and sneaks to the closest Pick-Up Truck. 
           He glances in the driver’s window.

                                 MAN
                        Looking for these, buddy? 

           CHRIS TURNER, 39, a tall and lanky cowboy, stands on the 
           opposite side of the truck. He holds a SHOTGUN and a set of 
           keys. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Walk around real slow. I don’t want 
                        to shoot you. Just want you off my 
                        land. 

           Will walks around the hood, Glock raised. 

           Chris jumps back, pushing the Shotgun forward. 
                                 CHRIS
                        What I say? Drop the gun! We got 
                        you covered.

           Will holds the gun, far from steady. 

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t think anyone was here. I 
                        wouldn’t have taken your car if I 
                        knew you were here. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Drop the gun! You ok, Sky?

           Will’s eyes roll to the left, spotting SKY, a girl, 13. Sky 
           has a WINCHESTER RIFLE sighted on Will.

                                 SKY
                        I got him, daddy.

           Will sees the girl trembling under the weight of the rifle. 
           She’s terrified but resolute. She’ll shoot him, and maybe by 
           accident. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Just keep holding the gun, sweetie. 

           Will tosses the Glock at Chris’s feet. 

                                 WILL
                        I have to get to Seattle. I need 
                        that gun. 

           Chris picks up the Glock and stares at Will. Sees the blood 
           and ash on his naked upper body.

           Chris’s wife, KAREN, 38, no nonsense, walks down from the 
           farmhouse, holding her own SHOTGUN. She reaches Sky and 
           gently pushes her daughter’s rifle down.

                                 KAREN
                        It’s okay baby, go inside. 

           Karen eyes her husband as Sky runs to the house. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Says he’s going to Seattle. Didn’t 
                        think we were here. 

                                 KAREN
                        Where’d you start?
                                 WILL
                        Milwaukee. My wife’s alone.

           Karen eyes Will. He’s a mess, struggling to stand and talk. 
           She looks to Chris with warm eyes. He nods at her.

                                 KAREN
                        Come on inside. We’ll get you fed 
                        and cleaned up. Try anything stupid 
                        we’ll kill you. This is a farm. We 
                        can be quick when it comes to 
                        killing. 

           INT. TURNER FARM. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Will, face washed and wearing one of Chris’s clean shirts, 
           devours a plate of eggs. Chris, Karen and Sky sit at the 
           table with him. It’s clear they’ve listened to his story.

                                 CHRIS
                        Diesel will ruin a car. You must 
                        have been tired, your friend being 
                        shot. 

                                 WILL
                        It was stupid. 

                                 KAREN
                        Will, do you know? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Karen? 

                                 KAREN
                        He needs to know. 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 KAREN
                        Something happened on the coast.

                                 WILL
                        Was it the whole coast? 

           Karen nods.

                                 KAREN
                        Seattle’s bay is inland. It could 
                        still be ok. But we heard Los 
                        Angeles is gone. 
           Chris refills Will’s coffee.

                                 CHRIS
                        Good news is you already came 
                        through the fires.

                                 WILL
                        Hard to imagine that’s the good 
                        news. 

                                 SKY
                        The caldera erupted. That’s what 
                        you drove through.

                                 KAREN
                        Honey, if the Yellowstone caldera 
                        erupted we’d be dead.  

                                 CHRIS
                        But it’s active. Mt. St. Helens and 
                        Rainier too. My buddy said he met a 
                        caravan of folks heading east. Said 
                        they thought Helen was going to 
                        erupt.

                                 SKY
                        You know, I’m pretty sure he could 
                        steal a car at Black Rock. I mean, 
                        that’s what he needs, right? 

           Karen looks at Sky. Then her husband. 

                                 KAREN
                        She’s right.

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 KAREN
                        This is a resort town. Summer 
                        homes. It’s off season. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Black Rock’s a bunch of mansions.

                                 WILL
                        These empty mansions have cars in 
                        the garage?

                                 CHRIS
                        Probably nice cars. And maybe they 
                        had property managers keeping the 
                        tanks full.
                                 WILL
                        How far is the walk? 

           Chris grabs his jacket, seeking approval from his wife. Karen 
           nods.   

                                 CHRIS
                        Hell. I already pulled a gun today. 
                        In daylight it’s worth a shot. 

                                 KAREN
                        Are you and your wife having a boy 
                        or a girl, Will?

                                 WILL
                        She thinks it’s a girl. 

                                 KAREN
                        She’s probably right. Look, I  
                        delivered five lambs yesterday. I 
                        know how to bring a baby into this 
                        world. And we’ve got supplies for a 
                        year. If things on the coast aren’t 
                        ok, you know where to find us. 

                                 WILL
                        Thank you. 

           Chris lights a Marlboro Medium. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I was on a logging detail in 
                        Bozeman when Karen told me she was 
                        pregnant. I was so nervous I drove 
                        back that night. 

                                 SKY
                        What’s your wife’s name, Will?

           Will gets up from the table. Smiles.

                                 WILL
                        Her name’s Sam... You’d like her. 
                        She’s tough like you.    

           EXT. LAKE COUER D’ALENE - AFTERNOON

           Chris drives Will around the lake in his 1980 Chevy Pick Up. 
           The water is filled with people on anchored sailboats, 
           presumably because it’s safe. Chris hands Will his Glock. 
                                 CHRIS
                        You might need this. Look up in the 
                        woods. 

           Will sees a dirt MOTORCYCLE. The bike’s a hundred yards away 
           but clearly tracking them. 

           The Pick Up rounds the corner. Two MOTORCYCLES are parked on 
           the side of the road. Two MEN, 20, stand at a dirt trail’s 
           outlet. They spin, holding rifles.

           Will trains his Glock on the two men before they can react. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t slow down. 

           Chris drives past the men as Will holds the Glock steady. 
           Chris takes a deep breath.

           EXT. COUER D’ALENE. BLACK ROCK COMMUNITY - AFTERNOON

           It’s a gated entrance. Or was. Someone’s already smashed 
           through. 

                                 WILL
                        How many houses are here?

                                 CHRIS
                        Thirty or so. 

           Will looks at a house. He sees A WOMAN and A MAN staring out 
           a window. A beat up car in the driveway. Squatters. 

                                 WILL
                        Go to the top of the hill. 

           EXT. BLACK ROCK MANSION - AFTERNOON

           Chris parks his truck in the driveway, nervous. The house is 
           massive and opulent. Chris gets out with his Shotgun, walking 
           with Will to the front door. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I don’t see anyone. 

           Chris tries the knob. 

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s locked. 

           Will kicks the door in. Matter of fact. 
                                 CHRIS
                        I’ll keep watch out here. 

                                 WILL
                        You hear me yell, drive away.  

           INT. BLACK ROCK MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Will walks through the house. Glock in hand. He finds the 
           Garage. It’s pitch black. There’s a shelf by the door. Will 
           sees a flashlight. 

           Will turns on the flashlight and catches the gleaming metal 
           of THREE CARS.

           EXT. BLACK ROCK MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Chris holds his shotgun, shifting nervously. Will comes out.

                                 WILL
                        I need you to back your truck into 
                        the middle garage door. It’s 
                        electric. 

           Will walks to the Pick-Up and grabs Chris’s gas canisters and 
           hose from the bed. 

           Chris reverses the truck into the garage door. The truck’s 
           bumper quickly buckles the door from its frame. 

           Will heads inside with the gas canisters. 

           A minute later Will drives out in a brand new BLACK GMC YUKON 
           SUV. A turbo V8. Fast. Big. Perfect. Will jumps out and puts 
           the gas canisters in the back.

                                 CHRIS
                        Damn. 

                                 WILL
                        There’s a Lexus with no gas inside. 
                        If you want it?

                                 CHRIS
                        Take what you need, not what you 
                        want.

                                 WILL
                        Let’s go. I’ll follow you. 
           EXT. CHRIS TURNER’S FARM. DRIVEWAY - SUNSET

           Chris walks out of the barn and lights a Marlboro Medium. He 
           hands Will a screw driver. 

           Will pops out the Yukon’s taillights and removes the bulbs. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You really drive without lights?

                                 WILL
                        Your eyes adjust.   

                                 CHRIS
                        I don’t envy you, Will. It’s crazy 
                        out there.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. 

           Will gets in the Yukon. Puts the Glock on the passenger seat. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Hold on a sec. 

           Chris runs into the barn. A second later he comes out with a 
           pair of BINOCULARS. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Night vision goggles. I use them 
                        for hunting. 

                                 WILL
                        I can’t. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I got like four pairs. They might 
                        help you drive. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re good people. You know that, 
                        right?

           Will reaches under the seat and pulls out a six-pack of 
           Kokanee beer bottles. 

                                 WILL
                        It was sitting in the garage. 
                        Figured it would go bad. 

           Chris grabs the beer, laughing. 
                                 CHRIS
                        Hey now. Even trade.

           Will and Chris shake hands. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You get to your family now.

           INT. YUKON. INTERSTATE 90. IDAHO - DUSK

           Will drives the GMC Yukon, eyes intense, back in business. He 
           picks up the Glock and ejects the clip. There’s 1 BULLET 
           left. Will chambers the bullet. 

           Will pulls Ricky’s Ipod from his pocket and plugs it in. 
           DEVOTCHKA’S ‘How It Ends’ starts to play. Will grips the 
           wheel, again eyeing his wedding ring. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. SPOKANE VALLEY - NIGHT

           The Yukon speeds at a 100 MPH. A highway sign reads SPOKANE 
           10 MILES, SEATTLE 284 MILES. Will crosses the state line into 
           WASHINGTON. The city of Spokane looms on the horizon. 

           Will slows the Yukon. The highway’s lined with abandoned cars 
           and trucks. Spokane office towers burn.

           Will picks up the NIGHT VISION binoculars and I-90 lights up 
           in a ghoulish GREEN. Will puts a hand on the wheel and hits 
           the gas. 

           Will drives at 100 MPH, holding the binoculars over one eye. 
           He slows, driving over a small bridge. Below the Spokane 
           River rages, flooding a neighborhood. The hydraulic dams 
           can’t function without power. 

           Will slows the Yukon in front of an exit sign: (GEG) SPOKANE 
           INT’L AIRPORT. Just past the sign and scattered across the 
           highway is the wreckage of a BOEING 747. Dead bodies still in 
           their seats.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WASHINGTON - NIGHT

           The black Yukon speeds down the highway in darkness. The 
           forest turns to desert. The land is volcanic soil from 
           eruptions past. 

           Will picks up the BINOCULARS. In the green thermal he sees 
           MT. RAINIER on the horizon. It’s spitting LAVA and plumes of 
           ASH into the night’s sky.
           Will sees actual LIGHTS ahead. WIND TURBINES spin along a 
           ridge. There’s RVs parked beneath the Turbines. They’ve 
           plugged directly into the clean energy supply. 

           INT. YUKON. INTERSTATE 90 - LATE NIGHT

           The highway is well lit but not from the moon. The sky is 
           AURORA BOREALIS, filled with wisps of fluorescent green and 
           red. This phenomena is known to occur in the northern pole, 
           not Washington state. 

           Will speeds down the highway, staring at the borealis. An 
           exit sign reads: YAKIMA. Will drives, fighting back tears, 
           lit by the beautiful sky. He accelerates to 160 MPH, more 
           determined than ever.  

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90. WASHINGTON - DAWN

           The Yukon passes a sign for SEATTLE. Right after the sign is 
           a YACHT, resting on the highway. 

           Will drives at a slow speed. The median is flooded with 
           brackish water and debris. There’s hundreds of scattered cars 
           with ghostly bodies still trapped inside.

           Will stops the Yukon above SEATTLE. The city is in ruins, 
           like New Orleans after Katrina. Whole neighborhoods replaced 
           by toxic lakes. Will eyes a downtown neighborhood that’s not 
           underwater. He hits the gas as the first rays of sun hit the 
           city. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - MORNING

           The city streets are washed in dirt and sea. There’s dead, 
           bloated bodies everywhere. Buildings have collapsed. Stores 
           are looted. Traffic signals rock aimlessly in the bay breeze. 

           Will skids the Yukon to a stop in front of an apartment 
           building. The front door is kicked in and the glass broken. 
           Will looks up and sees all the windows shattered. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

           Will sprints up the stairs two at a time, gripping the Glock. 
           He reaches the fourth floor and stops. The door to HIS LOFT 
           is open.  
                                 WILL
                        Sam?! Sam?!

           Will side steps in the door, Glock raised. Everything’s 
           scattered on the floor. The curtains flap in the broken 
           windows. 

           Will turns back to the door and sees a PHOTOGRAPH of Sam and 
           him in front of a barn (the same photo from Tom’s Iphone). 
           It’s hastily DUCT TAPED to the door, obviously left for him 
           to see. Will grabs the photo and heads out the door.

           EXT. LOFT BUILDING. SEATTLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will looks up and down the block. It’s a ghost town. He sees 
           a BOY, 7, standing beneath a ripped store awning. A MAN, 30, 
           pulls the boy away. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON COAST - MORNING

           The Yukon speeds down coastal highway 101. The road is 
           severely damaged, covered with cars and detritus.

           Will glances at the Pacific. There’s a NAVY BATTLESHIP in the 
           choppy waters. Suddenly Will slams the brakes.

           On the distant horizon there’s something that’s never been 
           seen. An enormous BLACK CLOUD stretching for miles. And the 
           black cloud is churning and appears to be growing. 

           Will hits the gas, nervous. The Yukon passes a sign for 
           BELLINGHAM, WA. Will spins the wheel onto a new road, heading 
           inland. 

           EXT. FOREST. BELLINGHAM - AFTERNOON

           Will speeds down a dirt driveway lined with Red Pines. He 
           rounds a corner, seeing TOM’S RANCH. There’s a BMW X5 in the 
           driveway. Will doesn’t recognize the car. 

           The front door of the house opens. A MAN, 38, on edge yet 
           confident, points a massive DESERT EAGLE .44 handgun at the 
           Yukon and fires a WARNING SHOT!   

           Will brakes the Yukon a hundred feet away. He gets out, 
           pointing his Glock. 

                                 WILL
                        Put the gun down!
                                 MAN
                        This is private property!

                                 WILL
                        I know! 

           The door to the house swings open. SAM sprints out, her eyes 
           filling with tears. 

                                 SAM
                        It’s him! It’s him! 

           Sam runs off the porch and down the driveway. She jumps into 
           Will’s arms, screaming in joy. Touching his face. 

                                 SAM
                        Baby, you’re face is bruised. Baby, 
                        you’re here! You’re here.

           Will just holds her, trying not to cry. Sam sees the look in 
           his eyes.  

                                 SAM
                        What happened?

                                 WILL
                        There was nothing I could do. I 
                        wouldn’t have made it without him. 

           Sam breaks into tears. Will holds her tight.

                                 WILL
                        I told him about the baby.  

           Sam steels her emotions and stares at Will. So many things 
           racing through her mind. 

                                 SAM
                        Do you know about the waves?

           Will nods, seeing the Man walk over. Sam holds onto Will, 
           turning. 

                                 SAM
                        This is Jeremiah. He picked me up 
                        during the evacuation. I was on the 
                        highway. Our car got stolen. 

           Will offers his hand to Jeremiah. 

                                 WILL
                        Thank you. 
                                 JEREMIAH
                        What happened to Sam’s dad?

           Sam shakes her head no, wiping away the tears. She grabs 
           Will’s hand.

                                 SAM
                        C’mon, baby. Let’s get you inside.

           Sam grabs Will’s hand and leads him up the driveway. Will 
           turns his head and catches Jeremiah eyeing him.  

           INT. TOM’S HOUSE - SUNSET

           Will sits at the kitchen table with Sam and Jeremiah. He sips 
           a beer, trying to relax. Sam stares at Will, grateful. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        So you had no idea about the waves 
                        until you heard the radio?

                                 WILL
                        The power was out. I caught a clip 
                        about the earthquake. Then-

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Chances are it wasn’t an 
                        earthquake. 

           Will sips his beer. 

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean?

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I’m a software engineer. I’ve seen 
                        tons of war games. They called this 
                        scenario ‘Troy’. It’s designed to 
                        erase rational behavior with a 
                        synchronized event. 

           Will studies Jeremiah, emotion and exhaustion coming to a 
           head.

                                 WILL
                        Are you fucking with me? Erase 
                        rational behavior? 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Will, I’m not trying to upset you. 
                        All we’ve done is pray for you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEREMIAH (CONT'D)
                        And Sam’s dad. I just don’t think 
                        it’s a natural disaster.

           Will sneaks a look at Sam.

                                 WILL
                        So what’s Troy? 

           Jeremiah drains his whisky and refills his cup.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Troy’s a mega-nuclear bomb 
                        detonated off the coast. At the 
                        same time a Trojan horse knocks 
                        down the electric grid. It works. 
                        I’ve seen the intel.  

                                 WILL
                        The intel?   

                                 JEREMIAH
                        The government showed us. 

                                 WILL
                        Where do you work?  

                                 JEREMIAH
                        In the city. Look, in lay terms the 
                        bomb plays like an earthquake. It 
                        also causes the waves. But the 
                        infrastructure. The power going 
                        out, that’s what caused the chaos. 
                        That was Troy. Make sense?

                                 WILL
                        As a theory or explanation? 
                        Probably neither.

           Sam gets up, wrapping her arms around Will’s neck.   

                                 SAM
                        Honey, let’s lie down. You need to 
                        sleep. 

                                 WILL
                        Who would do that? Why?

                                 JEREMIAH
                        The question is who wouldn’t? 

           Sam pulls Will to his feet.
                                 WILL
                        I don’t buy it. Troy didn’t turn 
                        the sky into a ball of lightning. 
                        Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens are 
                        spitting ash. There’s a black cloud 
                        over the ocean. This is something 
                        else.  

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Not necessarily. 

                                 WILL
                        Bullshit. Take a look at a compass. 
                        This isn’t a computer virus or a 
                        bomb. We don’t know what this is 
                        yet.  

                                 SAM
                        Will. Bed. 

                                 WILL
                        Whatever, it doesn’t matter.  

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Why?

                                 WILL
                        Because we still have to survive.

           Will grabs his Glock from the counter, beyond tired.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        You like that gun?

                                 WILL
                        I’d like it more if I had bullets. 

           Jeremiah and Will share a loaded smile. 

           INT. BEDROOM. TOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam lights candles around the bed. She spoons next to Will 
           and he immediately breaks down, convulsing into tears. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m fucking sorry. I’m so sorry.

                                 SAM
                        It’s not your fault. 

           Sam sees Will looking at the rumpled sheets on the bed. 
                                 SAM
                        Baby. No. Never. He’s been sleeping 
                        in the other room. 

                                 WILL
                        I know.

           Sam stares at Will. Warm. She runs her hand through his hair. 
           Will tries to choke back the tears.

                                 WILL
                        All I could think about was you. 
                        Your dad’s dead. And he’s talking 
                        about a fucking cyber war. Who is 
                        he?

                                 SAM
                        Shh... Stop. 

                                 WILL
                        Do you trust him?

                                 SAM
                        I trust you.

           Sam kisses him. Soft at first. Eyes open. Will stares at her. 
           She kisses him again, seeing how raw he is, tears of pride in 
           her eyes. 

                                 SAM
                        Every second. I just stared out 
                        this window. Waiting for you to 
                        come back to me.  

           Will pulls her close, desperate, kissing her full on.

                                 WILL
                        I’m here.  

           Sam pulls Will’s tee shirt off his bruised body and kisses 
           his chest. She yanks off her shirt and pants, then slides off 
           her underwear. Sam mounts Will, tears streaming, kissing him 
           like never before. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM. TOM’S HOUSE - SUNRISE

           Will stands by the window staring at the sky. The BLACK CLOUD 
           he saw over the Ocean is now over them. The sun’s light 
           barely piercing through.
           Will looks down the driveway and sees Jeremiah opening a door 
           to the Yukon. Will quietly dresses, trying not to wake Sam. 
           He eyes his Glock on the dresser.

           INT. KITCHEN. TOM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will finds Jeremiah at the stove, pouring hot water into a 
           French-Press. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Feeling better? Nice to have 
                        propane, right? 

           Will stares out the window at the black cloud. There’s flakes 
           of ASH drifting in the air.

                                 WILL
                        That sky Troy’s doing? 

           Jeremiah smiles, handing Will a cup of coffee. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Probably not. Look, I’m sorry about 
                        last night. I let the whisky do the 
                        talking.

                                 WILL
                        Why were you looking at the Yukon?

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I saw two kids in the woods. I 
                        wasn’t going to steal your car if 
                        that’s what you’re after. I have my 
                        own.

                                 WILL
                        You planning on leaving?

           Jeremiah studies Will.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        California. Sam and I talked about 
                        it. I know people there. 

           Will looks out the window. 

                                 WILL
                        Where did you see them? 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Who?
                                 WILL
                        The two kids?

                                 JEREMIAH
                        A hundred yards in. I’ve been 
                        running a perimeter since we got 
                        here. I already ran it once this 
                        morning. 

                                 WILL
                        Let’s go. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        You got your gun?

                                 WILL
                        I’m out of bullets. Should I get it 
                        anyway? To scare them?

           Jeremiah flashes the Desert Eagle .44 tucked in his waist. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        We’ll be fine. 

           EXT. RED PINE WOODS - MORNING

           Jeremiah and Will walk through the woods. Jeremiah leads, his 
           back to Will. Will looks at the black sky.

                                 WILL
                        So where did you work? You didn’t 
                        answer last night.

           Jeremiah glances back. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t take it personally. You 
                        rescued my wife. I’m just hoping 
                        you didn’t escape from prison.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I’m not the boogie man, Will. We’re 
                        in this together. 

           The ash starts to rain through the trees. 

                                 WILL
                        We’re not going to California. If 
                        you’re set on it, I’ll help you get 
                        gas. Otherwise you can come with 
                        us.
                                 JEREMIAH
                        Where?

                                 WILL
                        Away from the coast. 

           Jeremiah keeps walking, his back to Will. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I don’t blame you, not trusting me. 
                        After driving across the country. 
                        Seeing that side of people. 

                                 WILL
                        It’s always been there. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        What has?

           Will sees Jeremiah’s hand inching towards the gun in his 
           waist.

                                 WILL
                        That side of people.  

                                 JEREMIAH
                        My friends in California have money 
                        and land, Will. Sam and I decided 
                        if you weren’t back within a week 
                        we’d go there. She wants to go.

                                 WILL
                        I think that’s changed. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        We thought you were dead, Will. I’m 
                        glad you made it back. But I saved 
                        her. There’s a bond with me and 
                        her. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m grateful, Jeremiah.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I want you to respect what I’ve 
                        done. You can’t just show up here 
                        and change that. 

                                 WILL
                        She’s my wife. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        The world is ending, Will. 
           Jeremiah stops, his back to Will. He holds the Desert Eagle 
           at his side. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t. You have a choice.

                                 JEREMIAH
                        I know. And it’s an easy choice.

           Jeremiah spins, raising his Desert Eagle. He quickly freezes.

           Will’s Glock is already trained on his chest. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t see any kids out here. 

                                 JEREMIAH
                        Put the gun down, Will. You already 
                        told me you don’t have bullets.

                                 WILL
                        I lied. 

           BANG! Jeremiah’s chest explodes as he flies onto his back. 
           Will tosses the Glock and grabs Jeremiah’s Desert Eagle. 

                                 WILL
                        Shoot first.

           Jeremiah stares up at Will, dying, a shocked smile creasing 
           his lips.

           The black sky above churns, thunder cracking. The rain of ash 
           turns into a black blizzard. Will starts running. 

           EXT. RED PINE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Will sprints out of the woods toward the house, shielding his 
           eyes from the ash. Above him the black clouds pulsate like 
           TORNADO FUNNELS.

           Sam is on the porch. She heard the gunshot. She sees Will run 
           out of the woods.  

                                 SAM
                        Where’s Jeremiah?

                                 WILL
                        He’s dead. 

           Sam doesn’t question Will. She takes his hand and they run to 
           the Yukon together. 
           INT. YUKON. BELLINGHAM, WA - MORNING

           The Yukon speeds onto the main road. Sam gasps. The entire 
           sky is BLACK, the only light in the center, like the eye of a 
           hurricane. 

           Will turns on the windshield wipers.

                                 SAM
                        Where are we going?!

                                 WILL
                        We have to get away from the coast. 

           Will turns the Yukon onto I-2, speeding inland. 

                                 WILL
                        We’re going to make it. 

                                 SAM
                        Look at the sky!

           The eye in the storm shuts, turning day into night. Will 
           turns on the HEADLIGHTS. But the ash is too heavy. It’s like 
           driving into a WALL. 

                                 WILL  
                        I have to stop. I can’t see.

           Will pulls the Yukon over. He shuts the car off. The Yukon 
           shakes, battered by violent winds. In a matter of seconds the 
           car is blanketed in black ash.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           Just the sounds of the storm and Will and Sam breathing.  

                                 SAM
                        Will? All I see is darkness. 

                                 WILL
                        Give me your hand.

           The winds die down, followed by an eerie silence. Will turns 
           the car back on. He hits the windshield wipers and sees 
           light. The eye in the storm is opening! 

                                 SAM
                        Go! Go!
           Will hits the gas. The road is covered in obstacles. Will 
           speeds the Yukon, disappearing into the clouds of ash.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           EXT. ALBERTON GORGE BRIDGE, IDAHO - SUNSET

           The bridge is suspended over a five hundred foot gorge. The 
           Yukon zooms into frame, headlights OFF. It’s covered in dirt 
           and dents but still running. 

           INT. YUKON. INTERSTATE 90E - SUNSET

           Will drives, holding Sam’s hand. It’s been a long day. 
           They’re shell shocked but coming out of it. 

           Sam looks out the window at LAKE COEUR D’ALENE. The lake is 
           surrounded by pristine forests. She can even see the moon in 
           the lake’s reflection.

                                 SAM
                        The sky is clear here. It’s 
                        beautiful. 

                                 WILL
                        It’ll be safe. For now. They’re 
                        good people.

           Sam squeezes Will’s hand and places it on her stomach.

                                 SAM
                        I love you.

                                HOW IT ENDS 
                        “All I See Is Darkness” Pt. 1/3

           As the credits roll JOHNNY CASH sings ‘I See A Darkness’.  

                                 JOHNNY CASH
                        Well, you know I have a love, a 
                        love for everyone I know. And you 
                        know I have a drive to live, I 
                        won't let go. Can you see this 
                        opposition comes risin' up 
                        sometimes. And that I see a 
                        darkness! Did you know how much I 
                        love you? Is a hope that somehow 
                        you, can save me from this 
                        darkness?
