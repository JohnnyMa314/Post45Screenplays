           EXT. STREET - OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DEAD OF NIGHT

           Beneath a quarter moon that sparkles in the starry sky, DAG 
           PARKER and LORELEI JONES run for their fucking lives.  

           The zombie-pocalypse is upon us, which would be bad enough, 
           were it not for the simultaneous arrival of vampire-mageddon.  

           Chaos and carnage reign, with humans killing zombies killing 
           vampires killing humans in a massive chain of death.

           It’s as if we’ve walked into the wrong theater and find 
           ourselves twenty minutes into the third act.

           Dag and Lorelei, a couple of all-American blood-soaked teens, 
           race for the farm house at the top of a hill, a few dozen 
           yards ahead of an undead mob of brain-eaters doing the zombie-
           shuffle, and a phalanx of hemoglobin-drunk blood-suckers.

           INT. FARM HOUSE

           Dag and Lorelei kick open the DOOR and SLAM it behind them.

           Safe!  Phew.

           CAMERA pans 180 and we see the room is chockablock with human-
           zombie-vampire madness.  They’d have been safer outside.

           ARM

           punches through the door grabs Dag’s head and slams it back 
           into the door.  Lorelei shrieks.  Real helpful.

           A vampire leans in to bite Dag’s neck, but the zombie’s arm 
           slips right into the vampire’s path and it bites the zombie 
           instead, who drops Dag.

           Dag and Lorelei are off toward the stairs.  Along the way 
           zombies and vampires assault, but they’re getting in each 
           other’s way, and amazingly, the plucky young teens make it to 
           the staircase.

           Dag leads Lorelei up the steps, but she’s yanked by the 
           ponytail and pulled back to the landing, where she’s beset by 
           a trio of vampires.

           Dag breathes deep, bends his knees and launches himself from 
           the top step, torpedoing his body into the back of the middle 
           vampire, a black-haired teen no older than they are.

           The pair crash forward into the wall, CLANGING into a pair of 
           yard-long tubular copper door BELLS.

           Dag grabs a bell in each hand and yanks them loose.  He 
           swings one into the jaw of the vampire to his left, and 
           plunges the other into the chest of the one to his right.  
           Black blood oozes from the protruding end of the tube.

           The vampire Dag hit in the jaw recovers and moves to bite 
           Dag’s neck and Lorelei screams again.
           Dag ducks just as a nerdy-looking zombie slams into the door-
           bell speared vampire, sending it and the protruding bell 
           straight into and through the about-to-bite-Dag vampire. 

           The zombie grabs Dag’s head and prepares to eat his brain, 
           when the vampire-girl Dag top-roped CLANGS his skull with the 
           other DOOR BELL.  

           Before Dag can register the pin-wheeling threats, vampire-
           girl super-punches Dag in the chest, launching him back up to 
           the top of the steps.  

                                 LORELEI
                        Dag!

           It’s her first word, and her last, as vampire-girl wastes no 
           time in mainlining the blood from her jugular.  Yum!

           Dag attempts his second leap from the top step, but this time 
           vampire-girl is ready, and she catches him by the throat with 
           one hand.  She holds him there, choking him, while she 
           returns to her Lorelei blood-shake.

           But she’s interrupted by the zombie she clanged in the head, 
           who grabs her hair and yanks her head back.  Dag, lashing out 
           at anything near, punches the zombie in the head with both 
           fists.  It’s vampire on human on zombie on vampire.

           And that’s when things get bad.

           WHITE LIGHT

           floods through every window, momentarily blinding everyone.  

           SHOCK WAVE

           hits the house like a wrecking ball, sending Dag, the vampire 
           and the zombie tumbling off the landing and into the kitchen.  

           INT. KITCHEN

           The trio gather themselves and prepare to reengage, but

           WHITE LIGHT blinds them again.  And

           SHOCK WAVE

           even bigger this time, blows out the windows and doors, 
           burying shards of glass and splinters of wood into various 
           zombies’ brains and vampires’ chests.

           When the dust settles, we see that after all the fighting and 
           the explosions, the only beings not left completely dead are 
           Dag, the vampire girl and the zombie nerd.

           That’s it.  The rest of the house is dead.  Like, dead dead.

           The three survivors look at each other, unsure what to do, 
           when the zombie steps toward Dag.
                                 ZOMBIE
                        Brains!

           Dag takes a step backward, eyes wide.

                                 VAMPIRE
                        Wait!

           The zombie looks over at the vampire and cocks his head.

                                 ZOMBIE
                             (to Vampire)
                        Brains?

           The zombie now advances on the vampire.

                                 DAG
                        Wait!  Just wait a second.

           The zombie stops again, extremely confused.

           In the quiet of the house, we start to hear sounds from 
           outside.  Sounds of trouble.

           Dag steps tentatively across the room, over the landing and 
           into the living room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Bodies strewn everywhere, but Dag pays them no heed.  He’s 
           focused on the BOOMS and SCREAMS and ZIPS and WHIRS that are 
           emanating from outside the house.

           Vampire girl arrives behind him and then zombie.  All three 
           approach the windows and look outside.

           EXT. HILL AND BEYOND

           Outside, illuminated by the light of the blazing barn and a 
           half-dozen oak trees, are dozens and dozens of -- I shit you 
           not --

           Alien spaceships.  

           Spilling from the ships like ants from a hole, are thousands 
           upon thousands of silver-hued ALIENS, shimmering in the 
           firelight, like the molten polyalloy terminator from T-2.

           Using translucent bowling ball sized orbs that materialize 
           from their palms, the aliens are vaporizing everything in 
           their path.  

           INT. FARM HOUSE

           The trio stare in horror as each of their kind is cut down.

           Humans evaporated.  
                                 DAG
                        Oh my god.

           Vampires disintegrated.  

                                 VAMPIRE
                        Holy shit.

           Zombies vaporized.

                                 ZOMBIE
                        Uuurrrggggh.

           Dag and the vampire look at each other, speechless.  Zombie 
           joins the lookfest, eyeing the vampire first, then Dag.

                                 ZOMBIE (CONT’D)
                        Brains?

                                 DAG
                        No, not brains.  No brains.
                             (off Zombie’s squint)
                        We’ve got bigger problems right 
                        now.

           Zombie looks at Vampire.

                                 VAMPIRE
                        He’s right.  We need a cease-fire.  
                        A truce.  No biting.

           A translucent orb rolls through the front door and comes to a 
           stop in the living room.

                                 DAG
                        What the --

           The orb explodes, completely erasing a ten foot by ten foot 
           spherical chunk of the room.  Half a wall, half a piano, and 
           a table full of tchotchkes... gone.  Like they never existed.  

           The teens turn and peer out the window.  Aliens, dozens, 
           headed toward the house.

                                 VAMPIRE
                        What do we do?

                                 DAG
                        Basement.

           Dag leads them over the landing and into the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN

           Dag pushes aside the kitchen table and peels back the jute 
           mat below it to reveal a trap door to the basement.

                                 VAMPIRE
                        How’d you --
                                 DAG
                        They’re my neighbors.

           Dag yanks on the door but finds it locked.  He KNOCKS on it.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Miller?  Mrs. Miller?  You in 
                        there?

           There’s no response, and Dag raps harder on the door.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Please, if you’re in there.  It’s 
                        me, Dag.

           Another pair of vapor balls hit the house, and a set of 
           kitchen cabinets no longer supported by a wall tumble into 
           Dag, knocking him to the floor.

           DAG’s POV

           He sees aliens converging on the house from all sides.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Miller, Mrs. Miller, please...

           We HEAR a HEAVY LATCH UNLOCK below them.

           Dag tries the door and this time it OPENS!  

           With sweet relief, Dag ushers Zombie in first, then Vampire, 
           and then, after pulling the table back over the hole and 
           placing the mat on top of the door, Dag gently lowers the 
           door above him and descends into the 

           BASEMENT

           pitch black.  Zero light whatsoever.

                                 DAG
                        Mr. Miller?  Mrs. Miller?  Hello?

           We hear a JANGLE, as Dag bumps into the CHAIN for the lights.

           The bulbs pop to life, and what do we see?

           Zombie and Vampire feasting on the farmer and his wife.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

                                 VAMPIRE
                             (sheepish)
                        Sorry.

                                 DAG
                        To hell with sorry.  
           Dag scoops up a shovel and snaps the handle in two over his 
           knee, giving him a stake in one hand and shovel in the other.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        And to hell with you.

                                 ZOMBIE
                             (grinning)
                        Urrrrrgh!

           Zombie and Vampire drop their meals to the floor and the trio 
           eye each other “The Good, The Bad and the Ugly” style.

           HEAVY METALLIC FOOTSTEPS above them gives them pause.

                                 DAG
                        Shit.

           The distinct CLANG of the FOOTSTEPS is blurred as more and 
           more aliens arrive in the room directly above the basement.

           The STEPS gradually come to a halt, and the room is filled 
           with a muffled alien chatter that sounds like a conversation 
           between two Tivos.  PU-PIK.  PI-PUK.

           The floor bows under the collective weight of the creatures.

           PU-PIK...  PI-PUK.

           More metallic FOOTSTEPS as the aliens exit the house, leaving 
           our three survivors to resume their endgame.

           Zombie takes a tentative step forward and Dag raises the 
           shovel over his head.  Vampire feints toward Dag, but quickly 
           turns toward Zombie.  

                                 ZOMBIE
                             (at Vampire)
                        Urrrgggh.  

           They all retreat to their initial positions, eyeballing each 
           other warily.

                                 DAG
                        What’s best case scenario here?

                        I mean, say we don’t all kill each 
                        other.  What does the victor get, a 
                        lonely wait to be vaporized by an 
                        alien?

                        You’d think eating all those brains 
                        would make you smarter.

           Dag slowly puts down the shovel and stake, then stands and 
           stares at Vampire and Zombie, who both stay put.

           EXT. COUNTRY STORE - MORNING

           A white Pontiac 6000 stops at the curb and Dag opens the back 
           door and hops out.  From the front seat, his square peg 
           mother, um, PEG, hands him a list, and his straight shooter 
           dad, um, SHOOTER, leans over and adds to it.  

                                 SHOOTER
                        Get some milk, too.

           INT. COUNTRY STORE

           The door opens, and Dag, a gangly bag of knees and elbows, 
           steps inside to see DAISY, the absurdly large-breasted store-
           owner’s wife, standing behind the counter talking to DON 
           JOHNSON, as in the actor, Don Johnson.

           Dag takes one look at him and curses underneath his breath.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Morning, Dag.

           Dag rolls his eyes, grabs a basket and walks down the aisle. 

           As Dag shops, Don Johnson regales Daisy with some inane 
           tinseltown story that Daisy eats up like a chocolate sundae.

                                 DON JOHNSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So finally the S.C., the stunt 
                        coordinator, says fine, we’ll use 
                        your horse.  

           Dag scoops up a jar of jam, some eggs, a loaf of bread.
                                 DON JOHNSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And naturally the guy was a hundred 
                        percent right.  My horse, champion 
                        that she was, sure as heck wasn’t 
                        no stunt horse.

           The only unchecked item on Dag’s list is milk.  He arrives at 
           the refrigerator and finds it completely bare.

                                 DON JOHNSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Not only did the stunt man end up 
                        with a broken neck, but we 
                        completely wasted the day.  Had to 
                        push back my trip to Turks and 
                        Caicos and everything.  Disaster!

           Dag arrives at the counter, where he sees one beautiful glass 
           bottle of ice cold milk resting on the counter.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Ah, but I can laugh about it now.

                                 DAG
                        I hate to interrupt such an epic 
                        potboiler, but is there any chance 
                        I can grab that bottle of milk?

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Sorry, Dag, but this is Don 
                        Johnson’s milk.

                             (voice rising)
                        Who really likes milk.

                                 DAISY
                             (to Dag)
                        Will this be all then?

           Dag turns to Daisy and talks directly to her breasts.

                                 DAG
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Daisy starts ringing and bagging Dag’s merchandise.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        So how’s that dog of yours, Dag.

                        I’m still having a bit of a

                        Look, Don, have you ever considered 
                        that the reason you lose so many 
                        cows is that you’re a better actor 
                        than you are a farmer?  
                             (off Don’s hesitant smile)

           Dag slams the door and runs away before he can catch hell.

           EXT. MILLARD FILLMORE HIGH - MORNING

           Dag vanishes into the sea of students that pours into the 
           front entrance of a fairly large high school.  

           INT. HALLWAY

           An endless sea of lockers.  Dag glares at a photo of a 
           hairless dog taped to the front of his locker door.

           He scrunches up the paper, yanks open the door and tosses it 
           onto a pile of identical crumpled up pictures.

           CAMERA rises straight up, through the ceiling tiles, pipes 
           and tiles of the floor directly above Dag, arriving at

           VAMPIRE GIRL’S LOCKER
           where VAMPIRE GIRL, also known as PETRA LANE, eyes herself in 
           the mirror at the back of her locker.  She’s a raven-haired 
           beauty with black eyes and bone china skin, and a nasty two-
           inch scar on her scalp that she hides behind a wall of bangs.  

           Her tude says she’s hot, she knows it, and you should F off.  

           But wait a sec, did a look of panic just zip across her face?

           No matter.  It’s gone, as Petra adjusts her mostly-miracle-
           bra-rack and tugs at the bottom of her just-long-enough-to-be-
           street-legal dress.  Just in time, as here comes

           MILAN PINACHE

           tall, dark and delicious.  

                                 MILAN
                        You ready for tonight?

                                 PETRA
                             (a perfect actress)
                        You bet I’m ready.
                             (grabs his belt)
                        You better bring it.

                             (impish smirk)
                        I’ll bring it.

           Milan leans in to kiss her, but stops at the BLARING of a 
           WHISTLE, wedged firmly into the mouth of 

           ZOMBIE

           currently known as NED EUSTACE, the Heely-wearing hall 
           monitor, honor student, and weiner extraordinaire.

                                 NED
                        No PDA on school property.

           Milan eyes Ned with benign indifference, and we STAY on 

           NED

           as he rolls down the hall, weaving in and out of packs of 
           kids like a roller skate dancer at Venice Beach.  Until a

           LEG

           materializes out of nowhere in an attempt to trip him.

                                 TRIPPER
                        Nerd!

           Ned, oddly dexterous for a, um, nerd, leaps the leg with 
           aplomb, spins on a dime and Heely's backwards -- Is this even 
           possible?  Yes, for Ned, who's figured out the required 
           parabolic whatchamacallits -- down the hall.
                                 NED
                             (James Bondian, he thinks)
                        The name…  is Ned.

           Ned spins back around and

           WHAM!

           his FACE connects with the waiting LID of a garbage can, 
           knocking Ned to the ground, hard.

           Standing over his prostrate frame is TONY CERONE, no one 
           important, but we need an unsympathetic dick character.

                                 TONY
                        Whistle on that, Nerd!

           EXT. TEACHERS' LOUNGE DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ned, rubbing his bright red forehead, arrives at the door of 
           the teachers’ lounge and walks inside.

           INT. TEACHERS’ LOUNGE

           In a room darkened by tightly drawn blinds, listless teachers 
           with out-of-fashion clothes and never-in-fashion hairstyles 
           dot the room, eyeing the clock in anticipation of summer, 
           retirement and then death.  Toll-booth-working-dentists are 
           happier to show up for work.

           Whistle dangling around his neck, Ned rolls over to MR. 
           KELLER, the world’s worst math teacher, who lies on a couch, 
           apparently nursing the world’s worst hangover.  

                                 NED
                        Mr. Keller?

                                 MR. KELLER
                             (eyes closed)
                        Teachers’ lounge.

                                 NED
                        What?

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Teachers’ lounge.  Teachers’ 
                        lounge.  Teachers’ lounge.  

                                 NED
                        Right, but I just had one quick 
                        question about --

                                 MR. KELLER
                             (screaming)
                        TEACHERS’ LOUNGE!!!!  You insolent 
                        little turd.  Piss off and go blow 
                        your whistle at the cool kids.
                                 NED
                             (seemingly unfazed)
                        I’ll talk to you after class then.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        I hope you get hit by a bus and 
                        die.

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Blinds drawn, Mr. Keller SNORES in his chair at the front of 
           the room, while a class full of students enjoys the break.

           Ned, Petra and Dag are all there, although the dozen or so 
           feet between them might as well be galaxies: one of them 
           would have to burst into flames in order to attract the 
           attention of the others.  

           Dag sits by himself in the far corner of the room, idly 
           doodling a cartoon picture of himself throwing a baseball in 
           a notepad.  It’s a flip book, and Dag flips the pages to 
           display himself throwing the pitch that wins Fillmore the 
           State Title.

                                 DAG
                             (as he flips)
                        Mwaaaa!  And the crowd goes wild!

           Petra sits at her desk looking anxious.  She tugs at her 
           dress constantly and fusses with the hair covering her scar, 
           while beside her a girlfriend chatters mindlessly about 
           heels, parents, sunshine, lollipops and god knows what...

           Ned sits at his desk quietly solving differential calculus 
           problems in a college workbook.  Cause he’s a nerd, get it?

           The BELL RINGS, and everyone immediately flees the room.  
           Everyone, that is, except Mr. Keller, who continues snoring, 
           and Ned, who continues working.  (See above, re: nerd)

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

           Fifty healthy young bucks throw, hit and catch balls on a 
           perfectly pleasant fall afternoon.

           Behind the plate a catcher holds up his mitt in anticipation.

           THWAP!

           The catcher rips off his mitt and howls in pain.  

                                 CATCHER
                        Damn, dude.

           Behind him an ASSISTANT COACH stares in awe at a radar gun.

                                 ASSISTANT COACH
           PULL BACK to reveal Dag, on the mound, wearing an awkward 
           grin.  Beside him stands the HEAD COACH.

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Damn, son.  What are you eating?

           Dag smiles, sheepishly and picks up another ball.

                                 HEAD COACH (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious, are you cycling?

                                 DAG
                             (unsure)
                        My mom drives me.

           Teammates titter at Dag’s obtuseness.

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Roids, son.  Roids.

                                 DAG
                        What?  No.  I just hit a growth 
                        spurt.

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Six inches in a month is some 
                        spurt, boy.

           CHAZ JR., 6’5”, 220lbs, more ripped than a Kate Perry CD... 

                                 CHAZ JR.
                        Maybe hairless wonder finally 
                        sprouted a pube.  

           Dag’s shoulders slump.

                                 CHAZ JR. (CONT’D)
                        Show us, rat dog, show us one pube.

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Is that true, son?  You really 
                        spick and span down there?

           Dag can’t believe this is happening to him.  

                                 HEAD COACH (CONT’D)
                        Cause that’s weird, I think.  Kid 
                        your age.
                             (to assistant coach)
                        Is that weird coach?  No hair at 
                        seventeen?

                                 ASSISTANT COACH
                        Maybe he shaves it?  I read 
                        somewhere that they do that now.  

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Boys?  
                                 ASSISTANT COACH
                        Started with the girls, then 
                        spread.

                                 HEAD COACH
                        Is that it, then?  You shave it?

           More than one teammate has their phone out at this point, 
           recording the entire exchange.

                                 DAG
                             (long beat, near tears)
                        Can I just pitch or something?

                                 HEAD COACH
                        We’re about to find out, son.  Chaz 
                        Jr., get in there.

           Chaz Jr. steps to the plate with well-earned bravado.

           Beyond the batting cage fence, a sun-dress clad Lorelei sits 
           on a picnic blanket painting her toenails.  Ooh, she’s so 
           purdy.  Be a real shame if anything bad happened to her.

                                 CHAZ JR.
                        Pay attention, Lor.  I’m about to 
                        remind this bitch who’s finally 
                        gonna beat Harding High and win 
                        Fillmore it’s first state title.

                                 LORELEI
                             (looking up from her toes)
                        Remind him gently, Jr., that bitch 
                        is my neighbor and he’s a nice boy.

                                 CHAZ JR.
                             (to Dag)
                        Okay, nice boy.  Bring that cheese 
                        in here.  Chaz Jr. is ‘ungry.

           Dag eases his hand into his mitt and grasps the ball, the 
           slightest hint of a grin peaking out from the corner of his 
           mouth.  This is one of those scenes, with the top jock and 
           the prom queen and the underdog and Dag recognizes it 
           immediately.  This is his moment to show her what he’s made 
           of.  This is the moment she takes notice.

           This...  is...  everything.

           SLO-MO/MOS as Dag kicks his leg high, reels his arm back and 
           whips the ball with more velocity than ever before.  

           ZOOM slowly into Dag’s face, as he follows the path of the 
           ball, eyes wide in expectation of glory.

           But Dag’s face morphs from triumph to horror.

           FULL SPEED/FULL SOUND, still TIGHT on Dag’s face, as we hear

           SNAP SNAP
                                 CHAZ JR. (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!

                                 LORELEI (O.S.)
                        Chaz!!!!

           The horror in Dag’s eyes is palpable.

                                 ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.)
                        Jesus Christ!

           SLOW ZOOM into the black of Dag’s pupil as we listen to the 
           gory details.

                                 CHAZ JR. (O.S.)
                        Is it broken?

                                 ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.)
                        Which one?

           Chaz Jr. wails...  Lorelei screams... someone vomits... 

           POST-APOCALYPSE

           INT. BASEMENT - MILLER FARM - TIME UNCLEAR

           Dag and Petra sit together in the basement, dimly lit by two 
           fluorescent overhead lamps at the far end of the room.  Ned, 
           looking like a guy who popped a few too many oxys, lies 
           zonked out in the corner.

           Above them, we hear the muffled sounds of aliens watching TV, 
           along with a constant chorus of alien PI-PUKS and PU-PIKS. 

                                 PETRA
                        How long are they going to stay up 
                        there?  What the hell are they 
                        doing, anyway?

                                 DAG
                        You mean other than watching TV?

                                 PETRA
                        Seriously?  We were overrun by 
                        alien couch potatoes?

           Dag PEELS open a CAN of peaches, as Petra recoils in disgust.

                                 DAG
                        You don’t like canned peaches?

                                 PETRA
                        No.

                                 DAG
                        Is that like, uh, a vampire thing?
                                 PETRA
                        No, they’re just gross.

                                 DAG
                        But you wouldn’t eat them even if 
                        you liked them?

                                 PETRA
                        No.

                                 DAG
                        Because all you eat is human blood.

                                 PETRA
                        I guess so.

                                 DAG
                        You guess so?  

                                 PETRA
                        I don’t know.  I mean, I haven’t 
                        been a vampire for all that long.
                             (off Dag’s look)
                        Do we have to talk about this?

           Dag looks at Petra, then a drooling Ned, then back at Petra.

                                 DAG
                        What the hell else are we gonna do?

                                 PETRA
                             (exhaling)
                        I don’t know...  die of boredom?

           Dag leans his head against the wall and looks up at the shelf 
           above his head, which is covered with cans of paint.  

                                                              TIME CUT:

           BASEMENT - LATER

           Ned lies unconscious between Dag and Petra, who’ve each taken 
           a half of his body to decorate as they see fit.

           Dag’s side is what you’d expect from an immature teenage boy.  
           A black eye, a mustache, polished nails...

           Petra’s side is more thoughtful, with her half of Ned’s face 
           painted to look like Heath Ledger’s Joker, and a series of 
           Tim-Burtonesque spirals and swirls coating his arm.  

                                 DAG
                        You’re making me look bad.

                                 PETRA
                             (self-conscious)
                        It’s nothing.  
                                 DAG
                        Do you, like, paint?

                                 PETRA
                        Sometimes.  
                             (beat)
                        Yes.

                                 DAG
                        Is that embarrassing for some 
                        reason?

                                 PETRA
                        I don’t know.  It seems lame to 
                        admit trying hard at anything.

                                 DAG
                        Well I think it’s cool.  People who 
                        are just naturally good at things 
                        piss me off.

           Petra half smiles.  Encouraged, Dag grabs Ned’s jaw.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                             (working Ned’s jaw)
                        Why... so... serious!

           Petra reluctantly laughs. Dag, feeling it now, does it again.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                             (louder, more dramatic)
                        Why... so... seri --

           Ned half wakes with a wild URRRRGGGH!! that sends Dag 
           skittering across the room in a panic.

           Petra laughs fully and heartily now, and as Ned drifts back 
           to sleep, Dag grins, happy.  

           End of the world or not, he just made a pretty girl laugh.

           PRE-APOCALYPSE

           INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Ned still sits in the now pitch black room, still doing 
           calculus by the light of his cell phone.

           Mr. Keller SNORES a few more times before finally issuing a 
           GAGGING SOUND that wakes him with a start.  

           Mr. Keller blinks his eyes a few times and absentmindedly 
           rubs his palms along his chest and audibly SLAPS his TONGUE

                                 NED
                        Mr. Keller, if I might have a word 
                        with you about our most recent 
                        exam.  I believe there’s been an 
                        error.

           The look on Mr. Keller’s face says it all.  This is not the 
           first time Ned has lingered.  This is not the first time Ned 
           has bothered him.  

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Tell me Ned, is it still considered 
                        an error if it wasn’t an accident? 

                                 NED
                        Pardon?

                                 MR. KELLER
                        You think there’s been an error 
                        because you answered all the 
                        questions correctly yet still 
                        received a failing grade.

                                 NED
                        That’s correct.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        And...

                                 NED
                        And, I’d like you to correct my 
                        grade.  By my calculations this F 
                        will lower my grade in this class 
                        to a B-, which would --

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Don’t you get it, Ned?  I’m 
                        teaching you a lesson.  

                                 NED
                        A lesson?

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Not everything in your life is 
                        under your control.  It’s best you 
                        learn that now, before you get the 
                        wrong idea.

                                 NED
                        I’m not sure I follow your logic.  
                        You’re deliberately misgrading my 
                        exam as some kind of favor to me?

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Fine, it’s not favor.  I’ve just 
                        had enough.  The constant hand-
                        raising.  The constant handing in 
                        of unasked for extra credit work.  
                        The relentless questioning of every 
                        assignment.  You’re a pest.
                             (finally looks at Ned)
                        The fact is I can’t stand you.

                        And that fact, combined with the 
                        fact that I have final say over 
                        your grade, means I can do whatever 
                        I want, whyever I want.

                        But I might not get into Harvard 
                        because of this.

                        Oh god, that would be sweet.

                                 NED
                        Mr. Keller, I’m not sure you 
                        understand.  If I bring this grade 
                        home to my father he’ll murder me.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Marvelous.

                        Me, too.  Perhaps he’ll put it on

           EXT. MILAN’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Milan drives a black hearse with tinted windows.

           INT. MILAN’S CAR

           Milan and Petra lie in the back of the hearse, Milan bare-
           chested, Petra down to her carefully selected maroon 
           Victoria’s Secret Angel Push-Up Bra and panties.

           Milan strokes Petra’s ivory neck as she runs her fingers 
           through his hair, the look on her face a mixture of desire 
           and apprehension.  This is really happening.  Finally.

                                 PETRA
                        Is it going to hurt?

                                 MILAN
                        A little at first.  But then...  
                        ecstasy.

           Petra stares into Milan’s eyes and smiles nervously.

                                 PETRA
                        Okay, I’m ready.

                                 MILAN
                        Baby, you’re going to love it.

           Milan leans in to kiss her neck, as his hand runs down 
           Petra’s back, his fingers catching on the lip of her panties 
           and inches them down her waist.
                                 PETRA
                        Ouch!  Stop it!

                                 MILAN
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 PETRA
                        What are you doing?

                                 MILAN
                        What do you mean, what am I doing?  
                        You said you were ready.

                                 PETRA
                        You said you wanted to go all the 
                        way with me.

                                 MILAN
                        I do.

                                 PETRA
                        All the way means sex, not... that.

           Milan sits up, peeved. 

                                 MILAN
                        Pet, I thought I made myself clear.  
                        I don’t enjoy sex with humans.

           INT. EUSTACE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           In a fabulously appointed American dining room, Ned sits with 
           his family while a SERVANT serves out healthy portions of 
           steak, potatoes and gravy.  Ned is flanked by his dashing 
           father, SENATOR CHAZ EUSTACE, his glamorous mother, 
           CHARLOTTE, and his twin brother, Chaz Jr.  

           Both of Chaz Jr.’s arms are encased in thick white casts from 
           wrist to shoulder.

                        With every great disappointment, 
                        comes an opportunity.  Pop Pop told 
                        me that, shortly before he vanished 
                        into the Pacific on his second 
                        attempt to circumnavigate the globe 
                        in a hovercraft.

                        I believe today’s disappointment 
                        presents just such an opportunity.

                                 CHAZ JR.
                        You think I should take up soccer?

                                 SENATOR

                        Soccer!?  Have some self-respect, 
                        son.  No, I was thinking about Ned.
                                 CHAZ JR.
                             (aghast)
                        What about him?

                                 SENATOR
                        I spoke to Coach Thompson today, 
                        and seeing as there’s now an open 
                        spot on the roster, I recommended 
                        Ned for the position.

           Both Chaz Jr. and Ned look positively revolted by the idea.

                        With all due respect sir, I have 
                        never received less than an A in 
                        gym class.

                                 SENATOR
                        Gym class?  Ned, you need to excel 
                        on the field, not just in the 
                        classroom...  Athletics run in this 
                        family as deeply as academics.  
                        Look at your mother, did she drop 
                        out of Harvard while she was 
                        winning all those gold medals?

                        And did I quit the Yankees when I 
                        was reelected to the Senate?

                        So when I say you ought to try out 
                        for the baseball team, do you think 
                        that’s a suggestion or an order?

                                 NED
                        Understood, sir.

                        is over --

                        The doctors were blowing smoke up 
                        your ass.  Face the facts, Jr., 
                        you’re a cripple, and you’ll be 
                        setting off airport metal detectors 
                        for the rest of your life.

           Chaz Jr. instinctively punches his nerd brother in the dick, 
           but moving his broken arms causes him just as much pain and 
           he SHRIEKS as well.

                                 SENATOR
                        The fact of the matter is, Jr.’s 
                        going to Yale.  Whereas if you 
                        suddenly started failing tests, 
                        where would that leave you?

           METALLIC CLATTER as Charlotte drops her UTENSILS in horror.

           Meanwhile, Ned’s hand reaches for the failed test protruding 
           from his back pocket, drawing Jr.’s attention to the paper.

                                 SENATOR (CONT’D)
                        On that note, let’s see ‘em.

           All color vanishes from Ned’s face as his brother’s casted 
           arms awkwardly produce a stack of graded tests and papers.

           While the Senator flips through Ned’s stack - which consists 
           of papers coated in smiley-faced A’s - Ned clandestinely 
           pulls the failed math test from his pocket, wraps it around a 
           piece of steak and feeds it to the dog.

           Ned hands over stacks of tests marked with the same A’s, only 
           his aren’t accompanied by smiley-faces.  The senator flips 
           through them.  He nods, nods, nods, then stops.

           INT. DAG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A typical teenager’s bedroom, if one that skews a little bit 
           toward the immature.

           Dag lies face down on his bed, quietly sobbing, while his

           and retrieves a small bag of pot from Dag’s nightstand.

           From Dag’s POV we have a direct view of her pink cotton-

                        That date-rapist groped me at a 
                        party last year.  Luckily Milan was 
                        there to kick his ass.

                        don’t know shit.

           Dag’s face contorts as he fights in vane to ward off tears.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)

                        Urrgghh.

           Dag turns to Petra.

                                 PETRA
                        My parents are dead.

           Petra lifts her bangs to reveal her smooth forehead.

                        Aunt and uncle.  They’re okay.  But 
                        they’ve got their own kids.  Then 
                        one day it’s like, congrats, your 
                        sister’s dead!  Here’s her screwed 
                        up twelve-year-old freak-show of a

                        don’t really give a shit about me.

           Petra breaks down.  Dag, distressed by Petra’s tears, slides 
           over and offers her his shoulder, which she accepts.  

           And Ned, who’s been quietly stewing on the thought of his own 
           cold and uncaring parents, begins to cry as well.

           For a moment, the three of them just sit their crying.

           PRE-APOCALYPSE

           INT. FRONT SEAT - MILAN’S CAR - EARLIER

           Petra sits in the passenger seat, her cheeks stained with 
           tear-streaked mascara.

           Milan sits behind the wheel looking bored and irritated.

                                 PETRA
                        I don’t understand.  I thought we 
                        had something.  

                                 MILAN
                        What part of me being a vampire 
                        didn’t you understand?

                                 PETRA
                        But you’re assimilated.  I thought 
                        you weren’t supposed to do that 
                        anymore.  

                                 MILAN
                        Do what, Petra?  You said no and I 
                        stopped.  No means no.  
                                 PETRA
                        But why won’t you be with me my 
                        way?  What’s wrong with --

                                 MILAN
                             (with a snort)
                        Please, I’ve already gone down that 
                        road with Lorelei Jones.  

                                 PETRA
                        You slept with Lorelei?

                                 MILAN
                        Don’t you get it, Petra?  Lorelei 
                        had me for twenty minutes, maybe 
                        less.  What I’m offering you...  We 
                        could be together forever.  

           Petra stops at that, and the savvier viewer might detect that 
           Milan has probably played out this exact scene more than a 
           few dozen times before.  Together forever is like catnip to a 
           teenage girl.

                                 PETRA
                        Do you really mean that?

                                 MILAN
                        Petra...
                             (eyes twinkling)
                        Do you have any idea how long I’ve 
                        been waiting for a girl like you?
                             (teeth engorging)
                        Centuries.

           Petra’s eyes widen and her defenses fall.  

           Game.  Set.  Snatch.

           INT. NED’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ned’s bedroom looks like the office of an overworked 
           corporate attorney, with stacks of papers piled everywhere 
           and piles of heavy leather-bound books covering the floor.

           Ned works at his desk, illuminated by a banker’s lamp.

           NED’S SHIT-STAINED MATH TEST

           slaps down on the desk in front of Ned.  He looks up in 
           horror to see the Senator white with rage.

                                 NED
                        Dad, I can explain.

                                 SENATOR
                        It’s sir, and save your breath. 
                        The punishments are as follows.  
                        Chaz Jr. has been grounded for a 
                        week for being a whistle-blower.

                             (through his bedroom wall)
                        Worth it!

                                 SENATOR
                        Your accomplice, Toodles Two, has 
                        been put to sleep, which is sadly 
                        not an option for teenage sons.

                                 NED
                        You don’t understand.  It’s Mr. 
                        Keller.  I got every question 
                        right.

                                 SENATOR
                             (not caring or hearing)
                        As for you, Ned, seeing as you’re 
                        incompetent both athletically and 
                        academically, you’ve left us no 
                        choice.  I’m just off the phone 
                        with General Clark at West Point.
                             (beat)
                        You’ll start in the fall.

           With that, the Senator is gone, leaving Ned, alone in his 
           room.  His entire world blown up in an instant. 

           EXT. A PLACE WITH NAMELESS STREETS - LATER

           Accompanied by the opening arpeggio of Where The Streets Have 
           No Name, our three protagonists pound three separate 
           stretches of pavement in solitary silence.  

           Their paths don’t cross, but their moods are identical: Foul.  

           EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

           Ned wanders the streets listlessly, aimlessly, almost like 
           one lone zombie out for an evening stroll.  

           Perhaps this is what gives him the idea.

           EXT. Z-TOWN MAIN GATE - LATER

           Massive flood lights illuminate a twenty-foot brick wall with 
           a massive iron gate guarded by camo-clad bad-asses with 
           tinted visors and M4 carbines.  

           “Z-TOWN” is spray-painted on one wall beside the gate.  On 
           the other, “Abandon brains, all ye who enter here.”

           From behind Ned’s shoulder we hear a great SHUFFLING of FEET.

           Ned turns to see a herd of twenty zombies out for their 
           evening exercise, a quartet of military men prodding them 
           along.  The zombies are all shackled around the neck, with a 
           master shackle running along the length of the group giving 
           them the rough formation of a shuffling ice tray.
           The dead-eyed zombies’ moans grow louder, and they veer 
           hungrily toward’s Ned as they pass, only to be corralled back 
           on course by a pair of tazer-wielding guards on either flank.  

           EXT. Z-TOWN WALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Away from the gate, in the light of the quarter moon, Ned 
           Heely’s along the wall, raking his fingers across the bricks.  
           From behind the wall we hear HUNDREDS, perhaps THOUSANDS of 
           overlapping MOANS and GROANS.

           Ned arrives at a tree branch that has falling beside the 
           wall, giving him an easy ramp up to the top of the wall.

           INT. Z-TOWN  

           From Ned’s perspective we see Zombie Town, a District 9-ish 
           refugee camp filled with tin shacks and tents and most 
           importantly, zombies.  

           Ned sits with his legs dangling over the wall, perilously 
           close to the grasp of the handful of zombies walking the wall 
           on the other side.  

                                 ZOMBIE
                             (seeing Ned, hungry)
                        Urgggh.  Urgggh!!!

           A few zombies approach Ned as though he were a magical Big 
           Mac gifted from the gods.  

           Ned looks down at them with disgust and horror.  Maybe this 
           was a mistake.

           But then a clever, tent-pole-wielding zombie arrives and 
           chases the others off with a few powerful Urggghs, as well as 
           the occasional blow to the back of the head.

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                             (conversational)
                        Urgggh.  Hey, man.  Urg.

                                 NED
                        How come you can talk and the 
                        others can’t? 

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                        Me?  Urg.  I haven’t been here as 
                        long.  Or maybe I’ve been here 
                        longer.  
                                 NED
                        You don’t know how long you’ve been 
                        in there?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                        How long who’s been in here?

           Ned squints, confused by the confusion.

                                 NED
                        So what's it like, being a zombie?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE

                        Yeah, what does it feel like?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE

                        Oh, right, urgh.  

           A zombie approaches from over Clever Zombie’s shoulder and 
           without any thought he wheels and CRACKS the zombie in the 
           FACE with the tent pole.

                                 NED
                        Does it hurt?  Are you sad?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                        I don’t know.  It’s simple.  I see 
                        brains and I eat them and they’re 
                        yummy.

                        Urg.  Pretty much.

           Ned sits on the wall, pondering.

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE (CONT’D)
                        Wait, you seem smart.

                        intelligence, but yes, often the 
                        gifted have larger -- 

           Clever grabs hold of Ned’s pants-leg and attempts to drag him 
           off the wall.  Ned kicks him off.

                        brains.  
                             (off his groan)
                        But you have to do something for me 
                        in return.  

           EXT. COW FIELDS - MILLER FARM - NIGHT

           A field of cows stand perfectly still in the moonlight.  The 
           night is quiet but for the low RUMBLE of a nearby RIVER, and 
           an occasional THUD, followed by an exaggerated MOOOOOOO.

           Down at the front edge of an apple orchard, Dag scoops up an 
           apple.  He winds, he fires, and

           MOOOOOOOO

           Tears in his eyes, Dag reaches down and grabs another apple.

           CELL PHONE RINGS

           Dag pulls it out, eyes it, puts it back in his pocket.  

           THUMP  MOOOOOOO  CELL PHONE

           Dag pulls it out again and this time, because he’s a good 
           kid, he answers it.

                                 DAG
                        Dad, I’m fine.

                                 SHOOTER (O.S.)
                        Where are you?  You’re not messing 
                        with those cows again, are you?

                                 DAG
                        No.

           Dag smiles and takes a bit out of the apple in his hand.
                                 SHOOTER (O.S.)
                        You sure you’re okay?  Nothing 
                        weird happening with you lately?

                        Listen, Dag, I’m sorry I was hard 
                        on you before.  I know it’s tough 
                        being a kid, and a little 
                        recreational marijuana now and --

                        It’s not my weed, dad, it’s 
                        Lorelei’s.  I hold it for her so 
                        she doesn’t get in trouble with her 
                        folks.

                        My style hasn’t even gotten me out 
                        of the batter’s box. 

           Dag waits for a response, but doesn’t get one.  In the 
           moonlight he eyes the phone and as he sees the words Call 
           Dropped, the phone gets brighter and brighter as Dag watches 
           one bar after another disappear from the phone’s signal 
           strength, until finally it’s replaced by a big black X.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Piece of shit.

           But the whole field is lit up now, and Dag looks up to see

           ALIEN SPACE SHIP

           hovering above the field.

           And another, above downtown.

           And another above the high school.

           And another.  And another.  And another.

           EXT. MILLARD FILLMORE HIGH - MOMENTS EARLIER

           Petra sits alone in the top corner of the bleachers, looking 
           anxious, unsure, worried, drained. 

           She pulls out her cell phone and dials.  Straight to V.M.

                                 MILAN (FILTERED)
                        Hey, it’s Milan.  Leave a message 
                        at the beep and I’ll bite ya back.

           Petra hangs up.  Sighs.  

           She holds the phone up and angles it so that in the glass we 
           see the reflection of the moon.  The focus shifts, and now we 
           see Petra’s neck, and a pair of fresh puncture wounds. 

           She dials again.

                                 MILAN (FILTERED) (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s Milan --

           She hangs up, as she’s suddenly bathed in bright white light.

           She looks up, shielding her eyes against the light and sees 
           an alien ship hovering over the football field.

           EXT. INSIDE Z-TOWN - MOMENTS EARLIER

           Ned sits outside Clever Zombie’s tent, nursing a gnarly 
           looking full-mouth bite mark.  In his hand is a spoonful of 
           gelatinous gray matter.  Brain.

           Inside the tent behind him, we hear what sounds like someone 
           EATING from a WOODEN BOWL, and in silhouette, we see Clever 
           Zombie polishing off someone’s brain like it’s a bowl of 
           Fruit Loops.  He finishes with a burp and tips the body over, 
           the arms and empty brain pan flopping out through the opening 
           of the tent.

           Ned glances over at the corpse, shakes his head ruefully and 
           then SLURPS back the nugget of brain in his hand like an 
           Oyster shooter.  

           The affect is instantaneous, like a rush of heroin, and Ned 
           leans back against a tree stump, high on his first fix.  

           An alien ship arrives over the campsite, bathing the entire 
           scene in bright white light, and now we see that both arms of 
           the body are covered in white casts.  

           Ned zonked out on his first brain buzz, looks up at the sky.

                                 NED
                        Holy fricking urgggh...

           POST-APOCALYPSE
           INT. BASEMENT - MILLER FARM

           Petra and Ned stand over Dag’s prostrate body.  

           A line of drool slips from Ned’s mouth onto Dag’s head, 
           waking him, and he skitters back against the wall in terror.

                                 PETRA
                        Calm down, calm down.  We’re just --

           INT. FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The trap door slowly lifts up a few inches to reveal the 
           scared faces of Petra, Ned and Dag, who’s wearing a 
           motorcycle helmet with the visor up.

           They scan the room from floor level and we see the house has 
           been cleaned out.  All the earthly corpses are gone.

           Petra gives Dag a peck on the cheek, and he nearly falls down 
           the stairs.

                                 PETRA

                        not just saying that because I’m 
                        deliberately manipulating you.

           Dag rolls his eyes and mans up.  He lifts open the trap door, 
           and steps into the kitchen, Farmer Miller’s shotgun in hand.  

           The place is spotless.  Dag follows the sounds of the TV and 
           steps toward the landing that leads to the living room.  

           Dag flips down the visor on his helmet and pops his head out.

           LIVING ROOM

           Sitting on the couch is a large alien watching TV.

           KITCHEN

           Dag pops his back into the kitchen, where Petra and Ned look 
           on from the trap door.

           LIVING ROOM

           Dag sticks his visored head around the corner once more.

           KITCHEN

           Dag lifts the visor to reveal a scrunched up face.

           LIVING ROOM

           The alien sits and quietly watches Daniel Tosh riff 
           sarcastically about a fat girl skateboarding.

           Dag, Petra and Ned all pop their heads around the corner.  
           They stare in confusion at the alien staring at the TV.

           Tosh.0 PI-PUKS its way to CELEBRITY REHAB, which PU-PIKS its 
           way to MAD MEN. 

           Dag, Petra and Ned return to the kitchen.

           Dag smacks Ned in the side of the head and Ned instinctively 
           whirls and opens his jaws at him.

           Petra looks and sure enough Ned is nowhere to be seen.

           Dag and Petra look at each other and then look towards the 
           living room.  They poke their heads around the wall and... 

           There’s Ned, placidly sitting on the couch next to the alien 
           watching TWO AND A HALF MEN.

                             (slightly louder)

                                 NED

           Ned picks up the Tivo remote and PU-PIKS back to TWO AND A 
           HALF MEN.

           The alien breaks away from the TV and looks at Ned, his 
           diamond-shaped alien eyes narrowing into menacing slits.

           The look on the alien’s face and the hand the alien raises 
           toward Ned scares him off the couch, just as

           VAPOR BALL 

           Emerges from the alien’s hand and 

           NED’S HALF OF THE COUCH 

           vanishes into thin air.  Ned races over the landing as the

           LANDING, WALLS AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE

           disentegrate and vanish as well, leaving Ned, Dag and Petra 
           exposed in the kitchen.

           whatever the hell it’s shooting at them and spherical piece 
           by spherical piece the house vanishes into thin air.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MILLER FARM - DAY

           The three teens burst into the yard, and into broad daylight.

           Petra immediately falls to the ground and starts screaming.

           She’s BURNING UP!

           Not knowing what else to do, Dag leaps on top of her, placing 
           his arms over her arms, his legs over her legs and his head 
           over her head.

           Petra slowly quiets down as the pain dissipates.  

           Calm, she looks into Dag’s eyes, just millimeters from hers.

                        Was this assembly called for humans 
                        only?

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                        No, as your presence ably 
                        demonstrates.  And it’s my 
                        understanding that the vampire 
                        community will in fact be holding a 
                        vampire-only assembly at the blood 
                        bank.

                        And what of the zombie community?

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                        As you’re certainly aware, zombie’s 
                        no longer have the right to 
                        assemble.

                        According to whose laws?  You know 
                        as well as I do that whoever 
                        piloted these ships might pose a 
                        grave threat to the creatures of 
                        this planet, and the

                        population could prove a valuable

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                        It is the military’s opinion at 
                        this time, that utilizing the 
                        zombie population in any civil 
                        defense plan is likely to do more 
                        harm than good.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        And what of the vampire population?  
                        How can we be assured the military 
                        is not of the opinion that we’re 
                        next for the refugee camps?

                        This has all been settled under the

                        Now is precisely the time, General. 

           While Mr. Keller speaks, we see Senator Eustace eyeballing 
           notes from a pair of index cards.

                                 MR. KELLER (CONT’D)
                        My brothers and sisters have walked 
                        the earth for thousands of years, 
                        and never before have we drawn the 
                        attention or ire of an alien 
                        species.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Honey, what are you doing?
                                 SENATOR
                             (rising from his seat)
                        Hopefully becoming the next 
                        President of the United States.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Why should we few pay for the sins 
                        of the many?

                                 SENATOR
                        Who are you to talk to us about 
                        sin?  Last I checked we don’t 
                        survive on the blood of others.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Are you a vegetarian, Senator?

                                 SENATOR
                        You’re comparing the killing of a 
                        cow to that of a human being?

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Depends who’s doing the killing.

                                 SENATOR
                        Is that a threat, Mr. Keller?  
                        Because the human race, God’s race, 
                        will not stand for it!

           INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

           The automatic doors slide open and Petra steps inside.  
           KYLIE, the not-as-dumb-as-she-looks blond sitting behind the 
           counter, looks up from a Human People magazine and waves.

                                 KYLIE
                        Hey, Petra.  Cutting out of Aliens 
                        101?

                                 PETRA
                        Whatever.

                                 KYLIE
                        I know, right?  We’re totally sold 
                        out of duct tape and bottled water.  
                        I mean, how stupid can you get?  

           Petra raises a finger and pulls her cell from her pocket.

                                 PETRA
                             (wandering down the aisle)
                        Hey Milan...  I’ve been thinking 
                        about you too...  Of course I can 
                        meet you, what time?  

           Out of eye and earshot, Petra puts the phone down.  Before 
           putting it in her pocket, she dials.

                                 MILAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, it’s Milan.  Leave a message --
           Petra pockets the phone and walks further down the aisle.  
           She stops, looks over toward Kylie and then at the shelf.

           She’s staring at the Vampire Sunblock section.  She eyeballs 
           Kylie again, who’s nose deep in her People magazine.  

           Petra picks up a bottle imprinted with a picture of a happy 
           vampire couple splashing through the water at the beach.  
           Affixed to the bottle is a thick silver security tag. 

           Petra eyes Kylie once more, then leans over and pries the 
           security tag off with one unmistakably enlarged fang.

           Petra tosses the bottle into her bag and heads for the door.

                                 KYLIE (O.S.)
                             (bitchy)
                        Heard your assembly’s at the blood 
                        bank.

           Petra stops and turns around.  Kylie nods towards a large 
           round security mirror at the back of the store.

                                 PETRA
                        Shit.

                                 KYLIE
                        Never pegged you for a vamp, Petra.

                                 PETRA
                        I’m not.  Well, I mean, I wasn’t.  
                        I didn’t --

                                 KYLIE
                        Whatever.  
                             (back to her People)
                        Too.  Cool.  For school.

           Kylie returns her nose to her magazine, and after a long beat 
           Petra reluctantly turns and walks away.

                                 KYLIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hope it was worth your soul.

           EXT. Z-TOWN - EVENING

           Ned paces back and forth outside of Clever’s tent.  Clever 
           emerges with a huge smile on his face.

                                 NED
                        Finally...  I thought you were dead 
                        or something.

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                        Urrrrgggh...

                                 NED
                        Right, Urgh.  But what’s the deal, 
                        where can I get some brains?
                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE
                        Urrrrgghh...

                                 NED
                        C’mon!  What’s the matter with you?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Brain-freeze.

           Ned turns to see another zombie with the gift of speech. 

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Urgggh..  Ate too much brains.

                                 NED
                        How long is he gonna be like that?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Urgh?  Three years?

                                 NED
                        From eating one tiny brain?  

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                             (shrugs)
                        Three days?

                                 NED
                        Urrrrggghh!!  
                             (surprised at himself)
                        Jesus.  
                             (beat, thinking)
                        Hey, you have any idea how to score 
                        some brains?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Sure!

           A smiling Clever #2 stands and stares at Ned.

                                 NED
                        Can you tell me?
                             (off his vacant stare)
                        Where I can find some brains?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Oh.  Urggh.  Come.

           Clever #2 turns toward the center of camp and starts doing 
           the zombie-shuffle.

           Ned tries to walk slowly beside him, but the pace is 
           excruciatingly slow.

                                 NED
                        Can you hurry it up a bit?

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Urgh...  This is me running.

           Ned rolls his eyes and the pair make their way through camp.
           To the strains of the Platoon theme, Samuel Barber’s “Adagio 
           for Strings”, we see the desperate state of the zombie 
           population interred in the camp.  We see zombies sitting 
           around, eyes blank, zonked out after a meal of fresh brains.  
           We see zombies gnawing on the skulls of rats and squirrels.  
           We see zombies lying on the ground, rail-thin and listless.

           INT. PARKER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Shooter and Peg sit on the couch behind TV tables holding 
           thick juicy steaks, as Dag descends from the stairs in a 
           hoodie and jeans.

                                 SHOOTER
                             (holding the Tivo remote)
                        Where’re you off to?

                        The Eustaces.

                             (surprised)
                        You’re going to the meeting?

                                 SHOOTER
                        That meeting is a bad idea.  

                                 DAG
                        I’m actually just checking to see 
                        if they’d found Chaz Jr.

                                 SHOOTER
                        Chaz Jr. is not your 
                        responsibility, son.  Why not take 
                        a load off, watch CSI with us?  

           Dag stands, unsure.  

                                 SHOOTER (CONT’D)
                             (at TV)
                        What the heck?

                                 PEG
                        What is it?

                                 SHOOTER
                        Dang Tivo’s gone haywire.  

                                 PEG
                             (nervous)
                        It taped the show, though, right?  
                        We’ve still got the show.

                                 SHOOTER
                        I don’t know dear.
                             (at Tivo)
                        God dangit.

                             (frantic)
                        Shooter, please tell me we’re not 
                        missing CSI.

                                 SHOOTER
                        Peg, dangit.  Frozen piece of crap.

           Dag slips out of the house, not hanging around for that.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Dag pulls the Parker’s beat up Pontiac to the curb beside the 
           insane line of cars parked outside the Eustace residence.  

           He hops out and heads down the block towards the house.  

           Right at the front door he loses his nerve and does an about 
           face and heads back to his car.  Before he gets very far, the 
           front door swings open.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Chaz Jr.?  Is that you?

           Dag stops, punches himself in the leg and turns.

                                 DAG
                        No ma’am.  My name is Dag Parker.  
                        I came because I heard -- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh.  You’re here for the meeting...  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EUSTACE HOUSE

           Charlotte escorts Dag through the house by the elbow.

                                 DAG
                        I was wondering if you’d heard from 
                        Chaz Jr.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (anxious)
                        He’s been gone since last night.  
                        We’re worried he might have tried 
                        to be a hero.

                                 DAG
                        Hero?

           KITCHEN

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You see it’s his brother.  We 
                        recently discovered he’s a touch 
                        mentally disabled, and he wandered 
                        outside unattended.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                        We’re worried Chaz Jr. went after 
                        him and ran into a vampire.  In his 
                        state, he’d be defenseless.

                                 DAG
                        But vampires don’t attack humans.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You haven’t heard?  They’ve broken 
                        the truce!  Animals.  

           They arrive at the top of the basement stairs.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        They’re all down there.  

           BASEMENT

           Dag arrives in the basement to find it jam-packed with red-
           faced humans, all listening closely to the Senator, who 
           stands before them, sleeves rolled-up, mid-barn-burner.

                                 SENATOR
                        This is precisely the opportunity 
                        those icy blood-suckers have been 
                        waiting for!  They know full well 
                        our attention is diverted, our 
                        defenses spread thin, and our 
                        resolve weakened.  
                             (beat)
                        Gentlemen I stand before you and 
                        tell you that I am privy to top-
                        level intel that screams beyond a 
                        shadow of a doubt that the vampire 
                        attack is imminent.  If we wait for 
                        them to strike first, we’ll be too 
                        late.  We must attack preemptively.

           A roar of approval issues up from the crowd.

                        Now, my friends in Washington 
                        assure me that meetings just like 
                        this one are going on in towns all 
                        across this great nation, and we 
                        will not be alone in this, our 
                        moment, of triumph and glory.

           A second roar of approval springs forth.

                        And I swear, as God is my witness, 
                        if those undead fascists think they 
                        can break the Oslo Accord and get 
                        away with it, well, they’ve got 
                        another thing coming, don’t they?

                        some horrible, evil, God forsaken 
                        vampire is sucking the last of his

           INT. BLOOD BANK - NIGHT

           In a scene all too similar to the one we just left, a large 
           gathering of vampires sits and listens to Mr. Keller.

           Near the back of the room, Petra leans against the wall 
           scanning the crowd for the face of Milan Pinache.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Thirty years ago, my father, in his 
                        infinite wisdom, decided peace, 
                        assimilation and conscripted blood 
                        donation was a better answer than 
                        domination and enslavement.  We all 
                        know where that got him...  
                             (beat)
                        Murdered!  Staked through the heart 
                        in a Bed Bath and Beyond by a quote 
                        unquote deranged assassin.  Tell 
                        me, do you believe a two thousand 
                        year-old vampire could be felled by 
                        an underemployed bathmat-salesman? 
                             (the crowd chortles)
                        No!  The humans had the will my 
                        father lacked, and given that 
                        opportunity they did not blink.

           Petra finally locates Milan near the front of the room.

                                 PETRA
                             (whisper shouting)
                        Milan!  Milan!

           Milan turns, sees Petra, and his shoulders visibly slump.  He 
           turns back to Mr. Keller.
                                 MR. KELLER
                        I ask you, if we’re so assimilated, 
                        why hold a humans only meeting?  If 
                        we’re so accepted, why hasn’t a 
                        single human shown up for their 
                        appointed blood donation?  I’ll 
                        tell you why: because assimilation 
                        and conscripted donorship was never 
                        a solution.  It was a tactic. 

                                 PETRA
                        Milan!

           The vampires nearest to Petra all turn and SHUSH her.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        Shush yourselves.

           Milan doesn’t even turn to look.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        Delay.  Lay low.  Like a coiled 
                        cobra, waiting for the next 
                        opportunity.  The alien arrival, 
                        coincidental... or orchestrated... 
                        is just such an opportunity.  

                                 PETRA
                        Milan!

           This time the vampires turn and bare their fangs at her with 
           a HISS, Petra gets the message and heads out the door.

                                 MR. KELLER
                        I stand before you, my proud undead 
                        brethren, and beg you not to make 
                        the same mistake my father made.  
                        The time to act is now. 
                             (the crowd hums approval)
                        We must thin the herd, corral the 
                        survivors, and finally seize 
                        control of the one resource we 
                        require to rule uncontested.  
                             (the hum becomes a cheer)
                        The reward for action, eternal 
                        paradise.  The punishment for 
                        failure, eternal damnation.

           The vampires rise as one, ready for blood.

           EXT. BLOOD BANK - LATER

           Milan and Mr. Keller walk down the front steps together.  
           Petra, who’s been waiting outside, jogs over.

                                 PETRA
                        Milan.

                                 MR. KELLER
                             (irked)
                        Who is this?  What is this?
                                 MILAN
                        It’s nothing.

                                 MR. KELLER
                             (walking away)
                        Deal with it.

           Petra, god bless her poor recently undead soul, sees the 
           writing on the wall but is in complete and total denial.

                                 PETRA
                        I think there’s something wrong 
                        with your phone, I’ve been trying 
                        you all night.

                                 MILAN
                        Yeah, Petra, look...  The thing is, 
                        with this whole alien thing, and 
                        the coming apocalypse, I’m not 
                        really gonna have time --

                                 PETRA
                        I can wait.  I mean, we have all 
                        eternity, right?

           Milan frowns, eyes Mr. Keller who is standing at the 
           passenger door of Milan’s hearse, glowering at him.

                                 MILAN
                        Thing is Petra, I’m just not that 
                        into you.

           Petra’s face when Milan says this, oh my god.

                                 PETRA
                        Just not that into me?  
                             (would die if she could)
                        Just not that into me?

                                 MILAN
                        Petra chill.  Don’t make a scene.

                                 PETRA
                        Don’t make a sc --  I’M A VAMPIRE!!  
                        My soul is undead!  For all 
                        eternity!  Don’t make a scene!?  

           It would appear Petra intends to make a scene.  A big one.

           Milan shoots out a hand and clamps it over Petra’s mouth.

                                 MILAN
                        Chill, or I’ll rip your face off.

           Petra breathes deeply through her nose and stares at Milan 
           with wild rage.  

                                 MILAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you chill?
           Petra nods and Milan releases his grasp.  Petra immediately 
           opens her mouth to resume said scene, but stops when Milan 
           moves to clamp her face again.

                                 PETRA
                             (beat, calmer)
                        Just tell me why.  Why did you 
                        sleep with Lorelei, but bite me?

           Milan offers up a Billy-Zabka-worthy evil smile.

                                 MILAN
                        Lorelei is a hot blond with huge 
                        tits.  She's like a Playboy cover 
                        girl.  I’m having sex with that.

                                 PETRA
                        But you said I was beautiful.  You 
                        said we’d be together forever.

                                 MILAN
                        I see veins like that, I say a lot 
                        of things.  It's that pale skin, P, 
                        you're like a walking pop machine. 

                                 PETRA
                        And now I'm a vampire.

                                 MILAN
                             (dismissively)
                        You could have said no.

           That’s it, Petra, fangs out, lunges for Milan, only to be 
           snared, mid-lunge, by the twisted claw of Mr. Keller.

           Without a moment’s thought, he hurls Petra across the lawn, 
           THROUGH the SIDE of the car parked behind Milan’s and out the 
           other SIDE, where she rolls to a stop across the street.  

                                 MR. KELLER
                        When I say deal with it.  
                             (yanks him close, evil)
                        Deal with it.

                                 MILAN
                        Yes, sir.  

           The pair make their way down the sidewalk, as Petra hoists 
           herself to a leaning position and spits out a mouthful of 
           broken glass.  Any human would be ridiculously dead.

                                 MILAN (CONT’D)
                        See Petra, being a vampire ain’t 
                        all bad.  

           We settle on Petra’s sad, sad face as Milan offers one last 
           line of encouragement.  

                                 MILAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ll figure it out...  Just give 
                        it a couple hundred years.
           EXT. Z-TOWN - NIGHT

           FROM ABOVE, we see that Z-Town is oddly quiet.  Zooming down 
           to ground level we focus on one large shack at the center of 
           the camp.

           INT. LARGE SHACK - Z-TOWN

           Inside, we see that we’ve arrived at the secret zombie 
           version of the town hall gathering.  

           Ned and Clever #2 sit near the back.  Standing at the front 
           of the shack is a big bald zombie, the head zombie, the 
           CLEVEREST ZOMBIE of them all.  

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        We have no brains.

                                 ZOMBIE CHORUS
                        Urgggh!

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        My brother, the guard who brings us 
                        morgue brains, didn’t bring us 
                        morgue brains today.

                                 ZOMBIE CHORUS
                        URRGGGHH!

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        I don’t know what to do.

                                 ZOMBIE CHORUS
                        Urrrghh.

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        Maybe...  No.

           Cleverest stops and thinks, or whatever it is zombie’s do.

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE (CONT’D)
                        I really want brains.

                                 CLEVER ZOMBIE #2
                        Sure.  
                             (pointing)
                        He’s right there.

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        Urgh.  Could be something to do 
                        with the, urgh, space ships.

                             (exasperated)
                        Could be?
                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        Urrrggh!!

                                 NED
                             (to Clever #2)
                        No wonder you guys are locked up.

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        URGGHH!!

           The other zombies agree.  Urgh.  

                                 NED
                        Do you know where your brother is?  

           Cleverest squints at Ned, confused.

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                        Did you ask one of the other guards 
                        where he was?

           Cleverest perks up.  This one he knows!

                                 CLEVEREST ZOMBIE
                        Urggh.  No guards to ask.

                                 NED
                             (stunned)
                        There’s no one guarding the gate?

           Cleverest squints once more in confusion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN GATE - Z-TOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           Walking briskly, Ned arrives at the abandoned Z-Town gate and 
           takes a look at the massive iron chain that holds the door 
           shut.  It’s not even locked.

                                 NED
                             (pulling off the chain)
                        Unbelievable.

           Ned heaves open the heavy metal gate and strides on through, 
           followed about a minute later by the entire zombie horde.  

           POST-APOCALYPSE

           EXT. BACKYARD - MILLER FARM - DAY

           Dag remains on top of Petra, with Ned Urgghhing them to move, 
           as the aliens tread up the hill to vaporize them.

                                 PETRA
                        What do we do?
                                 DAG
                        I...  Uh...  I...

                                 NED
                        Urrrggghh!!  

           The aliens are getting closer.  What are they gonna do?

           An idea!

           Dag reaches down, briefly exposing Petra’s unprotected 
           vampire arms to the sun.  She screams as he rips his shirt 
           and hoodie off in one go, up and over his head and down and 
           over Petra’s, covering her in his inside out sweatshirt.

           Next comes Dag’s pants, which he unbuckles and yanks down 
           over his ankles and right back up over Petra’s.  

           She’s shielded!  But...

           Dag’s naked.  Buck naked.  Totally nudie.

                                 PETRA
                        Dude, ever heard of underwear?

                                 DAG
                        Long story.

                                 PETRA
                        I'm curious.

                                 DAG
                        Now's not really the time.

                                 NED
                        Urrgggh!  Aliens! 

           The aliens are indeed getting closer, but they keep running 
           directly into the cows in their way.  It’s like they have 
           some bizarre inability to see cows.  

                                 DAG
                             (still lying on Petra)
                        We should split up.

                                 PETRA
                        Are you nuts?  Splitting up is 
                        always the exact worst thing to do.

                                 DAG
                        Yes, but I still think we should.

                                 PETRA
                        You just want to split up because 
                        you're naked.

                                 DAG
                        No!
                             (beat)
                        Maybe.
                                 NED
                        He's right.  Urgh... Easier target 
                        together.  And, urgh, if we split 
                        up they'll have to separate.

                                 PETRA
                        Wow, you're really coming along.

           The first alien vaporizer ball erases a semi-circle of dirt 
           just a few feet from their heads.

                                 DAG
                        Boys locker room at Fillmore!  Go!

           Dag doesn’t wait for a counter offer as he leaps off Petra 
           and runs his naked ass over to the apple orchard.

           Another alien vapor ball lands right beside Petra and Ned, 
           cueing their immediate flight.  

           Petra makes for the road on the far side of the farm.

           Ned runs to the river we heard earlier and leaps in, the 
           current carrying him much faster than his zombie feet could.

           As Ned predicted, splitting up proves to be a brilliant idea, 
           as the aliens are stymied by the move and the entire regiment 
           focuses in on only one of the three.  Petra!

           As Ned floats down the river to safety, and Dag remains 
           unseen in the orchard, Petra is in deep doo doo.

           Huge chunks of earth disappear all around her as the aliens 
           lob vapor ball after vapor ball in her direction.

           Dag sees Petra’s plight and biting his lip, he does nothing.

           PETRA

           runs down the hill at accelerated vampire speed, but even 
           still, she’s outnumbered, overwhelmed, without hope.

           A huge bowl of earth disappears right in her path, and Petra 
           falls directly into the massive divot.  She rolls over onto 
           her back and looks up to see three aliens arrive above her.  

           A vapor ball grows in the palm of the middle alien and he 
           raises his arm to dispatch our pale and veiny heroine, when

           THUNK!

           A mysterious PROJECTILE plunks the alien in the noggin, 
           knocking him ass over teakettle.

           The other aliens look at one another and the one on the left 
           raises his hand, which holds a budding vapor ball.

           THWAK!

           Another projectile knocks him to the ground.
           The third alien turns just in time to see

           NAKED DAG

           deliver a ripe red apple about 91 miles an hour directly into 
           his head.  Dag is deadly accurate.  Amazingly accurate.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                             (to Petra)
                        Run!

           Petra doesn’t think twice, leaping out of the hole she’s in 
           and zipping off toward the road.  

           The aliens turn their attention to Dag, sort of.  I mean, the 
           kid is dead to rights, utterly surrounded by aliens, but they 
           don’t seem to see him.

           PLUNK

           Dag knocks over another alien, who falls to the ground 
           rubbing his head in surprise.

           In response, the aliens all raise their palms and fire vapor 
           balls in seemingly random directions.

           Dag cocks his head, confused, relieved, amped.  He rifles an 
           apple off the noggin of an alien at the far end of the group, 
           and the aliens respond by turning and firing in the direction 
           of the fallen alien, the exact wrong direction.

           Dag, still baffled, backs off, silently edging away from the 
           aliens, until he feels safe enough to turn his back and run.

           PRE-APOCALYPSE

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Senator Eustace leads an angry ragtag mob of humans as they 
           march down an utterly deserted street carrying stakes, guns, 
           baseball bats...  whatever they had in their garage.

           EXT. DIFFERENT STREET - SAME TIME

           Ned and his zombie brethren, shuffle slowly down a similarly 
           deserted street, collectively moaning for BRAINS.

           EXT. DIFFERENT STREET - SAME TIME

           Mr. Keller, flanked by Milan and the rest of the town’s 
           vampire population, whip down yet another deserted street.

           OVERHEAD SHOT
           reveals that each group, the humans, the zombies, and the 
           vampires are each on one of three main arteries that feed 
           directly into the park at the center of the Town Square.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MIDNIGHT

           The three groups meet in the middle and 

           IT.  IS.  ON.

           Humans ram spears into the chests of vampires, who burst open 
           like balloons filled with blood.

           SPLOOSH!  

           Others tee off on zombies’ heads with aluminum baseball bats.

           PING!

           Vampires pin humans to the ground, their bodies visibly 
           shriveling as the vampires’ fangs extract the blood from 
           their jugulars.

           THWIP!  

           Others decapitate zombies’ with the ease of children popping 
           the heads off dandelions.

           FWUP!

           Zombies move like a swarm of ants over a fallen bag of bread 
           crumbs, clutching and grabbing at anything they can get their 
           hands on, chomping on heads, arms, feet, whatever.  

           BLUNCH!

           Ned stands off to one side, sitting on the base of the statue 
           and watching the utter madness with cool detachment.

           An anonymous human runs by.

                                 NED
                        Nope.
                             (another)
                        Nope.
                             (another)
                        Nope.

           Then Tony Cerone, garbage-can-lidder and total dick, runs by.

           Ned smiles.

           EXT. MILLER FARM HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Petra wanders aimlessly up the hill.  When she reaches the 
           house she stops and turns.

           PETRA’S POV
           The house has a vantage of the entire town, and we see the 
           alien ships hovering quietly above us, as the 
           human/vampire/zombie war plays out below like a miniaturized 
           LOTR battle.

           Uninterested, lost in her own misery, Petra knocks on the 
           front door of the farm.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - FARM HOUSE

           Petra opens the door and pops her head in the house, the only 
           light coming from the moon and spaceships via the windows.

                                 PETRA
                        Hello?

           Getting no answer, Petra wanders over and watches more of the 
           chaos from one of the windows, then slumps down behind a 
           large plant that stands in the corner.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                             (mocking)
                        I’ve waited centuries for you...  
                        I’m just not that into you...  
                        Lorelei is a big-titted blonde, 
                        you’re all pale and veiny.
                             (freaking out)
                        Pale and veiny?!  Pale and veiny?!
                             (crying, a teenage girl)
                        Stupid boys.  Stupid slut Lorelei.

           INT. PARKER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dag bursts inside, his shirt torn, but his body uninjured.

                        Mom!?  Dad!?  

           INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING

           Dag bounds upstairs and races toward his parent’s bedroom.

                                 DAG
                        Mom?

           INT. DAG’S BEDROOM

           Dag rips open his bedroom door and finds Lorelei, lying on 
           his bed as though it were her own, lit joint in hand.

                                 LORELEI
                        Dude, knock much?

                                 DAG
                        Have you seen my parents?

                        Sure, who do you think rolled this 
                        joint for me?
                             (giggling)
                        No, dipshit, I haven’t seen ‘em.

           Dag races over to the window and looks out.

           VIEW

           A pick-up truck SQUEALS around the corner, a pair of humans 
           SHOOTING MACHINE GUNS from the bed at the supernaturally 
           speedy vampires giving chase.  

           The truck THUMPS into a mass of zombie, loses control and 
           SLAMS into a tree, ejecting both the passengers and sending 
           the gunners in the bed catapulting up into the tree where 
           they’re impaled on jagged branches.

           Dag takes it all in, then pours it all out in one giant BARF.

                        it vodka?  I’d so kill for a V and 
                        T right now.

                                 DAG
                        Lorelei, we gotta get out of here.

                                 LORELEI
                        You stashed it?  Nice.  Screw Chaz 
                        Jr.  You know that guy didn’t 
                        drink?  My body is a temple.  Pfft.

                                 DAG
                        Lorelei, NOW!

           EXT. DAG’S BEDROOM WINDOW

           Dag leads Lorelei out by the hand, where she promptly slips 
           in the puke and slides down the edge of the roof, dragging 
           Dag with her.   

           EXT. LAWN BESIDE PARKER HOUSE

           Lorelei lands with a THUD on the lawn and moans in pain.  She 
           realizes Dag hasn’t landed with a THUD on the lawn.

                                 LORELEI
                        Dag?  Dag?

                                 DAG (O.S.)
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Up here.

           Lorelei looks up to see

           Dag, hanging three feet below the roof, suspended by his 
           tighty-whiteys, which snagged on the corner of the gutter.  
           Uber-wedgie.  

                                 LORELEI
                        Oh shit, dude.

           Dag doesn’t say anything, due to pain, mortification. 

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)
                        That’s like... the greatest thing 
                        ever.

                                 DAG
                        Lorelei, please.  Hurry.

                                 LORELEI
                             (snapping into action)
                        Right, right.  

           Lorelei pulls out her phone and snaps a pic.

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)

                             (tears welling)
                        Lorelei, please.

           Lorelei puts her phone away and crudely tugs at Dag’s feet.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Gentle.  Gennnntlllle!

           She gives a ferocious yank and with a SNAP, Dag breaks free.

           The tighty-whiteys remain dangling from the gutter, intact.

                                 LORELEI
                        How is that even possible?

                                 DAG
                        Lor, let’s go!

                                 LORELEI
                        Jeez, man, where’s the fire?

           BOOM

           A thunderous detonation and accompanying fireball blooms up 
           from somewhere off behind the house.

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)
                             (so stoned)
                        Ooooo!  Pretty!

           Before Dag can correct her, Mr. Keller EXPLODES through the 
           Parker’s downstairs WINDOW, grabs Lorelei by the neck and 
           prepares to guzzle.  

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)
                        Aaahhh!!!!!
           Before Mr. Keller can bite, Senator Eustace drives a stake 
           through his back and out his chest, and Mr. Keller goes 

           SPLOOSH

           bathing Lorelei in blood, Carrie-style.

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)
                        AAAhhh!!!!!

           Before Lorelei can catch her breath, Cleverest Zombie leaps 
           down from fuck-knows-where and lands atop Senator Eustace, 
           chomping apart his face and skull with rapid-fire and savage 

           CHOMPS.

                                 LORELEI (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHH!!!!!

           Before it gets any worse, Dag grabs Lorelei by the wrist and 
           they run off.

           EXT. STREET - DEAD OF NIGHT

           We’ve arrived at the first scene of the movie, with Dag and 
           Lorelei racing up the hill for the farm house, while all 
           around them humans are killing zombies who’re killing 
           vampires who’re killing humans in a massive chain of death.

           INT. FARM HOUSE

           This time, from Petra’s perspective.  The room is chockablock 
           with human-zombie-vampire madness, but Petra crouches in the 
           corner, hiding behind a potted plant.  She doesn’t want 
           anything to do with this.  Until...

           Dag and Lorelei kick open the door and slam it behind them. 

           Petra takes one look at Lorelei and her eyes narrow.  There 
           goes the one bitch on the planet that Petra wouldn’t mind 
           taking for an involuntary blood drive.

           An arm punches through the front door, grabbing Dag.  A 
           vampire nearly bites him but bites the zombie by mistake.  

           Dag and Lorelei make their escape and head for the stairs, 
           but before they make it all the way up, Petra grabs Lorelei 
           by the back of her blood-soaked blond hair.

           A pair of vampires join Petra on the landing, and she 
           attempts to push them away.  She wants Lorelei for her own.

           But now she’s SLAMMED in the back by a leaping Dag, and the 
           pair crash into the wall, CLANGING into the DOORBELLS.

                                                                CUT TO:
           NED’S POV

           as he sits at the kitchen table, a napkin tucked into his 
           shirt, shoveling brain from Tony Cerone’s decapitated head 
           into his mouth with a spoon, completely oblivious to the 
           madness all around him.  And then he finishes the brain.

                                 NED
                        Urrrrggghh!!

           Ned hurls Tony’s empty head across the room, and turns to see 
           the action on the landing, where Dag is kicking vampire ass 
           with the broken doorbell.

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                        Brains!

           Ned rises and heads straight for Dag, who is about to be 
           bitten by a vampire when Lorelei screams and Dag

           DUCKS just as Ned attacks.  He misses Dag and slams into the 
           door-bell speared vampire, sending the vampire and the 
           protruding bell straight into and through the biting vampire. 

           Vampires out of the way, Ned grabs Dag’s head and prepares to 
           eat his brain, when Petra CLANGS his skull with the other 
           DOORBELL.  

           Petra then punches Dag in the chest, launching him back up to 
           the top of the steps, leaving Lorelei finally alone.  

                                 LORELEI
                        Dag!

           Petra shuts her up, plunging her fangs into her neck and 
           mainlining the blood from her jugular.  Yum!

           Dag attempts his second leap from the top step, Petra catches 
           him, gets back to drinking Lorelei, gets interrupted by Ned, 
           who yanks her head back, and Dag, still held aloft by Petra, 
           lashes out at anything near, kicking Ned in the head.

           It’s Petra on Dag on Ned on Petra.  Then

           WHITE LIGHT 

           floods through the windows and we

                                                          FADE TO WHITE

           POST-APOCALYPSE

           INT. MILLARD FILLMORE HIGH

           Petra arrives, still wearing Dag’s inside-out clothing over 
           her own, and makes her way through the empty, half vaporized 
           hallways.  Huge circular sections of lockers, walls and 
           classrooms are simply missing from the structure.  
           Petra pushes through the staircase doors.

           INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - MILLARD FILLMORE HIGH

           Petra opens the locker room doors and through a perfectly 
           round six-foot-wide hole in a wall of lockers, spots Ned, one 
           row over, curled up in a ball, sweating and shivering.  

                                 PETRA
                        Whoa.

           Petra steps around the wall of lockers and approaches Ned.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        You alright over there?

           Ned looks up, eyes sunken, face ashen.

                                 NED
                             (shuddering)
                        I think...  I think...  Urgggh...  
                        I think I’m having withdrawals.  

                                 PETRA
                        Withdrawals from what?

                                 NED
                        From brains.  From brains, I think.

                                 PETRA
                        That’s messed up.  

                                 NED
                        I’ll be okay.  I just need some 
                        brains, you know?  Hey, urgh, you 
                        got any?

                                 PETRA
                        Brains?  

                                 NED
                        Yeah, I just need like a taste.  
                        Urgh, just a smidge.

                                 PETRA
                             (backing away)
                        Sorry, dude.  All out.  
                             (switching gears)
                        Did Dag make it?

                                 NED
                             (not looking up)
                        Showers.

           INT. SHOWERS

           Petra steps into the shower room and sees Dag in a door-less 
           stall toward the back, washing the caked blood from his hair.
           She watches him for a moment, enjoying the view, then 
           whistles a perfect construction worker cat call.  

           Dag sees Petra and immediately turns around in shame.

                                 PETRA
                             (smirking)
                        I thought you were supposed to be 
                        hairless?

                                 DAG
                        I was, but --  Would you just give 
                        me back my fricking clothes?

           INT. LOCKER ROOM

           Dag arrives, his clothes clinging to his damp frame.  

                                 DAG
                             (to Petra)
                        Glad you made it.

           Dag approaches Petra and they share an absurdly awkward hug.  

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                             (moving on, seeing Ned)
                        What’s up with him?

                                 PETRA
                        Jonesing for brains.  How’d you 
                        make it out of there?
                             (off his cryptic smile)
                        What?

                                 DAG
                        You guys will never believe it.

           Ned looks up.

                                 PETRA
                        Try us.

                                 DAG
                             (beat, embarrassed)
                        They can’t see you when you’re 
                        naked.

                                 PETRA
                        They can’t see you, or they can’t 
                        see your mini-pez dispenser?

                                 DAG
                        Laugh all you want, but I’m 
                        serious.

                                 PETRA
                             (not believing it)
                        Whatever.  You’re making that up to 
                        get me to take my clothes off.
                                 DAG
                        No.  
                             (beat)
                        Maybe.  

                                 NED
                        It actually makes sense.

           They turn to Ned, who still looks like hell, but who is 
           suddenly focused like a bloodhound.

                                 PETRA
                        How could naked invisibility 
                        possibly make sense?

                                 NED
                        It makes a lot of sense.

           Ned rushes over to the coach’s chalkboard at the back of the 
           locker room.  

                                 PETRA
                        Hello...?  

           Petra looks at Dag who shrugs back at her.  Ned is going 
           crazy at the blackboard, drawing dashes and swirls and 
           hypotenuses of the quadrangles and mathy stuff that’s above 
           the heads of most Ivy League professors.  

           Petra turns and looks at Dag, who looks back at her.

                                 DAG
                        What?

                                 PETRA
                        I felt it, you know.

                                 DAG
                        Felt what?

                                 PETRA
                        Your little pez thingy.  When you 
                        were lying on me.  Poking me.

           Dag flushes cherry red and then goes white with rage.

                                 DAG
                        You know what?  Screw off.  All 
                        I’ve ever done is try to protect 
                        you, and all you ever do is insult 
                        and humiliate me. 

           Dag turns and runs over to the door to the coach’s office and 
           pulls it --  Nope.  Locked.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag...

           He awkwardly runs to another door and tries that.  Nope.
                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        Dag.

           He finally finds an open door and is gone, leaving Petra 
           alone with Ned, who’s still lost in computational bliss.

           INT. BOILER ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Petra pushes open the half-disintegrated door to the boiler 
           room and steps inside.  The room is about three-quarters 
           intact, with the other quarter conspicuously absent.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag?  You in here?  Hello?

           Petra turns to leave.

                        In here.

           There's a METALLIC CLANG, CLANG, CLANG from inside the closed 
           end of the massive, but partially vaporized BOILER.  

                                 PETRA
                        What are you doing in the boiler?

                                 DAG (O.S.)
                        I was hiding.

                        Oh.  
                             (beat)
                        Are you going to come out?

           BOILER

           Dag sits at the bottom of the boiler, the opening a good 
           fifteen feet off the ground.  He jumps, attempting to grab 
           the lip, but he comes nowhere close and slides back down. 

                                 DAG
                        No.

                        C’mon Dag, you’re being ridiculous.

                        No, no, no, ohhhh, shit.

                                 PETRA
                        What?

                                 DAG
                        Now we’re both stuck in here.
           Petra looks up at the lip way up high and laughs.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        This is funny to you?

                                 PETRA
                        Um, kind of?

           Dag looks at her, ready to flip out, then, with a giggle, the 
           tension starts to flow out of him and he laughs with her.

           LOCKER ROOM

           Back in the locker room, Ned has filled an entire side of the 
           blackboard with computations.  In a near fugue state, he 
           flips the board and keeps going.

           BOILER

           Petra stands on Dag’s shoulders and reaches for the lip.  
           She’s close, but can’t quite make it.

           While she tries, Dag sneaks a few peeks up her skirt.

                                 PETRA
                        It’s no use.

                                 DAG
                        Keep trying, I can hold you.

                                 PETRA
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        I’m sure you can.

           Dag lets her down and Petra slides down and leans against the 
           wall of the boiler.  

                                 DAG
                             (pounding on the boiler)
                        Ned!  NED!!!  NNNNNNERD!!!!!

           Petra laughs and Dag slides down and leans opposite her.

                                 PETRA
                        Somewhere he’s urrgghhing.  

                                 DAG
                        Urrrrghhh!

           Petra laughs again and they smile at each other.  Then Dag’s 
           face changes.

                                 PETRA
                        What?

                                 DAG
                        I almost died back there.
           Dag’s face wrinkles up in adolescent processing mode.

                        And what did you see?

           Dag exhales deeply, and then, starts crying.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                        I am telling you.  I didn’t see 
                        anything.  I’m like the least 
                        important person in the world.  I 
                        don’t know anything.  I don’t do

           Petra crawls over and climbs onto Dag, straddling him.

                        What are you doing?

                        And now you’re really growing on 
                        me.

           Dag looks more terrified than he did facing alien death.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        Why are you so scared?

                        I have news for you: neither have 
                        I.  

           Dag opens his mouth to reply.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        And don’t, do not, say, “Really?”

           Petra leans over and kisses Dag, who kisses her back.  

                                 DAG
                        I was gonna say really.

           She places a finger over his lips and takes his hand and 
           places it on her breast.  They kiss some more, and then Dag 
           shudders violently.  He rests his head on her shoulder.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)

                        laid eyes on.

           Petra goes flush.  Her breathing increases.  She looks deep 
           into Dag's eyes and begins grinding herself on top of him.
                                 DAG (CONT’D)

           Petra grasps Dag around the neck, closes her eyes and grinds 
           and grinds and grinds. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ned draws diagrams on the board, accompanied by the 
           unmistakable sounds of a FEMALE ORGASM.  

           INT. BOILER - SOMETIME LATER

           Dag leans against the wall, Petra draped across his chest.  
           Dag playfully curls Petra’s hair around his finger.

                        sudden.  C’mon.

           Petra leans over and catches Dag when he jumps, then slings 
           him over the wall of the boiler like he’s a walnut.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM

           Dag and Petra arrive in the locker room looking like exactly

                        flood of TV waves beamed out across 
                        galaxy.  They think we communicate

                        of the stars close enough to earth, 
                        and cross-reference that with which

           Dag holds the stairway door for Ned and Petra and the trio 
           walk down the hall.

                                 DAG
                        So if the aliens are after Nash

                        grabbed Don Johnson and gotten the 
                        hell out of here.

                                 NED
                        Because they don’t know Don 
                        Johnson.  They can’t even see him.  
                        They only know the TV wave version 
                        of Don Johnson.

                        And why aren’t we going to Don 
                        Johnson’s house?

                                 NED
                        Because, excluding by necessity the 
                        distinct possibility that he’s 
                        already been vaporized, we know 
                        that Don Johnson is at the country 
                        store via the process of induction.  

           Dag shoots a glance over at Petra who mouths the word Nerd.

                        Be that as it may, he is, in fact, 
                        a dairy farmer.

           As they move down the hall, they pass the A/V room.  Through 
           the windowed door, we see an alien watching TV.

           As they pass, the alien turns its head and sees them.

                        milk.

                        Conclusion: Don Johnson is totally 
                        motorboating the store owner’s 
                        wife.

           METALLIC CLANK

           arrives behind them, and they all turn to see a vapor ball 
           rolling right for them.

           Petra grabs Dag in one hand and Ned in the other and leaps 
           high in the air, over the reach of the detonating vapor ball, 
           and over the alien’s head, landing all three of them directly 
           behind him.

           The alien whirls, and raises an arm to shoot another ball.

           Dag charges him, but the alien tosses him aside as if he were 
           a toddler, sending him sliding into the hole in the tile 
           floor left by the first vapor ball.

           Petra is stronger and faster, but her assault is repelled 
           after a few relatively ineffective punches and kicks.  

           The alien tosses Petra aside and raises his arm once more, 
           aiming his palm and the growing vapor ball directly at Ned, 
           who cowers in fear against a wall of lockers.  

           Dag grabs at the first thing he finds, a chunk of concrete 
           from the destroyed floor, and at the precise moment the alien 
           moves to release the ball, Dag zips the concrete at the back 
           of the alien’s head.  

           STRIKE

           But too late...  As the alien falls, unconscious, the vapor 
           BALL CLANGS to the floor and rolls straight for Ned, who’s 
           still pinned to the wall.  He curls up tight, raising a hand 
           in a useless defensive gesture as the ball rolls to a stop 
           right in front of him.  

           He waits for the inevitable.  

           And waits.  

           And waits.  

           And then peeks, curious.  The ball is still there, only it 
           never went poof.  Ned starts cackling hysterically.

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                        A dud!  A goddamn dud!  Do you 
                        believe it?
           Petra and Dag race over to Ned, amazed, relieved, curious.

           The ball sits there, a glowing, ethereal mass of alien magic.

           Dag reaches out a finger to touch it.

                                 NED (CONT’D)

                        It is, but we don’t know what kind 
                        of dud, or if it’s still live or 
                        anything about it.

                        I bet the alien has to consciously 
                        set it off.

           Petra scoops up the ball, which seems dense in her hands, but 
           light in the air.  Dag holds out his hands and Petra hands 
           him the ball.

           Ned cuts himself off as Dag tosses the ball to him and Ned 
           attempts to catch it.  Attempts...  and - See: Nerd - fails.

           The ball activates, and Ned, along with a massive chunk of 
           the floor and lockers behind him vanishes into thin air.

                        Okay, everybody get naked.

           EXT. STREET - BROAD DAYLIGHT

           Dag, Ned and Petra walk along the the street, buck naked.  We 
           see them shoulders up, behind cars, trees, etc.

           There are aliens everywhere, but they’re completely oblivious 
           to the presence of the three naked teenagers.

                                 PETRA
                        Man, this is totally bizarre.

                        Um, ya think?

           They walk on in silence for half a block.

                                 NED
                        I thought you were supposed to be 
                        hairless?

                        For f’s sake...  What happened to

                                 NED
                        I thought that only applied to her.  

           They watch, as an alien walks right smack into a tree.

                        Dag, I couldn’t help but notice 
                        that when you were throwing apples 
                        at the aliens you kept hitting them 
                        directly in the head.

                        And when you threw that chunk of 
                        concrete you nailed him dead on.

                        So, logic tells me, beaning Chaz 
                        Jr. probably wasn’t accidental.

           Dag goes silent, totally and completely busted.

                        brother was a complete a-hole.

                                 DAG
                        Agreed.  But you should know that 
                        Chaz Jr. really cared about you.

                        Your mom said you disappeared after 
                        the aliens arrived.  She said Chaz 
                        Jr. went out and tried to find you.

                        That’s what she told you?  Those 
                        morons.  I traded Chaz Jr. to a

                        and a spoonful of his brains.

                        was the worst.  Did you know he 
                        made me do all his homework since 
                        first grade and never once said 
                        thanks?  And then when I got one 
                        bad grade he tried to get me sent 
                        to West Point.

                        thought it would get him a shot at 
                        the presidency.  Him and that dick-

           Don Johnson and Daisy sit in a small hidden area at the back 
           of the store room.  It’s a love shack, with a bed, a mini-
           fridge and not much else.

           Dag, Petra and Ned wander around the store.  Ned stops in 
           front of a rack of clothing.

                        Check it out!  Organic cotton!

           Don Johnson emerges from the back room.

                                 DON JOHNSON 
                        Dag?

           INT. COUNTRY STORE - LATER

           Dag and Petra are clad in identical outfits of what can best 
           be described as green eco-friendly organic slut dresses.

           Petra looks smokin hot.  Dag looks like a trannie.

                                 PETRA
                             (off Dag’s look)

                        So let me get this straight, you 
                        think an entire race of aliens 
                        packed themselves into space ships 
                        and flew twenty-five million miles 
                        to earth just to try to get more 
                        Nash Bridges?
                             (Dag and Petra nod)
                        Sounds plausible to me.  So what’s 
                        the plan?

                        him.

           Petra heads into the back room and both Dag and Don Johnson 
           ogle her ass as she goes.

                        No!  Ned, no!  Bad Ned!  Bad!

           Dag races into the back room. Don Johnson, a pussy, takes his 
           time.  By the time he arrives, Dag reemerges.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        What the hell’s going on back

                        Looks like he got all of it.

                        All of what?  Out of my way.

           Don Johnson pushes Dag aside and storms into the back room.

           INT. STORE ROOM

           Sitting on the floor of the store room is Ned, zonked out.  
           Beside him lies Daisy, now officially all tits and no brains.

                        was the brains of this operation.  
                        He’s gonna be zonked for a week.

           Petra trails off, her knees buckle and she collapses to the 
           floor.  Dag races to her side.

                                 DON JOHNSON

           CLOSE on Petra, who lies on a fold-out chaise lounge.  We 
           MOVE from her face to her arm, where we see a needle 
           connected to a tube, which we FOLLOW up to the counter where 
           it connects to another needle that Don Johnson is preparing 
           to insert into a vein in Dag’s arm.

                        a heroin-addict named Therese.  He

                             (adoringly)
                        You saved me... again...

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Hot damn, son, you are in business!

                                 PETRA
                        I...  that was a bad place...

                                 DAG
                        It doesn’t matter.  You’re ok, and 
                        we’ll never let that happen again.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag, listen...  I’ve done bad 
                        things.  Lorelei.  Mrs. Miller.  

                                 DAG
                        I don’t care about that.  

                                 PETRA
                        But I shouldn’t have bitten them.  
                        It was wrong.

                                 DAG
                        And I shouldn’t have deliberately 
                        beaned Chaz Jr.  We all do bad 
                        things, Pet.  It’s what we do after 
                        that matters.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        He’s right.  I used to take dumps 
                        in Cheech’s trailer.  But the past 
                        is the past.  So what do you say we 
                        focus on saving the world!

                                 PETRA
                        Sure, but we still need a plan.

                                 DAG
                             (the steely eyed hero)
                        I’ve got a plan.  

           INT. STORE ROOM - COUNTRY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Petra and Don Johnson stand and watch while Dag pokes at the 
           completely incapacitated Ned with a stick.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        This, is your plan?  
                                 DAG
                        You got a better idea?

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Than poking the zombie with a 
                        stick?  

                                 PETRA
                        I have an idea.

                                 DAG
                        You do?

                                 PETRA
                        Don’t act so surprised.  I’m flat-
                        chested, remember?  I’m allowed to 
                        think.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Okay, princess...  what’s the big 
                        idea?

           INT. COUNTRY STORE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Dag, Petra and Don Johnson stand around the counter staring 
           at a pair of walkie talkies sitting beside their packaging.

                                 DAG
                        No fricking way.  It’s too 
                        dangerous.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        I like it.  

                                 DAG
                        That’s because you’re a pussy.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Be that as it may, the plan is 
                        sound.

                                 DAG
                        I’ll do it.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag, you’ve saved my life four 
                        times.  One more time and I’ll have 
                        to sleep with you.
                             (off Dag’s devastation)
                        I’m kidding, I’ll still sleep with 
                        you.  But it’s my plan, and it’s my 
                        turn.  

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - AFTERNOON

           Dag, Petra, Ned and Don Johnson walk down the central path.  
           The park is filled with aliens unaware of their presence.  
           Dag, Petra and Ned are all dressed in eco-slut outfits, but 
           Don Johnson wears a comfy-looking T-shirt and jeans combo.

                                 DAG
                        You could have told me Daisy sold 
                        other organic clothing before we 
                        got outside.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Could have... didn’t.

           They arrive at the statue in the center of town.

                                 PETRA
                        Alright, it’s go time.

                                 DAG
                        Petra, please, you can still change 
                        your mind.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag!  

                                 DAG
                        Fine.  
                             (grabbing Petra)
                        You better not die.

                                 PETRA
                        I’ll do my best.

           Dag leans over and gives Petra a nice kiss.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Come on bro, you can do better than 
                        that.  You might never see her 
                        again.  

           Dag glares at Don Johnson, then turns back to Petra and now 
           we see a kiss worthy of the moment.  

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                             (to Ned)
                        Nice, huh?

           Ned gives Don Johnson a whacked out Urgggh, and Don Johnson 
           steps back in fear.  

                                 PETRA
                        Okay.  Here goes nothing.

           Petra takes Ned by the hand, leaving Dag and Don Johnson 
           leaning against the base of the statue.

           She leads Ned over to a pair of empty metal GARBAGE CANS, 
           which she picks up and begins to BANG together over her head.   

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        Hey aliens!  Hey you silver 
                        bitches!  Come and get us!
           In a flash, a dozen aliens turn and raise their arms.

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                             (to Dag)
                        See you on the other side...

           The vapor balls converge on Petra and Ned, and in a flash, 
           they’re gone, replaced by a giant hole in the ground.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Wow! Those guys are dead, for sure.

           Dag ignore’s him, focusing instead on the walkie talkie he 
           pulls from beneath the built in bra of his slut dress.

                                 DAG
                        Come on, come on, come on...
                             (beat)
                        Please, please, please...

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        I’m telling you kid, they’re 
                        wasted.  Wow!

                                 DAG
                        Shut up.  Petra, come in...  Are 
                        you there?  Petra...  Please...

           Dag is desperate, losing his mind.

                                 DAG (CONT’D)
                        Petra, come in...  Petra...  
                        Petra...

           Don Johnson leans over and turns the volume dial on the 
           walkie talkie from zero to ten.

                                 PETRA (FILTERED)
                        Dag?  You there?  Dag?

                                 DAG
                        Petra!  Petra!!  I’m here!

                                 PETRA (FILTERED)
                        Dag!  I’m in the stadium.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - SAME TIME

           TIGHT on Petra and Ned, who stand in the upper deck of a 
           massive football stadium.  

                                 PETRA
                        We’re all in the stadium.  Every 
                        damn one of us!

           PULL BACK to reveal that the stadium is filled to capacity 
           with humans, vampires and zombies.
           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Dag and Don Johnson make their way to the football stadium.  

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        So, seeing as it's the end of the 
                        days or whatever, let's say you and 
                        me talk straight. 

                                 DAG
                        You're a douche.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Well then.  That’s pretty straight.

                                 DAG
                        You made like a million dollars 
                        from a hit TV show -

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        More like twenty, from two hit TV 
                        shows.

                                 DAG
                        Whatever.  You're rich.  Why'd you 
                        have to buy the farm next door to 
                        my family's and run them out of 
                        business?

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        First of all, money can't buy you 
                        happiness, Dag.  Only fame can do 
                        that.  Second, I hate to be the one 
                        to break this to you but your 
                        family hasn't been in the milk 
                        business for fifteen years.

                                 DAG
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Rich people, like me, have a habit 
                        of paying people to manage their 
                        financial affairs.  Accountants, 
                        business managers, etc.  The land I 
                        bought was the last working dairy 
                        farm in the county, kid.  Your 
                        parents stopped milking their cows 
                        long before I got on the scene.

           Dag looks at Don Johnson with uncertainty.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Ask 'em, yourself.  I may be a lot 
                        of things, Dag --

                                 DAG
                        Like a wife-porker.

                                 DON JOHNSON

                        I'm not lying, Dag.  You don't have 
                        to like me…

                                 DAG
                        I don't.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        But I'm just a small-town boy made-
                        phenomenally, phenomenally good.  
                        I'd never deliberately run some 
                        local couple out of business.

                        Fine.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Now, about that dog of yours.

                                 DAG
                        Oh, my god.  My dog, that you’re so 
                        convinced is attacking your cows?  
                             (beat)
                        It's a Jack Russell.

                        You don't say.

                                 DAG
                        He’s fifteen pounds soaking wet.

                             (beat)
                        So who the hell is eating my cows? 

           EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

           Dag and Don Johnson approach the stadium, a brightly lit 
           beacon on an overcast night.

           The main entrance is guarded by aliens facing inward, who 
           take no notice of the organically clad Dag and Don Johnson as 
           they slip past them and into the arena.

           INT. UPPER DECK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Dag and Don Johnson make their way through the masses of 
           humans, vampires and zombies, all of whom, for the moment at 
           least, are peacefully coexisting as prisoners in the stadium. 

           Dag tugs Don Johnson by the elbow, as he glad-hands and winks 
           at his many admirers.

           Dag sees Petra up ahead, standing with Ned, General Clark and 
           Dag’s parents.  Dag races to them, kisses Petra, and bear 
           hugs his mom and dad.  
                                 DAG
                             (looking around)
                        No one’s fighting.

                                 PETRA
                        You can thank General Clark for 
                        that.  He took charge and brought 
                        everything back to normal.  

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                             (off his dress)
                        Hi there, ma’am.  

                                 DAG
                        I’m a boy.

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                        Sir, then.  I hear you might have a 
                        solution for our alien trouble?

                                 DAG
                        Ned figured it out.  Then he ate 
                        Daisy.

                                 GENERAL CLARK
                        We can worry about all that later.  
                        Right now I’ve got you set up in 
                        the public address box.  You ready 
                        Mr. Johnson? 

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        As soon as we get through hair and 
                        makeup.
                             (off their looks)
                        You can’t expect me to go on 
                        without hair and makeup?

           Dag punches Don Johnson in the shoulder.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Ou!  Fine.  But SAG’s gonna hear 
                        about this.

           INT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

           With humans, zombies and vampires occupying the stands, and 
           aliens guarding them from the field, the MASSIVE VIDEO 
           SCREENS at either end zone BURSTS into life.  

           VIDEO SCREEN

           Don Johnson sits, facing the camera, smiling brightly.  

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Greetings, alien friends.  This is 
                        Don Joh - Ur, Nash Bridges!

           At the sight of a two-hundred foot Nash Bridges, the aliens 
           go positively bonkers.  All of them, immediately, rush to 
           each endzone and stare up in rapt attention.  
           INTERCUT PUBLIC ADDRESS BOX

           Where Dag stands behind a camera pointed right at Don 
           Johnson, who sits on a chair overlooking the field.  

                                 DON JOHNSON
                             (to Dag)
                        Whoa!  These guys should be Emmy 
                        voters.  

           Dag throws a pencil at his head.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Good aliens, welcome to our fine 
                        planet.  I understand that you have 
                        come because you wish to see more 
                        of me.

           A huge chorus of PI-PUKS and PU-PIKS erupts from the alien 
           ranks, which are rapidly growing in number as more and more 
           aliens flood into the stadium and gather on the field.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        And I wish to show you more.  Trust 
                        me, none of this would have been 
                        necessary if the goddamn suits over 
                        at CBS hadn't - 
                             (a pencil hits his head)
                        But that is neither here nor there.  
                        Great aliens, if you would like to 
                        see more Nash Bridges, all you need 
                        to do is let my people go.
                             (another pencil)
                        And by people, I refer to not just 
                        humans, but all the beings of 
                        earth.  For this is not a human 
                        earth, or a vampire earth, or a 
                        zombie earth.  It is one earth for 
                        all kinds.  
                             (beat)
                        Including yours.
                             (another pencil)
                        What?  There are millions of those 
                        things.  I could do a 10-share!
                             (another)
                        Hit me all you want, but that one 
                        earth shit goes for them, too.  
                             (back to the camera)
                        Please, alien friends, stay, join 
                        us, and live in peace and plenty.

           PI-PUKS and PU-PIKS a plenty ring out.

           Then, from the center of the field, a gap forms around one 
           beautiful shimmering alien... their leader.  

           He finally speaks, loud enough for the whole stadium to hear. 

                                 ALIEN
                        Benevolent creatures of earth.  
                        Thank you for delivering to us the 
                        great Nash Bridges.  
           The other aliens PI-PUK and PU-PIK agreement.

                                 ALIEN (CONT’D)
                        In return for your generosity, we 
                        offer you this, our greatest gift, 
                        the gift of power.  

           The alien leader produces from his chest a strange, a one-
           foot long dog-bone-shaped object that glows dimly.

                                 ALIEN (CONT’D)
                        This one trillion mega-ton isotopic 
                        oxycniptide will explode in exactly 
                        one minute, giving you enough 
                        radiant energy to power yourselves 
                        for the next thousand years.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                             (on the video screen)
                        Say what?

           The alien sets the square down directly on the fifty yard 
           line and backs away into the mass of aliens on the field.

           INT. PUBLIC ADDRESS BOX

           Don Johnson and Dag exchange worried looks.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Did he just say one trillion mega-
                        ton explosion?

                                 DAG
                        That doesn't sound good.  

                                 NED (O.S.)
                        Urgggh!!

           They turn to see Ned, Petra, General Clark and Dag’s parents, 
           all standing in the box’s doorway.

                                 DAG
                        It’s bad?

                                 NED
                        URRRGGGGHHH!!!!

           ON THE FIELD

           an alien-looking set of spiraling lights clicks down the time 
           until detonation.

                                 DAG
                        What do we do?

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        Don’t look at me, you’re the 
                        director.
           The bone begins to glow brighter and brighter, draining the 
           power from the stadium, from the town, as it sucks in the 
           energy it needs to detonate.  

           The stadium is momentarily thrown into complete darkness, but 
           then the layer of clouds above the stadium finally breaks, 
           revealing a perfectly full moon that illuminates the arena.

           And Dag begins to scream.

                                 DON JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        You alright, hombre?

           Dag screams and scratches at his body, which hurts all over.

                                 PETRA
                        Dag!

           He looks down at his hands, which begin sprouting claws and 
           tufts of hair.  

           Then his knees SNAP and RESET in grotesque round arcs.

           Then his shoulders curl and his mouth swells into a snout and 
           we see that he is at long last mature enough for the 
           transformation his parents have long been hinting at.  

           Little Dag is no longer a boy, he's finally 

           A werewolf!

                                 PETRA (CONT’D)
                        Dag?

           With a ferocious howl, Dag licks Petra’s face, then bounds 
           out of the box’s window and leaps down to the deck below.  

           Staying in the public address box, we TURN to see

           DAG’S PARENTS

           who have also turned into werewolves.  They’re smiling and 
           hugging, tears in their eyes.  Their little boy is now a man.

           Don Johnson finally solves his mystery.

                                 DON JOHNSON
                        You cow-thieving motherfuckers!!!!

           BACK TO DAG

           who, in a flash, has scooped up the bomb in his jaws and 
           races for the stadium exit at impossible speed.  

           No more than a few seconds later

           KABLOOOOOMMMMM!!!!!!
           An absurdly gigantic explosion occurs just far enough away 
           that no one in the stadium is injured.

           There's nothing but silence in the stadium as all of the 
           earth dwellers breath a huge sigh of relief.  

           Petra looks up at the still billowing plume of fire, tears 
           streaming down her face, and then…

           OUUWOOOOOOOOO!!!!

           A lone wolf, cries out in the distance.  

           Dag made it!

           TITLE OVER

           NOT LONG AFTER

           BACK TO NORMAL

           ISH

           EXT. MILLARD FILLMORE HIGH - MORNING

           Kids, of the human, zombie, vampire AND alien variety all 
           pour into the main doors of the high school.  

           The Parkers pull their Pontiac to the curb and Dag jumps out.

                                 PEG
                        Petra coming over for dinner after 
                        the game tonight?

                                 DAG
                        You bet!  One Don Johnson steak, 
                        extra bloody, por favor.

                                 SHOOTER
                        You got it sport.

           INT. CLASSROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Everyone settles into their seats.  Dag sits next to Petra, 
           who sits next to a zombie (and his Special Ed aide), who sits 
           next to an alien...  It’s one big happy family.

           A teacher stands at the front of the room beside a TV 
           displaying video of the same teacher for the aliens to watch.

           The P.A. system CRACKLES to life.
                                 NED (FILTERED)
                        Good morning, urgh, student body.  
                        It’s a big day here at Fillmore, 
                        urgh, High, as the baseball team 
                        attempts to win us our very first 
                        state title.  

           INT. A/V ROOM

           Ned sits behind a desk, microphone in hand.

                        Everyone is invited to stick around 
                        after the game for a sneak peak at 
                        episode one of the brand new season 
                        of Nash Bridges.

           INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME

           The aliens in class PI-PUK and PU-PIK with excitement.  

                                 NED (FILTERED)
                        And remember, on the mound tonight 
                        for the Fillmore Phillies, your 
                        hero and mine, the ace who 
                        simultaneously saved Fillmore High 
                        and incinerated rival Harding 
                        High... Dag, The Wolfman, Parker.

           The students applaud, Petra fawns, Dag smiles, and everyone 
           lives happily ever after.  

           Except all the kids who went to Harding High. 

           Those fuckers are toast.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
