                      Hoof Harrington’s Greatest Hits 

                                         by 

                                   Dutch Southern 
           INT. STATE PEN. CELL. DAY

           ECU of A BOX, cardboard wrapped in twine. A VOICE, gravelly 
           and hard: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        When what you want is inside a box. 
                        And you’re not. You gotta think. 
                        Outside the box.

           Pulling back. Four walls. No windows. One steel door. And a 
           300 POUND SAMOAN on a cot. This is solitary confinement.

           The Samoan stirs. Eyes the BOX. Wonders how it got there. 

           Carefully opens it. Can’t believe his luck. A KEY and A 
           KNIFE.

           INT. STATE PEN. CORRIDOR. SECONDS LATER

           PRISONERS watching through bars -- CHEERING. The Samoan on 
           the move. The WARDEN leading the way, THE KNIFE at his 
           throat. Frightened GUARDS following, unable to do anything. 

           EXT. STATE PEN. SECONDS LATER

           An ELECTRIC GATE closing. The Samoan and his prisoner on one 
           side. The Guards on the other. 

           The Samoan can’t help but smile. He made it. He’s a free man-- 

           BANG! Freedom short-lived. A dead Samoan in the dirt. Guards 
           scattering for cover. The Warden running for dear life.

           Pulling back. WAY BACK. Far enough away not to be seen. HOOF 
           HARRINGTON on his stomach. Smoking RIFLE in his hands. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And that one didn’t even make my 
                        top five. My name is Hoof 
                        Harrington. And these are my 
                        Greatest Hits. 

           He gets up, his bones creaking. And we get our first SUPER:

                              HOOF HARRINGTON’S GREATEST HITS

           BLACK SCREEN. Beat... then another:

                                          NO. 5

                              THE COMMIE WHO KILLED KENNEDY
           BOOK DEPOSITORY. SIXTH FLOOR OFFICE

           Dallas, Texas. LEE HARVEY OSWALD with a rifle out the window. 
           Pulls back the bolt, ready to fire. Current time: 1963.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        No. Not him. The prick who actually 
                        did it.

           We leave the patsy...

           DEALEY PLAZA

           ...and we join a CUBAN with an Errol Flynn stache. Lying in 
           the grass. A high-powered RIFLE in his hands. The 
           PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE heading his way. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Yeah, that one. The grassy-knoll-
                        humping-snake Jack Ruby didn’t 
                        shank. 

           He closes an eye. And FIRES.

           ZAPRUDER FILM

           KENNEDY taking one to the neck. Then one to the head. Frame 
           FREEZES. Melting away. Nothing but WHITE. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Now, I’m no Red Socks-rooting-
                        lefty. But this is America. And 
                        here, we don’t get rid of those we 
                        elect with “magic bullets”. We do 
                        it with ballots, and money, and 
                        salacious rumors. That’s the 
                        American way. 

           A CAFE

           Havana, Cuba. The Cuban in a guayabera. Stuffing his face 
           with croquetas. Not a care in the world. Current time: 1966.  

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Everyone else -- we get rid of with 
                        people like me.

           A SNIPER-SHOT to the neck. Then a SNIPER-SHOT to the head. 
           It’s like a Zapruder remake. Shot-for-shot. PATRONS scatter.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Number Five was one of my first. 
                        Killing that cherna-guervara-fuck
                        put me on the map. After that, I 
                        was able to pick my own jobs. And 
                        name my own price. 

           A YOUNG HOOF 

           In a tree. Fresh-faced and full of spunk. Far enough away not 
           to be seen. A smoking RIFLE in his hands. A cocksure grin on 
           his face.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I was on the A-list of assassins. A 
                        young buck looking to fuck-up
                        anything and anybody.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY

           A CLOCK RADIO SOUNDS. And Hoof wakes. Not so young anymore. A 
           GROAN as he gets out of bed. Current time: Today.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Why a Greatest Hits? Let me 
                        explain.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM. DAY

           Hoof in the buff, looking at himself in the mirror. Looking 
           good -- damn good -- despite his age and the freshly stitched 
           SCAR on his chest.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        You know when you keep hearing 
                        about some hot-shit crooner and you 
                        wonder why people won’t shut the 
                        hell up about him. 

           Opens the THURSDAY slot on the pill dispenser. Pops a handful 
           into his mouth. No water. Water is for pussies. He chews 
           them.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So you go to the store to buy his 
                        album to check him out. But when 
                        you get there, you discover he’s 
                        got over a dozen. And you can’t 
                        tell one from the next. That’s what 
                        Greatest Hits are for. 
           Another look in the mirror. A fuck-you flex to the AARP. He’s 
           still got it.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. KITCHEN AREA. DAY

           Hoof pours egg whites into a skillet. Uses a spatula. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        That way you can get to know a 
                        little bit about him, find out if 
                        you want to know more. 

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. LIVING AREA. DAY

           Hoof at a typewriter. A Smith Corona. Punching away. One 
           index finger at a time. A STACK of pages beside a glass of 
           Metamucil.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Save some money, save some time. If 
                        he turns out to be some easy-baked 
                        cupcake like Harry Connick Jr., 
                        then you’re only stuck with one 
                        coaster instead of twelve. 

           He takes a swig. Returning the glass to a CD labeled: HARRY 
           CONNICK JR’S GREATEST HITS -- his coaster.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s what Greatest Hits are for.

           INT. DIVE BAR. DAY

           Hoof finishes his drink, taps the bar, and GUS gives him 
           another. 

           Gus used to be a Green Beret. Has a sword with three lighting 
           bolts inked on his arm. What red hair he’s got left is cut 
           short, almost a buzz. He looks like Louis C.K. -- if Louis 
           C.K. used to shoot-up steroids and jump out of airplanes.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And the goddam government should 
                        get the hell out of the banking 
                        business. And the car-making 
                        business. And the insurance-selling 
                        business. And just stick to what 
                        they’re good at: the killing 
                        business. Training men like you and 
                        me to go in and clear the way for 
                        their refineries. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT'D)
                        And their contracts. And their 
                        nation building bureaucracy. 
                        Because that’s what they’re good 
                        at. And that’s where the real money 
                        is anyway.

                                 GUS
                        Amen to that, brother.

           Hoof taps the bar and Gus gives him another.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And don’t even get me started on 
                        taxes.

                                 GUS
                        Taxes? When did you pay taxes?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        1963. And I’m still pissed about 
                        it. Which reminds me... 

           Hoof pulls out a paper bag. Gus opens it, gets all wide-eyed:

                                 GUS
                        No fucking way.

           It’s a HANDGUN. Not a Smith & Wesson. Not a Remington. Not a 
           Colt. This is a handmade piece. Part Blade Runner future. 
           Part Barry Lyndon past. Completely 100% badass.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I was hoping it could cover my tab.

                                 GUS
                        Of course. 

           Gus gripping it. Weighing it. Marveling at the detail.

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        This is amazing, Hoof. I can’t 
                        believe you made me a zip-gun.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Actually, it’s more of a Borz than 
                        a zip -- what the Chechens use 
                        against the Russians -- but 
                        whatever, same difference.

                                 GUS
                        Where did you learn to do this?
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        During the Cold War, whenever you 
                        had to hit a target behind the Iron 
                        Curtain, you’d have to rat-rod your 
                        piece from whatever you could find 
                        on site, or smuggle in. And let’s 
                        just say, I had a lot of practice.

                                 GUS
                        Old dogs, new tricks, huh.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Something like that.

           They both smile. The only two people in this dump.

           INT. CARDIOLOGIST’S OFFICE. TESTING ROOM. DAY

           Hoof on a treadmill. Huffing and puffing. Wires running from 
           his chest to an EKG MACHINE. 

           A STONE-FACED NURSE watching a LINE bounce on the monitor.

           INT. CARDIOLOGIST’S OFFICE. EXAMINING ROOM. DAY

           Hoof seated on a vinyl table. DR. SAHI, an Indian in a lab 
           coat, uses a stethoscope on his chest:

                                 DR. SAHI
                        Deep breath... Good... Now let it 
                        out.

           Hoof does. And Sahi gets a whiff:

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, what is that? Is that 
                        bourbon?

           Hoof knows it is, but does a smell-check anyway.

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        It’s not even noon yet.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I thought you said booze was good 
                        for my heart.

                                 DR. SAHI
                        I said wine. And a glass a day, not 
                        a bottle. Breathe in... hold it... 
                        Are you at least keeping to a daily 
                        routine like we discussed? 
           Hoof nods. He is.

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        And I hope bourbon before lunch 
                        isn’t a part of it. 

           No comment. Sahi disapproves with a look. 

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        Now exhale... How about your diet? 
                        You cutting back on the saturated 
                        fats? 

           Hoof nods. 

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        And the sodium.

           Hoof nods again. 

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        Are you exercising?

           Another nod.

                                 DR. SAHI (CONT’D)
                        Well, despite your best efforts the 
                        stent seems to be working. I want 
                        to see you in three weeks just to 
                        make sure. 

           Sahi jots something down on his clipboard. And Hoof smell-
           checks his breath again.

           INT. GROCERY STORE. AISLE. DAY

           Muzak playing to Hoof’s chagrin. He’s deciding between two 
           cans of beans. One says LOW SODIUM. The other doesn’t... The 
           former wins. Again, to Hoof’s chagrin. 

           INT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY

           Two rows of brownstones converted into apartments and stores. 
           Nice neighborhood. Not too expensive. Not too crowded. Hoof 
           rounding the corner. Heading home. A sack of groceries in his 
           hands.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. LIVING AREA. DAY

           A VHS TAPE inserted into a VCR. Jane Fonda circa ‘82 hopping 
           into view. She’s wearing striped leotards and leg-warmers.
           Hoof, in gym shorts and a tanktop, follows her instructions: 
           “Head to the right... back... left, stretch it out...”

           MUCH LATER

           Hoof in a chair. Facing the window. Staring at the night. A 
           PHOTO ALBUM in his lap. A glass of bourbon in his hand. A 
           look of longing in his eyes. 

           The end of another day. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY

           A CLOCK RADIO SOUNDS. Hoof wakes, eyes the ceiling, curses 
           the day to come.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. LIVING AREA. DAY

           Hoof’s fingers PECKING away at the typewriter. Adding another 
           page to the STACK.

           For the first time, we get a good look at the place. It’s 
           small. One bedroom. One bath. The furnishings minimal. 

           A TV with a dial. A nice vintage turntable with two oak 
           cabinets full of vinyl. On the floor, a very inexpensive 
           portable CD player. And a small stack of CDs.

           A couple of packed boxes against the wall. No paintings. No 
           photographs. Just a map of the world framed in wood. 

           This is not the type of place you’d expect an “A-list 
           assassin” to retire. Especially not a well paid one.

           Hoof mistypes. Adds whiteout. Dries it with his breath.

           EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY

           Hoof, seated in the grass. Unwraps a tuna fish sandwich. Made 
           it himself. Pulls out a sniper scope, aiming it at...

           A HILLSIDE ESTATE

           THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: NEIL NANTZ playing with his YOUNG 
           SON. Doing father and son things. And enjoying them.  
           HOOF

           Also enjoying them. Far enough away not to be seen. Trades 
           the scope for a camera. Telephoto Lens. Click! One pic after 
           another. Part picnic. Part stakeout.

           INT. GROCERY STORE. DELI COUNTER. DAY

           That goddam song from Terms of Endearment plays over the 
           loudspeaker. Hoof waiting behind a WOMAN in a moo-moo dress 
           and flip-flops. She’s complaining to the DELI CLERK about the 
           hue of her meat, wants him to sniff it.

           Hoof in hell. Opting to look elsewhere, notices...

           A BABY in a stroller. Staring back. All doe-eyed and blank-
           faced. Hoof giving a smile. The Baby returning it. 

           Hoof twitching his nose. The Baby responding with a chuckle.

           Hoof making a Red Skelton face. The Baby starting to LAUGH--

                                 IRRITATED WOMAN
                        Do you mind?

           An IRRITATED WOMAN waiting for Hoof, making a show of it. 
           Apparently, the line has progressed without him. He takes a 
           step, fills in the gap, cursing the woman under his breath.

           INT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY

           Same set of brownstones. Hoof rounding the corner. Heading 
           home. Sack of groceries in his hands, celery foliage peaking 
           out the top-- 

           Pfftt! A leak sprung. A MILK geyser spurting from the sack-- 

           Pfftt! Another spout. PRUNE JUICE spraying the sidewalk-- 

           Pfftt! BLOOD trickling from Hoof’s shoulder. 

           Pfftt!Tink! A bullet HITTING concrete. Hoof is gone. 

           A THIRD STORY BALCONY

           A HORRORSHOW of a man. A RIFLE with a silencer. Leaps over 
           the railing. Landing HARD. CRUSHING the hood of a Buick.
           INT. ALLEYWAY. CONTINUOUS

           Hoof hotfooting it. Keeping close to the wall. Gripping his 
           wounded shoulder--

           Pfftt!Tink! A bullet CLIPPING brick -- nearly clipping Hoof.

           Horrorshow adjusting his aim... Hoof ducking into a doorway.

           INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL. GROUND FLOOR. CONTINUOUS

           Tink!Tink!Tink! Bullets PELTING the steel door. Hoof climbing 
           the stairs. Lots of stairs.

           INT. ALLEYWAY. CONTINUOUS

           We get our first good look at Horrorshow. Muscles on muscles. 
           Dog collar with studs. Leather jumpsuit. Purple mohawk.
           Glitter and war paint. More piercings than a pincushion. The 
           worst of 80’s wrestling. 

           Snarling. Charging towards the building.

           INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL. 5TH FLOOR. CONTINUOUS

           Hoof, winded. Chugging along. Too many fucking stairs.

           EXT. BUILDING. ROOF. MOMENTS LATER

           The door swinging open. Hoof bursting onto the gravel. 
           Gasping. Grabbing his chest, his new stent throbbing. 
           Stumbling to the edge, looking down at--

           A nasty 10 story fall. 

           Nearby, another roof. 10 feet away. Maybe 15. He could make 
           it. Just needs a running start. 

           Takes it, sprints, prepares to leap, thinking better of it, 
           stopping, catching his breath. Who’s he kidding? He’d never 
           make it. Men half his age couldn’t make it--

           The door swinging open. A grinning Horrorshow raising his 
           rifle. Hoof with the pivot, PISTOL drawn--

           BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! Hoof, frozen in a killer’s stance. A 
           still-grinning Horrorshow tumbling back down the stairs, DOA.

           If you ever wondered what happened to Dirty Harry, now you 
           know.
           INT. APPLIANCE STORE. DAY

           White floors and white walls, sparkling with a Cinderella 
           sheen. Row after row of consumer-friendly gadgets: shiny 
           porcelain and shiny steel. But not a single solitary 
           customer. Or clerk. Never is. 

           In the back, a LOCKED DOOR labeled EMPLOYEES ONLY.

           BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR

           A large office containing only the barest essentials. Hoof 
           with his shirt off, seated on a stool, stitching-up the hole 
           in his shoulder. We see other scars, “torture tracks”.

           COOP with peppered hair, looking through a stack of files. 
           Dressed in corduroy and a pair of Chuck Taylors; he’s what 
           they call a HANDLER. Used to be Hoof’s. Now he’s just his 
           friend, his oldest.

           He hands Hoof a PHOTOGRAPH. A headshot of Horrorshow making a 
           Gene Simmons’ face and “devil horns” with his hands.

                                 COOP
                        This him?

           Hoof nodding.

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Called himself Horrorshow. Before 
                        that, Death Nail. And for a short 
                        time, Corpse Grinder. But his poor, 
                        poor mother; she called him Lesley 
                        Hubert Lankel. You heard of him?

           Hoof shakes his head.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How come he looks like a comic 
                        book?

                                 COOP
                        They all do. Some worse than 
                        others. It’s their way of standing 
                        out, making a name for themselves.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I remember when the trick was not 
                        standing out, hiding in the bushes, 
                        putting as many football fields 
                        between you and the target as you 
                        could. 
                                 COOP
                        Not anymore. Nowadays, these kids 
                        aren’t assassins, they’re big-game 
                        hunters looking for heads. It’s 
                        more about them than the job. Take 
                        this dingleberry, calls himself 
                        “Dandy Andy”.

           Holds up a headshot of DANDY ANDY. Exactly as described:

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Wears a pinstripe, feather in his 
                        fedora, gardenia on his coat, 
                        wingtips and spats on his feet, and 
                        a pencil-thin under his nose. 
                        Thinks he’s Jimmy-fucking-Cagney.
                        But he doesn’t stop with the 
                        wardrobe. No, not “Dandy Andy”. He 
                        uses a real-life, honest-to-god 
                        1926 Thompson Submachine Gun. Won’t 
                        use anything else. Do you know how 
                        hard it is to get ammo for a 
                        vintage 1926 Tommy Gun? Not to 
                        mention how many times a mag on an 
                        antique like that will jam. It 
                        belongs in a goddam museum. Not in 
                        the hands of a 24-year-old trick-or-
                        treater. Point is, with the kids 
                        today it’s not about doing a good 
                        job. It’s about being a star. 

           Hoof considers this, studying Horrorshow’s pic:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So, what’s his beef with me?

                                 COOP
                        There’s no easy way to say this. 
                        There’s a contract out on you.

           Hoof gives a chuckle, something he rarely does.

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious, Hoof. 

           Hoof realizes he is, loses the grin...

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        You gotta go underground. Get out 
                        of town--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Bullshit. Who is it?
           Coop takes a breath. Doesn’t want to say it, but has to...

                                 COOP
                        Big Blu.

           Hoof wasn’t expecting that. A sucker-punch to the gut.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So, he knows.

           Coop gives a solemn nod. And Hoof makes a solemn face, 
           remembering via VOICE-OVER:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Greatest Hit Number Four: Son of 
                        Big Blu.

           And we go to BLACK. There’s a beat... then the SUPER:

                                          NO. 4

                                      SON OF BIG BLU

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE. LIBRARY

           BIG BLU posing with his Stetson on. One boot resting on a 
           stool. A shotgun resting on his shoulder.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Big Blu was apple pie, baseball, 
                        and trickle-down economics all 
                        rolled into one. A bootstrapper who 
                        got rich the American way, by 
                        finding a need and exploiting the 
                        hell out of it.

           Pulling back, we see an ARTIST painting Blu’s portrait. The 
           stool has been replaced by a DEAD GRIZZLY BEAR.

           STILT HOUSE

           Hanoi, Vietnam. Four walls of polished wood. On one wall, a 
           dartboard with a photo of Lyndon Johnson. On the floor, Big 
           Blu with HO CHI MINH. They shake hands. Current time: 1964.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        That need was war-weaponry. The 
                        exploited: anyone with a beef. Blu 
                        was a gunrunner of the highest 
                        order, loyal to no one. To no 
                        country. To no cause. And to 
                        nobody. 
           COURTHOUSE

           We wait amongst a mob of REPORTERS. Doors swinging open. Big 
           Blu and his LAWYER leaving a hearing. Microphones and cameras 
           thrust in their faces. Questions shouted. He only answers us:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Whenever his patriotism was 
                        questioned, he would always 
                        answer... 

                                 BIG BLU
                        Nothing more American than free 
                        market capitalism. Except for maybe 
                        black market capitalism.

           He flashes us a shit-eater, adds a wink. Said too much; the 
           Lawyer knocks the camera out of our hands.

           FMLN CAMP

           Perquin, El Salvador. A guerilla base made from limbs and 
           leaves. A FMLN banner along with a bullet-riddled photo of 
           Reagan. CHILDREN armed with M16s. Big Blu shaking hands with 
           their GENERAL. Another deal sealed. Current time: 1981.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He made his first million during 
                        the Cold War. When the commies 
                        dried up, he turned to the driest 
                        place on earth. 

           TRAINING CAMP

           Kandahar, Afghanistan. MEN in turbans move across monkey 
           bars. OTHER MEN in turbans FIRE assault weapons at a portrait 
           of Clinton. Their BEARDED LEADER shaking hands with Big Blu. 
           Current time: 1998.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And that million became a billion.

           A FRAMED PORTRAIT

           Big Blu and his big-haired WIFE give toothy smiles. Their 
           portrait expanding. CHILDREN magically appearing. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        As his empire grew, so did his 
                        family. Churning out more kids than 
                        a Mormon without a wife-limit. 
           Big Blu and his Wife, now with a total of 12 SONS. The last, 
           a small child named RILEY BLU. We push-in on him.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The last of the litter he named 
                        Riley. 

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE. DINING ROOM

           Riley Blu seated before a birthday cake, surrounded by FAMILY 
           and FRIENDS, blowing out FIVE CANDLES.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Riley Wilson Blu, the runt of the 
                        family. 

           20 YEARS PASS in 24 frames. RILEY BLU (now 20 years older) 
           seated before another birthday cake, surrounded by FAMILY and 
           FRIENDS, blows out 25 MORE.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Riley Wilson Blu, the Polanski of 
                        the family. 

           His attention shifts, noticing MADDIE, a little girl in the 
           back. We follow his POV, moving past everyone, stopping on 
           her sweet face.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He liked them young. And he liked 
                        them drugged.

           BACKYARD

           Little Maddie swings. Notices Riley watching from the gate. 
           He gives her a wave. She returns it with a smile.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He’d done it before. Several times. 

           TOWN CAR

           Maddie and Riley together in the back. He empties a thermos 
           into her mug, gives her a reassuring nod and she drinks. In 
           the front seat, RILEY’S CRONY drives, watching through the 
           rearview.
           BIG BLU’S ESTATE. RILEY’S BEDROOM

           Maddie unconscious, laid out on the bed, still fully clothed. 
           A purple juice-stain on her upper lip. Riley unbuttoning his 
           shirt. Getting ready. The Crony watching from the corner. 

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           Maddie’s shirt, inside out, hastily put back on. Riley 
           buttoning his. Something is wrong. He checks her pulse. There 
           isn’t one. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But this time, he mis-mixed. Too 
                        much ketamine. Not enough grape 
                        juice. 

           BACKYARD

           A full moon overhead. Riley and his Crony placing Maddie’s
           little body in the grass. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Normally, this wouldn’t have 
                        registered higher than a “minor 
                        inconvenience” on the Riley Richter 
                        Scale.

           NEXT MORNING

           The sun rising, shining on the dead girl.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But this wasn’t just any little 
                        girl. 

           A SHADOW creeping up, covering her whole.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This was the daughter of Tony T. A 
                        powerful man who only cared about 
                        one thing...

           It’s TONY T. A mass of a man. Eyes welling as he scoops up 
           his daughter’s limp body.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Her.
           A BASEMENT

           Tony T and TWO ASSOCIATES pummel the Crony. Tony asks again. 
           The Crony, with a broken jaw, answers the only way he can, 
           using the blood on his finger to write the name... RILEY BLU.

           Tony looks stricken. Wasn’t expecting that. COCKS a 9mm
           against the Crony’s head... hesitates... gently lays the 
           hammer back down. He can’t do it.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But Tony wasn’t a killer. No matter 
                        how much he wanted to be. So he 
                        went to someone who was.

           APPLIANCE STORE. BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR

           Awkward with a capital “A”. Tony T, pleading. Hoof shaking 
           his head. Coop, no help at all, just staring at the floor.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But I couldn’t do it. I knew Blu. 
                        And I knew Riley. And that would 
                        make it personal. And I don’t do 
                        personal.

           Tony dropping to his knees, begging Hoof. But Hoof can’t. 
           He’s sorry, but “no way”. A last ditch effort by Tony; he 
           pulls out a PHOTO, holds it up for Hoof to see:

                                 TONY T
                        He didn’t just kill her...!

           It’s Tony with his daughter. Happy as can be. Hoof knows what 
           he has to do. Accepts with a reluctant nod. A grateful Tony 
           hugging the hell out of him. Hoof wishing he wouldn’t.

           DARK, CONFINED SPACE

           We can make out Hoof’s hard features as he waits.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        It was my last job. And not a bad 
                        one to end on. Some might even 
                        argue I was doing the world a 
                        favor. Lord knows, I made that 
                        argument myself.

           Ready. He takes a breath. And opens the door.
           RILEY’S BEDROOM

           Hoof out of the closet, now in the room. An 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
           startled. Dropping a mug. PURPLE JUICE staining the floor.

                                 RILEY BLU
                        Hoof?

           Riley confused. Hoof drawing his PISTOL.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Close your eyes.

           The Girl does as she’s told. And Hoof aims for the head.

                                 RILEY BLU
                        Hoof, it’s not what it looks like--

           BANG! -- a Rorschach bloodblot on the wall. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I did it up close. And personal. I 
                        never do that. But I felt I owed 
                        Blu that much. Because even if it 
                        wasn’t personal -- it was.

           The locked door RATTLING. Someone trying to get in. Hoof 
           grabbing the Girl. The door BURSTING OPEN. Big Blu flanked by 
           THREE OF HIS CREW.

           All eyes on an OPENED WINDOW. Curtains dancing in the breeze.

           Blu discovers his murdered son. Cradles him. Weeps and wails.

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE. MASTER BEDROOM 

           Blu practically catatonic. In a hospital bed. Hooked up to 
           all sorts of machines. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Riley’s death was too much for Blu.

           MIKE (who we’ll also come to know as THE WINDOW GUARD) hands 
           Blu an ANONYMOUS NOTE. On one side: 

                                 WHO SLEW LITTLE BOY BLU?

           On the other:

                               HOOF HARRINGTON, THAT’S WHO.

           Blu can’t believe it... impossible.
           LATER

           Blu still in bed. The 8-Year-Old-Girl standing at the foot. 
           Her PARENTS behind her. Blu holding up a SKETCH of Hoof.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Blu was bound to find out. 

           The Girl nods. And Blu starts to shake. Mike quickly handing 
           the Parents a wad of bills as he escorts everyone outside.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Serves me right for breaking one of 
                        my rules. Never hit up close and 
                        personal.

           Blu left alone, SCREAMING like a madman.

                                                               BACK TO:

           BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR

           Current time: Today. Hoof and Coop right where we left them. 
           Hoof with the poker-face, posturing pure McQueen machismo: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I don’t see what the problem is. He 
                        hired a guy. I killed the guy. It’s 
                        a wash.

                                 COOP
                        The problem is he didn’t hire a 
                        guy. He didn’t hire anyone. He just 
                        posted a bounty and pointed at you.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What in the hell does that mean?

                                 COOP
                        That means it’s an open contract. 
                        That means it’s open season on your 
                        ass. That means any upstart looking 
                        to make a name, or a hall-of-famer
                        looking to make his mortgage, is 
                        going to be taking a shot at you. 
                        You’re Hoof Harrington. You’re the 
                        biggest trophy a big-game hunter 
                        can get. Not to mention, it’s the 
                        biggest payday I’ve ever seen on a 
                        single in-state job. EVER.

           Hoof finally gets it... worse than he originally thought:
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So, how do I void the damn thing?

                                 COOP
                        I only know of two ways...

           INT. BIG BLU’S ESTATE. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY 

           Big Blu in his signature Stetson. Still in the hospital bed. 
           Looking like Abe Vigoda warmed over. All sorts of tubes 
           attached to all sorts of places. A heart monitor with a 
           steady BEEP. A NURSE reading a Harlequin in the corner. 

           The phone RINGS. He answers:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Hello.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        This is Hoof.

           Big Blu goes white, then red, then purple. The heart monitor 
           goes ape-shit. The Nurse looking up from her book.

           BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR

           Hoof on the phone. Coop on pins and needles.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Did you put a contract out on me?

                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        Would’ve put out a thousand more if 
                        I could, see you die that many 
                        times. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Look, he was out of control and you 
                        know it. If it hadn’t been me, it 
                        would’ve been somebody else. Maybe 
                        even you. Hell, you might even say 
                        I did you a favor. 

                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        A favor!?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Damn straight, a favor. You got 
                        your closet cleaned for free.
                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        Guess what, hotshot? I just added 
                        another zero to your head! How do 
                        you like that!?

           Hoof takes a deep breath, keeping his cool.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No way I can reason with you?

                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        I’m gonna piss on your grave.

           DIALTONE. Blu with the hang-up. Coop keeping hope alive:

                                 COOP
                        How did it go?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And the other way to void a 
                        contract...

           Coop sighs.

                                 COOP
                        Kill the signatory.

           Hoof takes a seat, doesn’t like the sound of that, weighs his 
           options... realizes he doesn’t have any. 

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. LIVING AREA. DAY

           Hoof returns home. RE-LOCKS the three deadbolts. SHUTS the 
           blinds. Peaks out -- scouting the skyline.

           Opens one of the boxes. Pulls out a chalkboard. Not a dry 
           erase board -- A CHALKBOARD. 

           Hangs it on an existing nail. Admires it. Straightens it.

           Opens another box. Pulls out an attache case. Does the combo. 

           A RIFLE in 5 pieces: barrel, scope, silencer, stock, and 
           magazine.

           A LITTLE LATER

           Hoof on the floor. The RIFLE in even more pieces. Some drying 
           on newspaper. Others being cleaned.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY

           A CLOCK RADIO SOUNDS. And Hoof wakes, his brain pleading with 
           his body to stay put. Body wins. Hoof GROANS.

           EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY

           Hoof in the grass. Having another picnic/stakeout. Boiled egg 
           in his hand. Sniper scope at his eye...

           THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: In the front yard, Neil Nantz and his 
           Young Son having a picnic of their own. Also in attendance: 
           BILL & JILL NANTZ (Neil’s parents) and SARA (Neil’s wife). 
           Another kodak moment with the Nantz family.

           HOOF

           Taking advantage of said “moment” with a Telephoto Lens. 
           Click!Click!Click! One pic after another.

           INT. DIVE BAR. DAY

           Hoof’s hand-made PISTOL, now a mantelpiece, hung proudly over 
           the bar. Hoof on a stool, putting together his RIFLE, 
           checking the scope. Gus taking a break from his racing form:

                                 GUS
                        You ever thought about an upgrade? 
                        Maybe getting a new rifle to go 
                        with the new century?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        This is a ‘63 Model 70. They don’t 
                        make them like this anymore -- pure 
                        perfection.

                                 GUS
                        If it’s so goddam perfect, then why 
                        did they stop making them?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Because they had to. In ‘64, the 
                        unions Marx’d and Mao’d Winchester 
                        until they raised wages. Once that 
                        happened, costs went up. And when 
                        costs go up, craftsmanship goes the 
                        way of the dodo bird. That meant no 
                        more Mauser extractor, no more 
                        fixed ejector, no more cone breech, 
                        and no more giving a shit.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT'D)
                        Now, all you can get you’re hands 
                        on are assembly line pea-shooters. 
                        And they’re about as accurate as a 
                        wet fart.

           Everything checks out; Hoof breaking the rifle back down.

                                 GUS
                        But does it still work.

           Hoof checking to see if Gus is fucking with him. He is. But 
           Hoof continues anyway:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        This is a fifty-year-old rifle, 
                        Gus. Not your fifty-year-old cock. 
                        Of course it still works. Every 
                        target I’ve ever had to take 
                        outside a hundred-yard range, I’ve 
                        taken with this bad-boy right here. 
                        Used it to pull Hoffa’s card in 
                        ’75, Bin Laden’s in ‘03, and a 
                        whole helluva lot more in between.

                                 GUS
                        You gonna use it to pull Big Blu’s?

           This gives Hoof pause. He hadn’t really thought about it. 
           Doesn’t want to think about it. Finishes his drink instead.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Tell me something, Gus. You ever 
                        wonder how your life might have 
                        ended up had you done this instead 
                        of that, or that instead of this?

                                 GUS
                        You mean like, what-if I hadn’t 
                        cold-cocked Sergeant Shit-for-
                        brains? Would I still be in the 
                        Corps today? Maybe even a career 
                        man? Or would I have ended up here 
                        anyway, slinging drinks to dole-
                        hounds, getting paid in zip-guns 
                        and IOUs? Is that what you mean?

           Hoof nods.

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        Hell no. Thinking like that will 
                        only drive a man nuts.

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        Until Bill Gates builds a time 
                        machine, thinking about anything 
                        other than how you’re going to 
                        spend your weekend is futile and 
                        pointless. Not to mention goddam
                        depressing. 

           Gus returns to his racing form. And Hoof returns to his 
           glass. His mind working, his thoughts via VOICE-OVER:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Doesn’t matter who you are. Or what 
                        you’ve done. Everyone with a 
                        greatest hits has a worst. That’s 
                        how you tell “the greatest” once 
                        its got. By comparing it to the 
                        shit. Clapton has “Wonderful 
                        Tonight”...

           EXT. CEMETARY. DAY

           Hoof kneeling beside a TOMBSTONE. Removing a bouquet of 
           flowers, replacing them with a fresh bunch. He takes a seat. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...Neil Diamond has “You Don’t 
                        Bring Me Flowers”, Dylan has that 
                        turd of a tune, “Lay Lady Lay”. And 
                        Rod Stewart has everything he’s 
                        ever recorded after 1972. Me, I 
                        have the Winslow Job. My worst hit 
                        by a long-shot. Literally.

           BLACK SCREEN. A beat... then the SUPER:

                                     THE WINSLOW JOB

           TV SCREEN

           A 70s era CAMPAIGN AD with all the standard bullshit photo-
           ops: SENATOR WINSLOW shaking hands with blue-collar folk, 
           kissing babies, posing at a construction site with his 
           sleeves rolled up, and then the slogan: 

                VOTE FOR THE MAN YOU KNOW. VOTE TO RE-ELECT SENATOR WINSLOW.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Senator Winslow represented one of 
                        those states where schools can’t 
                        pledge allegiance to the flag but 
                        it’s your civic duty to burn one, 
                        where they execute the unborn but 
                        the death penalty is cruel and 
                        unusual, where illegals get amnesty 
                        and natural-borns get audited, 
                        hell, you know the place...

           A burst of ELECTRONIC NOISE. Another recording coming 
           through. The picture settling on a HOME VIDEO:

           A hairless DUDE on a bed in a speedo. A line of coke where 
           his “happy trail” should be. Senator Winslow putting a straw 
           to his nose, making the line disappear.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But even in the most liberal of 
                        states, a politician can’t expect 
                        to be re-elected when he’s caught 
                        on tape sucking coke and snorting 
                        cock... 

           PULL BACK from the TV SCREEN to see we’re in...

           SENATOR WINSLOW’S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS

           Senator Winslow watching the INCRIMINATING VIDEO. Teary-eyed, 
           humiliated, frightened: a fucking cliche. Coop by his side, 
           giving him his options.

           A younger Hoof in the corner, his back to everything but a 
           glass of bourbon and a framed PORTRAIT. The latter featuring 
           THE WINSLOW FAMILY (dog included). Current time: 1976.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...not when he’s got a wife, two 
                        kids, and a dog named FDR. The 
                        public can put up with a lot, but 
                        being force-fed bullshit and told 
                        it’s caviar, that’s a little much 
                        for any constituent to swallow.

           AN EMPTY PARKING LOT

           Winslow making a meet. Trying to be inconspicuous. Handing a 
           bag to the EXTORTIONIST (the Dude with the cocaine on his 
           abdomen). 
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Winslow paid off his co-star twice. 
                        Neither time took. The threats kept 
                        coming.

           The Extortionist unzips the bag. Flush with CASH. He smiles. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s when he decided to pay me.

           FANCY HOTEL. EXTORTIONIST’S ROOM

           The Extortionist eating lobster, drinking champagne straight 
           from the bottle, living high off of Winslow’s money.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        The target got a room at a five-
                        star downtown.

           SEEDY HOTEL. LOBBY

           The NIGHT CLERK busy watching TV. Barely noticing Hoof 
           exchanging cash for a key. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And I got a room at a half-star 
                        across the street. The kind of 
                        place where you pay by the minute, 
                        and no one pays attention to your 
                        face.

           SEEDY HOTEL. HOOF’S ROOM

           You can practically smell the bodily fluids left behind. 
           Wallpaper peeling, ceiling leaking, air conditioner rattling, 
           and bed bugs waiting. Hoof’s RIFLE at the window. His eye at 
           the scope, trained on...

           A WINDOW (AT THE FANCY HOTEL)

           THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: The Extortionist in Hoof’s sight, 
           snorting some blow, oblivious to what’s to come.

           HOOF

           Pulling the trigger -- Pfftt! -- a shot FIRED. And we PAUSE.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Twelve hours earlier...
           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE. BEDROOM

           An early morning glow seeping through the blinds -- 
           WHOOOMPBAAAAM! -- A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION DOWNSTAIRS -- Jill & 
           Bill Nantz jolted awake.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...Jill and Bill Nantz woke...

           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE. DOWNSTAIRS

           A cautious Bill creeping down the stairs, his eyes widening 
           at the sight of...

           A GIANT REDWOOD in the middle of his living room. The roof in 
           bits and pieces all around.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...to find their sequoia no longer 
                        in their backyard.

           FANCY HOTEL. THE NANTZES’ ROOM

           Bill with the luggage. Jill with the BABY. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        The insurance company put them up 
                        in a five-star downtown.

           The BELLHOP showing them the amenities. The Nantzes
           noticeably impressed. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        They decided to make the best of a 
                        bad situation... 

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           The Nantzes lounging around in complimentary robes. Eating 
           ice cream sundaes. Watching HBO. Truly making the best of it.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...unaware of just how bad it was 
                        really going to get. 

           EVEN LATER

           The Baby CRYING. Jill and Bill suddenly awake. Jill getting 
           out of bed. Bill giving her a supportive pat on the back 
           before drifting back to sleep.
           Jill cradling the Baby, beginning to breast-feed. 

           HOOF

           Right where we left him. At the window of the SEEDY MOTEL. 
           The Extortionist in his sight, trigger pulled -- Pfftt!

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I knew as soon as the bullet left, 
                        something was wrong. 

           THE BULLET

           Slowed down so we can ride along:

           Whoosh! Through the air...

           Chink! Through the glass window of the FANCY HOTEL...

           BAM! Between the eyes of the EXTORTIONIST...

           Splat! Out the back of his HEAD...

           Thunk! Through the blood-spattered WALL, and into...

           THE NANTZES’ ROOM (NEXT DOOR)

           Bill sound asleep -- THUD! -- not anymore. Turning on the 
           table lamp, discovering... 

           His wife and child now on the floor. NEITHER MOVING.

           FANCY HOTEL

           An addled Hoof amongst a crowd of ONLOOKERS, watching the 
           PARAMEDICS load two ambulances. One with a BODY BAG. The 
           other with Jill. A distraught Bill climbing in with her. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I took their son.

           HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM

           An anxious Hoof, eyeing the ENTRANCE doors. They swing open. 
           And out comes Bill pushing Jill in a wheelchair, discharged.
           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE

           Bill helping Jill out of their car, and into their home. Hoof 
           watching from afar. Wanting to do something. But what?

           MONTHS LATER

           Now with snow on the lawn. An excited Hoof RINGING the 
           doorbell, running to hide, watching from a safe distance... 

           The door opening. Jill and Bill in pajamas and robes.

           TWO CORVETTE STINGRAYS in their driveway. One pink. One blue. 
           Both brand new with bows on top. A CARD included.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I started to give them things.

           A bewildered Bill opens the card. No signature. No 
           explanation. Just the prerequisite greeting: MERRY CHRISTMAS!

           ANOTHER DAY

           THROUGH A WINDOW: Jill doing housework. Suddenly overcome 
           with emotions. Tears gushing. Can’t make them stop.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But no matter what I gave, it could 
                        never make up for what I took.

           A guilt-ridden Hoof, walking away.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. RANCH HOUSE. DAY

           Current time: Today. And today is OPEN HOUSE. No furnishings 
           except for three card tables: one with drinks, one with 
           finger foods, and one with brochures and a sign-in sheet. 
           Lots of PEOPLE drinking, eating, eyeing the property. 

           Hoof enters, aviator shades up over his eyes, collar up over 
           his face. Grabs a brochure. A SHRILL VOICE stopping him cold: 

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Yoo-hoo! Don’t forget to sign in!

           A LADY REALTOR, in Tammy-Faye make-up and poodle hair, 
           calling from across the room:
                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Hancock your John, mister. Or no 
                        deviled eggs for you.  

           She wags a playful finger at Hoof. He obliges, signing 
           RANDOLPH SCOTT before ducking into the...

           DINING ROOM

           Head down, brochure up, most of Hoof’s face covered. Gazing 
           out a massive PICTURE WINDOW. A perfect view of... 

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           Right across the street. Surrounded by a massive fence. TWO 
           SECURITY GUARDS positioned at the gate.

           LADY REALTOR 

           Appearing beside Hoof, handing him a cup of punch and a 
           napkinful of goat cheese and deviled eggs.

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        That’s Big Blu’s place. 

           She gives a knowing nod. And he gives the appropriate eyebrow 
           raise.

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        But don’t let that scare you. He’s 
                        really a sweetheart, hardly the 
                        monster the media likes to portray. 

           Hoof eyes the HIGHEST WINDOW. One of many. He can see the 
           Nurse reading her book. And Mike (the Window Guard) eyeing 
           the grounds from within.

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        You know what he did when the 
                        owners of this reasonably priced 
                        property had to move? He offered to 
                        point one of his camera-thingies
                        right this way. Just to be 
                        neighborly.

           Hoof notices that CAMERA(-thingy) aimed right this way. One 
           of MANY CAMERAS. The others panning Blu’s property.

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s a perk they don’t mention in 
                        the brochure. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        The best security money can buy and 
                        you’ll practically be getting it 
                        all for free, just by moving in.

           Hoof notices an armed SECURITY GUARD on the rooftop with a 
           walkie-talkie.

           The Lady sizing Hoof up. He’s old. But so is a ‘69 Charger. 
           And those V8s have more steely kick than half the Jap-made
           electrics on the recall list. That’s what Hoof would say. 

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Is there a Mrs. Randolph Scott? I 
                        hope you don’t mind, but I noticed 
                        your name on the sign-in sheet.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Not at the moment. Just me.

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        O-really? Isn’t this a pretty big 
                        place for just one man?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Well, I’m a pretty big man.

           That’s it. She’s sold. A hot-flash in progress:

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Oh, my... you... goodness...

           A giggle. And a quick retrieval of a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s got my name and cell. If you 
                        ever want a more private tour, just 
                        give me a ring-a-ding-ding.

           She gives his biceps a parting squeeze before scuttling after 
           a WEALTHY LOOKING COUPLE who have just entered:

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Yoo-hoo! Don’t forget to sign in!

           INT. APPLIANCE STORE. BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR. DAY

           Coop retrieves a cylinder tube. Flattens the contents over 
           the desk. It’s A FLOOR PLAN. Hoof looking it over, each BOX 
           representing a room in Big Blu’s estate.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No renovations.
                                 COOP
                        Not since ‘82. Added a bedroom when 
                        Riley was born.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Should’ve added a padded one.

                                 COOP
                        So what do you think?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I think it’s Fort-fucking-Knox.
                        Security out the ass and ears. You 
                        can’t hardly make it down the 
                        street without getting sketched. 
                        And to makes things worse, they got 
                        Rapunzel in his own tower cell. 
                             (pointing to BLU’S ROOM)
                        And he never comes out. Not even to 
                        piss. Absolutely no shot from 
                        outside. Got at least one gunman by 
                        his bed. Another above his head.
                             (pointing to the ROOF)
                        Not to mention, two by the gate. 
                        And lord knows how many inside.

           Coop lays a transparency on top. A BLUEPRINT of exact 
           dimensions. Lined up perfectly -- new details revealed -- 
           TINY CONES in the corners of each ROOM. Hoof tapping them:

                        And these are the cameras? 

                                 COOP
                        One in every room. Installed two 
                        days after you hit Riley. 

           Hoof noticing something. Tapping the stairwell:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What about the main stairs?

                        Well looky there, you got yourself 
                        a blind-spot. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Then I’ve got a starting point.

                        A complete panoramic view: morning,

                        That’s gonna be tricky.

                                 COOP
                        Like a three-handed whore. 

           Hoof admires the schematics, almost impressed:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        They got the sonuvabitch in a box.

                                 COOP
                        Well, you know what they say. When 
                        what you want is inside a box. And 
                        you’re not...

           Hoof starts to smile.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You got to think. Outside the box.

           INT. HOOF’S APARTMENT BUILDING. HALLWAY. NIGHT

           The sound of a bright idea -- Ding! -- as the elevator doors 
           open. Hoof exiting, a sack of groceries in his hands. 

           Stops at his apartment. Digs out his keys -- but the door is 
           already open -- he pushes it the rest of the way, sees...

           BETTY RAGE, arched against his wall, waiting. Mod bangs, jet 
           black hair in a pontytail. Heart-shaped lips a glossy red. A 
           black corset tied tight. Fishnets with matching opera gloves. 
           And a GATLING GUN strapped to her back. She’s a 6-foot pinup 
           ready to pounce. 

                                 BETTY RAGE
                        They call me Betty Rage. And you 
                        must be Hoof Harrington.

                        Full disclosure, I’m a fan. In 
                        fact, I’ve been dreaming of this 
                        moment since I was a little girl.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        ...thanks...

                                 BETTY RAGE
                        So, you ready to get licked?

           A lick of the lips for emphasis. Hoof paralyzed by an 
           onslaught of what-the-fucks.

           Rage with the weapon retrieval. In one motion, the MACHINE 
           GUN unholstered and on FIRE -- BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! -- 
           Hoof SLAMMING the door. Hitting the floor. The wood barrier 
           BLOWN to bits. BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!

           A sudden ceasefire.

           Hoof, covered in splinter and soot. His heart racing. His new 
           stent throbbing. He clutches his chest, eyes THE ELEVATOR.

           BETTY RAGE

           Admiring the HOLE she just made. Adjusting her aim. Heels 
           CLICKING as she heads for the hallway. 

           HOOF

           Gripping his sidearm. Eyeing that ELEVATOR. Heels CLICKETY-
           CLACKING, closer and closer. One deep breath. A silent 
           prayer. And Hoof makes a run for it--

           BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! Drywall turning to dust. A 
           barricade of BULLETS. Hoof taking cover. His PIECE skidding 
           across the floor. BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!

           BETTY RAGE

           BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! Squeezing the trigger. Shredding 
           the wall between her and Hoof. All exposed flesh jiggling 
           from the recoil. Kind of hot if you’re not in her crosshairs.

           Another ceasefire.
           HOOF

           Heaving. His chest pulsating, burning. Reaching into his 
           coat, he pulls out a bottle of pills. Takes two. Heels 
           CLACKING closer. He spots his PIECE down the hall.

           Makes a run for it -- BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! -- Hoof back on 
           the floor. More bullets. More holes. More obstacles keeping 
           him from that goddam gun. BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG!  

           Another ceasefire.

           Hoof opening his eyes, covered in rubble. Debris all around. 
           Heels CLICKETY-CLACKING. Rage cornering the old man. 

           Hoof looking up. Long legs leading to a sexy smile. He 
           returns an awkward one. The GATLING aimed his way. Hoof just 
           a finger squeeze away from an eternity in hell.

                                 BETTY RAGE
                        Well, color me disappointed. Here I 
                        was hoping you’d play harder to 
                        get.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        We could start all over again. You 
                        go back into my apartment. I go 
                        back into the elevator.

           He smiles something sheepish. She can’t help but return it. 

                                 BETTY RAGE
                        You’re cute for a dead man.

           His smile fades. This is it. Ready, aim -- Ding! -- the 
           elevator doors opening. Rage adjusting her sights. But it’s 
           empty. No one inside. Just a distraction. The MAN responsible 
           for said distraction coming up from behind. Coming up fast. 

           In an undertaker’s suit. All black except for a dash of red, 
           his socks, playing peak-a-boo as he glides towards his prey.

           Rage sensing something, whips around, but it’s too late -- 
           anaconda arms wrapped around her neck. Rage BUCKING like a 
           bronco, her gun knocked to the floor. 

           A BLADE. Across her throat. And a GUSH of red.

           Hoof ready with his piece... but no need. The Man carving 
           away. A blood flow down her front. Her knees buckling, 
           collapsing like a gazelle bled-out by a lion.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Hey...
           Betty Rage twitching. The Man still working, back and forth.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        ...that’s enough.

           The Man doesn’t seem to think so, gripping a handful of hair. 
           YANKING. The head off with a TEAR. Landing at Hoof’s feet.

           Hoof can’t believe his eyes. The Man staring back, wipes away 
           some blood, revealing a twisted smile. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I’m Grand Guignol. And you have 
                        three days to kill Big Blu, before 
                        I kill you.

           He tosses a BUSINESS CARD. Eggshell with Romalian type:

                                          BANG!

           Hoof flips it over:

                                       YOU’RE DEAD.

           Hoof with a question. But no one to ask. Just Rage, left open 
           like a spilt bottle of ketchup. There’s a taut beat before 
           Hoof finally finds the words. They come via VOICE-OVER:

                        Now I do it to stay alive. Hard to 
                        believe there was a time when I 
                        didn’t do it at all. Greatest Hit

           A TOYOTA HILLUX

           Riddled with pockmarks and bullet holes. A Toubou DRIVER in 
           Bootsy Collins shades. A cloud of Sahara dust in his wake. 
           The TIBESTI MOUNTAINS on the horizon.

           In the back bed, Big Blu holding onto his Stetson, a smile on 
           his face. 
           Beside him, a younger Hoof -- no smile, no nothing, the 
           constant curmudgeon, no matter his age. Current time: 1978.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Back in the day, between jobs, I 
                        used to work for Blu. He called me 
                        his “long distance bodyguard”. But 
                        what I really was, was his proxy. 
                        My job was to take out his 
                        competition. And back then, Blu had 
                        no bigger competition than a man 
                        named Alias Arthur Rimbaud.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD’S ESTATE. LIBRARY

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD, part Peter Sellers/part Jean-Paul 
           Belmondo, posing with his trilby hat. One foot resting on a 
           stool. A shotgun resting on his shoulder. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Alias Rimbaud was the Big Blu of 
                        the French Riviera. 

           Pulling back, we see an ARTIST painting Rimbaud in some 
           fucked-up Cubist fashion. The stool has been replaced by what 
           looks like a DEAD LION. 

           FLN HEADQUARTERS

           Algiers, Algeria. A lighthouse turned into a war room. A FLN 
           flag on the wall. A transistor radio on the desk. A photo of 
           Charles de Gualle converted into a dartboard. Rimbuad shaking 
           hands with HOUARI BOUMEDIENE. A crate of WEAPONS at their 
           feet. Current time: 1962.

                        He was a gunrunner of the highest 
                        order, loyal to no one. To no 
                        country. To no cause. And to 
                        nobody.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD’S ESTATE. DINING ROOM

           It’s a birthday party. FRIENDS and FAMILY gathered around 
           Rimbaud’s YOUNG SON. The five-year-old opening one of his 
           many presents. It’s a TOY HELICOPTER! He thanks his father 
           and his mother. Rimbaud and his WIFE giving their son kisses.

                        The only exception he made was for

                        everything was hunky-dory...

           A MAP

           Of CHAD and LIBYA. Two countries in Africa that share a 
           border. We PUSH IN on that border, getting a closer look at 
           the AOZOU STRIP...

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...until Uranium was found in a 
                        patch of sand called the Aozou
                        Strip.

           ...TINY SOLDIERS from Libya invade Chad. TINY SOLDIERS from 
           Chad fight back until a FLAME appears burning a hole in the 
           center of the map ala “Bonanza”.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This discovery caused a property 
                        line dispute. 

           ON TV

           A NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR in a pompadour and a pornstar stache
           reports on the CHADIAN-LIBYAN CONFLICT. Over his shoulder a 
           cheesy BOX GRAPHIC appears. We see footage of both countries 
           fighting. It’s a sad sight.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Who was right, who was wrong didn’t 
                        matter. What mattered was who sold 
                        to who. 

           BIG BLU

           Shaking hands with MUAMMAR AL-GADDAFI. Gaddafi, a blowhard in 
           epaulets, medals, and gold sashes.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Blu dealt to Libya. 

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Shaking hands with FELIX MALLOUM. Malloum trying to appear 
           Presidential in a hand-me-down suit and a pair of horn-rims 
           that take up most of his face.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And Rimbaud dealt to Chad. And when 
                        they went to war, Blu got the 
                        bright idea to deal to both.

           FRAME FREEZES and a RED EX is drawn over Rimbaud. Kind of 
           childish, but that’s Blu.

           A CONFERENCE ROOM

           An oak table. Big Blu on one side. Rimbaud on the other. Blu 
           backed by a SCARY LOOKING DUDE. Rimbaud backed by an EQUALLY 
           SCARY LOOKING DUDE. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON  (V.O.)
                        So he went to Rimbaud with an offer 
                        he felt was fair. 

           Blu hands over an ENVELOPE. Rimbaud opens it. It’s a piece of 
           paper with a ZERO on it (a big fat “goose egg”). Rimbaud
           smiles, pulls out an ENVELOPE of his own.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And Rimbaud countered with an offer 
                        of his own. 

           Blu opens it. Another ZERO. Blu doesn't smile. Not at all.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Turned out he had the same bright 
                        idea as Blu. And like Blu, he 
                        wasn’t going to take no for an 
                        answer. That’s when Blu went to 
                        Plan B...

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           The main door opens and we see Hoof.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...Me.

           Blu is genuinely happy to see him, gives him a hug as he 
           enters. Hoof wishing he wouldn’t.

           BIG BLU’S STUDY

           Hoof going over the intel. Blu pointing out particulars, 
           giving his two-cents, all the while bouncing a BABY on his 
           knee, one of his many sons.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Whenever Blu hired me for one of 
                        these gigs, he always made the same 
                        stipulation: they must be performed 
                        out in the open, where everyone 
                        could see. Because in his mind they 
                        weren’t just hits, they were PSAs.

                                 BIG BLU
                        We have to make an example of this 
                        dickweed. I don’t need anymore pups 
                        nippin’ at my ass. This Rimbaud, he 
                        worries me. He’s worse than the 
                        rest. That means this Public 
                        Service Announcement has to be big.

           Blu’s big-haired Wife enters, serving the two men 
           refreshments as they discuss.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How big?

                                 BIG BLU
                        David Lean big.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You mean, epic.

                                 BIG BLU
                        With a capital “E”.

           Hoof considers this. Continuing via VOICE-OVER:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Now, if capital “E” is what the 
                        client wants, there is really only 
                        one option...

           A BOWLING BAG

           Overflowing with C-4. HOOF’S HANDS zipping the bag shut. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...Explosives.

           A HANGAR

           In the middle of the night. In the middle of nowhere. Hoof, 
           toting the BOWLING BAG, following Blu. Passing a couple of 
           SPORTS CARS that are probably stolen, and a VINTAGE BI PLANE 
           that probably doesn’t work, stopping at... 
           A HELICOPTER -- an early 70’s Jet Ranger -- the kind used by 
           local news crews to cover car chases.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Is that it?

                                 BIG BLU
                        Yep.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You’re sure.

                                 BIG BLU
                        A hundred percent. Always the same 
                        routine. Arrives in a truck. Leaves 
                        in that. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And the pilot...?

                                 BIG BLU
                        He knows not to touch the red tape. 
                        After he lands, he’ll go off 
                        somewhere to “take a shit”, won’t 
                        resurface until it’s over.

           Sounds good. Hoof unzips the bowling bag, pulls out a BRICK 
           of C-4, and gets to work.

           LATER

           The bowling bag is empty. The passenger door paneling is off, 
           Hoof having gutted it. The innards replaced with C-4, packed 
           tight inside. Hoof attaching the BLASTING CAP to the CLAY. 
           Blu watching over his shoulder:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Can I be the one to do it?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Do what?

                                 BIG BLU
                        Blow his ass up tomorrow.

           Hoof shakes his head. Snips a CORD. Attaches it to the 
           BLASTING CAP.

                                 BIG BLU (CONT’D)
                        Why not? 
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Two reasons. One: I always use the 
                        detonator as a bull's-eye, let the 
                        mark set it off. It’s the only way 
                        to assure accuracy. Two: not 
                        setting it off allows us to be Zen 
                        about the whole damn thing. This 
                        way, Rimbaud’s life isn’t in our 
                        hands -- it’s in his own. 
                        Literally.

           Hoof holds up the DETONATOR and demonstrates, pressing it 
           again and again. Blu is impressed:

                                 BIG BLU
                        So how are you going to get him to 
                        push it?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        By making it into something else. 

           Hoof attaches the DETONATOR to the CORD.

                                 BIG BLU
                        But how do you do that?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        With a little American can-do’ness.
                        Everyone knows in the land of the 
                        free, if you have a dream and a 
                        drive, you can be anything you want 
                        to be. Same is true with this 
                        little fucker right here. It can be 
                        a cuff link. A light switch. A 
                        radio dial... 

           Hoof attaches the DETONATOR to the interior DOOR HANDLE.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        ...Or the handle on the door of a 
                        helicopter. Doesn’t matter. Because 
                        whatever you make it, in its core, 
                        it’s still the trigger. Only 
                        instead of going bang, it goes 
                        boom. 

                                 BIG BLU
                        And that’s the trick. 

           Hoof reattaches the interior paneling, hiding the C-4 and all 
           the wires stuffed inside. 
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That’s the trick. Getting the mark 
                        to pull the trigger without knowing 
                        it’s a trigger.

                                 BIG BLU
                             (smiles)
                        It’s going to be big, huh?

           Hoof nods. It’s going to be big. Blu practically salivating:

                                 BIG BLU (CONT’D)
                        How big?

           Hoof ponders, and we leave the HANGAR to see for ourselves...

           ...ending up near the TIBESTI MOUNTAINS, the sun beating down 
           on the always cool Alias Arthur Rimbaud. Felix Malloum
           handing over a briefcase full of money. Rimbaud excusing 
           himself, heading to the HELICOPTER on standby. 

           It’s empty. The pilot nowhere to be seen. Rimbaud deciding to 
           wait inside.

           A piece of RED TAPE on the door. Peels it off. The HANDLE 
           revealed. PULLS it -- KAAAAABOOOOOOM! -- a BALL OF FIRE
           leaving nothing behind but twisted metal and charred bones. 
           We’ve seen enough, returning...

           ...to the HANGAR, where we finally hear Hoof’s answer:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Bridge on the River Kwai big.

           That is big. Blu can’t help but beam. All done, Hoof covers 
           the HANDLE (detonator) with a piece of RED TAPE.

           THE TIBESTI MOUNTAINS (BORDERING CHAD AND LIBYA)

           (Note: If you want to know what the Tibesti Mountains look 
           like, just pop in Star Wars and fast-forward to the part 
           where Luke gets his ass handed to him by the Sand People. 
           That’s pretty much it.)

           Parked on a peak is the Toyota Hillux. Lord knows how the 
           hell they got it up there. The Toubou Driver waiting on the 
           hood, puffing on a stick of ganja. Blu actually brought a 
           lawn chair, and a cooler. He sits in the former, grabs a beer 
           from the latter, looking primed for a tailgate party. 

           Perched on the ledge is Hoof, his trusty Model 70 on a 
           tripod, aimed at the ants far below... 
           THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: We see the ants up close. Felix 
           Malloum backed by CHADIAN SOLDIERS in Guerilla gear. Waiting 
           beside a HELICOPTER (the Jet Ranger rigged with C-4). A TRUCK 
           arriving. The Soldiers unloading MILITARY GRADE WEAPONRY from 
           the back. Rimbaud exiting the front. AND HIS WIFE AND YOUNG 
           SON RIGHT BEHIND!!!

           HOOF

           Struck white:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What the hell are they doing here?

           Blu looking through his binoculars: 

                                 BIG BLU
                        Who?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        His wife and kid. They’re not 
                        supposed to be here.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Receives a briefcase from Malloum. Flips it open. Flush with 
           CASH. Notices his Young Son by the HELICOPTER. The kid can’t 
           wait to get inside; it’s almost identical to the one he got 
           for his birthday, only bigger. Rimbaud can’t help but smile.

           HOOF 

           Quickly loads a ROUND in the chamber.

                                 BIG BLU
                        What are you doing?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        If he sets that off, they’re all 
                        dead.

                                 BIG BLU
                        But if he doesn’t...?

           Hoof pulls back the bolt, RACKING the round, ready to fire.  

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I’m not killing a kid.

                                 BIG BLU
                        You mean, not another one.
           Hoof shoots him a look, a heart-stopper. And Blu nearly shits
           his pants:

                                 BIG BLU (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Hoof. It was a joke. Do what 
                        you have to. But just make sure you 
                        tag that French fuck. I need him 
                        gone. Yesterday.

           Hoof flicks the SAFETY off.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Shaking Malloum’s hand. Heading for the Helicopter. His Young 
           Son jumping up and down. Can’t wait to get inside.

           HOOF

           Taking aim. Blu over his shoulder:

                                 BIG BLU 
                        That looks pretty far.

           It is. 2,500 yards to be exact. A hell of a shot.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Looking inside. It’s empty. Scans the vast desert for the 
           pilot. His Young Son tugging at his pant leg.

           HOOF

           Starting to sweat. His eyes starting to burn. Gauging the 
           distance. Factoring in the wind. Anticipating Rimbaud’s every 
           move/gesture, one inch is a mile at this range--

                                 BIG BLU
                        Has anyone ever even made a shot 
                        like this before?

           Hoof’s concentration breaking. Can feel Blu hovering:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No.

           Hoof taking a deep breath. Steadying himself. Continuing via 
           VOICE-OVER:
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That was a fact. No one had. It 
                        would be a record. A goddam
                        miracle. Two-thousand and five-
                        hundred yards...

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Notices the RED TAPE. Peels it away. Reveals the HANDLE. His 
           Young Son trying to grab a hold. But it’s just out of reach.

           Rimbaud picking him up. The kid’s tiny fingers finding the 
           detonator, ready to pull -- SPLAT! -- Rimbaud’s head 
           EXPLODING like one of Gallagher’s grapefruits. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...record set...

           Rimbaud collapsing. His Young Son still in his arms. His Wife 
           SCREAMING. The Soldiers scattering.

           HOOF

           Taking a deep breath. All done. Blu dropping his binocs, 
           disappointed -- wasn’t as big as he’d wanted.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...a record I held for nearly five 
                        whole seconds. As I said, Rimbaud
                        was like Big Blu in every way. And 
                        like Big Blu, he too, had his very 
                        own “long distance bodyguard”...

           Hoof hears something. A WHISTLING. Realizes what it is. But 
           it’s too late. A deer caught in the headlights -- WHACK! -- 
           an EXPLOSION of red, Hoof propelled backwards--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...a helluva shooter. Broke my 
                        record by three inches. And my 
                        collarbone in three places.  

           --WHAM! Hoof BOUNCING off the truck. LANDING in the sand. 
           Coughs some up. Some blood, too. Hears more WHISTLING!

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

           Blu does as he’s told. Unfortunately, the Driver doesn’t 
           speak a lick of English -- SPLAT! -- brain-batter and a 
           BULLET out the back. 
           Hoof crawling to his RIFLE, leaving a snail-trail of red in 
           his wake. BULLETS BUZZING. ROCKS EXPLODING. Pops a single 
           shell in the chamber, pulls back the bolt, adjusts his aim...    

           THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: Rimbaud’s LONG DISTANCE BODYGUARD 
           revealed, aiming his high-powered rifle right this way -- 
           BANG! -- the SOUND of Hoof’s bullet. The distance is far. 
           Takes about three seconds for Hoof’s slug to finally find its 
           target -- SPLAT! -- like cracking an egg with an anvil.

                                 BIG BLU (O.S.)
                        Did you get him?

           HOOF

           Sits up. Not looking so hot. A cautious Blu peeking out from 
           underneath the truck:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Hey Hoof, you okay?

           Hoof lifting his RIFLE one more time. Looking through the 
           sight, finding...

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Dead in the sand. His Young Son hysterical. His wife tugging 
           at the child, trying to get him to let go. But he won’t. He 
           won’t let go of his father. 

           HOOF

           Dropping his weapon. Closing his eyes. And collapsing hard.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           BUNGALOW. BEDROOM

           Hoof waking. Bandaged-up and sore as hell. A box fan BUZZING 
           in his ear. Big Blu seated beside him, taking notice:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Thank god you’re awake. About time.

           Hoof takes in his surroundings. Minimal, to say the least. 
           But still, 5-Star status in 1970’s South America. And then he 
           remembers, lurching forward in a cold-sweat:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        The kid? What happened to the kid!?
                                 BIG BLU
                        Nothing. Jesus, calm down. He’s 
                        fine. You got Rimbaud, and they got 
                        gone. Nice shot, by the way. You 
                        could hit a flea off a tick’s ass--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So, where the hell are we.

                                 BIG BLU
                        Where extradition is sacrilege. 
                        Where escaped Nazis go to spend 
                        their golden years. Where even the 
                        great Hoof Harrington isn’t worth a 
                        second look.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Brazil.

                                 BIG BLU
                        Sao Paulo to be exact. It got ugly 
                        back there. Had to get you out 
                        quick. Played hot potato with your 
                        ass all the way here. You’re going 
                        to need to lay low. Heal-up. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        For how long?

                                 BIG BLU
                        Long enough for you to get some 
                        much needed R & R.

           Big Blu gets up, turns on the TV: the BRAZILIAN WALTER 
           CRONKITE reporting on Alias Arthur Rimbaud’s murder. Blu pats 
           a stack of cruzeiros (Brazilian banknotes): 

                                 BIG BLU (CONT’D)
                        I left you more than enough dough 
                        for a dump like this. If you need 
                        more, wire me. I also left you a 
                        pair of trunks. Enjoy yourself.

           And with that, Blu is out the door. Hoof left alone, staring 
           at those “trunks” (a floral swimsuit hanging from a chair). 

           SAO PAULO BEACH

           Hoof wearing those swim trunks. A matching floral button-up 
           as well. His arm in a sling. No longer looking like Hoof, 
           looking more like a poor man’s Magnum P.I.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I tried to do as Blu said. But it 
                        wasn’t easy. Enjoying myself wasn’t 
                        really my thing.

           Waiting at a BAR. The shanty kind with no inside. Just an 
           awning, some stools, and a BARTENDER. Hoof handed a drink. 
           Something fruity with an umbrella and a straw. No way in hell 
           he ordered this. Looks like he’s going to kill the Bartender, 
           decides to take a sip instead, nearly spits it out...

           A COUPLE strolling by, al naturale, not a stitch of clothing. 
           The man’s junk just hanging out. Hoof eyeing the rest of the 
           locale. Disgusted. It’s a goddam NUDIST BEACH.

           Hoof suddenly distracted by something else, something more 
           frightening than uncovered penises... 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And then I saw her... 

           The most beautiful woman Hoof has even seen, staring back. 
           CATHERINE ELIZABETH in a one-piece. The only other person who 
           bothered to dress today. She releases a smile. Hoof tries to 
           return it, problem is, he hasn’t had much practice.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and everything changed.

           A FANCY RESTAURANT

           The BRAZILIAN WAYNE NEWTON croons something American in 
           Portuguese. Hoof and Catherine seated in the back. A candle 
           illuminating their faces. An apparent staring contest has 
           ensued.

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        So what do you do, Hoof?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I’m retired.

           An exchange of smiles. The first genuine smile we’ve seen 
           Hoof wear.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And as soon as I said it, I was.

           Catherine takes Hoof’s hand. And before he knows it, he’s on 
           the dance floor, being taught the Texas two-step. It’s 
           simple, but he’s a slow learner, stepping on her toes. She 
           just giggles, doesn’t seem to mind at all. 
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was whatever she needed me to be. 

           She rests her head against his shoulder. And he rests his 
           cheek against her hair.

           A CATHEDRAL

           Hoof and Catherine standing before A PRIEST. Coop the only 
           other person in attendance, handing over a ring. Hoof putting 
           it on his wife’s finger. A kiss follows.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Six months later I was a husband.

           HARRINGTON’S ESTATE. THE BABY’S ROOM

           Hoof and Catherine putting their BABY in a crib. Cooing, 
           giving kisses, all sorts of stuff you’d never expect Hoof to 
           do. Turning off the lights on their way out, pausing at the 
           door. Admiring their son one more time, hand in hand.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        A year after that I was a father. 
                        And for a little while, I was the 
                        happiest sonuvabitch alive.

           INT. MOTEL. ROOM. DAY

           A CLOCK RADIO SOUNDS. Hoof waking. Admiring his new 
           residence. Your standard $79 a nighter. Current time: Today.

           MOTEL. DINING AREA

           Hoof in aviator shades. Eating his complimentary breakfast. A 
           herd of OUT-OF-TOWNERS in tourist tees and sweatpants 
           pilfering the buffet with their fat fingers. Hoof trying not 
           to notice. Instead, concentrating on Guignol’s BUSINESS CARD:

                                    BANG! YOU’RE DEAD.

           Pshaw. Puts the card away. Moves on to today’s pills.

           MOTEL. ROOM

           Hoof unpacking his boxes, settling in. Replacing a painting 
           on the wall with his CHALKBOARD. Stares at it. Gets an idea. 
           Starts to jot stuff down: lines, numbers, shapes. 
           A LITTLE LATER

           The CHALKBOARD now completely filled. To the layman it might 
           appear to be the musings of an architect, or a physicist, or 
           maybe even a football coach; anything but the handiwork of a 
           highly skilled assassin. But that’s what it is.

           Hoof seated at the table. Been there a while. TYPING away. 
           Adding another page to his growing STACK.

           A KNOCK at the door. Hoof griping his PISTOL.

           Checks the peephole -- sighs -- opens the door as far as the 
           CHAIN LOCK will allow.

           TWO PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS in tweed and polyester. They flash 
           their shields. Hoof too tired to flash anything. Holsters his 
           piece and unhooks the chain. 

           EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT. DAY

           Hoof outside. Hesitating. Everything Hoof tries to avoid is 
           in that building there. The Plainclothes Officers holding the 
           door open. Against better judgement, he goes inside.

           INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT. OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

           Hoof led inside. Two chairs facing an oak desk. “Take a 
           seat.” He does. And the Plainclothes Officers close the door. 

           Left alone, he scans the cluttered office. Noticing PHOTOS. 
           All of Tony T. Apparently, he’s a cop (actually, Chief of 
           Police). And this is his office. Hoof doesn’t seem surprised. 

           Instead, he’s fixated on particular picture: Tony T with 
           Maddie. He’s seen it before. It’s the one that got him to 
           kill Blu’s son. Hoof letting the image soak in: the little 
           girl with her father -- so happy -- no idea what life had in 
           store for them-- 

                                 TONY T
                        Hoof Harrington!

           --Tony T charging inside. Hoof on his feet, extending a hand, 
           getting a bear-hug instead. Tony overcome with emotion, 
           practically lifting him off the ground. Hoof not the touchy-
           feely type, wants no part of this, but has no choice. 

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        So good to see you, Hoof. 
           Tony getting a hold of himself, claiming the chair behind the 
           desk. Hoof taking a seat, getting to the point:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So what can I do for you?

                                 TONY T
                        Do for me? I don’t think so. You’re 
                        done doing for me. It’s my turn to 
                        do for you. 

           Hoof doesn’t get it.

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        I took the call last night. I saw 
                        your place. And the mess you left. 

           Now he does. He was expecting that, but hoping against it. He 
           prepares for the inevitable, gets in “interrogation mode”. 
           Puts on his poker-face, one of his better ones.

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        Kind of surprised. Didn’t think 
                        beheadings were part of your M.O., 
                        a lady no less -- Jesus, Hoof -- 
                        But not to worry. The lease was 
                        under another name. Still is, by 
                        the way. And you wiped everything 
                        clean. Did a pretty good job of it 
                        too, almost left it spotless.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        ...almost...

           Tony T grins. Pulls out a piece of paper. Hands it over: 

                                 TONY T
                        You left that. Never took you as 
                        the tell-all type.

           It’s one of Hoof’s typewritten sheets. We see the heading: 
           GREATEST HIT NO. 4: SON OF BIG BLU. Filthy with fingerprints, 
           names, and dates. Hoof can’t put it away fast enough.

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        But that’s not why I brought you 
                        here. I brought you here so I could 
                        tell you I know about Big Blu. I 
                        know he’s turned you into a scratch-
                        off ticket. And I know it’s because 
                        of what you did for me and my 
                        Maddie. But most importantly, I 
                        brought you here so you could tell 
                        me what you need.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I don’t need anything.

                                 TONY T
                        You sure about that?

           Hoof nods. Tony T gives him a hard look, gauges his 
           sincerity. But Hoof is a hard read, especially when he’s in 
           “interrogation mode”.

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        Live by the sword, die by the 
                        sword. Is that the plan? 

           Hoof pleads the Fifth. And Tony plops his penny loafers on 
           the desk, leans back, and decides to get all anecdotal on 
           Hoof’s ass:

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        You’ve heard of Evel Knievel, 
                        right? Used to jump cars for a 
                        living, sometimes canyons, 
                        sometimes sharks; would jump just 
                        about anything if you paid him 
                        enough. And he did it with nothing 
                        but a helmet, an American flag, and 
                        a two-wheeler--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I know who Evel Knievel is.

                                 TONY T
                        But did you know he holds the World 
                        Record for broken bones? It’s true. 
                        Four-hundred-and-thirty-one 
                        fractures in 1972 alone. That’s 
                        some serious wear-and-tear. You’d 
                        think enough to kill him. But you’d 
                        be wrong. Because it wasn’t a 
                        single crash, or concussion, or 
                        even a coma that put Evel under. 
                        You know what it was? 

           Hoof couldn’t care less.

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        Cock-rot. A goddam STD. Hepatitis 
                        C. Went through two livers before 
                        finally calling it quits. Stunt 
                        after stunt after stunt, and 
                        barebacking the wrong piece of ass 
                        is what finally got him.

                        Live by the sword, die by a bolt of 
                        lighting, or a slip in the shower, 
                        or a tumor in the brain. But rarely 
                        the way you want, or expect. Some 
                        up-and-comer looking to make a 
                        name? Probably not. A grieving 
                        father looking for revenge? 
                        Doubtful. Someone, or something you 
                        least expect? More than likely. 
                        Point is, you got shit coming after 
                        you from every corner, whether you 
                        know it or not. Some you’ll see, 
                        some you won’t. Those you won’t, 
                        that’s when you’ll need me. 

           Tony T turning to the portrait on his desk. The one of him 
           with his little girl. Hoof’s poker-face peeling away...

                                 TONY T (CONT’D)
                        Now, I know I’ll never be able to 
                        repay you for what you’ve done. But 
                        that doesn’t mean I can’t try. So, 
                        whenever you finally wise-up and 
                        realize you do need help, don’t you 
                        dare hesitate to ask. You got me?

           INT. VIDEO-TASTIC. DAY

           The type of mom & pop shop Blockbuster made extinct a decade 
           before Netflix did unto them. Wall-to-wall shelving filled 
           with dusty VHS BOXES. Old-school titles like Chopping Mall, 
           Neon Maniacs, Bloodsucking Freaks, etc. Not a customer in 
           sight. Never is. Just a lone clerk... 

           DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN in lace gloves and leggings. A 
           tulle tutu with a corset top. Red lips under a Maybelline
           mole. Smacking on a wad of Wrigley’s, flipping through the 
           latest issue of Cosmo, not bothering to look up when the door 
           JANGLES and...

           Hoof marches in, indiscriminately grabbing a rental from the 
           shelf, plopping it down on the counter.

                                 DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN
                        You gotta membership?

           Hoof pulls out a CARD, and the Material Girl finally takes 
           notice. Watermarked and laminated: the Video-Tastic logo 
           along with a set of numbers and letters. She types the 
           sequence into an old-school TI/99 and a confirmation appears:

                        Wait right here.
           She disappears, returns with the UKRAINIAN BEN GAZZARA. 
           Intimidating, even with the coonskin toupee, the butterfly 
           collar, and the Yakov Smirnoff accent: 

                                 UKRAINIAN BEN GAZZARA
                        Can I help you?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I need to see Raketa.

           Ukranian Gazzara smiles:

                                 UKRAINIAN BEN GAZZARA
                        I do not know anyone by that name. 
                        Perhaps there’s something I can 
                        help you with. 

           Another smile from Gazzara. Hoof sizing him up. Not much to 
           size up, so he gets to it:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Let’s cut it with the cloak and 
                        dagger shit, okay? I’m on a 
                        schedule. And I don’t have time for 
                        this. I need to speak to Raketa.
                        And I need to speak to him now.

           The man takes a breath. A deep one. Probably counting to ten 
           in his head. Not used to being talked to this way. Hoof 
           doesn’t seem to notice or care, just taps his watch:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Today, comrade.

           Gazzara keeping his cool:

                                 UKRAINIAN BEN GAZZARA
                        Hands on your head, feet apart.

           Hoof assumes the position and Gazzara gives him a pat-down. 
           Discovers a PISTOL -- one of Hoof’s handmade specials.

           INT. VIDEO-TASTIC. WAREHOUSE. CONTINUOUS

           Hoof escorted into the back -- a warehouse full of MILITARY 
           GRADE WEAPONRY, namely EXPLOSIVES, some of which are being 
           loaded onto Sara Lee trucks. Not a videotape in sight.

                                 RAKETA
                        Hoof Harrington, you old 
                        sonuvabitch...
           More 80s Flashback. RAKETA sucking on a Rocket Pop, backed by 
           6 SLAVIC SPRINGSTEENS circa ‘84. All wearing acid-washed 
           denim -- jackets, jeans, and button-ups -- one asshole even 
           has on a headband. The TWO HAIRIEST step forward, stopping 
           Hoof cold.

                                 RAKETA (CONT’D)
                        ...how are you still alive?

           Ukrainian Gazzara tosses Hoof’s handmade PIECE. Raketa
           catches it, admires it, gets some popsicle juice on it:

                                 RAKETA (CONT’D)
                        You make this? 

           Hoof nods. And Raketa makes a fart noise with his mouth:

                                 RAKETA (CONT’D)
                        This is America, man. Here, if you 
                        need a gun you don’t build one. You 
                        just pick one from the trees.

           The Slavs laugh. Hoof doesn’t:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        It’s a Borz, what the Chechens use 
                        against the Russi--

                                 RAKETA
                        I know what a fucking Borz is, man. 

           Suddenly serious. No more laughter. Just hard faces. Hoof 
           uneasy, scanning the armory for a way out. There isn’t one. 
           Raketa doing his best Tony Montana:

                                 RAKETA (CONT’D)
                        But what I don’t know is, why 
                        shouldn’t I just kill you dead. 
                        Right here, right now. And collect 
                        that bounty from Big Blu.

           The 6 Slavs (7 counting Gazzara) COCKING their ASSAULT 
           RIFLES. Very dramatic. Desired effect reached: Hoof with the 
           hard swallow, eyes locking in with Raketa’s. Just one word 
           and it’s all over. Hoof taking a breath, making his play:  

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Because you want him dead. 

           Raketa forces a laugh. Some of the Slavs join it. Hoof 
           doesn’t. He’s fucking serious.

                                 RAKETA
                        Now why would I want Big Blu dead?
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Because you’re Pepsi and he’s Coke. 
                        Because he’s got the market 
                        cornered and you don’t. Because 
                        what you’re making right now is 
                        chickenfeed compared to what you 
                        could be making. And because this 
                        is America, man. And here, if you 
                        can’t compete, you merge. If you 
                        can’t merge, you take-over. And if 
                        you can’t take-over, then you find 
                        someone who can. 

                                 RAKETA
                        And that someone is you?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That someone is me. That’s what I 
                        do. I’m a proxy. I take him out. 
                        And you take over.

                                 RAKETA
                        Let’s say you’re right. Let’s say 
                        all I need is Big Blu out of the 
                        way. Why can’t I just do it myself?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Because if you did, it would start 
                        a war. And that kind of war would 
                        be bad for business. 

           Raketa sucking on his Rocket Pop, considering Hoof’s 
           proposal. 

           The 7 Slavs, their rifles ready, waiting for orders. 

           A taut beat (or two) before Raketa’s silver caps finally 
           shine. His smile turning into a laugh. A hearty one. The 7 
           Slavs following his lead. Guffaws all around.

                                 RAKETA
                        You got some balls on you, old man. 
                        So what do you need?

           Hoof taking a breath, not big enough to show his hand, but 
           big enough to keep from passing out.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Plastiques in porridge form: hot, 
                        cold, and just right.

           Raketa a bit surprised. That’s a tall order, and a strange 
           one for Hoof.
                                 RAKETA
                        Anything else?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And a cooler, if you got one.

           Even stranger.

           INT. DIVE BAR. DAY

           Hoof’s hands inside a MINI ICE CHEST, molding a BRICK OF C-4.
           Attaching the BLASTING CAP to the DETONATOR. Apparently, 
           Raketa came through with the plastiques and the cooler.

           Gus watching from the other side, understandably uneasy. 

           Coop studying Guignol’s BUSINESS CARD. Holding it up to the 
           light, inspecting it.

                                 COOP
                        I don’t get it. He saved your life. 
                        Then he threatened it. Then he gave 
                        you this? 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That’s about it.

                                 COOP
                        But he didn’t give you a name? 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No, he gave me a name. Grand Goon, 
                        Granny Goo-ball, something like 
                        that.

           Coop struck-frozen, all the color leaving his face:

                                 COOP
                        ...Grand Guignol?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yeah, that’s it. 

                                 COOP
                        And he told you he was going to 
                        kill you.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yep. In three days. Unless I kill 
                        Big Blu.
           Coop looks winded, even sick. Gus taking notice, instantly 
           forgetting the highly explosive material in Hoof’s hands, 
           focusing on the much worse sounding Grand Guignol instead:

                                 GUS
                        What? Who is he?

                                 COOP
                        You know how people are always 
                        wondering what would happen if 
                        Superman and Wonder Woman had a 
                        baby. Well, Grand Guignol is what 
                        would happen if Hoof Harrington 
                        and... I don’t know, Annie Oakley, 
                        had a baby. 

                                 GUS
                        Holy shit. He’s a super assassin.

           Coop gives a slow nod, the kind reserved for funerals and 
           wakes. 

           Hoof just rolls his eyes, takes a break from the C-4 to give 
           himself a re-fill. Has to, Gus is too busy wrapping his mind 
           around the whole “super assassin” thing to do anything else.

                                 COOP
                        I always thought he was a myth, 
                        like some sharp-shooting Sasquatch. 
                        Or a fairy tale invented by 
                        European handlers to ward off 
                        American competition -- like a 
                        Golem with a gun. Hoof, you got to 
                        end this. This is worse than an 
                        open contract. Having every wannabe 
                        with a pistol auditioning to be you 
                        is one thing. That, you can handle. 
                        But this guy... Grand Guignol, he’s 
                        a whole other breed. He’s the real 
                        deal. He doesn’t have to audition. 
                        He’s already got the part.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        If he’s so goddam great, then why 
                        haven’t I heard of him?

                                 COOP
                        Because it’s not 1976. And you’re 
                        not really up to snuff on the 
                        current feed.

           It’s true. He isn’t. Shrugs it off. Kind of proud of the 
           fact.
                                 GUS
                        So, what has he done?

                                 COOP
                        It’s not what he’s done, it’s how 
                        he’s done it. The first time I 
                        heard of him was about five, six 
                        years ago. There was this job 
                        making the rounds... 

           PRISON CELL (SOLITARY CONFINEMENT)

           A BOX wrapped in twine. ANOTHER 300 POUND SAMOAN on a cot (a 
           Tweedledee to the earlier Tweedledum), very similar scenario. 

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        ...It was a target in a box. With a 
                        real specific client. He wanted no 
                        outsourcing. That meant no guards 
                        or inmates could pinch-hit. Had to 
                        be a hundred percent professional. 
                        The client wanted there to be no 
                        question he’d ordered the hit.  

           The Samoan opens the box: A KEY, A KNIFE, and A CAR KEY.

           PRISON CORRIDOR

           The Samoan holding the KNIFE against the Warden’s throat, 
           heading for the EXIT. The Guards following. The Prisoners 
           CHEERING from their cells.

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        So Guignol set a plan in motion: 
                        get the target to leave the box.

           STATE PEN

           The Samoan and the Warden outside. A gate separating them 
           from the Guards. The Samoan flashing a smile. And we wait for 
           that bullet we know is coming...

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        But getting the target out of the 
                        box wasn’t enough. Guignol wanted 
                        more than just a clear shot.

           No bullet. Just an ESCALADE parked out front. The Samoan 
           pulls out the CAR KEY. And right there on the handle, 
           wouldn’t you know it, a Caddy symbol.
                                 COOP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He knew the target’s wife and 
                        children had recently moved, 
                        relocated to be closer to their 
                        father. 

           THE ESCALADE

           The Samoan behind the wheel, literally SCREAMING with joy! 
           Yippie-ki-yay!!! A freeman gunning it all the way...

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        And he knew the target wouldn’t 
                        leave without his family. 

           HOME

           The Samoan’s. He enters with the biggest smile of his life. 
           Belts out his best Ricky Ricardo: 

                                 300 POUND SAMOAN
                        Honey, I’m home!!!

           And then, it’s gone. The biggest smile ever, replaced by 
           something indescribable--

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        So Guignol had the target come to 
                        him.

           --his house redecorated with the body parts of his family. 
           Imagine Dahmer getting into Dadaism: a wall-to-wall collage 
           of organs and limbs. We only see a glimpse, but it’s enough 
           to know we don’t want to see anymore.

                                 COOP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And Guignol went well beyond what 
                        was required. 

           And from the shadows, the artist appears -- Grand Guignol -- 
           Keyser Soze in an undertaker’s uniform. A bloody HATCHET in 
           his hand, by far the least bloody thing on him. He’s drenched 
           in the shit.

                                 300 POUND SAMOAN
                        But why...?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Because practice makes perfect.

           Guignol tosses one of his BUSINESS CARDS. The Samoan SCREAMS. 
           And Guignol goes to work -- CHOPPITY-CHOP-CHOP!
                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        Guignol spent the next five years 
                        honing his skills. Making a name 
                        for himself. Each hit more brutal 
                        than the last.

                                                               BACK TO:

           DIVE BAR

           Coop finishing his story. Gus about to wet himself. 

                                 COOP
                        But now the question is, why does 
                        he want Blu dead? And why doesn’t 
                        he do it himself?

                                 GUS
                        Who cares? Just do what he says.

           All eyes turning to Hoof. But he’s already out the door.

           EXT. PARTY STORE. DAY

           One of many STORES on this busy strip. Hoof exiting with his 
           gear: the mini ice chest, his attache case, and now a ton of 
           helium-filled BALLOONS.

           Stops at a payphone.

           Flips through the Yellow Pages. 

           Finds PIZZA DELIVERY.

           Dials the first set of numbers he sees.

           INT. TREE HOUSE. DAY

           Wood planks forming four walls and a floor. A tin roof 
           overhead. Enough room for 3, maybe 4 kids. But not nearly 
           enough for Hoof, squatting beside the window. 

           Tying the helium-filled BALLOONS to the mini ICE CHEST. 

           Finished. He aims his RIFLE. Using the scope to see...

           A DISTANT ROAD

           Empty asphalt. At least two football fields away. And...
           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           TWO GUARDS at the gate. ONE GUARD on the roof. And Mike 
           watching from the WINDOW. Same set-up as last time.

           HOOF

           Checking his watch. It’s almost time. He attaches TWO THINGS 
           to the ice chest:

                    1. A TINY BUTTON (detonator). Duct-taping it to the 
                       inside of the handle.

                    2. A HANDHELD FAN -- the battery-operated kind. 
                       Duct-taping it to the back, upside down, like 
                       the motor on a speed boat. 

           Gauging the wind with a finger -- there is none -- he 
           releases the contraption into the air like some make-shift 
           homing pigeon.

           THE ICE CHEST

           Floating with purpose. The BALLOONS keeping it above the 
           trees. The HANDHELD FAN keeping it on schedule. The CHEST 
           keeping it from leaving the atmosphere.

           HOOF

           With the RIFLE. Hand to stock. Finger to trigger. Eye to 
           scope. Aimed at...

           THE DISTANT ROAD

           A HATCHBACK appearing. A sign on the side: PIZZA DELIVERY. 
           Heading straight for...

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           The Guards at the gate. ONE noticing the Hatchback. The OTHER 
           noticing something in the sky.

           The Hatchback pulling up. The Guard questioning the DRIVER, 
           asking him to step outside.

           HOOF 

           Two hundred yards away. Ready, aim -- Pfftt!
           THE ICE CHEST

           POP!POP!POP! Balloons BURSTING. Plummeting towards... 

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           WHAM! Landing HARD on the front lawn. The Gate Guard busy 
           with the Driver. The Window Guard (aka Mike) busy with his 
           walkie. The Roof Guard noticing...

           THE OTHER GUARD 

           Giving the fallen ICE CHEST a tap with his foot. 

           Then, another.

           Grabbing the handle. 

           The Roof Guard SHOUTING for him to stop.

           Too late -- THE TINY BUTTON DETONATED -- KABOOOOOOM! -- flesh 
           confetti and flames. The Guard gone. Just a patch of charred 
           earth where he once stood. 

           A hornet’s nest struck -- MORE GUARDS FROM INSIDE -- forming 
           flanks. Their RIFLES searching for a target. A mini-militia 
           of about FIFTEEN -- well-trained and ready.

           HOOF

           Taken aback. Wasn’t expecting that. Way more guards than he 
           had anticipated. Way better prepared, too. Realization 
           hitting quick: he doesn’t stand a chance.

           THE WINDOW GUARD 

           (aka MIKE) now on the lawn. Raising his RIFLE -- BANG!  

           HOOF

           Watching through the scope. Hearing something familiar. THAT 
           GODDAM WHISTLING SOUND -- BAM! -- KNOCKED off his feet. A 
           RINGING in his head. Cupping his ear. Bloody but intact. Just 
           a flesh-wound. Taking a deep breath. Collecting himself...

           BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM! -- MORE BULLETS! -- Hoof flat on the 
           floor. Planks pelted with lead. Splintered wood raining down. 

           Hoof leaping for the ladder. Missing it...
           BACKYARD

           ...landing with a THUD. TWO WIDE-EYED KIDS, watching in awe 
           as their TREE HOUSE gets shot to shit. Easily the coolest 
           thing they’ve ever seen. 

           Hoof over the fence. Running for dear life. Now, he’s 
           certain: he doesn’t stand a chance in hell. 

           INT. APPLIANCE STORE. BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR. NIGHT

           Coop behind the desk, pitching to a client. A blonde-haired, 
           blue-eyed twenty-something dressed like a BACKLOT NATIVE 
           AMERICAN: feathers, war-paint, suede pants with ribbon trim, 
           and a pair of matching moccasins.

           Hoof on the payphone. His collar up. His ear bandaged. His

                        What does that mean?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That means he’s gone Colonel Kurtz. 
                        He’s got his own little Blackwater 
                        in there, a bunch of itchy-fingered 
                        vets just waiting to break the 
                        Geneva Convention on some asshole.

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        Need I remind you: Escobar had an 
                        army.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Need I remind you: I was backed by 
                        the entire Columbian National 
                        Police Force when I took that shot. 
                        Now, I’m backed by a heart stent
                        and more arthritis than a packmule.

                                 COOP (V.O.)
                        Look, it’s like they say, when what 
                        you want is inside a box and you’re 
                        not...

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                             (pause)
                        Fuck you, Coop.

           Hoof hangs up. Takes a breath. And ducks through the SLIDING 
           DOORS.

           INT. PHARMACY. CONTINUOUS

           Muzak in the air. Aisles of powder, pills, and junk food. A 
           GROUP gathered around the PHOTO COUNTER. Hoof among them. 

           The doors SLIDING open. A COWBOY making an entrance. A ten 
           gallon hat on his head. Five o’clock shadow on his face. A 
           sheepskin vest over a shit-kicker shirt. The Marlboro Man 
           lives and breathes, and he’s on the hunt. Spurs JANGLING. 
           Eyes scanning the store, stopping on...

           HOOF 

           Spotting The Cowboy’s belt. TWO SIX-SHOOTERS hitched to a 
           rodeo buckle. The word HITMAN engraved in gold. 

           THE COWBOY

           Pulling out a WANTED POSTER. Double-checking. It’s a SKETCH 
           of Hoof. Not the best representation. But it could be him.

           Their eyes locking. Like the last reel of any Leone flick. 

           HOOF

           Ready. His fingers twitching, itching for the draw. He knows 
           that look, worn it himself many times.
           THE COWBOY

           Taking a stance. Thumbing the handle of his holstered piece. 
           The OK Corral in 3, 2--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Joel McCrea?

           All eyes on the CLERK holding stacks and stacks of PHOTO 
           ENVELOPES. He reads the name again: 

                                 PHOTO CLERK
                        Joel McCrea?

           Hoof to the counter, paying for his items. The Cowboy 
           reluctantly moving on, searching for that elusive Hoof 
           Harrington. 

           INT. MOTEL. ROOM. NIGHT

           The door opening. And a gloomy Hoof entering. 

           Plops down on the bed. A PHOTO ALBUM in his lap. Flipping 
           through... PHOTOS of Neil Nantz at different stages of his 
           life... all taken with a telephoto lens.

           Hoof opening the ENVELOPES he just bought. Sifting through 
           one: MORE “STAKE-OUT” PHOTOS of Neil. Hoof placing a select 
           few inside his ALBUM, admiring them. A sadness in his eyes, 
           more than usual. Has to look away...

           Notices the CHALKBOARD. A clusterfuck of scribblings and 
           schematics. All nagging reminders of the mission at hand. 

           Frustrated. He erases them. Writes one word:  

                                      IMPOSSIBLE!!!

           Over his shoulder, the bathroom door opening. A SHAPE 
           emerging from within. Coming hard. Coming fast. 

           Hoof’s Spidey-sense tingling. But it’s too late -- a SYRINGE 
           to the neck -- propofol INJECTED. Hoof out like a light.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           HOOF

           Seated at a table. Waking to the sound of TYPING. A HATCHET 
           within reach. But he can’t reach it. He’s tied-up with rope.
           Grand Guignol (pronounced Grahn Geen-yahl) seated across from 
           him. Using his typewriter. Wearing the same undertaker’s 
           outfit he always wears. Reads what he just wrote:

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        “How many babies does it take to 
                        paint a house?”

           Looks to Hoof for an answer. But Hoof isn’t playing along.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        Depends on how hard you throw them.

           Smiles. Rips the page from the feeder and slides it over.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        That’s for you. Free of charge. 
                        Include it with “The Winslow Job”. 
                        A dead baby joke to go with your 
                        dead baby chapter. 

           Flipping through Hoof’s STACK of typewritten pages:

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        That’s what this is, right? A book. 
                        A manifesto. Hoof Harrington hoping 
                        to be the next Holden Caulfield, or 
                        the next Earl Turner, inspiring a 
                        whole new generation of Mark David 
                        Chapmans and Timothy McVeighs.

           No response from Hoof.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        Well, whatever it is, consider me a 
                        fan. Hope you can finish it in the 
                        next two days. Because that’s all 
                        you have left, old man. Two. 
                        Fucking. Days. Two days to kill Big 
                        Blu before I kill you.

           Hoof sizing his captor up. Taking his time...

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What did Blu do to you? Sell you a 
                        bad batch of guns.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Let’s just say I have my reasons. 
                        As do you. That gives us a common 
                        goal. So why not finish what you 
                        started, and make us both happy. 
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Because it’s impossible.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Define impossible.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I think you already know. I think 
                        that’s why you haven’t done it 
                        yourself. 

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Bullshit. Nothing is impossible. 
                        Not for the great Hoof Harrington.

           Hoof smiles. Then starts to laugh. A laugh that lasts way 
           longer than it should. Guignol starting to look irritated:

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        What’s so funny.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You. All of you. Young, dumb, and 
                        full of cum. Dressing up like it’s 
                        fucking Halloween, or it’s Mardis
                        Gras, or it’s your Sweet Sixteen. 

           Guignol looks at himself, costumed-up like a 19th century 
           undertaker. Hoof just getting started, growing more 
           comfortable with his captor, maybe too comfortable:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, you know what all this 
                        fluff and faggotry reminds me of? 
                        The seventies. Back then, music 
                        wasn’t about the music. It was 
                        about the spectacle. Wigs, 
                        lipstick, and leotards. You had 
                        David Bowie claiming he was from 
                        Mars, Elton John dressing like he 
                        was Donald Duck, and those KISS 
                        assholes painted-up like a bunch of 
                        Thai Town trannys I wouldn’t fuck
                        with your dick. Everybody trying to 
                        be anything but who they really 
                        were: vapid, talentless fucks. Just 
                        like you. Sequins, glitter, and no 
                        substance. 

           Guignol on his feet, grabbing the HATCHET from the table. 
           Hoof so utterly unimpressed he can hardly keep from yawning.
                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        You know, Hoof, I don’t think 
                        you’re taking me seriously.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        It’s hard to take a man seriously 
                        when he’s counting down your 
                        execution like Casey Kasem counting 
                        down the Top 40. Three days, two 
                        days...

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I thought you liked count-downs. I 
                        thought that was your thing. 
                        Greatest Hit Number Five, Greatest 
                        Hit Number Four, Greatest Hit 
                        Number Three... My apologies for 
                        the misunderstanding. Allow me to 
                        explain. It’s in my nature to 
                        prolong the inevitable, to savor 
                        it: to sniff, taste, then spit it 
                        out like a glass of bordeaux. 
                        Doesn’t matter if I’m killing the 
                        great Hoof Harrington or a goddam
                        fly. I take my time. And when I’m 
                        ready, I take it apart, piece by 
                        piece. First a wing, then a leg, 
                        then its fucking head--   

           Hoof’s hand SEIZED -- THE HATCHET SLAMMING DOWN -- CHOP! Four 
           fingers SEVERED in half. Hoof HOWLING. Guignol in his ear:

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        --take me seriously, Hoof. Do not 
                        mistake a fetish for a fear. You 
                        have two days to kill Big Blu 
                        before I kill you. Piece by piece.

           Hoof’s heart POUNDING. His stent throbbing. Biting down, 
           trying to control his breathing. Guignol letting himself out:

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        Au revoir, monsieur Harrington.

           INT. HOSPITAL. OPERATING ROOM. NIGHT

           THREE FINGERS on ice. Hoof on the gurney. Coop by his side. A 
           DOCTOR reattaching Hoof’s pointer. 

                                 COOP
                        I told you he didn’t fuck around.
           Hoof biting down, refusing to comment. Gus entering with a 
           bottle of Hoof’s favorite booze -- bourbon. Fills four dixie
           cups. The Doc declining his, disapproving with a look. 

           Hoof taking one. Tossing it back. Fear showing on his face 
           for the first time in a long time. Maybe ever. 

           INT. DIVE BAR. BACK OFFICE. NIGHT

           Hoof, drunk as a skunk, stumbling inside. Propped up by a 
           sober Coop. His injured hand, a mitten of gauze. Gus 
           following, carrying one of Hoof’s BOXES, helping him move in. 
           Coop helping Hoof onto a cot. Hoof, slurring and blubbering:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Hey Coop...? You still checking in 
                        on him?

           Hoof struggling to get his boots off. His eye-hand 
           coordination taking a hit tonight. Coop helping him out:

                                 COOP
                        Who?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Neil. That’s who.

                                 COOP
                        The first Monday of every month; 
                        you know that.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How are his finances?

                                 COOP
                        Better than yours.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How about the kid? Did you set up 
                        that thing we talked about? That 
                        truck form...?

                                 COOP
                        The trust fund?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yeah, that.

                                 COOP
                        As soon as he turns eighteen he can 
                        retire.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And how are they otherwise? Are 
                        they good...? Are they doing good?

           Coop suddenly serious, if not a little exasperated:

                                 COOP
                        They’re fine, Hoof. You’ve done a 
                        real good job taking care of them.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                             (instant sulk-on)
                        Yeah, but they don’t know that.

                                 COOP
                        Doesn’t matter. Look at me...

           But Hoof can’t look, his neck is a noodle, his head all over 
           the place. So Coop grabs a hold, keeps him steady: 

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        ...it’s time you start taking care 
                        of yourself. You’re the one with a 
                        target on his ass. Not them. You 
                        got to get your head back in the 
                        game; take care of Big Blu before 
                        he takes care of you. Or worse.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I can’t. I’m too old.

                                 COOP
                        Bologna. You’re Hoof Harrington.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yeah, but maybe I got it coming. 
                        You ever thought of that?

                                 COOP
                        The only thing you got coming is a 
                        good night’s sleep.

           Hoof on the verge of tears.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I killed his son, Coop... I killed 
                        a lot of people’s sons.

           Hoof really seems eaten up by this, like he’s ready to make 
           penance. Or maybe he’s just feeling sorry for himself. It’s 
           really hard to tell when someone is this drunk. 
                                 COOP
                        You killed a pedophile who was off 
                        his leash. You did the world a 
                        favor.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        A father won’t see it that way. A 
                        father can’t see it that way.

           And with that, Coop let’s go. Hoof’s head hits the pillow and 
           he’s out. Coop and Gus putting the rest of him on the cot:

                                 GUS
                        Who‘s Neil?

           Coop isn’t listening. He’s noticed Hoof’s CHALKBOARD sticking 
           out of the box. And he doesn’t like what he sees. Erases the 
           word “IMPOSSIBLE”. Replaces it with the familiar phrase:

                                   THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

           Gus has noticed something, too. Hoof’s STACK of typewritten 
           pages. And his PHOTO ALBUM. Grabs the latter. Flips through 
           it. White patches where photos should be. But they aren’t. 
           They’re missing. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. DIVE BAR. BACK OFFICE. DAY

           Current time: Today. Hoof on the cot, waking to a RINGING 
           PHONE. Remembering last night. Ugh. A pounding in his head. 
           And cotton mouth. A hell of a hangover. Gus in the doorway:

                                 GUS
                        It’s for you.

           DIVE BAR

           The PHONE on the counter. A baggy-eyed Hoof picking it up:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Who’s this.

           GRAND GUIGNOL

           That’s who. But where he’s calling from, we can’t tell. And 
           what he’s fixated on (something in his hands), we can’t see. 
           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO:
                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        How’s the hand?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Back together again.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        It wasn’t your shooting hand was 
                        it?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        They’re both my shooting hands. Is 
                        this my daily reminder? You going 
                        to tell me how much time I have 
                        left?

           Guignol smiles.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Would it matter? You don’t really 
                        seem to care one way or the other.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        It’s not that I don’t care. It’s 
                        just that I’m old. Living doesn’t 
                        have the same appeal it once did.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        That’s what I thought. You know, 
                        when I knocked you out yesterday, I 
                        decided to seize the moment as they 
                        say. Get to know the real Hoof 
                        Harrington. Answer some questions. 
                        For instance, how come the greatest 
                        assassin of all time, and arguably 
                        the highest paid, lives like such a 
                        bum in such a shithole?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Wine and women, I guess.

           Hoof smiles. And so does Guignol, like two old friends 
           shooting the shit.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        The wine, I believe. But the women, 
                        no way. I think that torch you’ve 
                        been carrying for the past thirty-
                        odd years would burn the ass off 
                        any little bitch who got too close.

           Hoof loses the smile, doesn’t appreciate the reference:
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What’s your point.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I know about your son, Hoof. I went 
                        through that book you’re writing, 
                        and your photo album. And I finally 
                        figured it out: one-plus-one equals 
                        Neil Nantz.

           Hoof has to sit. Looking woozy. Worse than a hangover:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That doesn’t concern you.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        All your money, all you’ve ever 
                        earned, you’ve given to him. And he 
                        doesn’t even know. It’s like some 
                        fucked-up Victorian novel.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Look, you want Blu dead. He’s dead. 

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        It reminded me of my father. 

           And we finally see what Guignol is looking at, what he’s 
           holding in his hands. It’s a stolen PHOTO from Hoof’s album. 
           A younger, happier Hoof with Catherine and their Baby.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure, had he lived long enough, 
                        he would have done the same for me. 
                        I imagine there’s nothing a father 
                        wouldn’t do for his son. Nothing 
                        you wouldn’t do for Neil.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Did you hear me? I’m going to kill 
                        Blu. Consider it done. Today.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I hope for Neil’s sake, you’re 
                        right.

           Hoof is starting to tremble, his breathing heavy, hoping 
           against hope...

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Why do you say that?
                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Because if I know Blu as well as I 
                        think I do, he’s already got a 
                        contract signed, dated, and 
                        notarized.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You didn’t.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I did. Anonymously, of course. Just 
                        like last time -- when I told Blu 
                        you killed his youngest son.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        You better hurry. You still have a 
                        day left on my clock. But I imagine 
                        on Blu’s, Neil has far less.

           DIALTONE. Guignol with the hang-up. Hoof left reeling. His 
           worst fear coming true.

           INT. BIG BLU’S ESTATE. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY 

           THE PHONE RINGING. Big Blu answering:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Hello.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Blu, tear it up and I’ll do 
                        whatever you want.

           Blu knows that voice, his heart monitor RACING:

                                 BIG BLU
                        Fuck. You.

           HOOF

           Still at the bar. Desperate. His voice cracking:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Just call it off and I’ll come to 
                        you. Unarmed. You can put that 
                        goddam bullet in me yourself.

                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        Not good enough.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        He’s done nothing to you.

                                 BIG BLU (V.O.)
                        And my boy did nothing to you.

           Hoof having to bite his tongue, taking a deep breath. 
           Frustrated. Angry. Trying to stay in control.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Blu, please don’t do this.

                                 BIG BLU  (V.O.)
                        You remember the African job? You 
                        and me. That goddam desert. That 
                        helicopter ready to blow. And you 
                        wouldn’t let it. I think about that 
                        a lot. About how you couldn’t kill 
                        that French fuck’s kid.

           Hoof’s mind working...

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...Rimbaud?

           BIG BLU

           Stewing. Fuming. Ready to blow: 

                                 BIG BLU
                        Alias Arthur Rimbaud. I remember it 
                        like it was yesterday. How you 
                        couldn’t kill his son. But mine?
                        Mine, you could, no problem. You 
                        remember that? You remember how you 
                        had no fucking problem killing my 
                        boy? But his...? HIS YOU COULDN’T! 
                        BUT MINE YOU COULD! ISN’T THAT 
                        RIGHT!? ISN’T THAT RIGHT!!!?

           DIVE BAR

           No response. The phone left off its cradle. BLU’S VOICE 
           screaming for Hoof. But he’s long gone. 

           EXT. BUSY STREET. DAY

           Overcast. Burly clouds portending something god-awful. Neil 
           Nantz, Sara Nantz, and their Young Son making their way to a 
           red-brick building. A restaurant called THE BEES KNEES.
           A cautious Hoof watching from afar. His eyes peeled. 

           INT. THE BEES KNEES. CONTINUOUS

           This is the type of restaurant with glass tabletops, 
           postcards and stock photos stuck underneath. Plastic steins 
           full of soda pop placed on cardboard coasters. A color 
           coordinated staff with Oxycontin smiles. And entrees with 
           names like “Hootenanny Ham Rolls” and “Chicken & Yumplings”.  

           Hoof hovering between a hat rack and a HOSTESS. His eyes on a 
           booth in the back...

           His son, daughter-in-law, and grandson being seated.

           Hoof psyching himself up. Building up the courage to make his 
           move. Taking out his bottle of pills. Pops two.

           Neil helping his Son use crayons on a kiddies menu. His 
           attention shifting to the STRANGER hovering nearby...

           Hoof, awkward as hell, like we’ve never seen him before. 
           Having trouble getting out that first syllable.

                                 NEIL NANTZ
                        Can I help you?

           This is the first time Hoof has ever heard him speak. A 
           tremble and a smile, Hoof struggling to keep his emotions in 
           check:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I know this is strange, but you 
                        have to trust me. You’re not safe 
                        here. You need to come with me.

           Neil smiles awkwardly, can’t tell if he’s being punk’d or 
           not, looks around for the hidden cameras.

                                 NEIL NANTZ
                        What’s going on? Who are you?

           Hoof really didn’t want to tell him like this. But what 
           choice does he have? A hard swallow and a deep breath:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Look, I didn’t want you to find out 
                        like this. I wanted you to have a 
                        choice, but right now, we don’t 
                        have that luxury. So, here goes, my 
                        name is Hoof Harrington and I’m 
                        your--
                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        HOOF HARRINGTON...!!!

           All eyes on DANDY ANDY at a booth in the back. Just as Coop 
           described; a Dillinger stache, a Baby Face Nelson mug, and a 
           Damon Runyon VOICE:

                                 DANDY ANDY
                        ...YOU DIRTY RAT!!!

           Dandy with a 1926 TOMMY GUN -- RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT! -- 
           SCREAMING PATRONS. A COUPLE caught in the line of fire now a 
           Pollack painting. Hoof with a KICK -- WHAM! -- A TABLE 
           landing sideways -- BULLETS ripping into it. 

           Hoof pulling Neil and his family onto the floor -- WHAM! -- 
           another table brought to its side -- RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT! -- 
           MORE BULLETS deflected. Dandy leading his own chorus:

                                 DANDY ANDY (CONT’D)
                        My mamma, she calls me Andy! The 
                        ladies, they call me randy! The 
                        fellas, they call me dandy! But 
                        when it comes to killin’, they all 
                        call me handy!

           A Mad Hatter’s HOWL. Neil and his family terrified. Hoof with 
           the volley -- BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! -- FIRING back. Unable to 
           see his target, missing terribly. The Ghost of Gangster Past 
           moving towards the barricade. His museum piece SPITTING lead 
           and shells -- RAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT!

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Dandy!

                                 DANDY ANDY
                        Yeah!?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        If I come out, you promise to let 
                        everyone else go!?

                                 DANDY ANDY
                        Sorry, pops! No can-do! I’m not 
                        just here for you! I’m here for 
                        Neil Nantz, too! Gonna make the St. 
                        Valentine’s Day Massacre look like 
                        a Christmas Pageant! 

           HOOF 

           No longer keeping his fingers crossed. His face flooded with 
           emotion. Looking for a way out. But there isn’t one.
                                 NEIL NANTZ
                        How does he know my name?

           Good question. But there really isn’t any time to answer it. 
           A last-ditch effort by Hoof, returning FIRE with a fury -- 
           BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! -- but it’s no use. Dandy getting 
           closer... the bullets getting nearer...

           And then, SILENCE. Followed by a string of CURSES.

           DANDY ANDY

           Frustrated. His gun jammed, just as Coop predicted. SLAPPING 
           the magazine, pulling the trigger. Nothing coming out. More 
           CURSING. More SLAPPING. 

           Hoof peeking over the table... 

           Rising... 

           Approaching... 

           Dandy about to piss his pants. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to 
           hide. A gun to his head. Dropping to his knees. BEGGING like 
           Cagney in the last reel of Angels With Dirty Faces:

                                 DANDY ANDY
                        I’m sorry, Hoof. Real sorry! It was 
                        a mistake!! Ya gotta believe me--

           BANG! Curtains for Cagney. Hoof returning to his son. 
           Expecting a ticker-tape parade, getting something else 
           instead...

           Neil shot, gasping for air. A RED DOT on his chest. Getting 
           larger. Soaking through.

           Hoof in shock. Sudden paralysis. Except for his hands. 
           Shaking. It hasn’t registered yet. Not fully.

           Sara SCREAMS. Like a kettle of steam. And that does it. Hoof 
           awake. His eyes lit up. A starter pistol fired. 

           BUSY STREET

           Sara with her Young Son, CALLING after Hoof. But he doesn’t 
           stop, marching through the intersection, Neil in his arms -- 
           CARS BRAKING in the nick of time, HONKING -- Hoof heading 
           for... 
           A PARKING LOT

           Making a beeline for a COROLLA. A FAMILY OF FOUR getting out. 
           Hoof placing Neil in their backseat, lifting the keys from 
           THE FATHER’S hand-- 

                                 THE FATHER
                        Hey!

           --closing the door, starting the engine. And SPEEDING away, 
           leaving the Family in his wake. Stunned. Wondering what the 
           hell just happened.

           INT. COROLLA. SECONDS LATER

           Hoof driving like a mad man. One hand on the steering wheel. 
           The other, clutching Neil.

           EXT. HOSPITAL. MOMENTS LATER 

           The Corolla JUMPING a curb. SCREECHING to a halt.

           THE EMERGENCY ROOM

           A clusterfuck of the uninsured. The sick packed in like 
           sardines. Everyone taking a number. Hoof holding his son:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        My son needs help.

           No one hears him. The other INJURED are so much LOUDER.

           And now, Hoof has to break a rule. Getting noticed goes 
           against every fiber of his being. But he has no choice. His 
           son is dying. Eyes welling, he gives it a whirl:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        MY SON NEEDS HELP!!!!

           Success. All eyes on Hoof.

           WAITING ROOM

           Hoof in a plastic chair. Red-eyed and red-stained. His right 
           leg a piston: up and down, up and down. Coop entering:

                                 COOP
                        How is he?
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        They’ll only talk to family.

           Coop catching the irony, moving on:

                                 COOP
                        Wait here. I’ll go find out what--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I’m not waiting anymore.

           Hoof on his feet. Rage trumping reason.

                                 COOP
                        What does that mean?

           Coop knows damn-well. Hoof halfway out the door. 

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        Hoof! Don’t hit when you’re angry! 
                        That’s one of your rules, 
                        remember!?

           EXT. HOSPITAL. CONTINUOUS

           PARAMEDICS unloading a 400 POUND WOMAN from the back of an 
           AMBULANCE. Hoof making a beeline for the DRIVER. Tossing him 
           onto the pavement. Taking his place behind the wheel.

           All eyes on the jacked Ambulance SPEEDING away.

           EXT. BIG BLU’S ESTATE. NIGHT

           A starless night. Darkness set to the SOUND of crickets... 

           FLASHING LIGHTS in the distance, growing LARGER and LARGER. 
           The faint SOUND of a siren, getting LOUDER and LOUDER...

           The Gate Guard and Roof Guard taking notice...

           It’s the AMBULANCE. A raging Hoof behind the wheel. The Gate 
           Guard directing him to stop. But he doesn’t -- WHAAAAAAAM! -- 
           EXPLODING through the gate -- THUNK! -- the Guard EATING the 
           grill -- BANG!BANG!BANG! The Roof Guard SNIPING from above-- 

           Bullets RIPPING through the top. Barely missing Hoof. His 
           arms up, preparing for impact in 3, 2, 1 -- CRAAAAAAASH!

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Big Blu startled by the EXPLOSION below. Eyes on the... 
           SECURITY SCREEN 

           A B/W GRID -- 4 views of 4 rooms on a 5 second cycle. Blu 
           hits a button and we see half an AMBULANCE parked downstairs, 
           wood and brick all around, the rear tires still SPINNING.

           THE WINDOW GUARD 

           (aka MIKE), barking into his walkie:

                                 MIKE
                        TAKE HIM DOWN!!!

           DOWNSTAIRS

           The Ambulance STUCK, the motor REVVING, going nowhere. Debris 
           and dust everywhere -- WHAM!WHAM!WHAM! -- Hoof KICKING the 
           windshield. Breaks away in one piece. He climbs through--

           BANG!BANG!BANG! A swarm of INTERIOR GUARDS FIRING assault 
           weapons. Hoof FIRING back. A pistol in each hand (yeah, even 
           that one). Heading for the stairs. Finally getting a decent 
           head-count: WAY MORE GUARDS THAN HE HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT!!!

           (Note: Earlier, Hoof was overwhelmed by the prospect of 
           confronting 15 Guards. Now, he’s facing up to 40. He should 
           be freaking out right about now. But he’s not. Because right 
           now, he’s only concerned with one thing: BODY-BAGGING BLU.)

           BANG!BANG!BANG!BANG! Hoof is a fucking machine: no fear, no 
           mercy, and no pain. And they’re fish in a barrel -- ONE GUARD 
           after the other HITTING the floor, ready for the meat wagon. 

           Bullets BUZZING by. Walls RIDDLED with lead. BLAM! Hoof’s 
           shoulder SQUIRTING red. Lucky shot. Returns the favor -- 
           BANG! -- right between the eyes.

           For the first time we see what separates Hoof from the rest. 
           They’re “shooters”. And he’s a “shootist”. They pull a 
           trigger, leveling anything and everything. He pulls a 
           trigger, hitting only what he needs to. 

           BLAM! Another lucky shot. Hoof’s leg HIT. He shifts to his 
           good one. Pivots -- BANG! -- another toe to be tagged. 

           Marching onward. Full-on berserker mode. MORE GUARDS meeting 
           their maker. BLAM! Ribs CRACKING. Another bullet. This one 
           lodged deep. Not good. Blood SOAKING his shirt. GUSHING... 
           winded, swaying... finding the shooter with his piece -- 
           BANG! -- bull’s-eye. Another one bites the dust.  
           Touching A STAIR. Only 25 more to go and he’s got Blu. 
           Reloading with one hand. FIRING with the other. A hard thing 
           to do, if you’re not Hoof Harrington. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        BLU, I’M COMING FOR YOU!!!

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Blu heard that. Getting anxious. Staring at the... 

           SECURITY SCREEN

           A blood-thirsty Hoof taking the stairs. Disappearing. Off the 
           grid. The BLIND-SPOT Hoof had predicted.

                                 BIG BLU
                        Where the hell did he go!?

           MIKE

           Looking worried as well. Asks the walkie:

                                 MIKE
                        Where is he!?

           STAIRWELL

           Hoof climbing the stairs. A GUN pointed up. The other pointed 
           down -- BANG!BANG!BANG! -- FIRING at those still alive. A 
           GUARD at the top, FIRING BACK -- BAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!!

           Hoof, over the railing, hanging from the banister. The stairs 
           SHREDDED. He aims through the balusters. Stretching. His gut-
           wound opening. The Guard ready to spray again--

           BANG! Won’t get the chance. Toppling down like a limp slinky.

           Hoof with a chin-up. Wincing. That gut-shot is draining him 
           dry. MORE GUARDS below, FIRING upward.    

           MASTER BEDROOM

           The heart monitor in a FRENZY. Blu watching the...

           SECURITY SCREEN

           Hoof reappearing, limping onto the...
           SECOND FLOOR

           He made it. A bloody mess. Near death. But he made it. BLU’S 
           BEDROOM straight ahead. Hoof taking a breath. Preparing 
           himself for the final showdown. Guns COCKED and ready. 

           Goes to open it... but there’s nothing to open. NO DOORKNOB. 
           No nothing -- WHAM!WHAM!WHAM! -- KICKS having no effect -- 
           BANG!BANG!BANG! -- BULLETS even less. The door is fucking
           steel, inches deep, the kind built for a vault... 

                                 BIG BLU (O.S.)
                        Hoof Harrington, so close yet so 
                        far away.

           Hoof swaying. Light-headed. Blu’s VOICE booming from a WALL 
           SPEAKER:

                                 BIG BLU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Door only opens from the inside. 
                        Thick as my dick, too. But don’t 
                        feel bad. You never stood a chance. 

           Hoof sliding to the floor. Defeated. He can’t get in. 

           All sounds dropping out -- replaced by the RHYTHM OF HOOF’S 
           HEART -- slow and pained, the BEATS getting fewer and farther 
           between. Hoof starting to fade. His eyes fluttering. And 
           then, suddenly...  

           TONY T

           An apparition. Standing over him. 

                                 TONY T
                        Hoof, you hang in there. You hear 
                        me.

           POLICE OFFICERS rushing in with riot gear. EMTs following 
           with a stretcher. Blu CURSING. Hoof’s eyes closing.

           Everything going BLACK. A beat... then the SUPER:

                                          NO. 2

                                      DUDLEY DINKINS

           INT. COOP’S RESIDENCE. NIGHT

           Current time: 1981. Coop’s Residence reeks of the usual 80s
           era bachelor pad banalities: lots of wood paneling, lots of 
           leather, way too many Alberto Vargas prints, etc. 
           Coop sitting at the head of the table, finishing a glass of 
           Chardonnay. Seated at the other end is TALA, a Filipino in a 
           metallic halter gown and a bleached bob, unaware that she’s 
           humming (rather loudly) something by Giorgio Moroder.

           The rest of the table is filled with the Harringtons. Hoof, 
           looking the most content we’ve ever seen him. His wife, 
           Catherine, making faces at him from across the table. And 
           their Baby seated in a highchair playing with a couple of 
           string beans. The silence is deafening--

           Psst! -- silence is broken -- Coop getting Hoof’s attention 
           (as well as everyone else’s), indicating with his head that 
           they should retire to the study. Hoof excuses himself.

           COOP’S STUDY

           The men have retired: Coop, Hoof, and the Baby. The latter in 
           Coop’s possession. Hoof and Coop smoking cigars. Somehow, the
           Baby has gotten a hold of one, teething on it. Hoof quickly 
           confiscates it, returning it to the humidor.

                                 COOP
                        I got this job, Hoof. A real beaut. 
                        No pomp. No circumstance. Just a 
                        simple tap. You’re in and you’re 
                        out--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I’m retired, Coop. You know that.

                                 COOP
                        Yeah, I know. But they asked for 
                        you by name. And this one is sweet, 
                        pudding without the skin. In-state. 
                        No timestamp. Just you, the target, 
                        and more moola than--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Not interested.

           Hoof reclaiming his kid.

                                 COOP
                        Well, if you change your mind.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I won’t.

                                 COOP
                        But if you do, you know where to 
                        find me.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Thanks for dinner. Say goodnight to 
                        Uncle Coop.

           Hoof waves the Baby’s hand. The Baby giggles. And so does 
           Coop.

           STATION WAGON

           Rain HITTING the windshield. The wipers on amphetamines. Hoof 
           with one hand on the wheel. The other holding Catherine. 
           Their Baby in the back, sucking on a PACIFIER. Phil Collins 
           on the radio, just sucking. 

           A STOP SIGN.

           Hoof pressing the brake. Looking both ways.

                                 CATHERINE
                        So, how long have they been dating?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Who?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Coop and that Tala girl.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Coop doesn’t date. He pays by the 
                        hour.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Nooooo.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yep. He was married once. Says in 
                        the end, this is cheaper.

           Catherine erupts with laughter, shaking her head:

                                 CATHERINE
                        Classic Coop.

           Hoof agrees. It is “Classic Coop”. The Baby CRYING. The 
           PACIFIER on the floor. Catherine unfastening her seat belt. 

           Another STOP SIGN.

           Catherine straddling the seat. The PACIFIER just out of 
           reach. Hoof looking left, looking right, pressing the gas-- 

           WHAAAAAAAAAAAM! -- a TRUCK out of nowhere. The passenger side 
           PUMMELED -- SCREECHING TIRES, SCREAMS -- No headlights. 
           No brakes. No warning. The station wagon FISHTAILING -- 
           BAAAAAAAAAAAM! -- into a tree. BLACK ON BLACK.

           HOOF

           Regaining consciousness. His nose broken. His face the color 
           of Christmas. His eyes racking focus, locking in on...

           DUDLEY DINKINS. The other driver. In a smashed-up TRUCK. 
           Without a scratch. Without a chance in hell of passing a 
           breathalyzer. Just a drunken bobblehead, mumbling to himself.

           Hoof turning to Catherine. Are you okay? She opens her mouth 
           to speak... lets out her last breath instead. Hoof waiting 
           for something more. But that was it. There isn’t anything 
           more. The light out in her eyes. 

           A RAGE LIT IN HIS.

           Hoof out of the car. Reaching for his gun. But it’s not 
           there. Hasn’t been for over three years now. Looking for 
           something else... finding a ROCK. Thick. A two-hander. Big 
           enough to crush the skull of any drunk driver. 

           Picks it up. Carries it. Over his head. Over Dudley’s. Ready 
           to smash -- A BABY CRYING -- Hoof stopped. Remembers HIS SON!

           Hoof back to the car. His son still in his seat. Not a mark 
           on him. The PACIFIER still on the floor. Places it in his 
           son’s mouth. Takes him in his arms. Holds him tight.

           SIRENS BLASTING. Police Cars and Ambulances approaching.

           CEMETARY

           Hoof, a dry-duct zombie. The Baby in a stroller. The 
           tombstone we saw earlier. Now we see the name. Etched in 
           granite: CATHERINE ELIZABETH HARRINGTON. 

           Hoof lays down a bouquet of flowers. The first of many. 

           DINKINS’ RESIDENCE

           Middle of the night. The front door UNLOCKING. Hoof quietly 
           entering, pocketing the blade he used to break in with, 
           illuminating SPECIFIC OBJECTS with his flashlight...  

           DINKINS’ STUDY

           Opening the liquor cabinet, focusing on a bottle of SCOTCH...
           DINKINS’ BATHROOM

           Inspecting a tube of TOOTHPASTE... 

           DINKINS’ LIVING ROOM

           Picking up the LANDLINE, checking underneath the base...

           Noticing a LIGHT FIXTURE, standing on the coffee table, 
           getting a closer look inside...

           DINKINS’ KITCHEN

           Opening the fridge, taking out the MILK CARTON...

           DINKINS’ BEDROOM

           Dudley in bed. Having no trouble sleeping.

           Hoof watching. Having nothing but trouble.

           COURTROOM

           A JUDGE with a gavel. A sympathetic JURY. Hoof in the 
           gallery, keeping his shit together. Not an easy task. Dudley 
           Dinkins in the witness stand, cross-examined by the D.A. He’s 
           a blubbering mess. Turning to Hoof:

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        Mr. Harrington, I am so sorry. You 
                        have to believe me. If I could take 
                        it back I would. If I could bring 
                        her back I would--

           Hoof already out the door.

           DINKINS’ RESIDENCE

           End of the day. The front door UNLOCKING. Dudley entering...

           DINKINS’ STUDY

           Pouring himself a glass of SCOTCH...
           DINKINS’ BATHROOM

           On the floor beside the commode, puking. Takes a breath. 
           Feeling better...

           Uses the TOOTHPASTE...

           DINKINS’ LIVING ROOM

           Racing to the LANDLINE. Vomiting BLOOD. Dialing 9-1-1...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Nine-one-one. What is your 
                        emergency?

           Dudley gasping, obviously in excruciating pain:

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        Something’s wrong. I’m really sick.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        And what is your name, sir?

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        Dudley Dinkins. Please help me...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Of course. And what seems to be the 
                        problem, Mr. Dinkins?

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        I’m vomiting blood. My throat and 
                        my mouth are burning. And I’m 
                        having trouble breathing. Please 
                        send help.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Help is on the way. It sounds like 
                        it might be poison. Do you have any 
                        milk?

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        Yes.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Now, Mr. Dinkins, this is very 
                        important. I need you to drink as 
                        much as you can, force yourself if 
                        you have to. Milk is a natural 
                        diuretic. It will help offset 
                        whatever you’ve ingested, slowing 
                        down whatever harm is being done to 
                        your body. 
           DINKINS’ KITCHEN

           Grabbing the MILK CARTON from the fridge. Chugging it. Dairy 
           down his chin, all over his clothes. Finishing it as 
           directed. Waiting for the effects... 

           MORE VOMITING -- violent heaving -- an explosion of red and 
           white all over the tile.

           DINKINS’ LIVING ROOM

           Stumbling back to the LANDLINE. Sweat seeping from every 
           pore. His skin the color of lime:

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        I think it’s worse.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Did you do as I said?

           Collapsing, his head beside the receiver:

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        ...yes...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Then, it’s definitely worse.

                                 DUDLEY DINKINS
                        ...what...?

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        It’s definitely worse. You just 
                        drank a quarter-gallon of botulinum 
                        in less than 5 seconds. That’s bad. 
                        Real bad.

           He starts to shake, convulse.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And before that, you had enough 
                        iodine and aconitine to kill a 
                        horse. Or at the very least a large 
                        pony. The iodine was in your 
                        scotch. Undoubtedly, the first 
                        thing you hit when you got home, 
                        being on trial for second-degree 
                        murder, and all. But don’t worry, 
                        there wasn’t enough to kill you, 
                        not straight away, just enough to 
                        make you sick. Make you vomit. Make 
                        you want to brush your teeth.   
           Paralyzed. Tears down his face, unable to move or speak.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Which brings us to the aconitine. I 
                        put that in your toothpaste. You 
                        should’ve had a tingling sensation 
                        right away. Then, your throat 
                        should’ve tightened, closed up like 
                        a vise. Then you should’ve started 
                        to heave again, seen your insides 
                        outside in vivid technicolor. Now 
                        there is no antidote for aconitine. 
                        And it’s a slow-burner. But as slow 
                        as it is, it’s not slow enough. Not 
                        for my tastes.

           Blood beginning to seep from the sides of his mouth, from 
           inside his ears. His green skin turning blue. His eyes 
           glistening with pain.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s where the botulinum comes 
                        in. That’s what was in the milk. By 
                        now, everything but your heart, 
                        mind, and nerves should have 
                        ceased. This is the poison that 
                        will kill you, Mr. Dinkins. But not 
                        for at least a couple of hours. And 
                        not without causing more pain than 
                        you ever thought imaginable. Slowly 
                        but surely, and as painfully as 
                        possible, you will die.  

           Dudley staring at the LIGHT FIXTURE overhead. Upon closer 
           inspection, we see the lens of a CAMERA aimed his way...

           SMALL B/W TV SCREEN

           BIRD’S EYE VIEW: Dudley flat on his back, unable to move. 

           HOOF

           Inside A CAR. Watching his prey on the SMALL B/W TV. An old-
           school BLOCK CELL PHONE to his ear. His voice disguised. But 
           not anymore. Now, he speaks as Hoof Harrington: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Goodbye, Mr. Dinkins.

           At that moment, a BABY CRIES. Hoof extending a finger to the 
           back. His son grabbing a hold. Hoof comforting him with a 
           lullaby... The Baby crying no more.
           Hoof watching through the REARVIEW. The innocent face of his 
           son staring back, watching him... a realization hitting 
           quick... a burst of guilt and fear.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And then, it hit me. For the first 
                        time, I saw myself as I really was.

           HARRINGTON HOUSE. BABY’S ROOM

           Hoof placing his son inside his crib. Turning off the lights, 
           pausing at the door. Admiring his son like he did with 
           Catherine, but now, without her -- a sadness in his eyes.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I was a monster. 

           A FEVER DREAM

           Pederecki PLAYING. Hoof covered in blood. BODIES at his feet. 
           All his handiwork. His son CRYING in his arms, the only 
           unbloody thing in this hell. Hoof humming a lullaby, but it’s 
           not working. His son still CRIES.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And all I could think about was 
                        him. What happens when he finds 
                        out? Will he grow up to fear me? 
                        Hate me? Blame me?

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Hoof jolted awake. Gasping. Eyes welling. Knows what he has 
           to do. Doesn’t want to.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t let that happen.

           BABY’S ROOM

           Hoof watching his son sleep. He looks peaceful. Hoof doesn’t. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He deserved better than that. 
                        Better than me.
           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE

           DING-DONG. Jill Nantz answering the door, can’t believe her 
           eyes. There on the front porch...

           A Baby. A note pinned to his onesie. Jill taking the infant. 
           Bill taking the note:

                                 BILL NANTZ
                        “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Nantz, my name 
                        is Neil. Like the astronaut. I am 
                        here because I need a good home 
                        with a good mom and a good dad. 
                        Please take care of me as if your 
                        life depended on it.”

           The couple exchange glances. Their prayers answered.

           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE. KITCHEN

           Coop at the kitchen nook with the Nantzes. Handing them 
           papers to sign. The Baby in a highchair. Jill and Bill 
           beaming -- couldn’t be happier.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I gave away everything I had. Paid 
                        a debt I never thought I could. 

           THE NANTZ RESIDENCE. FRONT LAWN

           Hoof at a distance, watching. A grateful Jill and Bill 
           playing with a young Neil, no longer a Baby, now a toddler. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And not a day has passed that I 
                        haven’t thought about what I’ve 
                        done. Or regretted doing it.

           A misty-eyed Hoof unable to mask his true feelings. No poker-
           face today. He has to walk away.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HOSPITAL. RECOVERY ROOM. DAY

           Current time: Today. Hoof wakes. Adjusts to his new 
           surroundings, to the pain, and to the tubes. Tony T seated by 
           the door, reading the sports section. Some of his fellow 
           OFFICERS seen through the glass, loitering outside, keeping a 
           look-out. Coop by his side:  
                                 COOP
                        How do you feel?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Like a can of paint. 

           Hoof starts to get up. It hurts like a motherfucker. Coop and 
           Tony T helping him back in bed.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        I need to check on Neil.

                                 TONY T
                        Not now, you don’t. He’s safe. I’ve 
                        got the whole wing under lock-down. 
                        Not even a younger-you could get 
                        through.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How is he?

                                 COOP
                        He’s gonna make it. Just like you.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        So am I under arrest.

                                 TONY T
                        Nope. Just under “observation”. 
                        You’re lucky Coop called when he 
                        did. We showed up in the nick of 
                        time.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        How many did I get?

                                 COOP
                        You tagged fifteen, sixteen if the 
                        guy in ICU doesn’t pull through.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That’s not bad -- almost half.

                                 COOP
                        Almost half? Jesus, Hoof. You are 
                        getting old.

           That earns smiles all around. Somber smiles, but smiles 
           nonetheless.

                                 TONY T 
                        That half you didn’t get, we hauled 
                        off to County. We can hold them for 
                        two, maybe three days.

                        But that’s it. Once you’re back on 
                        your feet, you need to start 
                        moving, and fast. These hotheads 
                        aren’t going to rest until you’re 
                        dead, contract or no contract. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        What’s that?

           Hoof stopped listening a while ago. Noticing one of his boxes 
           on the floor. The CHALKBOARD sticking out.

                                 COOP
                        We brought some of your things 
                        over, thought it might make you 
                        feel more at home.

           Coop pulls a bottle of bourbon from the box. A red bow 
           fastened to the neck. Hands it over:

                                 COOP (CONT’D)
                        This is from Gus. A get-well gift. 
                        He said you liked the cheap shit.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Yeah, when I’m buying.

           Forced laughter, the kind used to cover elephants.

           LATER

           Visitation hours are over. And the lights are out. A POLICE 
           OFFICER snoring beside the door. Hoof waking, noticing the 
           CHALKBOARD. Apparently, Coop hung it on the wall. His message 
           intact, loud and clear:

                                   THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX

           Hoof yanks out his tubes. Gets out of bed. Takes a closer 
           look. And just like that, inspiration hits. Hoof erasing the 
           word “OUTSIDE”. Replacing it with “INSIDE”. And voilà: 

                                   THINK INSIDE THE BOX

           An idea is born. 

           HALLWAY

           Hoof leaving his room. ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER asleep in the 
           corridor. Hoof limping past, towards...
           THE CONNECTING HALLWAY

           Tony T guarding A DOOR. A pump-action in his lap. Hoof 
           approaching. The two men sharing a moment. No words. Just two 
           fathers saying thank you.

           NEIL’S RECOVERY ROOM

           The room Tony T is guarding. Neil asleep in bed. Drawings and 
           “get well” cards on a nearby stand. Hoof approaching. Eyes 
           welling, something percolating... a father’s sadness replaced 
           by a father’s rage. 

           INT. EMPTY HOUSE. NIGHT

           Vacated due to foreclosure. Not a single furnishing. The Lady 
           Realtor forced to fuck her GENTLEMAN FRIEND on the floor. But 
           she doesn’t seem to mind. Her cell RINGS. And she pauses just 
           long enough to answer:

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Rhonda Realty, how can I help you?

           INT. HOSPITAL. WAITING ROOM. NIGHT

           Hoof at the payphone. The Realtor’s BUSINESS CARD in hand: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Hello, this is Mr. Scott. We met 
                        the other day at one of your open 
                        houses, the ranch house across from 
                        Mr. Blu. 

                                 LADY REALTOR (V.O.)
                        Oh yes. The “big man”.

           Hoof forces a chuckle. It’s hard. Hoof doesn’t “chuckle”:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        That’s me. I was wondering when you 
                        were planning on showing that house 
                        again.

                                 LADY REALTOR (V.O.)
                        Tomorrow at ten. But if you want a 
                        more private tour--

           Hoof with the hang-up. Got what he needed.
           INT. VIDEO-TASTIC. WAREHOUSE. NIGHT

           Still keeping the 80s alive. Raketa and his fellow Slavic 
           crew loading MILITARY GRADE WEAPONRY onto Krispy Kreme
           trucks, rocking out to Gary Nuwman on the tape deck-- 

           AN ALARM SOUNDS -- SECURITY BREACHED!

           All AK-47s turning on the INTRUDER in the back... a stone-
           faced Hoof. His hand gripping Susan’s wrist and all the jelly 
           bracelets thereon.

                                 DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN
                        Raketa, I’m sorry. He just barged 
                        in.

           Hoof letting her go. Susie high-heeling it to Raketa’s side. 
           The gunrunner should be pissed, probably is, but smiles 
           anyway. The audacity. The balls. He lowers his weapon. And so 
           does everyone else.

                                 RAKETA
                        Seriously, man. How in the hell are 
                        you not dead yet?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I still got shit to do.

           Raketa nods, the logic is sound.

                                 RAKETA
                        So, what do you need from me?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        A re-fill.

           INT. DIVE BAR. NIGHT

           Closed for the night. Hoof entering, pulling a hand trolley 
           packed with WOOD and TOOLS. Holding a Video-Tastic bag packed 
           with C-4. A FLICK of the switch and we got light...

           Grand Guignol waiting in the corner. Tips his hat. Hoof 
           doesn’t seem surprised. Doesn’t seemed scared either.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Time’s up?

           Guignol nods, sauntering towards Hoof like a slow-moving 
           train. Twirling his HATCHET for added effect. 

           Hoof standing his ground, poker-face intact.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        What if I told you I found a way 
                        in. A way to kill Big Blu, once and 
                        for all.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I’d probably think it was just a 
                        sad attempt by a pathetic old man 
                        to postpone the inevitable. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        But what if it wasn’t.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Then, I guess I’d ask how.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                             (beat)
                        By killing me.

           Guignol stopped, dead in his tracks. Lowers his hatchet. 

           LATER

           Hoof left alone, and alive. That “sad attempt by a pathetic 
           old man” seems to have worked. Now it’s time to set his plan 
           in motion. He accomplishes the following via a MONTAGE:

                    1. Hoof SAWING and HAMMERING the wood he just 
                       hauled in. Building a BOX, a very big box.   

                    2. Hoof building a zip-gun, what he likes to call a 
                       “Borz”. HOLLOWING OUT the barrel and the 
                       cylinder.

                    3. Hoof making his own CARTRIDGES, using only
                       powder and primer.

                    4. Hoof TYPING. Hits the last KEY. Pulls the last 
                       sheet from the feeder. Places it inside a MANILA 
                       ENVELOPE along with the rest of the stack. 
                       Signs, seals, and adds stamps. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. DIVE BAR. BACK OFFICE. DAY

           No clock radio today. No need. Hoof is already awake, raring 
           to go.
           INT. RANCH HOUSE. DAY

           Another OPEN HOUSE. Packed to the gills. Quite a turn out for 
           a rainy day like today. The Lady Realtor policing those that 
           enter, making sure they take off their shoes. 

           DINING ROOM

           Hoof standing at the PICTURE WINDOW. Rain BEATING against it. 
           His steely eyes on... 

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           Part of the gate GONE, thanks to Hoof. No Gate Guards either, 
           another point for Team Hoof. A LARGE TARP covering the hole 
           he left. The ROOF GUARD at his post, braving it in a poncho. 
           Not nearly as many guards as last time. But they were never 
           really the problem. The problem is that goddam vault door.

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Mr. Scott, look at you.

           The Lady Realtor on the prowl. Approaching. 

                                 LADY REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Want a tour of the upstairs closet? 
                        Built for one, but two is so much 
                        more fun.

           She giggles. Squeezes his bicep, likes the feel. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You think that sonuvabitch would 
                        let me borrow some sugar?

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        ...What?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Being neighbors and all.

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        I don’t--

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Good point. I’ll go ask.

           Hoof heads for the door.

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Wait.
           He doesn’t.

           GRAND GUIGNOL

           Nearby. And out of sight. Spotting... 

           HOOF 

           Bursting from the Ranch House. Charging across the street. 
           The Lady Realtor poking her head out, calling out:

                                 LADY REALTOR
                        Mr. Scott! Wait!

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           The Roof Guard taking notice. Grabs the walkie:

                                 ROOF GUARD
                        Mike, we got a problem.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Mike into his two-way:

                                 MIKE
                        What’s that?

                                 ROOF GUARD (V.O.)
                        Channel two.

           Mike hits a button on the...

           SECURITY SCREEN

           The view changes from interior to exterior. We see HOOF 
           HARRINGTON approaching. Stopping as soon as he fills the 
           frame -- the Grim Reaper without his cloak.

           Big Blu watching. Wide-eyed. His heart monitor BEEPING AWAY. 

                                 BIG BLU
                        What in the hell is he doing?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know.

           The walkie-talkie asks:
                                 ROOF GUARD (V.O.)
                        Do you want me to take the shot?

                                 BIG BLU
                        Yes!

                                 MIKE
                        NO-wait!

                                 BIG BLU
                        What do you mean wait!?

           HOOF

           In the pouring rain. Staring at the CAMERA aimed his way. 
           Pulls out a PISTOL. Points to the sky -- BANG!BANG!BANG! -- 
           making sure all eyes are on him:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Big Blu! Why don’t you come down so 
                        we can settle this ourselves!?

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Big Blu about to shit himself:

                                 BIG BLU
                        He’s gone crazy! Why don’t you 
                        shoot him already!?

           Mike works a knob on the REMOTE, adjusting the... 

           SECURITY SCREEN

           The camera ZOOMING past Hoof. Focusing on the RANCH HOUSE 
           across the street. The Lady Realtor and several POTENTIAL 
           HOMEOWNERS watching from the front porch. Several MORE 
           WITNESSES watching from the PICTURE WINDOW.

                                 MIKE
                        Because we’re not as crazy as him. 
                        There’s at least twenty eyes on us.

           ROOF GUARD

           Looking through the scope. Hoof in the crosshairs.

                                 ROOF GUARD
                        I got him. Say the word and he’s 
                        dead.
                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        Do not fire. I repeat. DO NOT FIRE.

           The Roof Guard with an expletive, itching to end this.

           BIG BLU

           Shaking. Fiending. Staring at HOOF on the Security Screen.

                                 BIG BLU
                        What do we do!?

                                 MIKE
                        We wait for him to cross that gate. 
                        As soon as he does, we take him 
                        out. But not a second sooner. He 
                        has to trespass.

                                 BIG BLU
                        Trespass, goddamit! Cross that 
                        gate, you sonuvabitch! CROSS THAT 
                        GATE!!!

           GRAND GUIGNOL

           Raising Hoof’s RIFLE. Ready, aim...

           HOOF

           Rain streaming down his face. Looking like tears. His teeth 
           clenched. His eyes closed. Waiting...

           BANG! -- A SHOT -- and Hoof is on his knees. 

           BANG! -- ANOTHER -- and Hoof is face-down. 

           MIKE

           Horrified, into his walkie:

                                 MIKE
                        I SAID NOT TO SHOOT!!!

           ROOF GUARD

           Lowering his rifle, befuddled...

                                 ROOF GUARD
                        ...I didn’t...
           SECURITY SCREEN

           Hoof crawling -- BANG! -- another SHOT. And Hoof is laid-out.

                                 MIKE
                        Goddamit! Who’s doing that!?

           Grand Guignol appearing for all to see, practically taking a 
           bow. Smoking RIFLE over his shoulder. Grabbing Hoof by the 
           collar. Dragging him out of sight. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. BIG BLU’S ESTATE. NIGHT

           It’s stopped pouring, just sprinkling now. The Roof Guard in 
           position, sipping hot coffee from a thermos. His attention 
           caught... something in the distance.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Mike, the Nurse, and TWO ARMED GUARDS huddled around Blu’s 
           bed. Hours have passed but the tension hasn’t. A palpable 
           silence. Blu’s heart rate going beep... beep... beep...

                                 ROOF GUARD (V.O.)
                        MIKE!

           A collective jump. Mike grabbing his walkie:

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ROOF GUARD (V.O.)
                        Channel two.

           Mike hits a button on the...

           SECURITY SCREEN

           Guignol is back, a vision from some Gothic nightmare, heading 
           straight for them. Pulling the hand trolley. Hauling a LARGE 
           BOX (the one Hoof built last night). 

                                 MIKE
                             (into the walkie)
                        Pete, see what he wants.
           DOWNSTAIRS

           DING-DONG. PETE, a no-neck gorilla with an ASSAULT RIFLE, 
           checks the peep hole. JAKE, his doppelganger with a bandito 
           stache, guards the stairs. OTHER GUARDS mill about. Maybe 
           FOUR in all -- the rest, still in County courtesy of Tony T.

           The door opened. Guignol beside the BOX. The box looking 
           eerily like a coffin. Guignol just looking eerie.

                                 PETE
                        What do you want?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                             (with his hand out)
                        The bounty for Hoof Harrington.

                                 PETE
                        That’s what you got in the box?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Yep.

           Pete eyes the coffin, skeptical...

                                 PETE
                        Hoof Harrington?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Yep.

                                 PETE
                        Dead?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Yep.

           Pete steps away. Whispers into his walkie:

                                 PETE
                        He says he’s got Hoof in a box. 
                        Dead. Wants to be paid... Okay. 

           Pete returns.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Leave him here and if everything 
                        checks out we’ll get you the money. 

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Nope. No money. No Hoof.

           Pete eyes Guignol. It’s obvious he’s not going to budge. He 
           steps away again, whispering into his walkie:
                                 PETE
                        He won’t leave without the money... 
                        I don’t know. Because he’s a 
                        fucking freak... Okay.

           Pete returns. Notices the PADLOCK on the box.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Open it up. If it’s Hoof. And he’s 
                        dead. Then, you’ll get the money.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Nope. I get the money now. Then, I 
                        give you the key. Then, you do 
                        whatever you want.

           Pete sighs, stepping away again:

                                 PETE
                        No-go. He wants to get paid up-
                        front... You sure...? Okay.

           Pete returns.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Turn around.

           Guignol obliges. Pete with the pat-down. He’s clean.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        Follow me.

           Guignol does, BOX in tow. Pete and Jake helping him lug it up 
           the stairs.

           SECURITY SCREEN

           Grand Guignol, Pete, and Jake hitting the BLIND-SPOT. 
           Disappearing. Mike hitting a button, the view changing to 
           their destination: the empty SECOND FLOOR.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           All anxious eyes on the EMPTY SCREEN, waiting. 

                                 BIG BLU
                        We’ve got to fix that damn blind-
                        spot.

           Everyone agrees with a nod.
           SECURITY SCREEN

           Finally, Guignol resurfacing on the SECOND FLOOR. Just him 
           and the BOX. No Pete. No Jake. They’ve disappeared. 

                                 BIG BLU
                        Where did they go?

                                 MIKE
                             (into his walkie)
                        Pete...? Jake...?

           SECOND FLOOR

           Guignol pulling the BOX. It’s damn heavy. Stopping at the 
           VAULT DOOR. Knocking.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           The Two Armed Guards with their RIFLES ready. Mike letting 
           Guignol and the BOX in:

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s Pete and Jake?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Who?

                                 MIKE
                        The two men. From downstairs.

           Guignol can’t seem to recall. Mike growing impatient:

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        They escorted you up here.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Doesn’t ring a bell. Where’s my 
                        money.

           Guignol with his hand out. Mike trying to stay calm:

                                 MIKE
                        Frank, go look for Pete and Jake.

           One of the Guards leaves, the door SHUTTING behind him. 
           Guignol’s hand still waiting to be filled. Mike struggling to 
           keep his blood pressure down:

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Open the goddam box. And I’ll give 
                        you the goddam money. 
                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Money first. 

           Mike about to lose it, turning to Blu. 

                                 BIG BLU
                        Go ahead.

           Mike groans. Removes a family portrait from the wall. Reveals 
           a SAFE. Works the combo. And removes a SUITCASE...

           Guignol opening it. Discovering stacks and stacks of bills. 

           Now it’s Mike’s hand that’s out.

           Guignol removes a KEY from his boot. Hands it over. Mike 
           handing it to the remaining Guard.

                                 MIKE
                        Open it.

           The Guard obviously doesn’t want to, but inserts the key 
           anyway. Everyone, except for Guignol, taking a step back, 
           preparing for the Ghost of Hoof, or, at the very least, a 
           boatload of spring snakes.

           The key turns. The padlock opens--

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Mike raising his PISTOL -- BANG!BANG!BANG! -- THREE SHOTS
           into the upright coffin. If Hoof wasn’t dead, he is now. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Go ahead.

           The Guard does. And TWO BODIES tumble out. It’s Pete and 
           Jake. Bound, gagged, and now with THREE BULLET HOLES courtesy 
           of Mike.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is this!?

           The upright coffin: EMPTY. No Hoof Harrington. Mike in a 
           fury. Aiming his GUN at Guignol. Guignol couldn’t care less.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT IS THIS!?

           The Guard taking a closer look inside, his nose -- CRACK! -- 
           BROKEN by a FALSE-BOTTOM flung open -- HOOF OUT WITH HIS GUN!

           Mike adjusting his aim -- BANG!
           The Guard rasing his rifle -- BANG! 

           The Nurse rushing for the door -- CLICK -- Hoof’s hammer 
           COCKED. The Nurse stopped cold.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I don’t want to kill a lady.

                                 THE NURSE
                        Then, don’t.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Open that window and I won’t.

           Damn-good deal. She does as he says. Opens the window 
           directly behind him -- AAAAAARGH! -- Hoof’s boot KNOCKING her 
           through. Her ass landing in the garden below.

           BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM! The remaining Guards BEATING their fists 
           against the steel door. CALLING OUT to the recently deceased. 
           Not getting an answer.

           Hoof lifting his coat for Guignol. Revealing a zip-gun, the 
           “BORZ” he made last night. Grand Guignol taking it. 

                                 BIG BLU (O.S.)
                        You think this makes you right?

           Forgot about him. Big Blu’s eyes burning a hole into Hoof’s. 
           Hoof returning the stare, but without malice. Just empathy:

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No. I haven’t been right for a long 
                        time. But neither have you. You put 
                        a hit on my kid.

                                 BIG BLU
                        And you killed mine.

           Blu no longer scared. His heartbeat STEADY. His breathing 
           measured. He’s ready for the inevitable.

                                 BIG BLU (CONT’D)
                        Get on with it.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        No way we can work this out?

                                 BIG BLU
                        Maybe in hell.

           Blu closes his eyes. Juts his chin. And takes it like a man -- 
           BANG!BANG! -- one to the heart. And one to the head. 
           Finally, it’s over -- Click -- maybe not -- another hammer 
           COCKED. Hoof turning to find... 

           The “BORZ” aimed his way. Tables turned. Guignol at the head.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Careful where you point that thing.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        At this range, you don’t have to be 
                        careful. Drop the gun.

           Hoof obliges, letting it fall outside the OPEN WINDOW. He 
           takes a seat on the seal. Tired. Getting too old for this 
           shit. His chest agreeing with a skipped beat; he rubs it.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Blu’s dead. You got a suitcase full 
                        of cash. What more do you want?

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        The man who ordered my father’s 
                        death is dead. But the man who 
                        pulled the trigger is still alive.

           And Hoof says what he’s been thinking all along: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Alias Arthur Rimbaud.

           Guignol confirms with a nod.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT’D)
                        He was your father.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        He was.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        And this is your revenge. Use me to 
                        get to Blu. Use Blu to get to me. 
                        And you get whoever’s left 
                        standing.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        I’ve been planning it since I was a 
                        kid. That’s a lot of time to get it 
                        right. Spent most of it studying 
                        you. Copying you. Becoming you. I 
                        waited for you to get old. Waited 
                        for you to get soft. Waited for you 
                        to fuck-up. And in the end, you did 
                        not disappoint.
           Guignol smiles, obviously proud of himself.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        You don’t have to do this, you 
                        know.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        This isn’t going to be the part 
                        where you beg for your life, is it?

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        It’s the part where I tell you I’m 
                        sorry. 

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Sorry for what? For what you did to 
                        my father? For what you did to my 
                        mother? Or for what you did to me? 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        For everything.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Come on, now. You’re Hoof 
                        Harrington. And Hoof Harrington 
                        can’t be sorry. Because you have to 
                        feel something to be sorry. And we 
                        can’t feel a damn thing. We’re 
                        monsters, you and me. And we can’t 
                        change that.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        But we can, Guignol. This is 
                        America. And in America, with a 
                        dream and a drive, anybody can be 
                        anything they want to be. I can be 
                        sorry. And you can be something 
                        other than a monster.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL 
                        Christ-on-crack. Is this really how 
                        the great Hoof Harrington is going 
                        to go out?

           Hoof without a poker-face, as sincere as we’ve ever seen him: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        I don’t want to go out at all. I 
                        have a son. And I’ve missed out on 
                        too much already. I’m an old man 
                        getting older. Contract or no 
                        contract, I don’t have much time 
                        left. Whatever little time I do 
                        have, I want to spend it with him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (CONT'D)
                        That’s all I want. And I’m sorry 
                        for what I’ve done to you, and your 
                        father. Truly sorry. But you don’t 
                        have to do this. You don’t have to 
                        repeat my mistake.

                                 GRAND GUIGNOL
                        Thank you, Hoof. That means a lot. 
                        Knowing you want to live. Knowing 
                        you have something to live for. 
                        Knowing you will say and do 
                        anything to stop the inevitable 
                        from happening makes this more 
                        gratifying than I could have ever 
                        hoped. America or not, this is how 
                        it’s going to end. I’m going to 
                        shoot you in the head like you did 
                        my father. Then, I’m going to cut 
                        your carcass into bite-size bits. 
                        Then, I’m going feed them to your 
                        son. Then, I’m going to kill him 
                        and his family and let them know 
                        why. Goodbye, Hoof Harrington.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON
                        Goodbye, Guignol.

           We go to SLOW-MO as Hoof prepares for something other than a 
           bullet. Something bigger. Much bigger. His thoughts via VOICE-
           OVER: 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And like I’ve said before, anyone 
                        in this country with a dream and a 
                        drive can be anything it wants to 
                        be. Same is true with a detonator. 

           The TRIGGER pulled. And we see the smallest of SPARKS flash 
           from the chamber. But NO bullet.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It can be a cuff link. A light 
                        switch. A radio dial. Or the handle 
                        on the door of a helicopter. 
                        Doesn’t matter. Because whatever 
                        you make it, in its core it’s still 
                        the trigger.

           Grand Guignol’s EYES going Dangerfield. Realizing his 
           mistake. FLAMES trailing up his arm, towards his face. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Only instead of going bang, it goes 
                        boom.
           KAAAAAAAABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! The pistol EXPLODING. Shock 
           waves BLASTING. Hoof FLYING. A FIERY BALL OF DEATH -- ALL 
           ENCOMPASSING -- TRAILING HIM OUT THE WINDOW.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY. CONTINUOUS

           Hoof, his boot on fire, thrust from the FLAMING house. 
           Seeming to hang in mid-air. Like an astronaut lost in space. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Which brings me to my greatest hit. 
                        Number One: Hoof Harrington.

           Hoof discovering gravity. Plummeting back to earth. There’s a 
           beat... then the SUPER:

                                          NO. 1

                                     HOOF HARRINGTON

           RILEY’S BEDROOM

           Big Blu cradling Riley, his dead son. Still warm. A lot of 
           blood and a lot of tears.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time, a grieving father 
                        wanted justice.

           HILLSIDE

           Hoof taking PHOTOS of Neil from afar, a longing in his eyes.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        A guilt-ridden father wanted a 
                        reunion.

           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD

           Lays dead in the sand. His Young Son won’t let go. His arms 
           wrapped around his father’s corpse. His mother tugging at 
           him. This is Grand Guignol as a child.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And a fatherless son wanted 
                        revenge.
           ALIAS ARTHUR RIMBAUD’S ESTATE. DINING ROOM

           A Young Guignol blows out ELEVEN CANDLES on a cake. He does 
           not smile. He only closes his eyes and makes a wish.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He grew up fast, every birthday 
                        making the same wish.

           One of his gifts: a PUPPY with a bow on its collar. 

           AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY’S BEDROOM

           Guignol’s to be exact. He flips through a SCRAPBOOK. 
           Newspaper clippings collected from all over. Headlines 
           declaring: “ARMS DEALER RIMBAUD MURDERED”, “DRUNK DRIVER 
           POISONED BEFORE CONVICTION”, etc. Guignol adding another one: 
           “ASSASSINATION OF DICTATOR”. It seems Hoof has been busy. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He kept tabs on his target.

           The PUPPY sleeps at Guignol’s feet.

           A FIELD

           A Young Guignol trekking where he can’t be seen, a STICK in 
           his hand. The PUPPY following.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He practiced when he could.

           Guignol raising the stick, swinging hard, but before the Pup 
           is struck we CUT TO:

           A LIVING ROOM

           An older Guignol. Now in his signature undertaker suit, 
           HATCHET in hand. Resting in a blood-stained ottoman. 
           SPLATTERINGS everywhere. He tosses one of his BUSINESS CARDS.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And when he got old enough, he 
                        graduated.

           RESIDENTIAL STREET

           Hoof rounding the corner, a sack of groceries in his hands. 
           Far enough away not to be seen, Guignol watches.
                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        He tracked his target. 

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           Hoof climbing out RILEY’S WINDOW. Escaping with the only 
           witness to Riley’s murder, the 8-Year-Old Girl. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Waited for the target to slip up.

           Far enough away not to be seen, Guignol watches. Smiles.

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE. MASTER BEDROOM 

           Blu in his hospital bed. Mike hands him the Anonymous Note: 
           WHO SLEW LITTLE BOY BLU? HOOF HARRINGTON, THAT’S WHO.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Turned two old friends against each 
                        other. 

           HALLWAY

           Betty Rage, left headless on the floor. Guignol hovering 
           nearby. Hoof reading the business card: BANG! YOU’RE DEAD.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        Waited for one to remove the other, 
                        so he could move in. And get his 
                        revenge.

           HOSPITAL ROOM

           Hoof bandaged and bruised. Looking at the CHALKBOARD. Having 
           an epiphany. Writing: THINK INSIDE THE BOX.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        But the target got wise. Realized 
                        the only way he’d ever find peace 
                        was in death.

           DIVE BAR

           Hoof building his COFFIN. Making the “BORZ”. Placing SQUIBS 
           underneath his shirt.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        So the target became the assassin.
           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           Rain pouring. Hoof waiting. BLANKS fired. SQUIBS going off. 
           Hoof on the ground. Guignol appearing, dragging Hoof away.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And the assassin became the mark.

           DIVE BAR

           Hoof laying inside his COFFIN. Guignol lowering the FALSE-
           BOTTOM, covering him completely. Fastening the PADLOCK.

           BIG BLU’S ESTATE

           Pete answering the door. Guignol with the COFFIN.

           STAIRCASE

           Pete and Jake helping Guignol cart the COFFIN. Clearing the 
           SECURITY CAMERA, entering the BLIND-SPOT. 

           The back swinging OPEN. A magician’s trick door. Hoof leaping 
           out. NEEDLES to necks. Propofol INJECTED. Bound, gagged, and 
           unconscious; both Guards stuffed inside.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Only Hoof and Guignol remain. Guignol aiming the “BORZ”. 

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        When the time came, he gave the 
                        mark a choice. Left the mark’s life 
                        in his own hands. 

           Guignol pulls the trigger. And the gun EXPLODES. Hoof 
           PROPELLED outside. FLAMES EATING EVERYTHING.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The mark chose. And Hoof Harrington 
                        finally found peace...

           CEMETARY

           A Funeral. A smattering of PEOPLE gathered around, all 
           familiar faces: Coop, Gus, Tony T, Raketa, etc.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        ...in death. 
           A tombstone with HOOF HARRINGTON’s name. Beside his wife’s. 

           The Cowboy (from the pharmacy) at a distance. Watching. Rips 
           up the WANTED POSTER and walks away. The search for the 
           elusive Hoof Harrington is officially over.

           HILLSIDE ESTATE

           Neil back home. Bandaged up, but healthy. Sifting through a 
           stack of mail. There’s the MANILA ENVELOPE. He opens it. 
           Pulls out Hoof’s STACK of typewritten pages. The title page: 
           MY GREATEST HITS BY HOOF HARRINGTON. Neil begins to read.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        I’ve lived my life, earned my 
                        living, making decisions most would 
                        consider the hardest a man could 
                        ever make: pull the trigger or 
                        don’t pull the trigger.

           DIVE BAR

           The night before death. Hoof at his Smith Corona. TYPING with 
           purpose. Finishing the last page.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        And for whatever reason, this was 
                        never hard for me. Most of the 
                        time, I never even thought about 
                        it. I just did it. Or I didn’t. 
                        Didn’t consider the consequences 
                        and didn’t care. Just aimed and 
                        shot.

           HARRINGTON HOUSE. BABY’S ROOM

           Hoof staring at his son’s crib. His face full of regret.

                                 HOOF HARRINGTON (V.O.)
                        There was only one decision I ever 
                        made that was really ever hard. And 
                        it’s the one I think about every 
                        day.

           We see inside the crib. It’s EMPTY. And we FLASH to several 
           images from Hoof and Neil’s past. Listed below are some of 
           the highlights of that MONTAGE:

                    1. NEIL (AGE 4) on his BIKE. Bill walking along. 
                       Letting go. Neil swerving. Gaining control. 
                       Steady and straight. Learning to ride. A proud 
                       Hoof takes a PHOTO.

                    2. NEIL (AGE 10) at bat. A pitch. A swing. And a 
                       HIT. The CROWD and his TEAMMATES cheering him on 
                       as he takes FIRST, then SECOND. A proud Hoof 
                       takes a PHOTO. 

                    3. NEIL (AGE 18) in a cap and gown. Accepting his 
                       DIPLOMA. Waving at FAMILY and FRIENDS. A proud 
                       Hoof takes a PHOTO.

                    4. NEIL (AGE 24) leaving a church. Arms around his 
                       bride, Sara. GUESTS and FAMILY throwing rice. 
                       And once again, where he can’t be seen, a proud 
                       Hoof takes a PHOTO.

           HILLSIDE ESTATE

           Neil reading the last of Hoof’s typewritten pages. His face a 
           smorgasbord of emotions. So much information, so quick.

                        These were my Greatest Hits. A way 
                        for you to get to know a little bit 
                        about me, find out if you want to 
                        know more. 

           Paperclipped on the last page -- a PHOTO of Hoof, Catherine, 
           and Neil as a baby -- the family that never was.

                        I hope you want to know more.

           AN UNDISCLOSED BEACH

           A TINY HOUSE on the sand. Neil walking to the door. KNOCKS.

           It opens and we see Hoof. Some bandages and some burns, his 
           foot in a cast; but definitely not dead. His son extends a 
           hand. But that’s not good enough. Hoof gives him a hug 
           instead, a hug he’s been saving up for a while now. 

                                         THE END
