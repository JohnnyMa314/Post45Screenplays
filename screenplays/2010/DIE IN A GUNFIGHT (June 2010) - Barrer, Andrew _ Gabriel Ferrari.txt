           City noise: CARS, SIRENS, PEOPLE. 

           A SCUFFLE.   

                                 NARRATOR
                        I wanted it to start with a bird's 
                        eye view of Manhattan. There would 
                        have been music. Something catchy. 
                        Something anyone could enjoy. It 
                        would have been in a hip, New York 
                        aesthetic. Stylish, with the title 
                        splashed across the screen in pink 
                        cursive. But, instead, it starts in 
                        an alley.  

           We hear a film reel begin TURNING. Somewhere, a movie has 
           just begun.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Close on a collection of feet SLIDING over pavement. This is 
           a fight, from the shins down. One of the pairs of feet dons 
           designer leather shoes.  

           Close on the face of BEN GIBBON, 24, leisure-suited. He is 
           sweaty and bruised, BREATHING hard. 

           A fist flashes into screen and slams Ben in the face; blood 
           splatters. 

           Freeze on this image.

                        Since the age of five, Benjamin 
                        Gibbon has been in 723 brawls, 
                        fights and scuffles. An approximate 
                        38.05 per year. And he has lost-

                        One.  

           BACK IN THE ALLEY

           Unfreeze the image of Ben's bloody face as it takes the punch 
           and disappears from screen.  

           Pull back. Ben is on the ground, getting his ass kicked by 
           THREE GUYS. The fight is already over. Ben loses, again. But 
           he loses with dignity.  

                                 GUY 1
                        Stay down, bitch.   

           The guys LAUGH.  

           Ben struggles to get up. He is smiling at his attackers but, 
           really, he is smiling at us.  

           He charges the group, getting in a couple of shots before the 
           guys take him down again, three against one. Though taking 
           quite a bit of punishment, Ben does not seem phased. 

           He struggles to his feet.

           When Ben speaks, we discover that his voice is one and the 
           same with the Narrator's. This device will continue 
           throughout the film, with Narrator speaking in 3rd person and 
           no direct connection ever drawn between Narrator and Ben.   

                                 BEN
                        You'll have...

           He is almost up.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        To fucking...

           He makes it to his feet.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Kill me.  

           His three opponents struggle to keep him down, but Ben, a man 
           possessed, manages to shake them off one last time, landing a 
           wet, meaty PUNCH on the face of Guy 1.  

           His opponents rally, tackle him all at once, and bring him 
           collapsing down, out of screen.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Pull back on Ben, lying in a heap, completely beaten. The 
           guys stand back, astounded by the violence they have just 
           been subjected to.  

                                 NARRATOR
                        With a record like that, one could 
                        easily call him a loser. But, for 
                        Ben Gibbon...

           A determined Ben struggles to his feet.  

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Winning just isn't the point.  

           Slowly, Ben stands. He dusts himself off. As he does, his 
           opponents take one, ever so slight, step backward. Ben SPITS 
           blood and LIGHTS a cigarette. He puts his fingers to his 
           neck, feeling his pulse.

                                 BEN
                        Well, fuck, fellas. Still beating.  

           Ben lunges. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           BIRD'S EYE VIEW: A 1960 Ford Galaxie Sunliner scoots down a 
           crowded street in Manhattan. MUSIC plays: something catchy, 
           something anyone could enjoy. Over the shot, pink cursive 
           letters are scrawled in flamboyant, loopy handwriting.

           This is the beginning the Narrator imagined.

           Pull in on the Sunliner. Ben sits passenger. Driving is MUKUL 
           (Mick-cool), 21, an Apache Indian with the long hair of a 
           Brave. A tribal knife is tucked into Mukul's boot; it will 
           remain there throughout the film. 

           They wear tuxedos, and pass a joint back and forth. 

           Ben rests his gator-booted feet on the dash. He is clean and 
           cool, save the badly beaten face.

           Montage of Manhattan: Focus on people. A vibrant New York. 

           This is Halloween season. Some people wear costumes. Stores 
           are decorated. The city is gearing up for a ghoulish 
           celebration.

           Over these images of the city, two RADIO VOICES engage in a 
           debate. 

                                 VOICE 1
                        Fact: Phillip Lowman is a murderer. 
                        But somehow Terrence Uberahl is to 
                        blame? He hides his face from the 
                        public? Fine. He lives behind a 
                        wall of bodyguards? Sure. Why 
                        wouldn't he want to hide from a 
                        media that only wants to crucify 
                        him? 

                                 VOICE 2
                        Not so fast, Frank. There are those 
                        of us who believe Uberahl's 
                        technology corrupts the integrity 
                        of human life.  

            On Ben and Mukul, as the debate fades out. 

                                 BEN
                        I love getting high in a tuxedo. 
                        There's something cool about being 
                        fucked up and looking good at the 
                        same time. Something dangerous. I'm 
                        looking at you right now, and I 
                        have to say that you look maybe ten 
                        times cooler than usual, and you're 
                        a cool motherfucker.  

                                 MUKUL
                        Why, thank you. You're looking 
                        sharp yourself there, Gibbon. 

           The car stops at a red light. On the sidewalk, a YOUNG BOY 
           passes dressed in a police officer costume. 

                                 BEN
                        Say, copper. You know the last 
                        thing Che Guevera said to his 
                        assassin? (Spanish accent) Shoot 
                        coward, you are only going to kill 
                        a man. 

           Ben draws his hand, in the shape of a pistol, on the boy. The 
           boy responds, drawing a plastic gun and firing with a 
           vocalized BANG. Ben takes the bullet.

           INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - DARK (FIRELIGHT)  

           A man we will come to know as THE TUTOR, early-40s, with 
           brooding good looks, sits holding a framed photograph of a 
           girl in her early-twenties. He stares at the girl's image 
           with focused intensity, muttering to himself in a French 
           accent.

           EXT. MIDTOWN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS WITH PREVIOUS BEN/MUKUL 
           SCENE

           Ben and Mukul pull up to an event hall. A large sign outside 
           the building reads: An Evening with Sanje Padma, Presented by 
           The Rathcart Family in support of The Good World Foundation.  

           EXT. EVENT HALL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Mukul join an UPPER CLASS CROWD lined at the 
           entrance. Mukul is incredibly stoned and will stay that way 
           for the remainder of the scene.

           A DOORMAN checks names off a list as guests enter the party. 
           Past the door, large, ornate dining tables are set up around 
           the room. A stage stretches the far wall, with a podium set 
           up at the center. They reach the front of the line.

           On NANCY GIBBON, 50s, Ben's mother, cheerfully entertaining a 
           circle of VIPs.  Nancy notices Ben in the corner of her eye; 
           a look of concern passes across her face. She recovers, 
           graciously excuses herself, and hurries over to her son.  

                                 NANCY

                        Yes, he's my son. 

           Nancy leads Ben and Mukul to a private corner of the room. 
           She pulls a handkerchief from her purse, dabs a corner on her 
           tongue and attempts to rub the bruises off his face.

                        Your father is going to faint. How

                        No way.

           Nancy frowns quizzically, then goes back into her purse, 
           emerging with concealer.

                        enough in tone, don't you think?

                        Relax, mom. It is what it is.  

           Nancy looks closely at Ben's face, as if she still might 
           think of a way to fix it.  

                                 NANCY
                        Your poor face. No one would ever 
                        guess there's a handsome boy under 
                        there. I wish I could count on my 
                        son to make better impressions.

                        the only one I care about.

           He throws his arm around her. Nancy smiles, she can't help

           A WAITER passes them. Ben grabs his attention.

                        Two whiskeys, please. Something for

           ACROSS THE ROOM  

           HENRY GIBBON, 50s, is in the midst of a conversation with 
           several SUITS. He catches a glimpse of his wife and son. His 
           eyes narrow. He finishes his sentence.   

           BACK ON BEN AND NANCY 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh no. Your father. He sees us.    

           Henry arrives.  

                                 HENRY
                        You have to be joking.

                                 HENRY
                        No, it's not fine, Nancy. He can't 
                        be seen like this. I'm nearing the 
                        end of the most important case of 
                        my career. And he wreaks of reefer

           WILLIAM RATHCART, 50s, heartily enters the screen with his 
           wife, BEATRICE RATHCART, 50s. Beatrice wears a Valium smile 
           and carries the air of a sedated puppy.  

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Good God, son. What happened to 
                        your face?  

                                 BEATRICE
                        My! Did we have an accident?

                                 NANCY
                        It's nothing. Just a little 
                        scuffle. You know how boys are. 

                                 HENRY
                        Benjamin was actually just leaving, 
                        unfortunately. He has a prior, 
                        unbreakable engagement.   

                                 BEN
                        I wanted to come by and show my

           William CHORTLES.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        A sense of humor! Excellent! That's 
                        important when one is in the 
                        business of taking beatings.   

           Beatrice, a tipsy sidekick, CHUCKLES into her drink.

                                 HENRY
                        Funny you should say so. I trust 
                        you'll keep it in mind. Closing 
                        arguments aren't far off.   

           William bristles. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Fine manners, Henry. This isn't the 
                        time or the place. 

                                 HENRY
                        Then maybe you should save your 
                        jokes for the courtroom.   

           William is enraged, but falters.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maybe you should save your jokes

                        For where, William? Speak up. 

           Things are heating up. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll show you where. 

           Things devolve into a stare-down. 

           Mukul is a stoned spectator. Bloodshot eyes and a dazed 
           smile. He collects two whiskeys from the waiter and hands one 
           to Ben. 

                                 BEATRICE
                        So, what are your plans, Benjamin?

                             (With his eyes on Henry)
                        Yeah, Benjamin. How's your future 
                        looking? 

           Ben sucks up an ice-cube from his drink and loudly CRUNCHES 
           it in his teeth.

                                 BEN
                        My grandfather and I were close, 
                        and he left me a ton of money. So, 
                        nothing. I'm thinking I want to do 
                        nothing for a while. Then maybe 
                        open a video store.

                                 BEN
                        Yes, sir. 

           William takes one last, extended look at Ben's face, enjoying 
           Henry's obvious embarrassment. 

           Exit Rathcarts.

                                 HENRY

                        Son of a freaking-

                        Calm down, darling. 

           Henry turns to Ben, his forced smile gone.  

                                 HENRY
                        Make sure no one else notices you 
                        on the way out.   

                                 BEN

                        Get the fuck out. 

           On Ben, red in the face, hurt. He turns to go, followed by 
           Mukul.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Benjamin. Don't steal anything. 

           Ben acknowledges with a wave over his shoulder. 

           Henry leads Nancy back into the crowd. Neither of them 
           notices Ben and Mukul duck into the coat room by the exit. 

           INT. COAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben is still. Mukul stands by. Suddenly, Ben PUNCHES the wall 
           hard, three times in quick succession. He takes a BREATH and 
           calms himself. 

           ON THE STAGE - A LITTLE LATER

           William ascends the stage to APPLAUSE. He stands at the 
           podium and addresses the crowd, now seated at the tables.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I want to thank you all for being 
                        here tonight in support of The Good 
                        World Foundation and its many 
                        worthy causes. I know you're all 
                        probably too busy writing checks to 
                        listen to a speech.

           William pauses to share a CHUCKLE with the crowd. 

           On Henry, not enjoying the praise received by his opponent. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        So I have decided to spare you. I 
                        would simply like to acknowledge my 
                        family, who is seated before me: my 
                        beautiful wife, Beatrice, and my 
                        wonderful daughter, Mary. 

           We lose William's voice - who, in spite of his promise, is 
           launching into a speech - as we move in on MARY RATHCART, 22, 
           wearing the stoic expression of a well-behaved socialite. 

           We recognize Mary. She is the girl from the Tutor's

                        eight-years of age, she was asked 
                        to leave Manhattan's most

           YOUNG MARY, 8, sits hidden in the corner of the library, 
           reading a book and smoking a cigarette. She ashes 
           absentmindedly, so engrossed that she fails to notice the

           On Young Mary, only paying half-attention to her lesson. She

                        But, like most gifted children, she 
                        often witnessed the world around 
                        her as if from a distance, and was 
                        prone to extended bouts of

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM

           TEEN MARY, 14, dressed in ripped jeans and a flannel shirt, 
           her hair dyed black, lights a joint. Her room is plastered 
           with rock posters and scattered with lit candles. She puts 
           Nirvana's Rape Me up high on her stereo and moshes around the 
           room.

           William bursts through the door and scowls. Teen Mary

           A strict-faced NUN turns the light out and SHUTS the bedroom 
           door on TEEN MARY, 15, a set of blonde, Croatian twins we 
           will come to know as SNJEZENA and SVJETLANA, 15 (here), and a 
           FOURTH GIRL, 15. 

           As the door closes, Teen Mary and the twins throw off their 
           sheets, emerging scandalously clad. They immediately go about 
           tying their sheets together.  

           The fourth girl turns on her bedside lamp. 

                                 FOURTH GIRL 
                             (Accented hissing)
                        Again? Are you serious? 

                                 SVJETLANA
                             (Thick Croatian accent)
                        Say a word and we cut your fucking 
                        tongue out. 

           EXT. PARISIAN BOARDING SCHOOL DORMITORY - NIGHT

           The sheet-rope unravels out the window. One-by-one, the three 
           girls slide down and run off into the night.  

           PARIS MONTAGE - NIGHT 

           Teen Mary and the twins tear through the streets of Paris, 
           doing all the things underage kids do when they get away from 
           home. 

           INT. EVENT HALL - PRESENT

           On Mary.

                        But time has a way of dousing any 
                        fire, and, over the years, Mary's 
                        had subsided into a vague self-
                        doubt. Twenty-two, and a graduate 
                        of the Sorbonne, Mary found herself 
                        right back where she started.

           CONTINUED:

           Ben and Mukul rush through the room, removing the coats from 
           the hangers and piling them in each other's arms. They make 
           for a mad-cap comic sight: hustling from one coat to the next 
           while attempting to maintain the mounting armfuls. Mukul 
           slips on a fur coat and falls to the ground.

                        And, just as before, she was ready 
                        for something new.     

           INT. EVENT HALL 

           William is finishing his speech. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        And now, without further adieu, I 
                        give to you, the talented Sanje 
                        Padma. 

           The crowd rises in APPLAUSE as William gives the stage to 
           SANJE PADMA, a portly Indian carrying a sitar. The crowd 
           settles, Sanje readies his instrument, and launches into a 
           stylized rendition of Lynyrd Skynyrd's Freebird. 

           Suddenly, there is a RUCKUS by the exit. Sanje stumbles on 
           his sitar, and the crowd turns in offended shock to see: Ben 
           and Mukul, heavy with coats, steam roll the Doorman and make 
           their escape. 

           William, with a wave and a smile, assures the confused Sanje 
           it is okay to continue. The crowd, though flustered, 
           maintains a ruffled calm. 

           On Henry and Nancy, mortified. 

                                 HENRY
                        He stole the coats again. 

           On William, livid. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Gibbon stole the fucking coats 
                        again. 

           WHISPERS in the crowd: That damn Gibbon boy stole the coats 
           again. 

           On Mary, hearing her father's words and staring at the exit, 
           a slight smile on her face. 
           EXT. EVENT HALL ENTRANCE

           Ben and Mukul flee two steps at a time. Stray coats fly from 
           their arms and catch in the wind. 

           Freeze on this image.

                                 NARRATOR
                        When Ben was twenty-one, he took a 
                        leave of absence from University 
                        and hopped a bus out west 
                        unannounced. He contacted his 
                        family only once, via mail, with an 
                        affectionate letter confirming his 
                        health and safety, which he signed, 
                        Big Non Be, an anagram for Ben 
                        Gibbon, with one B left out. He 
                        returned seven months later in the 
                        company of Mukul. 

           The image unfreezes, and the boys hop into their convertible, 
           throwing the coats in the backseat and SPEEDING OFF. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Neither Ben nor Mukul ever told the 
                        story of how they came together. 
                        But they had been inseparable ever 
                        since.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Ben and Mukul move down a line of cardboard homes. Their arms 
           are piled high with the stolen coats, which they hand out to 
           the pleasantly surprised homeless residents of the boxes.    

                                 BEN
                        His name's Uberahl. Terrence 
                        Uberahl.

           COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE

           A blackened silhouette with a question mark on the figure's 
           head. It reads: Some say Genius. Some say Villain. Time's 
           Invisible Man of the Year. Who is Terrence Uberahl?

                                 BEN
                        Lowman's suing his company, Global 
                        Network, because he says 
                        teletransportation destroyed his 
                        soul and made him a murderer. 

                                 MUKUL
                        How so?

                                 BEN
                        The thing about it is, the first 
                        machine doesn't send your actual 
                        body. Instead, it copies you, 
                        breaks you down, sends your info to 
                        another machine, and that machine 
                        puts you back together with new 
                        shit. It's kind of like faxing 
                        yourself. Some shit like that. I 
                        don't really get it. It's 
                        confusing. All I know is, Lowman 
                        used to be an accountant, now he's 
                        a regular Mickey Knox. He 
                        transported to some client meeting, 
                        then, completely out of nowhere, 
                        stabbed his client to death with a 
                        corkscrew.

           A HOMELESS MAN, 60s, is sitting in front of his box on the 
           sidewalk. Ben hands him a coat.   

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        This is a girl's coat, kid. You got 
                        something else? 

           Ben takes the coat back, definitely a girl's coat, and hands 
           him a man's coat. 

           Ben and Mukul continue down the line of boxes, resuming their 
           discussion. 

                                 BEN
                        My dad's argument is, Lowman did it 
                        because something got left behind 
                        with his original physical 
                        material.  

                                 MUKUL
                        His soul.  

                                 BEN
                        Precisely. Now he's a soulless 
                        killer, so the argument goes.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MUKUL
                        Gotcha.   

                                 BEN
                        If my dad wins, he will have 
                        effectively proven the legal 
                        existence of the human soul. 
                        They're calling it the case of the 
                        century.     

           Ben balls his fist - on the hand he used to punch the wall - 
           and winces in pain. 

                                 MUKUL
                        You okay?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah.

           William, Beatrice and Mary stand over a coffee table, glasses

                        A toast. To Mary. To her academic 
                        success and renewed commitment to a

           They CLINK glasses and sip. The admonishment embedded in 
           William's compliments isn't lost on Mary. 

                                 MARY
                        Thanks, dad. 

           They sit. Beatrice lifts a Vogue magazine off the table and 
           pages through.

                        You know, I just can't stomach it. 
                        That's twice he stole the coats. 
                        Right in front of our eyes, no 
                        less. It's an affront. And an 
                        embarrassment to us. Henry will 
                        just have to write a check this

                        had a few sessions with the kid 
                        some years back. Said he had a 
                        screw loose. Said he had some kind 
                        of death wish, taking all those 
                        beatings. Imagine a psychiatrist 
                        saying that about someone? That

                        Young male gibbon, upon maturation, 
                        will challenge the dominant male 
                        for control of the family with the 
                        gibbon song. The dominant male 
                        responds in kind, warning the 
                        adolescent to desist. If the

           Ben leans into the mirror, studying his bruises. He runs a 
           finger over his cuts. There is a sense of ceremony in Ben's 
           focused survey of the damage done to him.   

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM

           Ben takes off his tux jacket and hangs it in his closet. The 
           girl's coat is on his bed. He picks it up and throws it over 
           a chair. Something falls from the pocket. He picks it up.  

           It's an invitation. Simple, white lettering, over black: Read 
           the directions and directly you will be directed in the right 
           direction. Below this, a Queens address and a date, 10/25.

           Mary's room looks like a hotel suite at the Ritz-Carlton. Any 
           hint of the girl who once lived here is gone. She SIGHS, 
           approaching her window and staring out into the night. 

                                 MARY
                             (Quietly, to herself)
                        Ben Gibbon. 

           EXT. THE LOWER EAST SIDE TO MIDTOWN - FROM LATE AFTERNOON TO 
           EARLY EVENING 

           Over whimsical MUSIC (think Minor Swing by Django Reinhardt), 
           Ben and Mukul emerge from a bike store with new bikes. Ben 
           wears a New York Jets football helmet, minus the face bars.    

           They cruise serenely through the streets of the city. Ben 
           smokes a cigarette and, at times, takes pulls from a flask he 
           keeps in his jacket pocket.   

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Not looking where he is going, Ben SLAMS into the back of a 
           hearse. The music SKIPS. Mukul takes note, and calmly comes 
           to a halt. Ben rises slowly, dusts himself off, assures a 
           worried HEARSE DRIVER he is okay and resumes his bike ride. 
           Just as calmly, Mukul follows behind him. The music resumes. 

           Soon, as if on que, Ben and Mukul nod to each other and part 
           ways. 

           EXT. QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE - MAGIC HOUR

           Ben bikes across the bridge. 

           Pull back. Ben is a tiny creature crossing a giant bridge in 
           a giant city. The sun sets over Manhattan.  

           EXT. QUEENS - CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Ben hops off his bike and leaves it on the street. He turns a 
           corner, arriving at a black door marked with the address from 
           the invitation. Ben opens the door on a dark hallway, and 
           ventures in.   

           INT. CLUB - HALLWAY

           At the end of the hall, an ornate picture frame lines a hole 
           cut into the wall. Standing in the frame is SNJEZENA (Snee-
           edge-enna), early 20s, a tough, blonde, Croatian bombshell 
           whom we recognize as the adult version of one of Mary's 
           boarding school accomplices. She is dressed like a Geisha.  

                                 BEN
                        Hi. I'm Ben Gibbon.

           Snjezena smiles. This is new. When she speaks, it is in a 
           thick Croatian accent.

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Hello, Ben. I am Snjezena. Do you 
                        have an invitation?

           Ben reaches into his pocket and pulls out the invitation. 

                                 SNJEZENA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, love.  

           Snjezena looks at the invitation, looks at Ben, looks back at 
           the invitation (at a serial number in the bottom corner). She 
           smiles quizzically. She's on to him. 

                                 SNJEZENA (CONT’D)
                        Go right ahead. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Snjezena nods to TWO SUITED BOUNCERS standing by a door at 
           the end of the hall. They step aside, and Ben passes through. 

           INT. CLUB - MAIN ROOM

           POV: The door opens on a cross between a rave and a Japanese 
           tea room. The rambunctious CLIENTELE sip alcohol from china 
           tea cups, served by Kimono-clad WAITRESSES. 

           Lining the walls are private rooms sectioned off from the 
           main floor. The walls of these rooms, facing out toward the 
           crowd, are sliding rice paper screens, backlit, so we can see 
           the silhouettes of the people within.    

           INT. THE CLUB - HALLWAY

           Mary approaches Snjezena's window.

                                 MARY
                        Hey, stranger. 

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Mary, you came!

                                 MARY
                        Wouldn't miss a reunion with my two 
                        favorite twins.

                                 SNJEZENA
                        It is so happy to see you. We go 
                        for coffee soon? Catch up?  

                                 MARY
                        I'd love to. (Sheepish) I lost the 
                        invite you sent me.  

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Yes, I already know this. A 
                        beautiful imposter boy with bruises 
                        just used it. He smiled nicely so I 
                        let him in. 

                                 MARY
                        A boy?

                                 SNJEZENA
                        A boy named Ben. 

                                 MARY
                             (Shock)
                        He's in there? 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Come. 

           Snjezena leads Mary to the door at the end of the hall, opens 
           it a crack and points Ben out, now wandering rather aimlessly 
           around the club with a drink in his hand. 

                                 SNJEZENA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know him? 

                                 MARY
                        I know of him. 

                                 SNJEZENA
                             (Smiling mischievously)
                        Mary mystery girl. I missed you.  

           INT. CLUB - MAIN ROOM

           Mary makes her way through the club and arrives at the bar, 
           tended by SVJETLANA (Svee-et-lanna), Snjezena's twin.

                                 MARY
                             (Over the noise)
                        Hey, stranger. 

                                 SVJETLANA
                        Draga! Is it you? 

                                 MARY
                        It's me. 

                                 SVJETLANA
                        This is happy. We go for coffee 
                        soon?

                                 MARY
                        Definitely.

                                 SVJETLANA
                        Can I get you a drink?  

                                 MARY
                        No, it's okay. I can't stay long. I 
                        just wanted to come say hi. But 
                        let's do that coffee. 

                                 SVJETLANA
                             (Teasing)
                        Look at Miss Mary, all grown up. No 
                        time for clubs, anymore? Pity, 
                        pity. Coffee it is! Coffee like 
                        grown up kittens. Like cats!  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Svjetlana GROWLS at Mary, leaving her to attend to patrons at 
           the other end of the bar. 

           A pair of hands slide over Mary's eyes. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Peek-a-boo, guess who? 

           Mary pulls the hands from her eyes and turns around. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh, my god! What are you doing 
                        here? 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        I heard you were back. Of course, I 
                        had to see you. 

                                 MARY
                        But how did you know I was here? 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        How else? I followed you. 

           The Tutor smiles, as if proud of himself. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        I got us a room so we can talk away 
                        from these animals. Venez. 

           He takes Mary by the hand, leading her away from the bar. We 
           follow them across the club and watch them enter a rice paper 
           room, but we remain outside as the door slides shut. Instead, 
           we enter the room next door. 

           INT. BEN'S RICE PAPER ROOM

           Ben sits alone, drinking, a little shy. There are several 
           clusters of people in the room. One COUPLE, sitting at the 
           end of a couch, stares at Ben. They are WAYNE, late 50s, and 
           BARBIE, early 30s. Wayne is a walrus of a man, dressed like a 
           Texas oil baron. Barbie is blonde, looking like Mamie Van 
           Doren somewhere between her heyday and her tailspin. 

                                 WAYNE
                             (Southern draw)
                        How'd you get that black eye?

                                 BEN
                        Defending a woman's honor.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WAYNE
                             (Chuckling)
                        Yeah, right.

           There is a long pause. Wayne stares. 

                                 WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        My wife thinks you're cute. Cute 
                        like a rabbit. (Pause) Hey, Rabbit. 
                        This here's my Barbie. And I'm 
                        Wayne. 

                                 BEN
                             (Extending his hand)
                        Nice to meet you. I'm Ben.

           Wayne shakes Ben's hand. Barbie doesn't. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Barbie, why don't you go sit over 
                        there with your new pet rabbit? 

           Barbie slides next to Ben. 

                                 BEN
                             (Uncomfortable)
                        You guys from around here? 

                                 WAYNE
                        Hey, Rabbit. You know what I always 
                        thought would be a cool way to die?  
                        In a shark attack. Imagine that!
                        Seriously, imagine it! Take a 
                        minute and think about it. A big, 
                        giant fish with big, giant, razor-
                        sharp teeth. Eating you!  

           Wayne pulls a bag of powder from his pocket and dumps a small 
           amount onto the table in front of them. He produces a 
           butterfly knife and uses it to cut the powder into lines. 

                                 WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Imagine feeling your arm get yanked 
                        out of its socket. Imagine swimming 
                        in your own guts. There's a horny 
                        beast circling you. It's getting 
                        turned on by your squirming.  

           Wayne scoops up some powder on the knife and SNIFFS it off 
           the blade. Tossing the knife on the table, he places his hand 
           above his forehead, mimicking a fin and the movement of a 
           shark around its victim. Wayne circles in on Ben, the victim. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        It fucks with you. It hangs back 
                        like so, then... rah! 

           Wayne lunges toward Ben and takes a bite out of his side. Ben 
           jolts.   

           INT. MARY'S RICE PAPER ROOM - SAME TIME

           The Tutor sits and runs his eyes over Mary. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        I missed you.

                                 MARY
                        Seriously, what the hell are you 
                        doing here? This place is so not 
                        you.  

           The Tutor grins guiltily. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You really followed me? 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Mais oui. 

           Mary LAUGHS. 

                                 MARY
                        That's totally weird! (Coy) Now I'm 
                        embarrassed. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Embarrassment has no place among 
                        friends. What matters is I'm here. 

           INT. BEN'S RICE PAPER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Close on Ben's face. Wayne's knife is under his nose. The 
           choice already made for him, he SNIFFS the powder off the 
           blade. 

                                 WAYNE
                        We're all running around like we're 
                        too special to get eaten. But we're 
                        not. We're just monkeys in suits, 
                        Rabbit. Silly, little mascots for 
                        the great big organ grinder in the 
                        sky. (Mimicking a monkey) Ooh ooh 
                        ah ah! What about you, Rabbit?  

                                                       CUT TO:
           BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, AS THE HEROES BURST 
           THROUGH THE DOOR OF THEIR CABIN, OUT INTO THE SUN. 

           BACK ON BEN

           A flurry of GUNSHOTS rings out.

                        Well, goddam! Here I was thinking 
                        you was just a scared little baby 
                        rabbit.
                             (To Barbie)
                        You hear that, Barbie? 
                             (To Ben)
                        Look at her. You got her all tuned 
                        up. It's true what they say. Every 
                        broad likes a bad boy.

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (Excitedly)
                        You must come visit me at my home, 
                        like old times. We could be more 
                        comfortable there, catch up the way 
                        old friends should. 

           Though Mary maintains her playful approach, a slight caution 
           is beginning to creep into her words. 

                                 MARY
                        We'll see. But, seriously, stop 
                        with the following thing, weirdo. 
                        Just call me next time! 

           The Tutor grows suddenly serious. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Are you ashamed of me, le petit?

                             (Taken aback)
                        What? What do you mean? There's 
                        nothing for me to be ashamed of. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Have you forgotten our wonderful 
                        conversations?

                        Of course not. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Your clarity of mind is a precious 
                        asset. Like casper! Do you 
                        remember?  

           The Tutor's unexpected turn has Mary overwhelmed. 

                                 MARY
                        Of course, I remember. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Would it trouble you greatly to 
                        stop by and lend me a bit of that 
                        youthful wisdom? I have an idea I 
                        would like to discuss, and we 
                        should toast your graduation! Oui? 

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, okay. I'll stop by. 

           The Tutor drops his serious tone, and brightens. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Bravo! You won't regret it. 

           INT. BEN'S RICE PAPER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Close on Ben's face, wide eyed and sweaty. Drugged. Suddenly, 
           the knife shoots into frame, held just below his nose. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Football?

                        Wayne, I think I'm too fucked up.

                             (To Barbie)
                        Rabbit's too fucked up, Barbie.

                                 BEN
                        Way too fucked up. 

           Wayne still wants Ben to take the drugs.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        No, Sir. I think I'm quite alright. 
                        In fact, I think I should be 
                        leaving now. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Ben rises to go. Wayne twitches. He pulls the knife back and 
           quickly SNIFFS the line of powder off the blade. He SNORTS 
           and rises quickly to his feet, stopping Ben in his tracks.

                                 WAYNE
                        You wait just a goddam second, now. 
                        We were just getting started here, 
                        Rabbit. (To Barbie) Barb, you wanna 
                        dance with Rabbit?    

                                 BARBIE
                        Yes! 

           Barbie jumps to her feet, launching into an over-the-top sexy 
           dance. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Dance with her, Rabbit. 

           For a brief moment, Ben does his best to comply, awkwardly 
           affecting a dance while Barbie inches in. 

                                 BARBIE
                        This is fun! 

                                 WAYNE
                             (Pleased)
                        Yes, ma'am! 

           Barbie shimmies downward, dropping it low. Ben pulls her up 
           by her shoulders.  

                                 BEN
                        Let's stay up here. It's nicer up 
                        here. 

           She turns her back to him, swinging her arms in a windmill. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Wow. That's unusual, but, okay. 

           Then, Barbie thrusts herself backward, grinding her ass into 
           his crotch. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I actually think I should be going.

           Ben stops dancing and turns to leave. Wayne gets in his way.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I said dance, Rabbit. My wife is my 
                        shining angel, and if my angel 
                        wants to dance, my angel's gonna 
                        dance.

                        You wouldn't aim to hurt my angel's 
                        feelings, would you rabbit?

                             (Gathering courage)
                        No Sir, Wayne. But, like I said, I 
                        have to be leaving now. I apologize 
                        for letting your beautiful bride 
                        down, but-

           Ben takes a big gulp, gathering courage.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You're either going to let me past, 
                        or I'm going to make you let me.  

           Wayne tosses his hat. 

                                 WAYNE
                        So you want to dance with Wayne? 
                        Now, there's some sand! 
                             (To Barbie)
                        Step aside, darling. Looks like me 
                        and Rabbit are gonna throw down. 
                             (To Rabbit)
                        Sure on it. We're gonna throw it 
                        right on down. 

           INT. MARY'S RICE PAPER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Mary sits alone. Shaken, contemplative, smoking a cigarette. 

           Suddenly, with a CRASH, Wayne and Ben come bursting through 
           the wall. Wayne tumbles on top of Ben and starts pummeling 
           his face.  

           Ben, in the midst of the onslaught, looks up at Mary. Mary, 
           shocked, looks down at Ben. As Ben takes a punch to the face, 
           the image freezes. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           POV: We are seeing through Ben's eyes. His vision is blurred 
           and confused. Mary comes into our view, leaning over us.  

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ben is sprawled out on the Bed, still wearing his clothes 
           from the night before. He has been beaten badly this time. 

           Mary is huddled in her trench coat on a couch across the 
           room. She wakes, rubbing her eyes, and takes in her 
           surroundings. She stands and timidly approaches the sleeping 
           Ben. 

           Ben jolts awake, quickly rising. Mary, surprised, jumps back. 

           They face each other. 

                                 BEN
                        Hi. 

                                 MARY

                                 BEN
                        Thanks for getting me home.  

                                 MARY
                        My pleasure. Are you okay?

           Ben says nothing. Mary steps forward, almost cautiously. 
           Coming close, she reaches out and places her fingers on his 
           face, running them over his cuts.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM

           Ben's hand turns the shower knob. 

           Ben stands in front of the mirror, getting a first look at 
           his face. He examines himself. He looks pretty bad this time. 
           His expression betrays his first thought: There's a hot girl 
           in the other room, and he looks like shit. 

           Ben psyches himself up. He takes a step back and, in the 
           fashion of a gunfighter, draws on his reflection. In a 
           whisper, he SHOOTS, and holsters his gun. 

           He turns, but quickly turns back, drawing and SHOOTING again. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Ben exits the bathroom in a towel. He is covered in bruises. 

           He pauses; Mary is gone. There is a note on his bed: 

           Juliet's at 7? Mary.

           Mukul is drinking a cup of coffee. Ben enters in a fresh 
           leisure suit. Mukul hands him a cup. They drink.

                        We should go. 

           They each take a final gulp.

           INT. GIBBON FAMILY DINING ROOM - LATER

           Henry and Nancy sit across the table from Ben and Mukul at a 
           mahogany dining table in a conservatively decorated dining 
           room. They eat breakfast. 

           BEETHOVEN plays.  

           Tension. 

                                 NANCY
                        Your poor face. I can't look at 
                        that face. I just don't understand 
                        how you let these things happen to 
                        you. Did you forget that you're a 
                        nice boy?

                                 HENRY
                        He's an embarrassment is what he

                        Henry, please. 

           An awkward pause. 

                                 MUKUL
                        I like the choice of music, Mrs.

           Henry EXHALES angrily.

           Henry tosses a bread basket across the table. Mukul ducks a 
           flying roll. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I've had enough of this nonsense. 
                        You're a disgrace, Benjamin! You're 
                        not fit for this family!

                        He steals coats from charity 
                        events! My twenty-four-year-old 
                        son! How do you think that reflects 
                        on me? I am this (shows "this" with 
                        his fingers) close to winning the 
                        most important case of my career. 
                        I'm on the verge of making history, 
                        and you are single-handedly 
                        dismantling this family's 
                        reputation. A reputation I have 
                        worked my entire life to build! A

                        Benjamin, I'm going to ask that you 
                        keep yourself quarantined. We won't 
                        be requiring your presence at the 
                        Halloween Gala. 

                                 NANCY

                                 HENRY
                        You are a disgrace. To yourself and 
                        to my name.   

           Silence. CHEWING. The table awaits Ben's next move. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Suddenly, Ben shoots a threatening glance at Henry, and 
           HOOTS, like a gibbon monkey. Henry stares at Ben; Ben holds 
           his stare, and HOOTS again. The challenge has been made.  

           Henry puffs his chest and HOOTS back. Ben POUNDS his fist on 
           the table, HOOTING twice. Henry lets out an enraged HOOT, 
           sweeping the plates and dishes off the table.  

           Ben jumps on the table. He lifts a plate of sausages and 
           flings it across the room. Henry follows suit, leaping on the 
           table and letting out a warcry HOOT.  

           In a tense moment, father and son stand facing each other on 
           the table. They hold each other's eyes. This is Ben's last 
           chance to submit. But, inhaling deeply and throwing his head 
           back, Ben releases his most savage HOOT yet.  

           Henry lunges. Ben dives and runs up the stairs to the second 
           floor. Henry follows closely. 

           Reaching the top of the stairs, Ben doubles back and leaps 
           off the banister, grabbing hold of the dangling chandelier. 
           He swings back and forth, HOOTING at his father, who watches 
           from the top of the stairs. Henry takes a running leap and 
           dives at the chandelier, knocking Ben to the floor. 

           Henry pursues Ben. They lay waste to the house in their 
           battle.  

           BACK TO THE MOMENT BEFORE THE CHALLENGE 

           Close on Ben's face. Tears well up in his eyes. He swallows 
           hard, fighting them back. 

           He rises from his chair and leaves the room. 

                                 MUKUL
                        Thank you for breakfast, Mr. and 
                        Mrs. Gibbon. 

           Mukul dutifully follows.

           On Mary. She is on her best behavior. Her hair is clean, tied 
           back tight, and she wears a Sunday dress. She takes small, 
           careful bites from her fork, with all the grace of someone 
           who has been taught just how to do so.  

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        I'm not even going to ask where you 
                        were. I don't want to know. But 
                        this is truly disappointing, Mary.

                        We've always had such high hopes 
                        for you, and yet you continually 
                        let us down. 

                                 MARY
                        I'm sorry.  

           Pull back to reveal Mary at breakfast with her parents. They 
           eat quietly.

           Beatrice leans forward to take a bite from her fork. She 
           misses, and the food slides off the fork, splashing in egg 
           yoke.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I sincerely hope you are. In this 
                        world, you are only as good as they

                        are Mary Rathcart. I can't have you 
                        out all night, doing God knows 
                        what. Especially not now. 
                        Respectability is nothing more than 
                        an absence of scandal in the face 
                        of scrutiny. Without scrutiny, 
                        there can be no respect. And 
                        without respect, you're nothing. 
                        Sooner or later, you'll need to 
                        accept that.   

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Mary stands in her room, frustrated by the confrontation at 
           breakfast. She glances around and takes a deep BREATH. 

           She makes a decision. 

           She goes to her closet and removes a large duffel. She moves 
           about her room, resolutely stuffing clothes into the bag. 

           INT. JULIET'S - EVENING

           Ben sits in a diner booth. He glances at his watch: 7:10.

                        At ten past seven, Ben began to 
                        wonder if Mary would show up at 
                        all. He didn't want to care but, 
                        the truth was, he did. He had spent 
                        the day thinking about his 
                        interesting, though brief, 
                        encounter with her, and was 
                        relieved that she wanted to see him

                        Now, confronted with the 
                        possibility that Mary had 
                        reconsidered, a dim sense of regret 
                        began to creep in on him.      

           Mary enters the restaurant and spots Ben. She approaches, her 
           bag slung over her shoulder. She sits.  

                                 BEN
                        You showed.

                        Did you think I wouldn't?   

           Ben shrugs, attempting to be casual.  

                                 BEN
                        Where are you going?

                        What do you mean? I'm not going 
                        anywhere. I just got here, dummy. 

                                 BEN
                        You're carrying a bag. I figure, 
                        you packed a bag because you're 
                        going somewhere. 

                                 MARY
                             (Coy)
                        No. Not going anywhere.

                                 BEN
                        So, what's in the bag? 

                                 MARY
                        Not much. A couple outfits. A few 
                        other things. What's with the third 
                        degree? Can't a girl carry a bag? 

           Ben points down at the bag.

                                 BEN
                        That's no bag. That's a suitcase. 

                                 MARY
                             (Playing defeated)
                        Well, if you must know, I had to 
                        unexpectedly vacate my residence. 
                        Temporarily.

                                 BEN
                        Where are you staying?

                                 MARY
                        I haven't figured that out yet. 
                        But, don't you worry about me.  
                        (Blatantly changing the subject) I 
                        had such a big breakfast but, for 
                        some reason, I really want waffles, 
                        with lots of butter and syrup. What 
                        are you feeling? I could be into 
                        splitting two things, but it 
                        depends on what you get.  

           What Ben says next, comes from a place within him over which 
           he has no control. 

                                 BEN
                        You can stay with me. 

           Mary smiles. She got what she wanted.  

                                 MARY
                        Really? 

                                 BEN
                        It's not bedbugs, is it? 

                                 MARY
                        What do you mean?

                                 BEN
                        You said you had to vacate your 
                        residence. That sounds like 
                        bedbugs. 

                                 MARY
                             (Laughing)
                        No. Not bedbugs. Are you sure it's 
                        not weird? I could find somewhere 
                        else to stay. 

                                 BEN
                        It's cool, I like sleep overs.  

           They sit in a moment of silence, both of them pleased.

                        So, what's your last name? 

                                 MARY
                        We're already on a first name 
                        basis. Why digress?  

           Ben doesn't know what to make of this. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        Why, are you the president's 
                        daughter?

                                 MARY
                        Not exactly. 

                                 BEN
                        Fair enough, Mary. I'm Ben Gibbon.

           Mary is a little surprised by how forthright Ben is proving 
           to be. 

                                 MARY
                        I'll tell you, if you really want 
                        to know, but then you'll go on 
                        Facebook and spoil everything. 
                        There's something refreshing about 
                        anonymity. 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, I get that. You could be an 
                        assassin, hired to kill me. It's 
                        exciting. I'm not stressed about 
                        it, as long as my dad didn't send 
                        you.   

                                 MARY
                        Why would your dad send someone to 
                        kill you?  

                                 BEN
                             (Laughing)
                        Never mind. I don't do Facebook, by 
                        the way. 

           Mary is liking Ben more and more. 

                                 MARY
                        This is going to be fun. 

           A WAITRESS appears at the table.

                        Sure does.

                        Coming right up. 

           The waitress leaves the table. Ben stares at Mary.  

                                 BEN
                        Do you know who Ken Kesey is?  

                                 MARY
                        I do.

                                 BEN
                        He had this thing where he always 
                        talked about making his movie. 
                        Like, he was living his life, 
                        making his movie. I always liked 
                        that. I always thought of my life 
                        that way.  

           Mary thinks this over, then takes a risk: 

                                 MARY
                        So, am I in your movie now? 

                                 BEN
                        Seems to be the case.

           Mary puffs her chest in mock pride.

                        Well, lucky for you, I studied 
                        acting at the Sorbonne. I'm going 
                        to be great in your movie.

                             (Playing along)
                        Then, consider this your audition. 

                                 MARY
                        I'm bad at crying, though. They had 
                        a whole class for crying on demand. 
                        I could never do it. Our final was 
                        the Sally Field scene from Steele 
                        Magnolias. I sucked. 

           The waitress comes back with the root beers.

                                 BEN AND MARY
                        Thank you. 

           They CLINK bottles and sip.

                        We need a little backstory. For our 
                        movie. How about, we both get to 
                        ask one question? 

                                 BEN

                                 MARY
                        Alright, slugger. Why does your 
                        face look like that? 

                                 BEN
                        You saw my face get like this. 

                                 MARY
                        No, I saw you get beat up. But 
                        that's not how your face got like 
                        that. It was like that before. I 
                        saw you.   

                                 BEN
                        You were checking me out?

                        Maybe.

           Ben settles back in his chair.  

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           YOUNG BEN, 7, dressed in a miniature leisure suit, sits with 
           a YOUNG GIRL, 7. The girl, who wears glasses, is hunched over 
           a Lunchable, making a cracker sandwich. She hands the 
           sandwich to Ben, who accepts it nonchalantly, too busy with 
           Nietzsche's Will to Power to pay her much attention.  

                                 YOUNG BEN
                        Even the human body is nothing but 
                        a series of power struggles.  

           The girl does not understand what Ben is saying, but she bats 
           her eyelids, fully impressed.    

           Suddenly, the book is SLAPPED out of Ben's hands. A group of 
           BULLIES stands over them.  

                                 LEAD BULLY
                        Only girls read.  

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        He was reading to me.  

           The Lead Bully reaches out and grabs the girl's glasses off 
           her face. 

                                 LEAD BULLY
                        Try making sandwiches for your 
                        boyfriend now.  

           Ben stands and faces the Lead Bully.  

                                 YOUNG BEN
                        What's a foot for?

                                 LEAD BULLY
                        What?

                                 YOUNG BEN
                        What's a foot for?

           The Lead Bully does not know how to respond.  

                                 YOUNG BEN (CONT’D)
                        For kicking. 

           Ben KICKS the Lead Bully in the balls, and follows with a 
           swift PUNCH to the face.

           Close on the Lead Bully's nose BREAKING. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The other Bullies pounce on Ben, who disappears under the 
           pile, taking punches from all sides, smiling on the way down. 

           BACK IN JULIET'S 

           The waitress brings their food to the table. 

                                 BEN AND MARY
                        Thank you. 

           Ben cuts his burger in half and Mary does the same to her 
           waffle. They make their exchange and dig in.

                        Believe it or not, Ben was telling

                        principled.

                                 BEN
                        Now, I get a question. (Pauses, 
                        thinking) Where did you learn your 
                        manners? 

           Mary smiles.

                                 MARY

                        You haven't put your elbows on the 
                        table since we sat down. Your 
                        napkin is folded and placed on your 
                        lap. 

           Mary looks down at the napkin placed on her lap.

                        You don't slouch. 

           On Mary's posture, perfect.

                        And the way you hold your utensils. 
                        The fork is balanced between your 
                        middle finger and the tip of your 
                        index finger while the thumb 
                        steadies the handle. And you hold 
                        your fork in your left hand when 
                        you cut, then place your knife down 
                        on your plate and switch your fork 
                        to your right hand to take the 
                        bite. The zig-zag method, standard 
                        etiquette. 

           Ben points at Mary with his fork and speaks with a mouthful 
           of food.

                        You have very good table manners.

           Mary concedes, and launches into a story... 

                                 MARY
                        Well, my parents sent me to school 
                        in Paris when I was- 

           Mary continues, but her voice drops out.  

           Instead:  

                                 NARRATOR
                        Mary went about telling the story 
                        of her extended term of cultivation 
                        in Paris, allowing hints of her 
                        rebellious streak to shine through 
                        in an effort to avoid sounding... 
                        lame... The stories we tell are 
                        often just as much about the 
                        details we choose to omit, as those 
                        we choose to include. And, as Mary 
                        told her Paris story, her mind was 
                        stuck on a rather large detail 
                        that, in it's deliberate omission, 
                        revealed itself for what it truly 
                        was: a secret. This realization 
                        gave her pause... 

           On Mary. She falters in her story telling, her eyes drifting 
           downward into a blank daze. 

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Suddenly, she was overwhelmed.

           Something like panic washes over her.

           She snaps out of it.

                                 MARY
                        What? Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's a 
                        little hot in here, huh?. I think I 
                        just need some water.

           Mary CHUGS her glass of water. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        What was I saying? Oh yeah, so-

           Mary continues, but her voice drops out.  

                                 NARRATOR
                        Mary momentarily put her concerns 
                        aside and picked up where she left 
                        off. But the details of her 
                        omission made for a far more 
                        interesting story and, indeed, a 
                        far more relevant one. That story 
                        begins like this:

           EXT. PARIS - BLACK AND WHITE

           A slightly younger Mary, 20, strolls through the Pere-
           Lachaise Cemetary. 

           As she walks, looking closely at a name here and there, a 
           dark figure looms in the foreground, watching her from a 
           distance.   

           POV: We follow Mary with the figure.  

           EXT. COURTYARD OF THE HOTEL COSTES - BLACK AND WHITE

           Mary sits alone at a table, sipping a cappuccino and reading 
           a book of Greek Myths.  

           A man approaches. It's the Tutor.

           The conversation vacillates between French and English, with 
           all French subtitled. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (French)
                        Well hello, little American. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARY
                             (English)
                        Hi! How was your flight?  

           She rises to hug him. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (English)
                        Quick and easy. 

           They sit. 

                                 MARY
                             (English)
                        It's really so sweet of you to want 
                        to show me around.  

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (French)
                        When your father said you were 
                        staying in Paris for university, I 
                        figured you might benefit from 
                        seeing the city through the eyes of 
                        a native.

           Mary smiles with self-effacement. 

                                 MARY
                             (English)
                        Well, I hope you didn't come all 
                        this way just for me. 

           The Tutor, somewhat conspicuously, changes the subject. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (French)
                        Where are you focusing your 
                        studies?

                                 MARY
                             (French)
                        Acting. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (French)
                        Ah, magnificent. A far more useful 
                        trade than some might think.  

           Mary LAUGHS dryly. Suddenly, she's a bit... uncomfortable? 

                                 MARY
                             (English)
                        I hope so. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (French)
                        Paris, via New York. Very chic. 
                             (English)
                        But you've been gone so long! Don't 
                        you miss America? I like America. I 
                        like the people. People like you, 
                        Mary. You have passion. No one 
                        rivals the passion of the French 
                        like the Americans. But its a 
                        different passion. The French have 
                        a passion for self. When you think 
                        of France, what do you think of?  

                                 MARY
                             (English)
                        I don't know. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (English)
                        C'mon! You think of our bread, our 
                        cheese, our coffee, our wine, our 
                        women. Cezanne, Monet, Godard. 
                        We're hedonists. You even named 
                        your kisses after us. But say 
                        "America" and we think of your 
                        democracy, your army, your  
                        influence, your reality television. 
                        America's passion is for the other. 
                        America loves the human race so 
                        deeply, it must possess it... Don't 
                        tell anyone, but I suspect my 
                        passions are often more American 
                        than French. 

           On Mary. Embarrassed. 

           INT. JULIET'S 

           On Mary. Embarrassed. Awash in her memory. 

           Ben's nose begins to bleed.

                                 MARY
                        You're bleeding.

           Ben quickly reacts, putting his napkin to his nose.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Here, let me see.

           Mary comes around to Ben and grabs the napkin. She leans his 
           head back and cleans his face.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        There you go.

           Electricity. 

           Suddenly, there is a jarring BOOM from off-screen and a blast 
           of fire from the kitchen. Over Ben's shoulder, we see the 
           EMPLOYEES of the restaurant running about, SHOUTING, while 
           the PATRONS go into a panic. The kitchen, it seems, has 
           exploded.  

           Ben and Mary do not take their eyes off each other.   

                                 HOSTESS (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentleman, we have a 
                        small emergency taking place in the 
                        kitchen. If you could please calmly 
                        exit the restaurant, we can get 
                        this sorted out.  

           The sprinkler system goes off, and the PATRONS, hardly 
           obeying the Hostess' request to proceed calmly, begin rushing 
           and pushing toward the door. But Ben and Mary do not move. 

           Suddenly, Mary lunges toward Ben and kisses him hard on the 
           lips. She quickly pulls away.

                                 MARY
                        I'm sorry.

           Ben kisses her back, longer and deeper. The water from the 
           sprinkler rains down on them. 

           INT. STAIRWELL OF BEN'S APT. BUILDING - LATER

           Mary's bag is slung over Ben's shoulder. He follows her up 
           the stairs. Her butt shakes in his face. He pokes it. She 
           looks back and GIGGLES, running up the next flight of stairs.  

           INT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Mary burst through the door, wet, out of breath, 
           flirtatious.  

           Mukul is standing at the kitchen counter with his back to us. 
           Without turning, he waves hello.

           Mary SNIFFS and winces. 

                                 MARY
                             (Whispering)
                        What's that smell?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Malodor. Mukul's making stink 
                        bombs. 

           Ben whisks Mary into his room. Mary drops her purse, some of 
           the contents spill onto the floor. 

           We stay on Mukul, facing him now, and see that he is wearing 
           a surgical mask. Carefully arranged in front of him are 
           several hardboiled eggs, a long eye dropper, a plastic bottle 
           labeled, "US Government Standard Bathroom Malodor", a straw 
           and a roll of aluminum foil. He gets to work. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM

           Mary is looking through the things in her bag.

                                 MARY
                        I really don't like any of my stuff 
                        anymore. 

                                 BEN
                        Why?   

                                 MARY
                        Well, I guess I never really loved 
                        any of it. 

           She stands, and walks over to Ben's closet. She casually 
           opens it and sorts through, coming upon her own coat.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                             (Knowing)
                        Where'd you get this? 

                                 BEN
                        Long story, but I stole it. You 
                        want it? 

                                 MARY
                             (Smiling to herself)
                        No, thanks. 

           She continues sorting and arrives at the t-shirts. There's 
           Big L, Tupac, Biggie, Pantera, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, 
           Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, Sid Vicious, Lynard Skynard, Bob 
           Marley, Marvin Gaye, etc. She picks out the Sid Vicious.  

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        These people are all dead. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BEN
                        Yep. 

                                 MARY
                        Turn around.

           Ben turns. Mary strips her wet clothes and slips on the Sid 
           Vicious t-shirt. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           Mary, wearing the t-shirt, her hair wet, makes for an idyllic 
           image. Ben stares.   

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Don't look at me like that. You're 
                        making me shy.  

           They spend a moment in silence. Ben is transfixed. There is a 
           hole in the t-shirt. Mary pokes a finger through it.   

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        There's a hole in it. 

           Mary turns away from Ben and, affecting an innocent 
           curiosity, peruses his room. 

           She comes across a red, plastic View-Master and puts it to 
           her eyes.  

           VIEW THROUGH THE VIEW-MASTER, IMAGES CYCLING DOWN WITH A 
           CLICK: A MOUNTAIN RANGE, A BEACH.

                                 MARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I want to run away to one 
                        of these places. Start a totally 
                        new life where no one knows me. Be 
                        totally anonymous.   

           BACK IN THE ROOM

           She puts the View-Master down, looking at Ben. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Is that stupid? 

                                 BEN
                        It isn't stupid at all. 

           She smiles and approaches the fully stocked bookshelf, 
           running her finger along the titles. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        What? Why would you ask that?

                        I don't know. Just curious.

                        About what?

                        I didn't realize I had a choice.

                                 MARY
                        Seriously, when you think about 
                        dying, do you want it? Is it 
                        something that excites you?

                        Well, do you want to live?

           Ben shrugs.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                             (Laughing)
                        That's fucked up, slugger. So... do 
                        you want to pay me before or after 
                        the sex? 

           Ben is shocked. Mary LAUGHS.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You don't really think I'd sleep 
                        with you looking like that, do you? 

           Ben struggles to keep up. 

                                 BEN
                        I don't think anything. 

           Mary softens and sits next to him on the bed. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MARY
                        I'm joking. I think you look cute. 
                        (Off Ben's disbelief) Really. I do. 
                        And I'm not a whore, just so you 
                        know.  

                                 BEN
                        Were you hoping I would invite you 
                        to stay with me?

                                 MARY
                        I knew you would. 

                                 BEN
                        That's a little presumptuous, isn't 
                        it? 

                                 MARY
                        No.

                                 BEN
                        Why not?

                                 MARY
                        Because I could just tell something 
                        about you. And, anyway, I was 
                        right, wasn't I? 

           Mary leaps onto Ben's bed and stands, looking down at him.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Do you really want to die? 

                                 BEN
                        I didn't say I want to. 

                                 MARY
                        But you didn't say you don't want 
                        to. 

           Mary begins bouncing on the bed. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It's nothing to be ashamed of. I 
                        get it, I think. It's just a simple 
                        matter of curiosity. Who wouldn't 
                        be curious? I sometimes wonder what 
                        it feels like, you know? That 
                        moment... when you officially cross 
                        the line. Click. Out. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        That used to keep me up at night 
                        when I was a kid. 

           Mary stops bouncing. 

                                 MARY
                        What did?

                                 BEN
                        That moment. Crossing the line. But 
                        with sleep. I started thinking 
                        about the moment your mind clicks 
                        off, the moment you officially fall 
                        asleep, and I started paying 
                        attention to it and looking for it 
                        so hard that I stopped it from 
                        happening. I would be lying there, 
                        thinking, "Here it comes." 
                        Thinking, and then it wouldn't 
                        come. I didn't sleep for three 
                        months.

           Mary LAUGHS.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        No, really, it was a problem.

           Mary resumes her bouncing. 

                                 MARY
                        So, what's it like getting punched 
                        in the face?

                                 BEN
                        I don't know. It hurts

                                 MARY
                        Do you like that or something?

           A pregnant pause. Mary stops bouncing. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Will you punch me in the face? I 
                        want to know what it feels like. 

           Mary drops to her knees and sticks out her chin for Ben to 
           punch.

                                 BEN
                             (Laughing, incredulous)
                        What? No.

                                 MARY
                        Do it. Punch me in the face, I give 
                        you permission. Right in the 
                        kisser. 

                                 BEN
                        I'm not going to do that.

                                 MARY
                        Come on. A girl hardly ever gets 
                        the chance. On the count of three, 
                        punch me in the face, or I'm gonna 
                        punch you. One....... Twwwwoooo.. 
                        I'll do it... Three.

           Mary gives Ben a right hook to the jaw.

                                 BEN
                        Ouch!

                            (Giggling)
                        You didn't do it.

           Ben grabs his jaw in pain.

                                 BEN
                        I didn't think you were serious. 

           Mary moves close to Ben and puts her hand on his face.

                                 MARY
                        Aww, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do 
                        it so hard. I guess I'm a natural.

           A moment passes.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        What are you thinking about, 
                        right... now?

                                 BEN
                        Well, now I'm thinking about you 
                        asking me what I'm thinking about, 
                        so I don't know. What are you 
                        thinking about?

                                 MARY
                        Now I don't know, either.

                        See? How about, on the count of 
                        three, we both say what we're 
                        thinking at the same time. Then, 
                        depending on what you say, maybe 
                        I'll punch you in the face.

           Mary LAUGHS.

                                 MARY
                        Okay. Ready? One...Two...Three-

           EXT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Close on Mary's cellphone, on the floor beside her purse, 
           VIBRATING with a call.

           Pull back. Mukul, smoking a joint and looking rather high, 
           stands silently over the phone, considering his next move. 

           He answers.

                                 MUKUL
                        Hello?

           A long pause. 

                                 THE TUTOR (O.S.)
                        Pinocchio?

                                 MUKUL
                        Excuse me?

                                 THE TUTOR (O.S.)
                        Pinocchio.  

                                 MUKUL
                        What about him?

                                 TUTOR (O.S.)
                        He was nosey.

           Over the phone, a soft, threatening CHUCKLE.  

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - LIBRARY - SAME TIME

           The Tutor is obscured in the darkness of the room.

                                 THE TUTOR
                        It got him into trouble.  
           BACK ON MUKUL

           Mukul almost smiles in disbelief. But he doesn't.  

                                 MUKUL
                        Hey, fuck you man.

                                 THE TUTOR (O.S.)
                        Well, Pinocchio, could you please 
                        remind Mary that I am expecting her 
                        tomorrow evening?   

                                 MUKUL
                        And whom should I say is calling? 

           BACK ON THE TUTOR

                                 THE TUTOR 
                        Her number one fan.  

           CLICK.  

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

           Mukul drives the Sunliner, Ben sits passenger.   

                                 MUKUL
                        I don't like her.

                        No?

                                 MUKUL
                        No. 

           Ben considers this. He values Mukul's opinion. 

                                 BEN
                        Why not?

                                 MUKUL
                        Because she brought you home 
                        unconscious, she managed to move in 
                        within a day... and because a guy 
                        calling himself her Number One Fan 
                        called her and calls me Pinocchio. 
                        And there's something about her. 
                        She holds herself like a liar.  

           Ben LAUGHS to himself.

                        Because it rang.

           The car drives past a large building. A sign out front reads: 
           Global Network. PICKETERS are gathered outside: Philosophy 
           professors, students, assorted hippies and some religious 
           folk, carrying signs and SCREAMING slogans like, 
           Psychological continuity is not enough!; What's wrong with 
           airplanes?; Telebortion!   

           As the car passes, we stay on the crowd outside the building. 

           A female NEWS REPORTER, late 20s, stands in front of the 
           crowd, in the middle of a report.  

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        That's right, Ken. We are outside 
                        the headquarters of Global Network, 
                        whose controversial 
                        teletransportation technology is 
                        creating quite a stir as the 
                        landmark case, Lowman Vs. Global 
                        Network, nears closing arguments. 

           She sticks the microphone in the face of a PICKETING 
           METAPHYSICIAN (who wears a t-shirt that reads: Picketing 
           Metaphysician), 30s, bearded.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Sir, why are you protesting?

                                 PICKETING METAPHYSICIAN
                        This technology is perverting the 
                        sanctity of human life. I hope Mr. 
                        Gibbon puts Global Network out of 
                        business!

           INT. HALLOWEEN STORE - SAME TIME

           Close on the face of Snjezena. She's wearing pair of Groucho 
           Marx glasses, complete with nose, and points a finger at us.  

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Shady bitch.

           Pull back to reveal a brightly lit Halloween store, glowing 
           candy pink and lined with props, costumes, masks, etc. Think: 
           Ricky's.  

           Snjezena, we now see, is pointing at Mary, who wears Ben's 
           Kurt Cobain t-shirt, fashioned into a dress, with a belt 
           cinched around her waste. 

                                 MARY
                        What's so shady about it?

           Svjetlana, wearing a Batman mask, is standing behind Mary. 
           The twins surround her.

                        Jebi ga! 
                             (To Mary)
                        Look at you, uptown girl. So scared 
                        of your fucking fuck Daddy Esquire. 

                                 MARY
                        It has nothing to do with what my 
                        father may or may not think. 

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Oh, no? 

                                 MARY
                        No! It has everything to do with 
                        what Ben may or may not think... if 
                        he knew who my father was. 

                                 SNJEZENA
                        Like a poor little cage bird.

           Svjetlana lifts a devil pitchfork from the rack and tosses 
           it, like a spear, at Snjezena. 

                                 SVJETLANA
                        So, birdie, did you fuck your 
                        fightboy yet? Does he have big one?

                                 MARY
                        Eeew! No! No way.

                        to, slut? Miss Mary "I don't put 
                        out until the tenth date" Rathcart.

           Snjezena spanks Mary with the pitchfork. Mary retreats to the 
           next aisle.

                                 MARY
                        Shut up!

                        Oh, Mary. Let's go to la Louvre! 

                                 MARY
                        Gross. No... fucking... way. Not 
                        even close. He's just a family 
                        friend, who's honestly starting to 
                        weird me out. 

                                 SVJETLANA
                        About time. 

                                 MARY
                        But that's a whole other thing... 
                        Weren't we talking about Ben? I did 
                        kiss him, and it was totally  
                        embarrassing. I said "sorry" 
                        after... But then he kissed me 
                        back. It was cute.

           The twins brighten. 

           Mary lifts a black wig off a mannequin head and tries it on, 
           fussing with it in a mirror. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But seriously, I don't want to tell 
                        him yet. I'll see where it goes. I 
                        prefer a little mystery, anyway. 
                        Mystery's sexy.

           Mary, with the wig still on, tries on a pair of black 
           sunglasses. 

                                 MARY
                        Look at someone like Jackie O. She 
                        was anonymous, so beautiful behind 
                        those big, black glasses. To me, 
                        that's sexy.  

           The twins trade costumes. 

                                 SNJEZENA
                             (Looking in mirror)

                        No. That's not it. Or maybe that's 
                        just it. I have always had to be 
                        Mary Rathcart. 

           Mary pauses, lost in a moment of confusion.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I don't even know who that is 
                        anymore. But I do know that I don't 
                        want to let my last name stop this 
                        thing in its tracks, just because 
                        his last name is Gibbon.

                        He's the son of my father's arch 
                        nemesis. Like, arch.   

                                 SNJEZENA
                        So? He's sexy enemy boy. 

                                 MARY
                        He's completely rejected a world 
                        that I'm stuck in. He probably 
                        thinks he's slumming it. And I know 
                        it's stupid, but I'm nervous about 
                        what the truth would mean to him. 

                                 SNJEZENA

                        And, until I do, I'm just Mary. For 
                        him, I'm just Mary.

           INT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ben and Mukul are sitting on the couch, watching the news. 
           The room is smokey. Mukul is high. 

           Mary enters the apartment.

                                 MARY
                        Hey, guys. 

                                 BEN
                        Hey, there. 

           On the television screen, a MAN, middle-aged, sits in an 
           interrogation room. He speaks calmly, giving an interview, 
           bound in a straightjacket. A caption on the screen reads: 
           Exclusive Interview with Phillip Lowman from inside Sing Sing 
           Correctional Facility.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        But isn't it a little convenient to 
                        blame it on teletransportation? 
                        There are a lot of people who 
                        commit murder every year. Are they 
                        all soulless? 

                                 LOWMAN
                        Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. 
                        I'm no expert. The only thing I 
                        know is that something in me went 
                        missing. And now I'm a killer, 
                        Diane. I can't be trusted. I'd kill 
                        you if I could get free enough. Jab 
                        that pencil of yours right in your 
                        neck. Let the blood squirt on my 
                        face. I'd love nothing more.  

                                 MUKUL
                        Ooooooohh snap. 

           Mary HUFFS.

                        That guy's innocent, and the 
                        technology's busted. He tested it- 

           Mary catches herself mid-sentence. 

           Ben and Mukul share a glance. Wait, what? 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I need a shower. 

           Mary hurries into Ben's room. Ben hurries after her. 

           Mukul watches them go with no small hint of suspicion. 
           Eventually, he turns back toward the television. He lifts a 
           bong and takes a HIT.   

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben chases Mary into the room. His television is paused on an 
           image of Sally Field. 

                                 BEN
                             (Re: the screen)
                        Look, it's your scene! 

           Ben unpauses the screen. It's Steel Magnolias, and Sally 
           Field is CRYING HER EYES OUT. 

           Mary can't help but smile. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh, god. So embarrassing. 

                                 BEN
                        I'm sure you rocked it. 

                                 MARY
                        Trust me, I didn't... So, can I use 
                        your shower? 

                                 BEN
                        Sure.

                                 MARY
                        Thanks.

           Mary disappears into the bathroom, CLOSING the door behind 
           her. After a moment, the door POPS OPEN a crack and she pokes 
           her head out.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary, deep in thought, lets the water run over her. 

           Her cellphone, resting on the sink, VIBRATES. She reaches 
           around the curtain and checks her massage. She frowns. 

           Ben YELLS through the bathroom door. 

                                 BEN
                             (Muffled)
                        You want to go to Central Park 
                        tomorrow?

                                 MARY
                        What?

           Ben YELLS again. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Just come in! 

           The door OPENS a crack. Ben's lips appear in the small 
           opening. 

                                 BEN
                        I was just wondering if you want to 
                        go to Central Park tomorrow. 
                        Weather man said it's going to be 
                        nice. 

                                 MARY
                        Don't be so shy. I'm behind the 
                        curtain. Come in. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben hesitates a moment, then enters the bathroom, CLOSING the 
           door in our face behind him. We linger a moment, listening to 
           their MUFFLED VOICES on the other side of the door. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Ben sits on the closed toilet, his eyes facing downward. He 
           and Mary converse through the shower curtain, talking over 
           the SHOWER. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        I haven't spent a day like that in 
                        a while. I say we do it. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Like a picnic? 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, like a picnic. 

           A moment passes. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        You're pretty shy, huh? 

                                 BEN
                        Just being a gentleman. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - SAME TIME

           A mischievous smile grows on Mary face. 

                                 MARY
                        You know what I think? 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        What? 

           Without warning, Mary pulls back the curtain, exposing 
           herself to an astonished Ben. Only, she has fashioned a 
           bikini out of soap suds.

                                 MARY
                        I think you're a perfect 
                        gentleman... How do I look?

                                 BEN
                        Like a million bucks.

           Satisfied, she retreats back behind the curtain. 

           We stay with Ben. He sits, stunned... He grins. 

           INT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Mukul is still on the couch. Mary enters, wearing her trench 
           coat, and passes quickly through the room.

                                 MARY
                        See you later, Mukul. 

           Mary exits. 

           Soon after, Ben FLOPS down on the couch next to Mukul. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MUKUL
                        Where'd Mary go? 

                                 BEN
                        Had to go see a friend. 

           Mukul frowns. He just doesn't trust her. 

           EXT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - RAINING - NIGHT

           A cab pulls up to the townhouse. Mary steps out of the cab 
           and hustles through the rain toward the gate. 

           She stops, staring up at the town house. Hesitation. 

           Finally, she RINGS the bell at the gate. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (Through the intercom)
                        Enter, mon cheri. 

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The Tutor sits in a chair at the center of the room, drinking 
           a glass of red wine.

           He reaches for a pill container on a table at his side, 
           removing a pill and dropping it into a small mortar and 
           pestle. He CRUSHES the pill, takes a pinch of the powder, and 
           SNIFFS it. 

           Mary enters the room, dripping from the rain. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        You're soaked. 

                                 MARY
                        I didn't have an umbrella. 

           Mary removes her trench coat and hangs it on a coat rack. 
           Underneath, she is sporting another one of Ben's weathered t-
           shirts, worn as a dress, featuring Michael Jackson. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (Re: Mary's shirt)
                        Ah! MJ... The quintessential 
                        example of how America insists upon 
                        rendering its geniuses as 
                        monstrosities.  

           Mary shrugs.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        This calls for celebration. 

                                 MARY
                        I'm terribly sorry in advance but, 
                        I can't stay long. 

           The Tutor, ignoring her, rushes to a record player across the 
           room. He starts the record. 

           Bal Petit Bal, by Yves Montand, comes on the player. He turns 
           to Mary, and SINGS with Montand through the slow start of the 
           song.

           He approaches her, taking her by the arms and leading her in 
           a dance around the room. He stops them at a table with a 
           bottle of wine and two glasses. He pours and offers Mary a 
           glass. 

           They CLINK their glasses. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        To our reunion. 

           Mary, overpowered by the Tutor's energy, gulps a sip of wine. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        Venez. 

           The Tutor passes through a doorway. Mary follows, into...

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We scan across a dining table that has been artfully arranged 
           with a decadent meal. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay for 
                        dinner.

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Have a seat. 

           The Tutor pulls a chair out for Mary. Flustered, she sits, 
           and he SCOOTS the chair in behind her. Standing there a 
           moment, the Tutor closes his eyes and steals a WHIFF of 
           Mary's hair. He shivers in excitement, then takes a seat 
           himself.

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        I've prepared us a feast. To start, 
                        escargots cassolette, with hazelnut 
                        and champagne garlic butter.

                        It goes nicely with truffle corn 
                        soup. Followed by sole meuniere, a 
                        very light butter sauce, and 
                        forbidden rice. And, if there's 
                        room, crepe suzette. Bon appetite. 

           They begin eating. All the while, the Tutor keeps his eyes on 
           Mary. Aware of this, she stares down at her plate. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        I have something I want to say. 

           In an attempt to throw the breaks on a situation that is 
           clearly beginning to spin out of control, Mary pipes in with 
           a forceful: 

                                 MARY
                        That's good, because so do I. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                             (Excited)
                        But, me first.

           He sits back, taking Mary in with a smile. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        It's funny, the way roles are 
                        consistently reversing. Here I am, 
                        your tutor for many years, and yet, 
                        in watching you grow from a 
                        promising, young student to... a 
                        beautiful, young woman....  

           The color drains from Mary's face. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        Don't be shy. It's true. Watching 
                        you... I've learned many things. 
                        When I visited you in Paris-

                                 MARY
                        But, that's what I want to talk 
                        about. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        Your horses, cheri. Please hold 
                        them... If you can't tell, I've 
                        rehearsed this. So, how do you 
                        youngsters say it? Please, go with 
                        it? ... Yes, well, when I visited 
                        you...

                        You were so full of life, and I 
                        realized, what I love most about a 
                        woman is the life she contains. The 
                        life of a woman's intellect. I've 
                        heard men say, "I'm a legs guy." 
                        Or, "I'm a breasts guy." Me? I'm a 
                        mind guy. 

           The Tutor pauses a moment. Mary's discomfort has begun to 
           evolve into something more along the lines of terror. 

                                 MARY
                        I don't follow. You're starting to 
                        frighten me, Te- 

           The Tutor rises abruptly, startling Mary and cutting her off. 
           He paces around the table, circling in on her. Mary stiffens.

                                 THE TUTOR
                        But don't you see? It had 
                        everything to do with you, Mary! 

           He approaches her. 

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        I realized there was something I 
                        was missing. Something I lost. But 
                        then, I realized I'd found it 
                        again... in you. Do you understand?   

           He puts a hand on Mary's shoulder, and she jolts, spilling 
           her glass of wine onto Ben's shirt.

                                 MARY
                        Shit!

                                 THE TUTOR 
                        Merde. One moment. 

           The Tutor leaves the room. Mary rises, looking around the 
           room like a cornered mouse. But, in a flash, he is back, 
           carrying a shirt of his own.  

                                 THE TUTOR (CONT’D)
                        Here you are. 

                                 MARY
                        What's that? 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        You can wear this, for now. I'll 
                        get the stain right out. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARY
                        No, it's quite alright. Like I 
                        said, I really can't stay. I'm 
                        sorry, but-

           The Tutor raises his voice in disconcerting agitation. 

                                 THE TUTOR
                        No, no! It isn't quite alright. I 
                        simply cannot allow it. (Lowering 
                        his voice) Change into this, and I 
                        will cleanse your garment. I'll 
                        even turn around, like a perfect 
                        gentleman. 

           The Tutor thrusts the shirt into Mary's jittery arms, and 
           turns. We stay with him - close on his face - and fully 
           register his mad desperation.  

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Okay. 

           He turns toward her and she hands him the soiled shirt.  

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry. Of course, you're right. 
                        Go ahead and work your magic on 
                        that stain. When you come back, I 
                        want you to finish what you were 
                        saying. 

           The Tutor smiles with garish warmth. Victory. 

           He leaves the room again. Alone, Mary's tension finally boils 
           over. She BREATHES heavily, attempting to get control of 
           herself. 

           She inches out of the room.

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mary STEPS QUIETLY through the room, glancing over her 
           shoulder to see if the Tutor has caught on. 

           She pulls her trench coat off the rack. 

           EXT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - RAINING - NIGHT

           Mary runs full speed away from the townhouse. She's CRYING 
           now, her eyeliner-stained tears mixing with the rain 
           droplets. 
           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Ben is in bed, asleep. Off-screen, the door to his bedroom 
           OPENS and CLOSES. Mary, barely visible in the darkness, 
           creeps into the room. She drops off her wet coat and changes 
           out of the Tutor's shirt.    

           Ben is half awakened by Mary, now in a Jim Morrison shirt, 
           crawling into bed. She slides next to him. He wakes slowly. 

                                 BEN
                        I missed you. 

           Mary is taken aback, touched. 

                                 MARY
                        I missed you, too. 

                                 BEN
                        Did you have fun with your friend? 

           Mary doesn't answer. She just looks at Ben. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What? 

           She just looks. Ben LAUGHS in self-defense. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Mary reaches out and touches Ben's face, running her hand 
           slowly over his bruises. 

                                 MARY
                        I'm happy. 

           They kiss. They pull back. They kiss again, more intense. 

           They tumble, tangling in the sheets. Ben disappears from the 
           screen. Mary looks down to see where he went and smiles. Ben 
           is going down on her. 

           Close on Mary's face: pleasure, orgasm. She calms. Ben 
           reenters the screen. Their faces are close. They kiss.   

           Sex. 

           LATER

           Ben and Mary lie together in the dark.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Ben and Mary laid side-by-side in 
                        the post-coital silence and allowed 
                        their minds to wander.    

           On Ben. He breathes in.

                        Ben realized that Mary never seemed 
                        to wear perfume, and yet, his room 
                        still smelled sweeter since the 
                        night she arrived. He smiled (Ben 
                        smiles), surprised that he hadn't 
                        hesitated to perform oral sex on 
                        her. Ben tended not to perform oral 
                        sex on girls he barely knew, 
                        because he inevitably found himself 
                        wondering where she, and her 
                        vagina, had been. But, with Mary, 
                        he hadn't thought twice. (Ben 
                        raises his eyebrows, surprised) In 
                        fact, he hadn't thought at all.        

           On Mary.  

                                 NARRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Mary was delightfully surprised by 
                        Ben's... skill. (Mary breathes in) 
                        Enjoying the way his smell mingled 
                        with hers on the pillow, she began 
                        to suspect that Ben might be a boy 
                        who could, as it were, "get" her. 
                        She measured her breaths, timing 
                        them so that her inhale coincided 
                        with Ben's exhale, and then giggled 
                        (Mary giggles), recognizing she was 
                        stooping to a rather saccharine 
                        girlishness. (Mary's smile fades, 
                        but remains) Nevertheless, she 
                        couldn't help but notice how these 
                        breaths somehow seemed easier than 
                        ever before.  

           Mary turns toward Ben.

                                 MARY
                        Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Mary?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MARY
                        I'm really happy you got thrown 
                        through that wall. 

                                 BEN
                        Thanks. 

           Mary smiles and rolls over on him. 

                                 MARY
                        You know what I mean. 

           She kisses him on the cheek. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        They were falling for each other.  

           EXT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           The Tutor lurks in the darkness. He is disheveled, agitated. 
           He stares up at Ben's window. 

           Close on the Tutor's face. Ominous.   

                                 THE TUTOR
                        D'accord.  

           EXT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - MORNING

           William approaches the gate, hanging open a crack. He enters.

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           William knocks on an ornate door. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello? May I come in? 

           No answer. William pushes the door open. It CREAKS. He 
           enters. 

           INT. THE TUTOR'S HOME - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           The room is darkly lit, cavernous. 

           The Tutor sits behind a large, wooden desk, sipping whiskey 
           from a glass. He looks disheveled, distraught. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Terrence. There you are. I've been 
                        calling. 

           It's now that we realize: the Tutor is TERRENCE UBERAHL. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 UBERAHL
                        Drink?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, thank you. 

           William takes a seat across the desk from Uberahl. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Give me good news, William.  

           William SIGHS.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can't. At face value, we're neck 
                        and neck. But I never go by face 
                        value. I go by my gut and, when I 
                        look at the faces of those... 
                        excuses for jurors, I see 
                        sympathy... For Lowman. 

           Uberahl rises to his feet, pensive. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        And none for me? I've been working 
                        my entire life on this technology. 
                        I have poured all of myself into 
                        it, everything I have, and they're 
                        going to just take it away? They're 
                        going to steal my life from me? 
                        They can't do that!

                                 WILLIAM
                        They can.

                                 UBERAHL
                        You have to stop them!   

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm working hard to do that, 
                        Terrence. But, you need to 
                        understand, people want to believe 
                        they have a soul. We need to color 
                        your side of this thing. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Color it how?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Listen, you and I know your stance 
                        on these things. But they don't. We 
                        need to make you pro-soul.

                        We need to make your technology 
                        soul friendly. We need the jury to 
                        think of Lowman's... condition... 
                        as the psychosomatic effect of a 
                        misunderstanding. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        But that's just what it is! 

                                 WILLIAM
                        How?

           Uberahl takes a breath, calming himself and preparing his 
           thoughts. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        If the soul is the source of our 
                        being, then it is the sum of our 
                        experiences, thoughts and beliefs. 
                        These are what make us who we are. 
                        Together, they are us. And, if 
                        that's the case, then that means 
                        our souls are malleable. They 
                        change with each experience. Isn't 
                        that beautiful? My technology can 
                        fully participate in that beauty, 
                        by passing our soul from one bundle 
                        of physical material to another in 
                        the shape of uninterrupted 
                        psychology.  The soul can survive 
                        this precisely because that's all 
                        the soul is, William! Psychology! 

           William considers. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        When you die, does it get carried 
                        away to Heaven by angels? 

           A look of disgust passes over Uberahl's face. The scientist 
           in him is offended by the simplicity of the notion. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                             (Off Uberahl's disgust)
                        Science works from time to time, 
                        Terrence. But the people want 
                        angels. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        So, what are you saying? 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 WILLIAM
                        We're dealing with a murder. And 
                        now others are making similar 
                        claims. It's becoming an epidemic. 
                        Society needs someone to blame. 
                        We're fighting an uphill battle. 

           For a moment, Uberahl seethes. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Angels! 

           He smashes his glass on the desk, breaking it and cutting his 
           hand. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Terrence! Get a hold of yourself. 
                        You take the stand in a matter of 
                        days. Do you realize that? You were 
                        the first person in the world to 
                        teletransport. Your soundness of 
                        mind is the key to our case. So 
                        keep it together!  

           Uberahl's hand is bleeding, but he disregards it. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Yes, yes. I know. I'm fine. 

           William studies him. He is certainly not fine. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - MORNING

           Ben and Mukul stroll casually down the street. Mukul carries 
           a sack of quarters, passing handfuls to Ben, who feeds them 
           into the parking meters lining the block.

                                 BEN
                        I think I'm in love with Mary.

                        I think I fell in love with her the 
                        moment I saw her. 

           They continue in silence for a moment.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        She's a cool chick.

                                 BEN
                        I don't know. She's just really

                                 MUKUL
                        No, how do you know you love her?

                        Oh. 

           Ben thinks this over.

                        I don't know. 

           Mukul pulls a baggie out of his pocket and hands it to Ben. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Peyote? 

           Mukul nods. Ben stuffs it in his pocket, looking around to 
           see if anyone noticed the exchange.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        See? That's why I like you, man.

                        Eat it.. with Mary.  

           Ben grins sheepishly.

                        Remember the last time I took 
                        Peyote?

           TITLE CARD:

                                     THREE YEARS AGO

           An exhausted Ben, wearing a weathered leisure suit, stumbles 
           through a vast desert. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                             (To himself)
                        I'm lost. 

           He drops his head and keeps walking.

           Something ROARS. Ben stops in his tracks and turns, coming 
           face to face with a mountain lion, poised threateningly a 
           short way off. It GROWLS, hunching low, readying itself for a 
           spring forward.  

           Ben swallows hard, and squares off. The lion lunges.

           With a sharp WHISH, a knife comes flying into screen, taking 
           the lion down and out of screen. 

           Ben, stunned, looks down at the newly dead mountain lion. The 
           knife is sticking out of its neck. 

           He looks up to see: Mukul, wearing a suit and an Apache 
           headband. 

           Mukul pulls his knife from the lion's neck, wipes it on his 
           pants and returns it to his boot. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I'm Ben Gibbon.

                                 MUKUL
                        I am Mukul.

                                 BEN
                        Thanks for saving my life.

           Ben reaches out his hand.

                                 MUKUL
                        Not a problem. 

           They shake.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - MORNING

           Mukul places a gentle hand on Ben's shoulder. 

                                 MUKUL

                        See it all.
           INT. UPSCALE GROCERY STORE - AFTERNOON

           Ben and Mary - wearing a t-shirt featuring Tupac Shakur and 
           the Notorious B.I.G. - stroll through the aisles of an 
           upscale grocery store (think: Dean & Deluca's), putting 
           supplies in their basket. 

           Ben opens the refrigerator and grabs a carton of orange 
           juice. 

                                 BEN
                        Vitamin C. 

           Mary picks out a couple of sandwiches, tosses them in the 
           basket, and they continue down the aisle. 

           We move away from Ben and Mary, through the shelves of food, 
           to the next aisle, where Mary's mother, Beatrice, is shopping 
           with a FRIEND. Their arms are overflowing with bags from a 
           day of shopping.

                                 FRIEND
                        Have you heard from her? 

                                 BEATRICE
                        Not word one. She's slipping back 
                        into her old habits, I'm afraid.  

                                 FRIEND
                        Oh, my poor Bee. I'm sure it's just 
                        a phase.  

                                 BEATRICE
                        One can only hope... She gets it 
                        from William's side. (Whisper) 
                        You've met his mother.  

           They GIGGLE. 

                                 FRIEND
                        You are bad.

           Back on Ben and Mary. As they turn the corner, Mary jolts at 
           the sight of her mother. Quickly, she grabs Ben's hand, pulls 
           him back around the corner and, to keep him quiet, plants a 
           kiss on him.

                                 BEN
                        Whoa, tiger. Is that a cucumber, or 
                        are you just happy to see me?

           Mary glances around nervously, but it seems the coast is 
           clear. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Get it? Because we're in a grocery 
                        store and a cucumber is shaped like 
                        a cock.

           Mary rolls her eyes.

                                 MARY
                        On second thought, let's ditch the 
                        picnic. 

           Mary drops the basket where she stands. We remain, focusing 
           on the "Great source of Vitamin C" scrawled on the orange 
           juice box, as she pulls Ben speedily from the store. 

                                 BEN
                        Alright. I know a good little spot 
                        by the park.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - EDGE OF CENTRAL PARK - SHORTLY LATER

           Mary follows Ben toward a hotdog cart parked at the edge of 
           the park. The VENDOR sees them coming, and brightens. 

                                 BEN
                        Hey, Raj! 

           On Mary. Of course, Ben knows the hotdog vendor. 

                                 RAJ
                        Benjamin Gibbon! Long time, my 
                        friend, very long time. (Re: Mary) 
                        And who is the pretty baby? 

                                 BEN
                        Raj, Mary. Mary, Raj. The hotdog 
                        guru.

                                 RAJ
                        It is a pleasure. 

           Raj kisses Mary's hand. 

                                 MARY
                        The pleasure's mine. 

           Raj examines Ben's face. 

                                 RAJ
                        My friend, you look like a Bombay 
                        prostitute with that face. 

           Raj and Mary share a LAUGH. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        Would you mind if I jumped back 
                        there and prepared a dog for my 
                        lady?

                        Anything for Ben Gibbon. 

           Ben goes about preparing a hotdog for Mary. 

                                 BEN
                        How do you take it.

                                 MARY
                        Messy.

                                 BEN
                        Nice. I'm going to go ahead and put 
                        ketchup and mustard on it, because 
                        that's the only way to eat a 
                        hotdog. 

                                 MARY
                        Duh. 

           Ben presents the hotdog. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Slap some relish on that bitch. 

           Ben slaps some relish on and hands Mary her hotdog. She takes 
           a giant bite. Ben and Raj wait eagerly for a response, but 
           Mary just continues to stuff her face until the dog is gone. 
           Ben and Raj are in awe.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                             (With a mouthful of 
                              hotdog)
                        It's good.

           Ben and Raj just stare at Mary, her mouth streaked with 
           condiments. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        What?
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Ben leads Mary by the hand into a secluded hideaway within a 
           willow tree enclosure. The lake shimmers through the trees; 
           BOATMEN pilot TOURISTS in slowly drifting gondolas. 

           From the look of them, we can tell Ben and Mary have taken 
           the peyote. 

                                 BEN
                        This is my special spot. It's the 
                        only place in the city where it's 
                        still possible to be alone.

                                 MARY
                        Is it okay if I'm here?   

           They drop to the ground and lay side by side, looking up at 
           the ceiling of trees above them.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. You're cool. 

           Mary smiles and reaches upward; Ben reaches too, running his 
           fingertips along Mary's hand and sliding his finger through 
           hers.   

                                 MARY
                        Look. 

           Ben looks. On a tree, the shadows of their arms intertwine 
           and collapse into each other. 

                                 BEN
                        Don't you ever feel like we're 
                        letting the world disappear? 
                        There's so much noise and new ways 
                        of making connections, no one ever 
                        takes the time to actually connect. 
                        There's so much loneliness. But 
                        what about just lying on the ground 
                        and feeling the earth hold you up? 
                        And touching? 

                                 MARY
                        I don't want to ever go home. I 
                        want to stay here forever. 

                                 BEN
                        I could build you a little house. 
                        Bring you food from time to time. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARY
                        But I'd want you to stay with me. 

           Ben turns to look at Mary. She turns to look back. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, mister. 

           Ben just looks. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Your pupils are huge. I feel like I 
                        could fall into them. 

           She squints, looking closer. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You have so much beautiful pain in 
                        your eyes, Ben. (Pause) Does that 
                        sound like a cliche? (Pause) You're 
                        like a real person. (Pause) You're 
                        making my stomach warm. (Pause) I 
                        need to push it against you. 

           She pushes herself toward him. He pulls her in so that she 
           comes to rest in the nook of his arm. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I'm so happy I found you. You're my 
                        best friend. Is that okay? 

           A moment passes. 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. It's more than okay. 

           They roll in the grass, kiss. 

           They stare deeply into each other's eyes, and then they both 
           burst into LAUGHTER.  

           Pull back. Looming in the shadows, is Terrence Uberahl. He 
           watches them. 

           LATER - TOWARD EVENING

           Ben and Mary sit by the lake. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        All this stuff going on in our 
                        heads, everything we think and 
                        feel, it all just sits in our 
                        brains. 
                                 (MORE)

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        So, when we die, it rots like 
                        everything else. It's as gone as 
                        our nose cartilage and no one will 
                        really ever know that these 
                        thoughts were thought, or these 
                        feelings were felt. I've been 
                        scared my whole life that I could 
                        die without anyone noticing, like I 
                        was never here. 

           Mary ponders this. 

                                 MARY
                        I changed my mind about staying 
                        here forever. I say we run away to 
                        Mexico. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. SUNLINER - BEN AND MARY CRUISING THROUGH A GREEN-SCREEN 
           BACKDROP OF THE DESERT

           They shout over the BURNING ENGINE and the RUSHING WIND. 

                                 MARY
                        First thing I want to do is get 
                        three fish tacos! 

                                 BEN
                        Then we'll rent a little hacienda 
                        on the beach, and just lay around 
                        in the sun until we're old and 
                        grey.

           Mary throws her hands in the air and SCREAMS into the wind. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Emanuel Swedenborg, an eminent 
                        Swedish scientist, philosopher and 
                        Christian mystic, had an 
                        elaborately detailed theory on 
                        angels. He believed that, in 
                        Heaven, a single angel was made of 
                        two people who had loved each other 
                        on Earth, and that their souls, 
                        thus combined, formed the shape of 
                        a perfect human, and so the shape 
                        of Heaven itself.  

           BACK IN CENTRAL PARK 

           The sun sets over the city. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           POV: We watch Ben and Mary reenter the tree cover from the 
           pond. There is heavy BREATHING in our ear. 

           Uberahl steps into the open from behind a tree. He glares. 

           In this moment, the shadows are sharper, darker. The trees 
           are taller. The air is colder. Ben and Mary's trip has gone 
           bad. 

           Mary stops in her tracks. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Hello, Mary. 

           Ben looks questioningly at Mary, who is too shocked to 
           notice. 

                                 MARY
                        Terrence? What are you doing here? 

           Ben attempts to get a grasp on the situation. 

                                 BEN
                        You know this guy? 

           No answer from Mary.

                                 UBERAHL
                        Yes, she does. And I know her. 

           Ben doesn't like the way this sounds, but he maintains 
           cordiality. He approaches Uberahl and extends his hand.

           Uberahl's eyes go wide. He GUFFAWS incredulously. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        You don't say... I guess that makes 
                        us enemies times two. Terrence 
                        Uberahl. Pleasure. 
                             (To Mary)
                        You're proving to be quite the 
                        trouble maker, Miss Rathcart

           On Ben. Utter confusion. Shock, personified. 

           Without warning, Uberahl grabs Ben by the collar of his shirt 
           and throws him, with entirely unexpected strength, into the 
           trunk of a tree. Ben collapses in a heap. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BEN
                             (Wow, that guy just threw 
                              me against a tree)
                        Goddam. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Don't you know that the penalty for 
                        hunting in the King's forest is 
                        death?  

           What follows is a thorough beat-down in which Uberahl manages 
           to combine nearly super-human strength with the delicacy of 
           an aesthete. 

           He lifts Ben to his feet and slams him hard in the face. 
           Tosses him, lifts him again. 

           Ben is getting pulverized.

                        You should learn to ask questions 
                        when a stray cat shows up at your 
                        door. You never know who it might 
                        belong to. 

                                 MARY
                        Stop!

                                 UBERAHL
                             (Laughing, to Mary)
                        Is this your idea of a man? I am 
                        disappointed... 

           Mary rushes him, but he grabs her by the hair and twists her 
           around. 

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        How does it feel to be in danger, 
                        children? Are you excited yet? Is 
                        it everything you imagined?  

           Ben attempts to get up. 

                                 BEN
                             (With a mouthful of blood)
                        Fuck you.  

           Uberahl CHUCKLES with an air of superiority and KICKS Ben 
           hard in the face. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        The last words of a pitiful 
                        generation.   

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Uberahl produces the Michael Jackson t-shirt Mary left at his 
           apartment and tosses it at Ben. 

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        Wipe yourself off. 

           With that, he grabs Mary by the throat. Now, all of Uberahl's 
           affected coolness is gone. With Mary's throat in his hand, he 
           breaks down. He is the penitent madman. His own victim.   

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                             (Ranting)
                        The youth! Your world is filled 
                        with so much information, you have 
                        grown into little sponges, no? You 
                        look human, but when the time comes 
                        to speak your humanity, there is 
                        nothing there.  

           He pushes her against a tree, squeezing harder. Mary's eyes 
           go wide. She CHOKES. 

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        Squeeze a sponge and all that comes 
                        out is-

           THWACK. 

           Uberahl looks down to see Mukul's knife protruding from his 
           leg. 

           He releases Mary, who collapses WHEEZING, and calmly pulls 
           the knife out. 

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        And who might you be? 

           On Mukul. 

                                 MUKUL
                        Pinnochio. 

           Mukul charges. Uberahl readies himself, knife in hand. 

           In the meantime, however, Mary has risen to her feet with a 
           large rock in her hands. She lifts it over her head and, just 
           as Mukul and Uberahl are about to clash, brings it down hard 
           on Uberahl's head. 

           Mukul stops short. 

           Uberahl staggers forward in confusion, drops the knife and 
           slowly lifts his hand to his head. His knees wobble. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           He looks up, glancing menacingly at his opponents before 
           turning and rushing into the darkness.   

           Mukul retrieves his knife, wipes the blade on his pants and 
           returns the knife to his boot. 

           Mary hurries to Ben, only now regaining his senses. 

                                 MARY
                        Ben, oh my god. Are you okay? 

           Ben is a bloody mess. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I'm so sorry. 

           He looks at Mary, then down at the shirt in his hands. He 
           rises slowly to his feet, woozy from the beating. 

                                 BEN
                             (As if to the world at 
                              large)
                        Are you fucking serious? 

                                 MARY
                        He kicked you in the face. Are you 
                        hurt?  

           She touches him cautiously, as if feeling for injuries. 

                                 BEN
                             (Re: Are you hurt?)
                        I got kicked in the face. 

                                 MARY
                        Baby, sit down. 

           Ben comes to his senses. He pulls away from her. 

                                 BEN
                        Why does he have my shirt?

           Mary doesn't know where to begin. There is an awkward pause. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Why does Terrence Uberahl have my 
                        shirt, Mary Rathcart? 

                                 MARY
                        Ben. I want to tell you. 

           But she doesn't know how. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        Forget it. I don't want to know. I 
                        wouldn't believe you, anyway.

           Ben turns to go.

                                 MARY
                        Ben, please wait. Please. 

           He turns back abruptly. 

                                 BEN
                        I have no fucking idea what's going 
                        on here, and I don't really feel 
                        like finding out. 

                                 MARY
                        Listen, you just need to stop and 
                        talk to me. I need to-

                                 BEN
                             (Angry, hurt)
                        Need to what? I didn't ask for 
                        this.

           He turns back and continues on. 

                                 MARY
                        Where are you going? 

                                 BEN
                        Home. 

                                 MARY
                             (Tears)
                        Can I come with you? 

           Ben continues on, without answering. Mukul lingers for a 
           moment, offering a sympathetic glance at Mary before falling 
           in behind Ben.

           Ben is sweaty and blood is dripping from reopened cuts on his 
           face. He is running desperately toward something. His eyes 
           are wide, panicked. He dives. 

           Freeze. A GUNSHOT rings out.

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - BATHROOM

           Ben stares into the mirror, enacting his post-fight ritual of 
           examining the damage to his face. Only this time, his 
           reflective air is replaced with one of somberness. He looks 
           sad.  

           He peers into his bedroom at Mary's bag, sitting untouched in 
           the same spot on his floor. 

           Off-screen, his cellphone RINGS. He exits the bathroom. 

           INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben lifts the phone and glances at the caller ID: Mary. He 
           hesitates, then ignores the call. 

           On Ben's call log, all the missed calls are from Mary.  

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM

           Mary, in her underwear, stands in front of a full length 
           mirror. She removes a black dress from a hook by the mirror 
           and slips it on.  

           She lifts her phone and scrolls to Ben's name. Her finger 
           lingers over the send button. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           There is a KNOCK on the door. 

                                 MARY
                        Come in. 

           The door opens to reveal William, dressed as Napoleon. He 
           looks her over, as if for flaws. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ready? 

                                 MARY
                        Almost. 

           William gives her a long hard look. Judgment. He slowly 
           shakes his head and, SIGHING, leaves the room. 

           Mary is left alone with herself in the mirror. 

           INT. BEN AND MUKUL'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Ben lounges with Mukul on the couch, watching an old slasher 
           film. Ben is dressed as Han Solo, and Mukul is dressed as 
           Chewbacca, complete with the mask. They pass a joint back and 
           forth and take swigs from a bottle of Jack Daniels. Mukul 
           drinks and smokes through the mask so that, when he exhales 
           smoke, it streams out the orifices. They seem pretty wasted.   

                                 BEN
                        You want to go stink bomb the 
                        Halloween Gala? 

           Mukul considers this.

                                 MUKUL
                        You miss her, don't you? 

           INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA (OR SOMETHING LIKE IT) - NIGHT

           The Halloween Gala. Decorations mix garish with eloquent, and 
           the GUESTS, costumed to the nines, have allowed the 
           celebratory nature of the gathering to loosen the standard 
           codes of decorum. There is an active dance floor. People are 
           having fun. People are drunk.  

           We cut around the room, favoring our main characters:

           William and Beatrice Rathcart, dressed as Napoleon and 
           Cleopatra, smile and CHATTER with a horde of FRIENDS, 
           ACQUAINTANCES, COLLEAGUES and WELL-WISHERS. They tow Mary 
           with them, dressed as Jackie O, her true appearance all but 
           hidden beneath a dark wig, deep red lipstick and excessively 
           large black sunglasses. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mary does her best to be polite to the many people OOH-ING 
           and AH-ING over her, but she is clearly miserable. 

           Henry is dressed as Franklin Roosevelt on Safari, with Nancy 
           as a 1920s era Flapper on his arm. They schmooze every bit as 
           hard as the Rathcarts. 

           The Rathcarts and Gibbons cross paths in the center of the 
           crowd. Henry extends a hand. 

                                 HENRY
                        No hard feelings?

           They shake. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Fucking smart ass.

                        Will your son be here tonight, Mrs. 
                        Gibbon? I would love to meet him.

                        Oh, not tonight, I don't think.

                                 WILLIAM

                             (Surprisingly defensive)
                        Or else, what?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Or else... 

                                 HENRY
                        I thought so.

                                 WILLIAM 
                             (Muttering)
                        I've been taking tae bo. Show that 
                        punk a thing or two. 

           EXT. HALLOWEEN GALA - CONTINUOUS

           Here comes trouble. The Sunliner pulls up to the curb, and 
           Mukul tosses the keys to a VALET. 

           Close on Ben's gator-booted foot hitting the pavement. Pan-up 
           on Han Solo: Ben Gibbon on a mission.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Ben leaves frame, but we remain. Into frame, steps DEATH, a 
           black-cloaked figure carrying a sickle. Ominous.  

           Standing at the entrance is a DOORMAN wearing a white cloak 
           and a halo, with a sign on his chest reading: St. Peter. He 
           checks the names of the GUESTS who pass in a white, leather 
           book. 

           Ben and Mukul approach the line... and make a break for it, 
           dashing past the Doorman, who attempts to grab them and 
           stumbles into some GUESTS. The line dissolves in confusion; 
           Ben and Mukul vanish into the party. 

           Taking advantage of the confusion, is Death, slinking into 
           the party past the befuddled Doorman. We notice... a limp.  

           INT. HALLOWEEN GALA - MOMENTS LATER

           The Phantom of the Opera and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 
           emerge from the coat room. Ben and Mukul have pulled a 
           switch. Ben (the Phantom) scans the room. Mukul (the 
           Hunchback) zips up a backpack and slings it over his 
           shoulder. 

                                 BEN
                        You know what to do. I'll get us 
                        some drinks. 

                                 MUKUL
                        Whiskey sour. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay. Break. 

           They break off and enter the soiree.  

           ON BEN

           Ben orders two drinks at the Bar, turns, and is confronted by 
           Henry and Nancy. 

                                 HENRY
                        I really can't believe you're here. 
                        I can't believe it. 

                                 BEN
                        I'm a little surprised you could 
                        tell it was me.

                                 NANCY
                        We're your parents, Benjamin. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HENRY
                        It's just... you... You were 
                        banned, Benjamin. That's bad 
                        enough. But you crash the party? 
                        How did you even get in here? 

                                 BEN
                        Sneakiness. 

           Nancy GIGGLES. 

                                 HENRY
                             (To Nancy)
                        This is not- 
                             (To Ben)
                        This is not funny. 

                                 BEN
                        Look at this place. I doubt anyone 
                        will even notice I'm here. I just 
                        wanted to take a look. Those are 
                        some pretty cool costumes, by the 
                        way. 

                                 NANCY
                        I know, right? Not so bad your-

                                 HENRY
                        No! You're up to something. No way 
                        you came here innocently. 
                             (To Nancy)
                        Look at him! He has a plan. 

           Ben is smirking; he does look like he has a plan. 

                                 BEN
                        And what if I do? 

                                 HENRY
                             (At a loss)
                        Well, then I ask that you not go 
                        through with it.

                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 HENRY
                             (Even more lost)
                        Because, Benjamin. Why do you do 
                        this to me? 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BEN
                        What makes you think I'm doing it 
                        to you? Are you one of (motioning 
                        to party) them? Is it You the 
                        People versus Benjamin Gibbon? 
                        Because I never really wanted to 
                        think of it that way. 

           Henry has been silenced. 

           Ben pats his father on the shoulder and kisses his mom on the 
           cheek. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Just have fun, guys. I can take 
                        care of myself. Oh, and Dad. 
                        Congratulations.  

           Ben, drinks in hand, leaves them at the bar. Nancy shrugs and 
           smiles at Henry, as if to say, you gotta love him.   

           We follow Ben to a corner of the room, where he rendezvous 
           with Mukul.  

                                 MUKUL
                        Okay, so I did a perimeter of the 
                        room, and I think the best blast 
                        points would be-

                                 BEN
                        You know what? Why don't we hold 
                        off? People seem like they're 
                        having fun, and it's kind of a cool 
                        party. 

                                 MUKUL
                        Yeah. 

                                 BEN
                        So, why don't we just hang for a 
                        little? Have some free drinks? 

                                 MUKUL
                        Okay. 

           Suddenly, a hand reaches into frame, pulling Ben around by 
           the shoulder and bringing him face-to-face with Jackie O. She 
           jerks Ben toward the dance floor. Ben, taken by surprise, 
           allows himself to be led away; he hands Mukul his drink 
           before being pulled out of reach. Mukul remains, calmly 
           sipping his drink. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           We move onto: Jackie O and the Phantom. They dance. They 
           dance skillfully, better than we would have expected. They 
           stand out amidst the less talented crowd of FELLOW DANCERS. 
           In fact, they are almost comically good.

           Mary lifts her glasses.  

                                 MARY
                        Hi.  

           Ben feigns shock. 

                                 BEN
                             (Sarcastic)
                        Mary? Mary Rathcart? 

                                 MARY
                        How did you know it was me? 

                                 BEN
                        It's a pair of sunglasses, babe. 
                        This isn't a superhero movie. 

           Mary smiles. 

                                 MARY
                        I missed you... Did you miss me? 

                                 BEN
                        No. 

                                 MARY
                        Shut up. Did you? 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Maybe a little bit. 

           Pause. 

                                 MARY
                        Listen. I misled you. I'm sorry. 

                                 BEN
                        Did someone put you up to it? 

                                 MARY
                        No. I knew who you were all along. 
                        But I didn't plan it. I swear. 

                                 BEN
                        The whole time?

           Mary nods.

                        it? 

                                 MARY
                        You know why.

                        You really thought I would care 
                        what your last name is? 

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, I kind of did. Silly, I know.

           Ben LAUGHS. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)

           Mary GIGGLES shyly. 

                                 MARY
                        Yeah, he is. But, listen. The guy

                                 BEN
                        I mean, he's going to be really 
                        pissed. 

                                 MARY
                        Hey. The guy from the other day-

                             (Flippant)

                        The one that kicked you in the

                                 BEN
                        Oh. You mean, Terrence Uberahl?

                        I just want to apologize about 
                        that, too. He really kicked your 
                        ass bad and it's all my fault.

                        Yeah, it was pretty bad. And I

                        think about what went on between 
                        us, but nothing happened. He's old 
                        and weird and I would never. I can

           They both notice the lapse in logic.

                        Anymore. I just want you to know

                        I was doing. You were kind of a 
                        surprise. I never meant to hurt

                        I mean, the guy had super human 
                        strength, and he caught me off 
                        guard in the middle of a peyote 
                        trip. It wasn't fair.

                        good, liar".  

           Mary smiles guiltily. 

                                 MARY
                        I, Mary Rathcart, am a filthy, 
                        rotten, no good liar.

           Ben crosses his heart.

                        Hope to die?

                        Stick a needle in my eye. Bottom 
                        line, I'm kind of a weird guy. I 
                        don't need things to be normal. 
                        Never have. And it doesn't matter 
                        to me how fucked up you may or may 
                        not be. I really don't care. I 
                        don't even care that you almost got 
                        me killed. I don't care what your 
                        name is, or how checkered your past 
                        is. You should probably get a 
                        restraining order on Uberahl, or 
                        something. But we can figure all 
                        that out later. I have fun with 
                        you, even though you're a dirty 
                        liar. And I missed you like crazy.

                                 MARY
                        Yeah? But I called and you didn't 
                        answer.

           Ben thinks for a moment.

                                 BEN
                        What do you say you and I go out on 
                        a date? I could pick you up at your 
                        place. Take you out to a movie. I 
                        think that's how it goes.

                                 BEN

                                 MARY
                        Sounds awesome.

           She removes Ben's mask.  

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You might be the raddest person I 
                        know, Gibbon. You're a gentleman.

           By now, Ben and Mary have managed to dominate the attention 
           of the room. An enraged William is already pointing the 
           Gibbon boy out to several SECURITY GUARDS.  

                                 BEN
                        We're going to freak a lot of 
                        people out. 

                                 MARY
                        I don't care. 

           Ben dips Mary, kissing her deeply. For a brief moment, they 
           are alone in the room. 

           A hand reaches into frame and grabs Ben by the shoulder. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Party's over, kid. 

           Ben casually takes the Security Guard's hand off his 
           shoulder. 

                                 BEN
                             (To Mary)
                        Call me?

                                 MARY
                             (Charmed)
                        Yeah. 

           The Security Guard grabs Ben more forcefully. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I said, move it!

           Ben just as forcefully shakes him off. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (8)

                                 BEN
                        I can see myself out. 

           The Security Guard does not like being put in his place. 
           Grabbing Ben by the collar, he attempts to lead him toward 
           the door. But Ben turns to face him. Every security guard in 
           the room is now circling. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I'm counting down from three. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        No, I'm counting down from three! 

                            BEN
                                                     SECURITY GUARD
           Three, two-
                                              Three, two-

           WHAM. The Security Guard gets it first. Only, it's not Ben 
           who has delivered the blow, but Mukul, who has come flying 
           into the frame like a demon possessed. 

           The circling security guards pounce on Mukul, who's backpack 
           falls and gets kicked into the crowd. 

           Ben and Mukul struggle, but are outsized and outnumbered. The 
           guards lift them to their feet, taking the opportunity to 
           rough them up. 

           Henry approaches. 

                                 HENRY
                        That's quite enough! Get your hands 
                        off them! 

           But Ben and Mukul are not going quietly, and Henry takes an 
           elbow in the confusion. Everything stops. The Security Guard 
           who's elbow has done the damage knows he just made a mistake. 
           A tense moment passes. 

           Henry regains his composure and... PUNCHES the guard in the 
           face. 

           Now things get messy. As Henry is pulled into the fracas, 
           others rush to put a stop to it. But now both Gibbons are 
           looking for a fight. 

           As arms reach in to pull combatants apart, the tussle only 
           expands into a brawl. And expands, and expands... 

           Until a WOMAN IN HEELS steps on Mukul's bag. 

           Something SQUISHES and, looking down, the woman only has a 
           moment before the smell hits her. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (9)

           Her eyes go wide, as a great SNIFF echoes through the room. 
           Amidst CRIES of confused disgust, the woman standing at 
           ground zero suddenly, and violently, VOMITS. 

           To make matters worse for the poor woman, Mukul comes 
           crashing into frame (not under his own power), mowing her to 
           the ground like a vomiting blade of grass.  

           Chaos. 

           Fists fly. Feet slip in vomit. There is a stampede for the 
           door, but the fight at the center of the room has expanded to 
           the point where those stampeding are just as likely to get 
           pulled in as they are to make it out.  

           On Ben. He helps his father to his feet. Finally, Team 
           Gibbon. But our attention is pulled away from father and son 
           by an ominous sight: 

           Death is moving toward them, deftly weaving his way through 
           the chaos of the crowd. 

           Soon enough, Death arrives. He lifts his arm, revealing the 
           muzzle of a gun. Death removes his hood. It is Terrence 
           Uberahl. He FIRES a round into the air, everyone in the room 
           freezes. 

                                 UBERAHL 
                        Henry Gibbon!    

           GASPS from the crowd as Uberahl takes aim at Henry.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Terrence?! 

                                 UBERAHL
                        Nobody move! Watch. Everybody 
                        watch! Gibbon. What have you built 
                        with your life? 

           Henry is frozen in panic.

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        What have you built?! Nothing! You 
                        are a dismantler. I have worked too 
                        hard! I've sacrificed everything! 
                        And I'm to lose it in a class 
                        action suit? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Terrence! Put the gun down. Be 
                        reasonable.

           Uberahl's agitation is mounting. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        No! No more litigation. 

           Uberahl COCKS THE HAMMER of his gun. 

                                 UBERAHL (CONT’D)
                        Yesterday, all you wanted was for 
                        my machine to inspire a murderous 
                        impulse. But now, in this moment, I 
                        would wager that's the last thing 
                        in the world you want. Am I right, 
                        Henry? 

                                 HENRY

           Uberahl takes aim. 

                                 MARY
                        Terrence! 

           Mary's voice takes Uberahl off-guard. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Terrence, don't. You're a good man. 
                        I know you are. But you're sick... 
                        You need help. 

           She approaches, her arms outstretched in a defensive posture. 

           She glances at Ben. He gives her a nod of support. 

           She closes her eyes, takes a DEEP BREATH and... produces 
           tears. Mary is CRYING on demand.

           On Ben. Proud. He sneaks her a thumbs-up. That-a-girl.   

           Mary has reached his side; her hand is moving toward the gun. 
           For a moment, it seems as if Uberahl will relent. But when 
           her hand grasps the gun, he pulls back. 

                                 UBERAHL
                        You almost had me, slut. 

           He knocks her to the ground. 

           What happens next happens quickly. Ben, seeing that Uberahl 
           is about to pull the trigger, rushes forward. Mary, seeing 
           Ben rushing forward, rushes forward as well. Uberahl aims. 

           On Ben, running. We remember this image. 

           He dives in front of his father.

           Freeze on Ben, midair. BANG.

                        Though too young to understand it 
                        at the time, Ben was struck by the

                        these were images of real things.

                        reality that he could never fully 
                        grasp. Or even accept. 

           IMAGE OF A YOUNG BEN, STARING INTO THE MIRROR. 

           This image is reminiscent of an older Ben, inspecting his 
           bruises in the mirror.

                        Ben remembered feeling weightless. 

           BACK IN THE GALA

           On a frozen Uberahl, pointing a gun at us.

                        Ben had contemplated this moment 
                        many times. He had dreamt up 
                        countless scenarios. He had 
                        imagined many good deaths. But he 
                        couldn't remember any of them now. 
                        Nor did he try.

                        In that moment, Ben couldn't try to 
                        do anything. He could only do what 
                        he did.

                        He thought of Mary. 

           BACK IN GALA

           Suddenly, the world breaks back into normal speed. In a 
           flash, Mary has dived in front of the diving Ben. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           With a meaty THUNK, she takes the bullet. She drops limply to 
           the ground. Blood begins to pool.

           The room descends into full-blown madness. If people wanted 
           out before, they are even more desperate now. They careen 
           toward the exits. 

           On the Rathcarts, eyes wide with dismay, Beatrice SHRIEKING.

           Ben crawls to Mary, gathering her in his arms. It takes a 
           moment for him to understand what has happened. 

                                 BEN
                        No. No, no, no. 

           Uberahl, seeing that Mary has been shot, stammers in dismay.  

                                 UBERAHL
                             (To himself)
                        Mon Dieu.  
                             (To Ben)
                        Thief. She was my soul. Not yours.  

           Uberahl takes aim at Ben. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And that's the thing about these 
                        moments. These horrible, beautiful, 
                        unknowable moments. People always 
                        just seem to do what they do. Be 
                        what they are. 

           Ben closes his eyes, accepting his fate. 

           THWACK. Mukul's knife lodges in Uberahl's healthy leg.  

                                 #1 FAN
                        Ahhhhhhh! Merde!

           His gun goes OFF. 

           Across the room, the Security Guard who started it all gets a 
           bullet in the face. 

           Here comes Mukul, diving into frame and tackling Uberahl. The 
           gun flies from Uberahl's hand and SKIDS across the floor. 
           This is all Ben needs. He scrambles across the bloody floor 
           toward the gun.

           Uberahl tosses Mukul, and pulls the knife from his leg. With 
           murder in his eyes, he turns and charges. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Just when we least expect it. 

           POV: Ben FIRES at us. 

           Pull back. Uberahl has been shot in the face. He falls back 
           flat. 

           Ben drops the gun and returns to Mary. He lies next to her, 
           pushing the bloody hair from her face. He kisses her. Her 
           eyes are glassy and her skin is pale, but she smiles up at 
           him. Tears stream down Ben's face. He calls to her shrinking 
           life, he implores her to stay. But we hear none of it over 
           the AMPLIFIED CACOPHONY of the room.

           Then, the room goes silent. 

                                 MARY
                        Ben.  

           Mary is almost gone. 

                                 BEN
                        Stay awake. 

                                 MARY
                        I love you. 

           Her eyes flutter shut. Silence. 

           Though the room is a flurry of panic, we hear only: THE SOUND 
           OF A FILM REEL RUN ITS LAST COURSE THROUGH A PROJECTOR AND 
           SPIN EMPTY.

                        Death makes for good punctuation, 
                        and mine was going to be a perfect 
                        example. It was going to catch 
                        everyone off-guard and, when the 
                        credits rolled, the audience was 
                        going to stay seated for a moment 
                        or two, everyone mourning me in 
                        their own way. He was flawed, they 
                        would think, but his heart was in 
                        the right place. They would regret 
                        the ending, but think it fitting, 
                        perhaps even inevitable.     

           We pull in on a hospital.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Police cars, news vans and ONLOOKERS crowd the street. 

           CLOSE ON BEN

           Ben's face is freshly and oh-so-severely bruised. He stares 
           at us blankly. He forks a bite of food into his mouth and 
           slowly chews.

                        I knew the man well. It's so sad. 
                        He was brilliant. But rather 
                        godless.  

           Pull back. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 

           The Rathcarts and Gibbons - all of them bruised and battered 
           from the Halloween brawl - converse in a kind of sewing 
           circle at the corner of the room.

                        You can say that again. Look at us. 
                        Who would have thought? Really, 
                        it's rather remarkable.

           Ben sits at Mary's bedside. Her arm, shoulder and side are in 
           a large, cumbersome cast. Ben holds her hand, forking her 
           bites of food from a tray. 

           They share a quiet, knowing smile.
