                         “SANTA BARBARA, CA. 1973”

           PATTY LOUD, lithe and attractive at 42, opens her door to greet   
           the day; a bright and beautiful day.  The spacious house, with   
           its ocean views and swimming pool, four cars, five dirt bikes, 
           even the poodles that bound down the front path with her to the 
           mailbox, speak to a life anyone would envy.  Except on this day. 

           The neighbor driving by doesn't return her wave, which she           
           finds disturbing.  More disturbing still, is what the mailbox 
           holds: a picture of her, with her husband Bill and five teenaged 
           kids; a family portrait so flattering they once used it as a 
           Christmas card.  But, instead of Merry Christmas, it now reads  
           "WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO THESE PEOPLE?!!" 

           THE DOGS respond to her URGENT CALL, racing back inside where she 
           locks the door and draws the curtains, shutting out the light.

           BILL and PATTY'S wedding; babies appear in rapid succession              
           (3 boys, 2 girls) growing up into a life of love, laughter,                    
           and affluence - MONTAGE INTERRUPTED BY TALKING HEADS:

                        If there is such a thing as shame, 
                        and the Loud family doesn't feel it; 
                        then we, as a Nation, are obliged to 
                        feel shame on their behalf.

                        Of the most talked about events of the  
                        20th Century, two questions remain: Why 
                        Nixon recorded incriminating Oval Office 
                        tapes.  And "what possessed the Loud Family 
                        to invite cameras into their home, knowing 
                        exposure to the truth would destroy them." 

           The third "talking head" to weigh in, is Patty Loud, in a candid 
           interview, about what it was like to be in the eye of this storm. 

                              PATTY LOUD    (INTERVIEW)
                        "One single lesson?"  Hard to say.                 
                        Maybe, that when something seems            
                        too good to be true - it is. We were 
                        seen as the perfect family. No one,      
                        in Santa Barbara, would disagree.

                             "April 15, 1971"

           An AIRPORT TAXI pulls up, in front, and HONKS.

           INT. THE HOUSE - SAME 

           BILL LOUD comes hurtling down the stairs, with his suitcase, 
           making a pit-stop in the kitchen, where he's barely noticed    
           amidst all the cross-talk, except by PATTY, who fills his cup              
           at the head of the table.  WE DWELL ON FACES, AS PATTY CONTINUES:

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        Michelle, at l3, was a "budding young 
                        equestrian," in love with a horse named 
                        Daisy; Delilah, at 16, was a budding          
                        young woman, in love with a boy named  
                        Brad; Kevin and Grant, at 17 and 18, were 
                        certain their band was the next Rolling 
                        Stones.... And then, there was Lance.

           A no-show at the breakfast table; Bill's disapproval of his 
           son LANCE, is captured in a single glance at the EMPTY CHAIR.

                                 BILL
                        He is coming down, isn't he?            
                        (catches their covert glances)  
                        Does he understand they're not 
                        going to graduate him, if he             
                        has anymore unexcused absences? 

                                 DELILAH
                        The kids make fun of him, Dad.

                                 BILL
                        I wonder "why" that is.

                                 PATTY
                        We had a good talk about it. He's           
                        going to work a little harder, 'til    
                        graduation, at blending in. 

           JAWS DROP as LANCE ENTERS and slides into the vacant seat beside 
           his Father.  His hair is the color of aluminum foil.  

                                 BILL
                        What the Hell is that? 

                                 LANCE

                                 BILL
                        Do you think you're leaving the                
                        house, like that? 

                                 LANCE
                        Andy says, "People's opinion of me, 
                        is none of my business."

                                 BILL
                        Well, my opinion is.  Go wash it out.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Can we take a vote?

                                 BILL
                        No, we can't.  

                                 DELILAH
                        I think it's cool.

                                 LANCE
                        That's a "yes" vote.

                        Another "yes" vote.

                                 BILL
                        Patty - ?

                                 PATTY
                        Yes, Bill?

                                 LANCE
                        Another yes vote!

                                 BILL
                        If I didn't have to leave town,    
                        I'd take you upstairs and wash             
                        it out myself.

                                 LANCE
                        Why not cancel your trip?

           Meant to strike a nerve, it does.  Eye-contact between BILL and 
           PATTY indicates there's more to that question, than meets the eye.

                                 BILL
                        It might be your trip that's              
                        cancelled, Lance.  Andy Warhol          
                        called you, because you sent him                  
                        three hundred letters...
                                 LANCE
                        310, actually.

                                 BILL
                        And he stopped calling you, when he                 
                        was shot by a insane fan, which you              
                        now look like.  And, if you're purpose              
                        in going to New York, is to look for            
                        Andy - looking like that - you'll be      
                        looking for trouble!    

           GRABBING HIS SUITCASE, HE SLAMS OUT THE DOOR; PATTY'S worried gaze 
           at LANCE, taking in the empty chair beside him.

                        Bill's constant traveling took a toll 
                        on all of them; especially Lance, who 
                        hungered for his approval, most of all.

                        "out of the blue?"

           INTERCUT: PATTY'S ONGOING INTERVIEW 

                                 PATTY
                        Completely.  I'd never met him, 
                        never heard of him; Mary Avery 
                        called, saying "somebody important" 
                        wanted to meet me.  Wouldn't tell 
                        me who, or why.

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA TENNIS CLUB COUNTRY CLUB - LATER 

           Patty's friend, MARY AVERY waits on a patio overlooking the tennis 
           courts, with a man who, in this world of the perfectly tone-and-
           tanned, is clearly out of place. Dressed for colder climes, he's 
           shed his sweater, revealing a T-shirt too short to cover his 
           paunch.  But when he sees PATTY coming, wearing something that 
           shows her form and stride, the "unassuming" presence of CRAIG 
           GILBERT transforms into a formidable force of personal charm.

                                 MARY

                        Gilbert, from The Big Apple.

           Greetings exchanged, a waitress is summoned; PATTY'S awareness        
           of his admiring eyes on her, brings her performance up a notch. 

                                 PATTY
                        I'll have a Manhattan.  In honor            
                        of - "Manhattan." 

                                 GILBERT
                        In that spirit, I'll have an orange juice. 
                                 PAT
                        Don't drink in the afternoon?

                                 GILBERT
                        If I intend to win any friends on 
                        The Planet of Perfect Specimens, 
                        I'll have to lose the gut.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh, we're not as superficial as we look.               

                                 GILBERT
                        That's a relief. 

                                 PAT
                        But, do get a longer T-shirt. 

           IT SCORES A SURPRISED LAUGH; a good sign for what lies ahead.

                                 MARY
                        (to Gilbert)  Was I right?                 
                        (to Patty)) Craig came to Santa 
                        Barbara looking for the "Ideal 
                        American Family," Patty.

                                 PATTY
                        You came to the right place.

                                 ALAN
                        So people have told me.  And I 
                        already found one.  In a basket of 
                        Christmas Cards, at Mary's house  
                        last night.

           THE CHRISTMAS CARD he's holding carries the FAMILY PORTRAIT we   
           saw in the opening - before became an instrument of slander.  

                                 PATTY
                        We're not ideal.  We're just a family.

                                 GILBERT
                        I'd like to meet them. 

                                 PATTY
                        With what in mind?

                                 GILBERT
                        I make documentary films, Patty.         
                        Nothing you'd have ever heard                  
                        of; most recently on the work of             
                        Mead. She's a well-known anthropologist.

                                 PATTY
                        Really.
                                 GILBERT
                        Yes, and her method of researching            
                        is what inspired me.  Her remarkable 
                        study of "family life" in a primitive 
                        village - 

                                 PATTY
                        Coming of Age in Samoa - which I quite 
                        liked. (off his surprise)  We've learned 
                        how to tone our bodies here, and read at 
                        the same time. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Very Impressive.

                                 PATTY  
                        (quoting Mead)  "Fathers are biological 
                        necessities, but social accidents."  
                        She's dead-on, with gender roles.   

                                 GILBERT
                        She also said, "I don't believe in 
                        using women in combat.  Because 
                        women are too fierce." 

                                 PATTY
                        How 'bout, "throughout history 
                        women have chosen providers,             
                        while men have chosen anything."

           LAUGHTER, ALL 'ROUND.

                                 GILBERT
                        Why do I think we already know more 
                        about each other, than we should?

           The line between playful banter, and flirtation, is blurring here.                 

                                 GILBERT (CONT'D)
                        I want to study "An American Family,"                 
                        the same way she did, a primitive one;              
                        by having  camera team virtually "move                
                        in"with them, to capture life as it's                
                        really lived, 24/7.

                                 PATTY
                        In my family, that would be intensely boring.

                                 GILBERT
                        Nothing "real" is boring, Patty. You've 
                        heard of Andy warhol?  

                                 PATTY
                        (suppressing a smile)  Vaguely.
                                 GILBERT
                        He made a film called "Sleep."                   
                        Eight hours long, of nothing but                      
                        a man sleeping.  And audiences were 
                        fascinated.  We're all "born voyeurs."

                                 PATTY  
                        But we're not all born exhibitionists.               
                        Why would anyone subject their family                
                        to that? 

                                 GILBERT
                        To be a part of history.  A brave new  
                        experiment in putting "reality" on TV.   
                        Not fake reality, like "The Brady Bunch"    
                        or "Leave it to Beaver," but real people, 
                        with real lives.  A real family, like                 
                        "this one" (the Louds Christmas card)              
                        that gives "family" a good name. 

                                 PATTY
                        Its very flattering, but...

                                 GILBERT
                        Ah-ah don't say no. 

                                 MARY
                        He's gotten a "yes" from everybody   
                        he's spoken to, Patty.  The Hartells, 
                        the Kellers, The Bravermans...

                                 PATTY
                        Excellent choices, all.

                                 MARY
                        But not as good as The Louds.  You 
                        know that, and so do I.  And so 
                        does everyone in this community.  

                                 GILBERT 
                        As will, everyone in the entire 
                        Country, when they tune in, and   
                        see the Loud Family on TV. 

           Her PAUSE provides an OPENING: 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I like that thought.  Hold onto it.

                                 PATTY
                        And, what thought would that be?
                                 GILBERT
                        The one that says, "Patty, you'd 
                        better think this through...or               
                        you might be thinking about it,            
                        for the rest of your life. 

           INT. HER CAR - ON THE WAY HOME                                  

           PATTY bemused; "Like A Bridge over Troubled Water," on the radio, 
           casting a shadow on the mood. [NOTE: we can use or her on-camera 
           interview, or just her voice, to hear her thoughts, below.]

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        The "thought" I had, was about the            
                        "hangups," late at night, when I'd             
                        answer the phone. The woman's handkerchief 
                        that came back from the dry cleaners, 
                        pinned to his lapel.  And the silver 
                        cufflinks he claimed to have bought at a 
                        pawnshop; and was shocked by my "paranoia" 
                        at the freak coincidence that "To My Bad 
                        Billie" was inscribed on the  back.  

           INT HER BEDROOM  - EVENING

           PATTY at the window, in the grip of her fantasy as she watches 
           the kids play football on the lawn.  

                                 PATTY (VO) (CONT’D)
                        Paranoid or not; I could see their faces 
                        when they turned on their TV's and saw 
                        the Loud Family, shoulder-to-shoulder in 
                        solidarity, bonded by blood, and time, 
                        and love, and sacrifice, and a thousand 
                        things they couldn't begin to understand - 
                        except that they were up against a force 
                        that was indestructible. 

           INT. HER BATHROOM - BEDTIME 

           PATTY at the mirror, torn with indecision. 

                                 PATTY
                        What would it do to us? Could I use my 
                        family, to save my family?  I prayed 
                        for a "sign," to tell he what to do.  

           Reaching for the moisturizer, BILL'S travel kit HOLDS HER EYE.

                        Patty?  You know what I was thinking,              
                        When I came home tonight -  ?       

           Pulling on pajamas as he heads toward the opened bathroom door.

                        When I came home tonight, and - 

           ENTERING, HE SPOTS WHAT SHE'S STARING AT.  GULP.

                                 PATTY
                        Your hairbrush.

                                 BILL
                        My hairbrush?

                                 PATTY
                        It's clean.

                                 BILL
                        And - ?

                                 PATTY
                        Who cleaned it?

                                 BILL
                        I cleaned it.

                                 PATTY
                        You've never cleaned it.  I clean it.

                                 BILL
                        Well, I did, this time.

                                 PATTY
                        Why?

                                 BILL
                        You know, Patty?  This is finally           
                        too much.  Can you handle the truth? 

                                 PATTY
                        (in earnest)  I need the truth.

                                 BILL
                        It had blond hair in it.  From a Golden 
                        Retriever.  Bill Nevin's 4-year old brat 
                        opened my suitcase and brushed the dog 
                        with it.  You're amazing, though, I'll 
                        say that. (bursts into laughter)  "Who 
                        cleaned your hairbrush?!"  That's one 
                        for the books!! 

           She can't help but smile; not in appreciation of the humor, 
           but for being delivered the "sign" she's been praying for.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        So, I was saying.  You know what          
                        I was thinking?    (MORE)

                        When I was out there, playing   
                        touch-football, on the lawn?           
                        I was thinking that we're the     
                        "West Coast Kennedys."

                                 PATTY
                        That's interesting.  Because I met             
                        a filmmaker today, who's looking for             
                        The Perfect Family, to put on TV.

                        First of all, we were just married, 
                        and had something a little more 
                        exotic in mind for our honeymoon  
                        than a cutting room in a motel on     
                        the beach in Santa Barbara.

                        And, what was it, that changed your 
                        mind?  Craig Gilbert's legendary 
                        salesmanship?

                        The subject, I think.  For me, anyway.  
                        Getting "up close and personal" with 
                        people who'd really made a go of that 
                        thing called marriage; I wouldn't mind 
                        learning how to do that. 

                                 ALAN
                        For me, a chance to do something pure.

                        life, as it's really lived.

                        You'd heard of the Heisenberg principle?               
                        (trying to quote it)  "Anything changeable...."

                        Could that explain, what "went wrong?"

           THE RAYMONDS EXCHANGE GLANCE: "How best, to answer?" 

                                 SUSAN
                        It's important to know that Gilbert's                
                        own marriage had just collapsed. He                     
                        was bitter.  And believed, the version              
                        of "family," spoon-fed to us on television,                  
                        was a lie; and that the institution of                 
                        "marriage" was, in fact, doomed to extinction. 

                                 MODERATOR
                        So, it wasn't "being observed" that             
                        changed things.  It was "the observer."

                        He searched for the "perfect family," with                      
                        the instinct of a bloodhound sniffing for                
                        a "fatal flaw."  Consciously or not; he                   
                        wanted to find a family that looked like                           
                        The Brady Bunch - and bring them down.

           INT. LOUD HOUSEHOLD - A GUEST FOR DINNER

           GILBERT, held captive to Bill's bloviating, and noticing              
           PATTY's  embarrassment at his need to impress, is becoming               
           more certain, with each passing moment, that his search is              
           over.  The intellectual mismatch, plus an underlying tension,     
           is, to say the least, "promising." 

                                 BILL
                        You know what the secret is?  You gotta 
                        love it. If you don't love it, you can't 
                        sell it.  And, God help me, laugh if you 
                        want, I love drillbits.  The sight of a 
                        giant Grand Chinook Sawtooth take a big 
                        bite out of Mother Earth, it makes me 
                        feel... what can I say? 

                                 GILBERT
                        "Humbled?"

                                 BILL
                        "Powerful."

                                 KEVIN
                        Mister Gilbert saw Hair, Dad. Said it                            
                        was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
                                 BILL
                        (Mr. Quick-wit)  Speaking of which, 
                        you need yours cut!  That's a "once-
                        in-a lifetime experience," too!

                        And he knows Mick Jagger!

                        Isn't that the guy yodeling out 
                        there, in the garage?

                                 GILBERT
                        Your boys have promised me a concert.

                        to shoot it and put it on TV! 

                                 BILL
                        Whoa, Boys.  Let's slow down, here.

                                 GILBERT
                        My fault.  I confessed to them, that    
                        out of the 50 families I've interviewed, 
                        none is as remarkable as this. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You should see Lance.  He's the coolest 
                        of us all.  But he went to New York.    

                                 GILBERT
                        We could film him in New York.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He'd love that!

                                 BILL
                        (quick to intervene)  No, no, we'll 
                        just keep it to the immediate family.

                                 PATTY
                        He's not the immediate family?

                                 BILL
                        He's not in the house, and that's 
                        what the show is right?  What goes 
                        on, in the house?

                                 GILBERT
                        The house, the school, the super-market; 
                        wherever the family goes, we go, and 
                        that's what goes into the show.
                                 MICHELLE
                        (sudden fear)  What about the bathroom?

                                 GILBERT
                        (over their laughter)  No. 

                                 BILL
                        Seriously, what is off limits? 

                                 PATTY
                        Why, Bill?  Do you have something to hide?                

                                 GILBERT 
                        Fair question: the "threshold of privacy."  

                                 BILL
                        (pointedly)  "Thank you."  What's 
                        the answer?

                                 GILBERT
                        We'll know it, when we've crossed it. 
                        You'll come down to the cutting room 
                        and tell us what you don't like.

                                 BILL
                        That's in writing?

                                 GILBERT
                        For this to work, requires mutual trust.

                                 GRANT
                        I trust you, Mister Gilbert.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Me too, can we vote?

                                 BILL
                        Did someone say there are "votes, "here?

                                 GRANT
                        Come on, Dad.  We could be famous!

                                 GILBERT
                        They're not wrong. If we do this  right, 
                        you'll get the entire Country watching. 

           The thought of Bill's Bimbo's brings dark victory to PATTY'S eyes.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        The intelligent half, anyway.  

                                 PATTY
                        How do we get the dumb half?  (Oops)             
                        I mean it'd be nice to get everyone.
                                 BILL
                        What about payment?

                                 GILBERT
                        Actors get paid, to do what they're             
                        told.  The public has to be certain     
                        there's no "manipulation" going on here.

           Seeing the blow to his enthusiasm, worried glances shoot across 
           the room; the kids to PATTY, Patty to GILBERT, who throws her a 
           conspiratorial wink.  He's got it under control. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Frankly, Bill, I told my  bosses I'd 
                        find five great families - which I've 
                        already done, right here in Santa 
                        Barbara - and do "one hour of TV" on 
                        each. If you come aboard, I'd consider 
                        giving the whole five hours, to you. 

           AN ADMIRING GLANCE FROM PATTY: He's thrown the perfect bait.  

                                 BILL
                        What families are those?

                                 PATTY
                        The Hartells, the Kellers, the 
                        Braverman's and the Winstons.

                                 BILL
                        What's so great about their families?

                                 PATTY
                        What's not?

                                 BILL
                        Well, Bill Hartell spits food when          
                        he talks, the Keller kid is practically 
                        retarded, Clarice Winston can't shut up, 
                        and Estelle Braverman is just plain ugly. 

                                 GILBERT
                        So - is that a "yes?"

                                 BILL
                        I don't know.  I hate to be a bad host,                
                        but, with all the disruption it will                 
                        cause, and no  payment of any kind,                   
                        I just don't see  any upside, to it.

                                 PATTY
                        You might, when Bill Hartell becomes

           The Christmas card blown up to POSTER SIZE, for the Network brass, 
           who listen to GILBERT'S PITCH - with skepticism.

                        Handsome, hard-working Dad; smart, sultry 
                        Mom; 16 year old girl, experiencing her 
                        first crush, two boys who think they're

                        Because you promised us "five great 
                        families," and came back with one.

                                 GILBERT
                        I promised "five great hours."  
                        And, with this family, I'm betting   
                        five hours won't be enough.

                                 PRODUCTION EXEC
                        Enough of what?  "Pass the salt?"  
                        "Good pot roast?"  "How was your day, 
                        Dear?"  Frankly, I don't get the point.

           Don't get the point?  That's kind of "invitation" he lives for.                    

                                 GILBERT
                        Did you get the point of going to the            
                        moon, Paul?  I'm serious.  Did anyone             
                        ask Chris Columbus, "what's the point"             
                        of checking out what's on the other side           
                        of the ocean?  If he didn't have an answer 
                        before he left, he sure as hell did, when   
                        he came back with the news, "It ain't flat, 
                        guys, it's round!"  Personally, I think it 
                        was worth the trip.  But that's just me.

           just for the show.

                        (amping it up)  The "point" is, we've gone 
                        beyond the horizon, and behind the moon,   
                        but have yet to get past The American

                        the smiling faces they put on Christmas 
                        cards, there, you might as well believe,            
                        the Earth is Flat, and the Moon is made

           "Ten hours" gets a HUGE LAUGH - which was intended.

           PATTY on the phone, amidst the chaos of dogs barking, hammers 
           pounding, drills whining; the RAYMONDS and their Camera Assistant, 
           TOMMY GOODWIN, setting up the house for camera and sound.

           INT. GILBERT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - SAME

           He barrels in, and grabs the phone.

                                 GILBERT
                        I was just describing you Patty, and           
                        used a "term" that would make you blush.  

                                 PATTY
                        Why aren't you here, Craig?  There are 
                        people tearing my house apart. 

                                 GILBERT
                        They're pre-rigging, so that when we 
                        finish shooting in New York, we can 
                        just walk right in, and continue.
                                 PATTY
                        Maybe we shouldn't be starting                 
                        there.  In New York, I mean.

                                 GLBERT
                        Why, Patty?   What's wrong? 

                                 PATTY
                        I don't know.  The whole thing.                  
                        It feels like a mistake.

                                 GILBERT
                        Okay, slow down.  Is Lance worried? 

                                 PATTY
                        Only about what to wear.  So am I, 
                        And what to do. How to act. I mean            
                        how to do this.  I wish you were 
                        here. 

                                 GLBERT
                        There's nothing I can do, at this 
                        point, that the Raymonds' can't.  
                        They're not only great filmmakers 
                        they're good people, who you can 
                        talk to.  That's why I picked them.

                                 PATTY
                        I picked you to talk to.

                                 GILBERT
                        I'll be waiting, when you get here, 
                        Patty.  And we'll carve out some time           
                        together.  In the meantime, put Alan            
                        on  the phone.  You're probably giving            
                        them that dazzling "Patty smile" that 
                        covers up how scared you are.

           His words hit so deep, she's left speechless.  Handing off the          
           phone, she looks to the PATIO, where MICHELLE is helping SUSAN 
           plant a microphone in a potted palm.  In the KITCHEN, the boys            
           are helping TOMMY put brighter bulbs in the Chandelier.

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        I wondered, that day, where all this                
                        was taking me.  And why the person                 
                        I wanted to pour my heart out to, was 
                        someone I hardly knew at all.

           THE ANNOUNCEMENT of "Flight #255, arriving from Los Angeles,"       
           jump-starts the FILM CREW (Alan, Susan & Tommy), who shoulder 
           their equipment and run for the gate. TOMMY "slates," on the hoof.

           PATTY, at the mirror, unties her ponytail, then ties it again, 
           tweaks her collar, glosses her lips and, trying to conceal               
           how nervous she is, strikes an "indifferent" pose.

                        This backlight's killing me.

           THE 'SUN-GUN' snaps on, causing ARRIVING PASSENGERS to 
           squint, and PATTY to FREEZE in her tracks.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh - I didn't realize.

                        we're "invisible," remember?

                        But, you're right in front of me.

                                 ALAN
                        Walk right through us.  We'll

           Filming continues, as she hails a taxi.  TOMMY gestures 
           "ignore us" to the DRIVER, as THEY ALL PILE IN and pull away. 

           INT - TAXI - ON THE ROAD

           ALAN is in the front seat, turned around, shooting directly 
           back at PATTY; SUSAN squeezed in beside her with all the 
           sound gear piled in her lap. TOMMY crouches on the floor, 
           beneath the camera lens, reaching up to focus it, on command.

                        of a Mother, beginning to comprehend         
                        the size of this "monster" that has     
                        swallowed up her First Born.

           the show is, "every step of the way."

           keeps watch at the window - EXCITEDLY SPOTTING SOMETHING BELOW.

                        huge sunglasses, and have cameras 
                        following her?  Or is that Jackie-O?

           ALAN creeps backwards, in front of PATTY, to stay close on her 
           face, while TOMMY signals pedestrians to "clear away."

           NOTE: WHENEVER ALAN IS FILMING, WE SEE BOTH HIS POV, AND OURS.     

           HIS CAMERA, CLOSE ON HER FACE, captures her shock at how sleazy 
           this place is.

           OUR CAMERA has THE WIDE SHOT: people dodging out of the way  
           as THEY APPROACH THE FRONT DESK, TOMMY, admonishing the DESK 
           CLERK, in the broadest possible sign language, to IGNORE THEM.

                                 PATTY
                        Really?

                        I know so many famous and interesting

                        She thinks he's the All-American Boy,  
                        and she's the All-American Girl.

           THE CAMERA IS SHAKING, ALAN struggling to contain his LAUGHTER.

           WE'RE WATCHING IT ON AN EDITING CONSOLE AGAIN: GILBERT fast- 
           forwarding, to a scene of PATTY, LANCE and SOREN, on the streets

           INT. LA MAMA THEATER: SHOW IN PROGRESS

           PATTY front row center, between the two boys, with a sickly smile 
           on her face, watching a high-kicking chorus line of DRAG QUEENS.

                                 GILBERT
                        He takes her to a drag show!  Laced               
                        with profanity and sadomasochistic sex, 
                        performed practically in her lap!

           PATTY, IN SHOCK, CATCHES LANCE'S EYE - and whispers.  

                                 PATTY
                        Is that your friend, "Jackie?"

                        She's a man?

                        Well, I haven't accepted, or anything.

           A GLANCE OVER HER SHOULDER makes her cringe.  The FILM CREW is 
           there, PLUS CRAIG GILBERT - filming this whole scene.

                                 PATTY
                        (to Lance)  I'm going to leave,               
                        at intermission, okay?  You stay.

                        Lance, in case you haven't noticed.           
                        You might have taken this into                
                        account before you brought me here.

           INT. THEATER - THE FIRST ACT CURTAIN COMING DOWN 

           PATTY flips on her dark glasses, BLOWING RIGHT PAST GILBERT, who 
           pursues her to the street; her eagerness to distance herself from 
           that debacle, making it difficult for him to keep pace. 

                                 GILBERT
                        How'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?

                                 PATTY
                        Did you know this is what they were    
                        taking me to?
                                 GILBERT 
                        "Cinema verite," Patty. "What happens,     
                        happens." 

                                 PATTY
                        No.  This is not "happening."                        
                        Not in our show. "Transvestites?"                     
                        Don't make him look foolish, Craig.                
                        (anguished)  Maybe this is huge mistake!              

                                 GILBERT
                        You have a "say" about what "goes in,"             
                        and what "comes out," Patty.  But,          
                        if you're this upset about a "drag show" -

                                 PATTY
                        It's about Bill.  If he ever saw this...                     

                                 GILBERT
                        Lance is amazing, Pat.  I think you             
                        know that.  So does my whole crew.             
                        If his own Father doesn't know it,            
                        he's really missing out.  

           Though stunned by his trespass, she is touched by his words.     
           The undermining of PATTY LOUD has begun. 

                                 PATTY
                        I'm scared for him.  This place. 
                        These people.

                                 GILBERT
                        He's trying to find himself, Pat.  
                        And this is the place to do it.

                                 PATTY
                        Do you think so?

                                 GILBERT
                        It's no coincidence his hero is 
                        Andy Warhol.  And no shame. 

           Her eyes are hidden by sunglasses, but we sense she is near tears.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 PATTY
                        Not really.

                                 GILBERT
                        I'd give you a hug, but it wouldn't 
                        be appropriate.
                                 PATTY
                        I thought this was "cinema verite."  
                        Whatever happens, happens, right?   
                        Go for it. 

                                 GILBERT
                        I think I'll wait on that.

           Winning her confidence with every move, he puts a protective arm 
           around her, and gives her his handkerchief to wipe her tears. 

           INT. BISTRO - LATER

           PATTY, in what will become her signature pose - a cigarette 
           burning, and a drink in hand - is opening up to him.  

                                 PATTY
                        You know what Andy told him, the 
                        last time they spoke?  That he 
                        should honor his Father, even if 
                        his Father doesn't honor him.

                                 GILBERT
                        How much of an age difference is 
                        there, between you and Bill?

                                 PATTY
                        Seven years.

                                 GILBERT
                        Feels like a different generation.  
                        Such fixed moral principles."  
                        (fishing) Or, am I wrong, about that?

           He gets the "Patty smile; she's not ready for that.

                                 PATTY
                        What does your wife think of you?

                                 GILBERT
                        Not much.  We're divorced.  Weren't 
                        the "right fit," right from the    
                        start.  Still, it's hard to pull away.

           If it sound familiar, it's meant to.  

                                 PATTY
                        Could I ask a question?   The 
                        "adjective" you used.  To describe 
                        me?  You said, on the phone -

                                 GILBERT
                        Oh. I get kind of flowery, when I'm 
                        in my "selling" mode.
                                 PATTY
                        Selling?  

                                 GILBERT
                        You, to my bosses.  You, and the family.

                                 PATTY
                        What was the "word?"  

                                 GILBERT
                        Sultry.

                                 PATTY
                        "Sultry."

                                 GILBERT
                        And "smart."  I said that, too. 

                                 PATTY
                        I like sultry.

                                 GILBERT
                        ("message received") I think we'd 
                        better go.

           AS THEY EXIT TO THE STREET, WE HEAR:

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        Craig Gilbert was a revelation.           
                        Soulful, intellectual, fascinated           
                        with every detail of my life... and          
                        he appreciated Lance, which was the            
                        most endearing thing of all. 

           INT. THE LOUD HOUSE - LATER

           BILL ON THE PHONE, as PATTY ENTERS HER HOTEL ROOM AND ANSWERS.  
           WE CUT BETWEEN THE TWO.

                                 BILL
                        Hey, alley cat.  Isn't it kind of 
                        late to be prowling the streets?

                                 PATTY
                        Lance took me to a show.      

                                 BILL
                        How's he doing?  Found a job, yet?

                                 PATTY
                        No, but he's made a lot of friends. 

                                 BILL
                        Any girls on the horizon?  (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        That's still my hope, you know.  
                        That, if he could just meet the           
                        right girl.

                                 PATTY
                        I think he has. 

                                 BILL
                        Really?

                                 PATTY
                        She was in the show tonight.

                                 BILL
                        And, she likes him in "that" way?

                                 PATTY
                        Says she wants to marry him.

                                 BILL
                        Well, I'll be Goddamn!  That's 
                        amazing!   Has Gilbert been around?

                                 PATTY
                        (lighting a cigarette) Mmmm-hm.            
                        He likes Lance, just the way he is.

                                 BILL
                        (feeling the barb) Oh, is that so? 

                                 PATTY
                        He's going to try to help him reconnect 
                        with Andy.       

                                 BILL
                        I don't think that's a good idea.

                                 PATTY
                        I don't think that matters.   

                                 BILL
                        How much have you had to drink Patty?

                                 PATTY
                        Enough to put me to sleep.  We're                    
                        going for a stroll in the Park, in                      
                        the morning.  

                                 BILL
                        You and Gilbert?

                                 PATTY
                        Me and Lance.  He's happy here.
                                 BILL
                        I'm not happy here.  I miss you.

                                 PATTY
                        Then you can pick me up at the 
                        airport, Wednesday afternoon. 

           Hanging up, she lies back on the bed, savoring the feel of FREEDOM  

           EXT SANTA BARBARA AIRPORT - DAY

           BILL, waiting with a rose in hand, greets PATTY with a big hug. 
           Noticing the camera wasn't ready, he waits 'til it is, and does it 
           again; not much more convincing than it was the first time     

                                 BILL
                        How 'bout I take you guys to lunch?  

           TOMMY indicates, "We don't speak."

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Okay then, how 'bout I take my wife 
                        to lunch??

                                 PATTY
                        (re: filming)  "On" or "off" the record? 

                                 BILL
                        Hey.  My life is an open book.

           INT. RESTAURANT (EL PASEO) - LATER

           THE CREW takes a "working lunch," gobbling food, while the camera 
           runs on PATTY and BILL, in the booth across from them.  BILL is 
           downing a second Marguerita; neither has much to say.

                                 BILL 
                        So, you had a good time.  That's good. 

                                 PATTY
                        I did.

                                 BILL
                        (joking)  Well, we didn't miss you a 
                        bit.  Delilah took right over, where  
                        you left off: "Michelle, you set the 
                        table, Grant, you make the toast." We 
                        were all working for her, this week.

                                 PATTY
                        Still, in all, you got a nice tan. 
                                 BILL
                        High blood pressure, Kiddo.  This strike 
                        is going to do me in.  Thirty thousand 
                        bucks worth of  drillbits sitting on the 
                        dock, with no one to haul it.

                                 PATTY
                        (disinterested)  Are we going to                           
                        go broke, Bill?

                                 BILL
                        You better believe it.  Lance "living     
                        it up," in New York?  I hope he knows 
                        he's on a short string, there.

                                 PATTY
                        He loves it there, Bill.  Loves the                       
                        streets, the people, bursts into song 
                        sometimes.  He has a "spark of life,"                 
                        like no one I've ever known.  So open.                
                        And funny. 

                                 BILL 
                        And lazy, like the rest.  Has he even    
                        looked for a job?  I tell Grant, he        
                        can make ten bucks an hour hauling cement 
                        for David Witzell, you know what he says? 
                        "Thanks, anyway."  If he thinks he's                
                        going to spend the summer "howling"                  
                        in that garage... 

                                 PATTY
                        The band is his dream, Bill. 

                                 BILL
                        How 'bout getting dream that brings                    
                        in some  bucks?  It's not like we're                   
                        raising a  bunch of doctors and lawyers, 
                        around here.

                                 PATTY
                        Then, how 'bout raising people who 
                        have a shot at being happy?

                                 BILL
                        (escalating)  How 'bout having a Mother            
                        who makes certain they know "right from            
                        wrong?"  What they should and shouldn't                
                        be doing. I think that would be nice,                  
                        don't you? 

           ALAN'S CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON PATTY; stunned.  Has BILL forgotten 
           they're being filmed, or is he "getting off," on this? 
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Believe me, this week of "baby sitting" 
                        gave me a better idea of what goes on, 
                        when I'm gone. 

                                 PATTY
                        Really?  Like what?

                                 BILL
                        Like your 16-year old daughter, staying            
                        out half the night, after her dance 
                        practice.  2:00 o'clock in the morning                
                        on a school night?!  I get home, and           
                        her bed is empty?  Maybe somebody           
                        else's  isn't.  You know what I mean? 

           PATTY, FUMING, TURNS TO THE RAYMONDS.

                                 PATTY
                        We'll end it here.  I'll speak to 
                        Craig in the morning, about dropping 
                        this from the film.

                                 ALAN
                        (in full agreement)  Done.  

           As they 'wrap', PATTY "dead-eyes" BILL, and issues a quiet threat. 

                                 PATTY
                        "Bait me" in front of the camera                  
                        again?  You'll be very, very, sorry.

           INT. GILBERT'S N.Y. CUTTING ROOM - NIGHT

           GILBERT ON THE PHONE, FUMING AT ALAN, who is in his cramped 
           cutting room/cum living space, at the Miramar-on-the-Beach Motel. 
           WE CAN HEAR WAVES IN THE BACKGROUND. 

                                 GILBERT 
                        So, you let her call "cut?"  Is she 
                        the director now?  I've got people 
                        leaning all over me, because we're 
                        burning 18 rolls  of film per day, 
                        and nothing is happening!  Finally, 
                        something starts to heat up, and 
                        you abort it?!!

                                 ALAN
                        It was about her 16-year old   
                        daughter's sex life.  Do we want to 
                        embarrass a 16-year old girl? 
                                 CRAIG
                        Listen carefully.  You were hired                 
                        to turn that camera on, and let it       
                        And run!  And run!  And RUN! That is 
                        Cinema Verite! That is what you signed           
                        up for!  "No involvement, no judgement,        
                        no agenda!"  Do I want to embarrass a              
                        16-year old girl?!  You bet I do!  
                        Because, what goes wrong  with that 
                        family, goes right with this film!               
                        And, if you don't have the guts to           
                        shoot it, I'll find somebody who will! 

           HE SLAMS THE PHONE DOWN; leaving THE RAYMONDS in DISMAY. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           PATTY and her daughters, out shopping, are spotted by a close 
           friend (VAL) calling from the doorway of "VAL'S CLOSET" - her 
           pricey boutique. 

                                 VAL
                        Hey, Patz! I was about to call you!        
                        What are you guys up to? 

                                 PATTY
                        New tap shoes, for the dance recital. 

                                 VAL
                        How'd you like a new Spring outfit, 
                        complete with purse, hat, and shoes -      
                        "on the house?"

                                 PATTY
                        My goodness.  Why?  

                                 VAL
                        Because I wouldn't mind having all              
                        of America see my new Spring line,              
                        is "why."  Bill says he can get me a 
                        wardrobe credit, at the end of the show.

                                 PATTY
                        Well, that's very nice of him.

                                 BILL (OS)
                        There's my girls...!

           Speak of the Devil, he pulls up, with the FILM CREW in tow, 
           bounding to the curb with hugs for all - including VAL.  

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Is this a beautiful bunch?                   
                        One's prettier than the next.  
                                 FROM ACROSS THE STREET 
                        Hey, there's America's perfect family!

           It's the HARTELLS, dodging traffic, to get into the shot.   

                                 HARTELL
                        I hear they're going to film the                
                        boys' rock band. 

                                 PATTY
                        And the girls' dance recital. 

                                 BILL
                        (Got a) bunch of movie stars, here! 

           ANOTHER PAIR OF FRIENDS joins them for the street-corner gabfest; 
           PATTY, having become camera-savvy, makes the most of the photo-op, 
           wrapping a possessive arm around HER MAN. 

                                 PATTY'S (VO)
                        Two months into the filming, I sensed                  
                        I was accomplishing what I set out, to.           
                        The image of the Loud Family, being        
                        captured on film, were exactly what                  
                        I wanted Bill's Bimbos to see.        

           INT. SANTA BARBARA THEATER - DANCE RECITAL

           BILL and PATTY, in the audience of proud Moms and Dads, are the 
           picture of marital contentment, their eye contact conveying the 
           intimacy of "parental collusion," long absent from their lives.

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        Craig claimed to be "too busy,"            
                        to visit - which was just as well,                
                        because our "charade" was taking               
                        on a life of its own. So real, that               
                        I started believing it, myself.

                                 GILBERT (OS)
                        The point is, what's lurking 
                        beneath the surface."  Watch this:

           INT. N.Y. EDITING ROOM - DAY

           GILBERT, trying to take the story in a whole other direction,            
           is getting HIS BOSSES EXCITED, with footage of the "lunchtime             
           flare-up between PATTY and BILL; working it, for all it's worth.

                        unless you can make one these Old             
                        Biddies die on camera, this is a             
                        worthless shoot!  If they don't                
                        getting some "bang for their buck"             
                        back here, they're going to pull the                
                        plug on us!

           INT. PATTY & BILL'S BEDROOM - DAY 
           PATTY in BILLS closet, furtively, and feverishly, going through 
           every pocket, shelf and drawer, unfolding every scrap of paper, 
           turning his socks inside out, sniffing his shirts and ties....             

                                 PATTY (OS
                        When I got back from Portland, and             
                        Bill was still gone, the years of 
                        "turning a blind eye" came to a                  
                        crashing end.  I became obsessed,               
                        with the need to know.  

           HER HAND wraps around something in the pocket of a ski jacket:            
           a KEY RING, WITH 3 KEYS ON IT, that she's never seen before.

                                 GRANT (OS)
                        (urgent) Mom?

                                 PATTY
                        (pockets it)  Yes? 

                                 GRANT
                        (bounding upstairs) Dad's getting out                  
                        of a taxi. Should we keep it a surprise,   
                        or show him what's going on in the yard?

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - SAME

           BILL surprised to see PATTY appear; she's surprised by his 
           "appearance," as well.  He's burned to a crisp. 

                                 PATTY
                        Wow.  Where have you been?  To 
                        Hell, and back?? 

                                 BILL
                        You got that, right. Baking, on a              
                        job site for three days, trying                 
                        to keep Jefferson Contracting from 
                        demanding their money back. 

                                 PATTY
                        Why didn't you call me?

                                 BILL
                        I thought it'd be a quick round 
                        trip, and didn't want to pull you 
                        away from your Mom.  It's bad out 
                        there, Patty. Kern County Quarry 
                        had to close down, because the 
                        Teamsters have joined the strike. 
                        I've got 15,000 worth of equipment 
                        sitting on the dock in Galveston.
           Not a ruse; his anguish is real. But he forces a smile for the 
           CREW, emerging, with GRANT and KEVIN, from behind the house. 

                                 GRANT
                        We can't hide it, Mom, they've got to             
                        start hammering.  Man, are you burned.

                                 BILL
                        "Hammering" what?  What's going on?

           They lead him to the back, where WORKMEN are building a platform.

                                 KEVIN
                        (proudly) "Woodstock West," Man.  
                        There's a new rock group, gonna 
                        break out here, Friday night.  

                                 GRANT
                        We're inviting people from every                
                        coffee house and bar in town, so                   
                        we can get some gigs, this summer.

                                 BILL
                        You've got a "gig" this summer, Grant, 
                        hauling cement for David Whitsell. 

                                 GRANT
                        Oh, I don't think so.

                                 BILL
                        (taking him on)  Oh, I do.  We're 
                        going to need some financial help, 
                        around here. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You'll love pouring cement, Grant.

                                 BILL
                        (to Kevin)  I'm putting you to work 
                        too, helping me to branch out.

                                 GRANT
                        You'll love "branching out," Kevin. 

                                 BILL
                        I need you to go to Australia with 
                        Sonny Hartman, and try to pick up 
                        some new clients.  Start grooming 
                        you, as a businessman.

                                 GRANT
                        He goes to Australia, I pour cement?!
                                 BILL
                        I have "instincts," Grant.  One of                     
                        them, is putting the right people,                   
                        in the right jobs. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Do I look like a "businessman?" 

                                 GRANT
                        Do I look like a "cement guy?!"

                                 BILL 
                        (re: the camera) We'll discuss it, later.

                                 GRANT
                        (steamed) No, let's go for it, right 
                        here and now!  I want it on film, that 
                        our Father doesn't believe in us!

                                 PATTY
                        (warning)  Grant.

           He "buttons it," flipping BILL off, as he STOMPS AWAY.                             

           INT. PATTY & BILLS BEDROOM -  LATER

                                 BILL (OS)
                        (moaning)  ....Oh God.  Oh God...

           Not sex - sunburn; lotion being rubbed on his back by PATTY, who's 
           mortified that, by all indications, her fantasies have run wild.          

                                   PATTY
                        Why weren't you wearing a shirt?

                                 BILL
                        I didn't know the sun was so hot.  I               
                        didn't know a lot of things.  I didn't           
                        know you could take ten bucks, turn it              
                        into fifteen, keep parlaying it, until            
                        you're ready to beat the "big boys" at                 
                        their own game - then a Goddamn strike                 
                        comes along and I'm out in  the hot sun,        
                        unable to pay my vendors - ! 

                                 PATTY
                        What's the worst that could happen? 

                                 BILL
                        It scares me to think about it. 

                                 PATTY
                        We could face anything, Bill, if          
                        we had each other.
           In his vulnerable state, it lands like a BUNKER BUSTER.

                                 BILL
                        Don't we "have" each other, Patty?

                                 PATTY 
                        Come on, Bill

                                 BILL               
                        (coming apart)  My God.  I'm flying                  
                        back here, thinking I've always got                 
                        Patty, I've always got the family.                          
                        I give a shit less, what happens                                 
                        to the house, the cars, they can all                            
                        "go away," so long as...(chokes up)

                                 PATTY
                        (soothing)  Okay, it's okay....  

                                 BILL
                        We've had our ups and downs, Patty, 
                        I've taken you for granted,  I know.  
                        And I'm sorry,  Truly.  For the pain 
                        I've caused.  But, without you in my 
                        corner, I don't know what I'd do. 

           Too little, too late?  Her HESITATION sends him into a PANIC. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you're "here" for me,              
                        okay?  You gotta say that for                
                        me, Patty.  You gotta tell me that.  

                                 PATTY
                        I am, Bill.  Of course I am. 

                                 BILL
                        I'm done making you unhappy.  That's 
                        all over, now.  I love you.  Patty - ?

                                 PATTY
                        I love you too, Bill.  God help me, 
                        I do. 

           The kiss is for his sake.  But the hug that follows is a clear 
           demonstration of how much she needs this moment to be true.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA - NEXT DAY 

           The FILM CREW follows PATTY into VAL'S BOUTIQUE; a new lightness                   
           in her step; Bill's remorse having given her a sense of hope. 
                                 PATTY
                        (to a salesgirl) Is Val around?  I'm              
                        here to take her up, on her offer.                   
                        My boys are giving a concert this              
                        weekend, and it might be a good time                 
                        for me to look nice.          

                                 SALESGIRL
                        I'll get her.

           PATTY turns away, thumbing through the rack, as VAL ENTERS. 

                                 VAL
                        Hey, I was just thinking about you.   

           PATTY looks up - AND HER BLOOD RUNS COLD.

                                 VAL (CONT’D)                           
                        I've got these amazing pastel                     
                        sundresses, with matching shoes.             
                        There's a turquoise, that would be              
                        dazzling on you. (no response) Patty- ?               

                                 PATTY
                        That's quite a sunburn. 

                                 VAL
                        Can you believe it?  One day, of 
                        gardening?  You should see my back.

                                 PATTY
                        (tight) It looks like more than   
                        "one day of gardening," to me. 

                                 VAL
                        Okay, "two."  And half.  I lied. 

                                 PATTY
                        "Two and a half."  That's about right.           

                                 VAL
                        You should get a job with Coppertone.

           VAL LAUGHS.  PATTY GLARES. THE FILMMAKERS exchange uneasy glances. 

                                 VAL (CONT’D)
                        Did you want to try it on?  It 
                        comes in five colors.           

                                 PATTY
                        I'll take one of each.  And, forget             
                        the "freebee."  Bill told me to use           
                        his credit card, and buy whatever             
                        I want, no matter what the price.

                        If  I didn't know better, I'd think he's 
                        feeling a little "guilty," wouldn't you?  
                        Or, maybe it's just that he loves me so 

           THEIR EYES LOCK. VAL'S SUNBURN JUST GOT HOTTER.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Come to think of it, I'll need shoes.
                        And, luggage, maybe.  I might be traveling 
                        soon.  With the children.  It'll break 
                        Bill's heart, to be left here alone, but          
                        I told the girls we might go to Taos             
                        this summer.  How would that work for you? 

                                 VAL
                        Could I see you for a minute?

           PATTY follows her out of camera range, to the back room.  ALAN, 
           exchanging a meaningful look with SUSAN, puts his camera down.

                                 VAL (CONT’D)
                        What on Earth is your problem?

                                 PATTY
                        You offered to show me your           
                        sunburned back.  Do you mind - ? 

                                 VAL
                        What for?

                                 PATTY
                        To see if there's a strap line,           
                        or if you unhooked your bra to            
                        get an even tan - while "gardening."  
                        Bet the neighbors liked that.

                                 VAL
                        I do mind.  And I think, being    
                        followed around by those cameras      
                        has made you a little nuts.

           Seeing the lie in her eyes, PATTY smiles.

                                 PATTY
                        Are you coming to the concert? 

                                 VAL
                        The boys invited me, but I'm not sure I should.

                                 PATTY
                        They'd be hurt if you didn't. We've  
                        always considered you "family," Val.

           TURNING ON HER HEEL, PATTY EXITS THE SHOP.
           INT. GILBERT'S CUTTING ROOM IN NEW YORK 

           Footage of Patty's encounter with Val, on his screen, GILBERT            
           is on the phone with ALAN, in a RAGE.

                                 GILBERT
                        Not even the slightest bit "curious," 
                        huh?! Bill comes home, surprising Patty 
                        with a bad sunburn, this woman turns up 
                        with a bad sunburn, and Patty's all over 
                        it, and you never asked her "why?!"

           ALAN, on the other end ,is equally pissed.

                                 ALAN
                        Just a "fly on the wall," Craig.                
                        Wasn't that the job description?!                    
                        "No involvement?" No "agenda?"                  
                        "Just turn on the camera, and                  
                        let it run, and run, and RUN?!" 

                                 GILBERT
                        You know what I think, Alan?  It's 
                        time to "give you hand," down there.             

                              PANEL MODERATOR (OS)
                        Would you call it "creative differences?"

                                 ALAN (OS)
                        That would be a nice way of putting it.

           INTERCUT:  ACADEMY OF RADIO AND TV AUDITORIUM - 1975 

                                                 
                           "An  evening  with  filmmakers  Alan  and  Susan  Raymond"   

                                 ALAN
                        Patty’s growing desperation to keep               
                        things sugar-coated, was on a collision 
                        course with Gilbert's increasing hunger 
                        for red meat.  

                                 MODERATOR
                        And you were "caught in the middle?" 

                                 SUSAN
                        We were "in the way."

           EXT.  BACKYARD - THE CONCERT IN PROGRESS

           Swirling lights and Tiki Torches illuminate the stage, where ALAM 
           and TOMMY work TWO CAMERAS, big-time concert style. 
           Honky Tonk Woman plays to a packed house, seated in rows of 
           folding chairs; even the neighborhood dogs are in attendance. 
           VAL is there, with another attractive woman (LINDA), both of whom 
           catch BILL'S eye, and give him a "thumbs up."  Next to BILL, are  
           MICHELLE and DELILAH; the chair meant for PATTY, is empty.  

           WE FIND HER INSIDE, watching from the kitchen window; the dark 
           glasses, in addition to the usual cigarette and drink, suggesting 
           her mood has sunk to a depth we haven't seen her go to, before. 

           But she almost drops her drink when she sees a TAXI pull into              
           the driveway, CRAIG GILBERT, with a suitcase in hand, getting out.  
           Unprepared for this, she'd duck if he hadn't already spotted her, 
           smiling and waving, as he heads her way.

           INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                     

           HE KNOCKS AND ENTERS; PATTY too fragile to do much more than nod.  

                                 GILBERT
                        Hi, I'm Craig Gilbert.  From New 
                        York?  Big fan. 

                                 PATTY
                        Been awhile.

                                 GILBERT
                        Doesn't seem like it, to me.  I 
                        watch you in dailies every day. 
                        You're beautiful in every frame.

                                 PATTY
                        Are all men bullshitters, Craig?  
                        Or just the two in my life?

                                 GILBERT
                        There shouldn't be "two."  It was 
                        clear to me, in New York, that it 
                        would be best if I stayed away.              
                        I sensed you knew that, too. 

                                 PATTY
                        And you're here tonight, because - ?

                                 GILBERT
                        At the risk of being called a 
                        "bullshitter," I began to wonder             
                        if maybe you needed me here.  No, 
                        that is bullshit.  I missed you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (bursting in)  Mom, you're missing 
                        the whole thing!  Hi, Craig! You too! 

           MOMENTS LATER: THE FINALE BRINGS THE AUDIENCE TO ITS FEET.
           INT. THE HOUSE - LATER

           An after-concert celebration with booze and pizza, the Raymonds, 
           the Loud kids, and all their friends and neighbors, are kicking 
           back with the "boys in the band." BILL AND PATTY are there, so      
           is Patty's brother TOM, and his wife YVONNE (identified, in random 
           dialogue, as "the proud Aunt and Uncle").  VAL is in attendance, 
           with her friend LINDA, so is MARY AVERY, who first introduced 
           Patty to Craig..... and, most importantly, The Man himself, CRAIG 
           GILBERT, holding the ladies in his thrall.

           BILL is trying to compete, but out of his league; PATTY, having 
           had too much to drink, glares, with resentment, at both of them.

                                 GILBERT
                        What Barry told me - "Barry Gordy"  
                        (aside) who, just between you and       
                        me, is enjoying a "special friendship   
                        with Diana Ross - is that the success              
                        of any group is all about "one person."  
                        The Supremes have it.  The Emotions 
                        (reminds who they are, with the refrain, 
                        "Oooh, Baby-baby") don't.

                                 BILL
                        (challenging)  How 'bout the Jackson 
                        "Five?"  Can't say that's about "one 
                        person," can you.

                                 GILBERT
                        It is, actually; the ten year old.  
                        That little guy is going to be a star.

                                 BILL
                        At least that "Little Guy" is bringing             
                        in some bucks.  Unlike my "little guys."

                                 GILBERT
                        It takes time, Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Oh, they got all the time they want.  
                        They want to "play music," go play it.       
                        Just, not on my dime.  

           HIS ANGER blows a hole in the fun - and he falls into it. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        (re: Grant)  "Mick Jagger" here, 
                        don't want to shovel cement?  Fine. 
                        Don't shovel cement, go support 
                        yourself.  The girls want to tap 
                        dance, get a job to pay for lessons.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        I even got one, who wears pink shoes 
                        and thinks he's going to Paris!

                                 GILBERT
                        (correcting)  He's in Paris.

                                 PATTY
                        (stunned)  He's what?

                                 GILBERT
                        I'll show you the footage.  I sent    
                        a kid from NYU, with a camera, to 
                        follow him.

                                 BILL
                        Fine by me, so long as someone      
                        else pays the tab.  

                                 PATTY
                        (fuming)  Well, it's not "fine" by               
                        me.  And I do want to see that film.  
                        I'd like to see all the film.  And               
                        find out what the Hell else I don't     
                        know about my family.  Where my children 
                        are, where my husband goes - and what 
                        the point is, of doing this!

           Glances shoot across the room; GILBERT'S eyes dart to the RAYMONDS 
           and he SNAPS HIS FINGERS (!) indicating they should be shooting 
           this.  Offended by the "dog obedience command," they do not obey.  

                                 MARY AVERY
                        I'm sure we'd all like to hear what                 
                        the point is, Craig.  Maybe it will            
                        help Patty understand what an honor              
                        it was, to have been chosen for this. 

           Taking center stage, the mix of Mai-Tai and flattery inspires               
           the usual poetic spin; but also, an unguarded version of GILBERT'S 
           "truth" - that PATTY has never heard before. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Think of a space ship landing on Earth,                   
                        a thousand years from now, and finding                 
                        a "time capsule," with film in it, of                     
                        life inside the human dwelling, in that               
                        long ago time, of 1971.  Everyone sweet,and 
                        smiling, and happy, and dancing, and singing 
                        around the piano, safe and secure  with the 
                        certainty and permanence of each others' love.                 
                        (And here's the kicker:)  What the Space               
                        Aliens found, was an old episode of The 
                        Partridge Family!

                                 GILBERT (CONT'D)
                        Which is the direct antithesis of                    
                        how we really live: "fumbling around,                
                        in confusion," trying to make sense               
                        of those very false notions of "family"                
                        that television has put into our heads!

                                 PATTY
                        (livid) That's full of shit.  You're full                    
                        of shit.  Is that what you think we're                 
                        doing, here?  Fumbling around, in confusion?!"  
                        Let me tell you something, that everyone                  
                        else in this room seems to know, but you.                                                         
                        The Louds  are not "fumbling around!"  And,                
                        are not confused!  I am fine, we are fine,                  
                        my family is fine!  And, if our world confuses 
                        you, it is you who are confused.  To us, it               
                        makes perfect sense!  And we are safe, and 
                        sensible inside of it!. 

           SHE HEADS FOR THE DOOR; BUT ISN'T FINISHED YET.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I'm coming to the editing room,                  
                        tomorrow, Mister Gilbert.  And if            
                        there's anything that gives the false 
                        impression we're "fumbling around" in 
                        here, it's not going out, on the air! 

           SHE SLAMS OUT, leaving STUNNED SILENCE, behind her. 

           INT. BILL AND PAT'S BEDROOM - LATER

           The darkness broken by a shaft of light when BILL steps out of     
           the bathroom, slipping into bed beside the sleeping form of PATTY - 
           who stirs.  Clearly not asleep.

                                 PATTY
                        Don't talk.  Just listen. I promised     
                        the girls a trip to Taos.  We'll go as 
                        soon as school's out.  I want Delilah to 
                        take a little break from Brad.  I'll find 
                        a horse for Michelle to ride.  Grant has 
                        agreed to give it a try in Orange County, 
                        shoveling cement.  Kevin will accompany 
                        Todd Hartman to Australia. 

                                 BILL
                        It's about time someone listened to me.

                                 PATTY
                        No one is listening to you.  I want            
                        them all accounted for, before I go, so 
                        no one will be in danger of desertion. 
                                 BILL
                        Going to work, is "desertion" to you? 

                                 PATTY
                        I'm not sure, Bill.  I'm not sure of 
                        anything.  That's why I'm going away.         
                        To get some clarity about what's real,         
                        and what's not.  What part of the nightmare 
                        is my imagination, and what part is true.

                                 BILL
                        I think it's a good idea to get away.

                                 PATTY
                        I'm sure you do.

           EXT/INT. MIRAMAR MOTEL (CUTTING ROOM) - NEXT DAY

           The laughter of children playing in the surf doesn't penetrate  
           the blackout curtains of the cutting room, where GILBERT, as 
           "requested," is screening footage for PATTY; the canny salesman 
           showcasing the stuff she'll love - that he hated. The Portland 
           shoot. PATTY, contrary to her expectations, is moved to tears. 

                                 GILBERT
                        I did some editing, before I           
                        came out, so you could see how             
                        it will all come together.  

           ON THE SCREEN, are things we haven't seen; like PATTY and her MOM 
           leafing through the family album, which becomes a PHOTO MONTAGE        
           of the kids growing up, underscored with strings.  

           Then it CUTS TO the BIRTHDAY CAKE being carried out by the OLD 
           LADIES singing Happy Birthday; ALAN'S CAMERA, guided by infallible 
           instinct, PANNING to PATTY, coming up alongside her MOM, as the 
           old lady makes her wish, her eyes glistening in the candlelight. 
           GILBERT knows when to stop.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        There's 86,000 feet of film, Patty. 
                        Every frame as good as this. We could 
                        sit here for days, and I'm happy to do 
                        that, if that's what you want to do.

                                 PATTY
                        (chagrined)  No.

           He hands her a BETA CARTRIDGE, labeled "Lance in Paris."

                                 GILBERT
                        To be viewed at your leisure.  
                        There was no deception on my part. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GILBERT (CONT'D)
                        He gave me the impression, he'd 
                        told you he was going.

                                 PATTY
                        I'm sorry about last night.  It's 
                        been kind of a tough time for me.

                                 GILBERT
                        That's clear to see.

           He opens the door to the sun, ocean breeze, and sound of waves.  
           They step out, onto the sand.

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           ing the shoreline, among young families reveling in each other's 
           company, GILBERT notes PATTY'S envy of them, offering his arm.  
           Accepting it, she picks up the conversation, where they left off.

                                 PATTY
                        It's "clear to see" what?

                                 GILBERT
                        Your "anger."  Is he cheating on you? 

           Surprised by his directness, she ponders how to answer. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        There are no cameras, here.

                                 PATTY
                        The painful truth is, I'm not sure.  
                        I always think so, but can't find 
                        proof.  He says I'm paranoid. That 
                        might be true.  

                                 GILBERT
                        If you did have proof, what would                  
                        you do?

                                 PATTY
                        Do you "know" something, Craig?

                                 GILBERT
                        I "know" what I see in you.  And                   
                        what  I saw in you, the moment we               
                        met. Unforgettable, actually.  A              
                        vision of the "Liberated Woman."             
                        Her own person.  Beautiful, graceful,              
                        funny, and strong.             

                                 PATTY
                        Pantsuits will do that.
                                 GILBERT
                        A "role model."  And, like it or not,             
                        that's what you'll soon be.  You'll be              
                        on magazine covers, and women all over 
                        America are going to look to you, for          
                        a roadmap, of how to be, and who to be,            
                        when "family" turns out not to be, all 
                        they'd hoped for.  To swallow their fears 
                        like Patty Loud did, and face it, head on; 
                        refuse to accept "unhappiness" as the 
                        unspoken wedding vow.  That's what I              
                        was trying to say last night.  You can             
                        show women, whose strength is eroding,            
                        how to take back their lives.

           Impressed, as always, with his eloquence, she sits, digging her 
           toes into the sand,  He settles in ungracefully, beside her, 
           following her gaze to the horizon.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        You asked me, last night, if                 
                        I was a bullshitter.  Are you?

                                 PATTY
                        Test me.

                                 GILBERT
                        Okay.  I told you, what I thought 
                        of you, when we first met.  What 
                        did you think of me? 

                                 PATTY
                        I thought, if that guy could fix    
                        his body, he'd be my perfect man.

           Few people can shock him like she does; he bursts into guffaws.  

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Any more questions?

                                 GILBERT
                        Yes.  Would you leave him, if you   
                        knew for certain, he was cheating                
                        on you?

                                 PATTY
                        Yes.

                                 GILBERT
                        Would you consider doing it, with            
                        Alan and Susan in the room?  With            
                        the camera rolling, just tell him            
                        to "pack up and get out?"  If you             
                        had proof?
                                 PATTY
                        I'd consider anything, if I could 
                        find out the truth.

                                 GILBERT
                        Well, then. I've got my work cut 
                        out for me.  (off her look)
                        Getting my body in shape, I mean.

                                 PATTY
                        You might start, by doing some            
                        push-ups, right now.

                                 GILBERT
                        Don't look.  I'm going to take                       
                        my shirt off

                                 PATTY
                        Wouldn't think of it.

           She heads away, never looking back, to see him struggling,                  
           to do push-ups, in the sand.  

           EXT. THE LOUD'S DRIVEWAY - DAY

           PATTY, with the help of her three traveling companions (MICHELLE, 
           DELILAH & DELILAH'S FRIEND, "CROW") have finished packing the car  
           for the trip to TAOS; KEVIN and BILL are securing suitcases to the 
           roof rack; the CAMERA CREW there to get the departure on film. 

                                  PATTY
                        (to Kevin) I left the number of                
                        the house we're staying at, and                  
                        I want you to make a collect call,                  
                        as soon as you get to Australia. 

                                 BILL
                        But not too many of those.

                                 PATTY
                        (to the crew)  When are you guys   
                        coming?  (off their refusal to speak)  
                        Oh, for God's sake, you can answer.

                                 TOMMY GOODWIN
                        We'll fly down, over the weekend.  
                        We're filming Kevin's haircut today.   

                                 BILL
                        For Ripley's Believe It Or Not?

                                 DELILAH
                        Gonna to miss us, Daddy?
                                 BILL
                        Who do I take, to the Fiesta Day 
                        parade?

                                 DELILAH
                        I might be back by then.

                                 PATTY
                        The heck you will.

                                 DELILAH
                        You said --

                                 PATTY
                        (cutting her off)  I left lunch for      
                        you guys.  Let's go.

           Hugs all 'round - except for BILL who gets stiffed by PATTY. ALAN 
           films the car driving away, until they've disappeared from view.

           INT HOUSE  - LATER

           THE CREW, finished lunch, are carrying their plates to the 
           kitchen; about to pass Bill's study, when they're STOPPED BY:

                                 BILL (OS)
                        Hey, Beautiful.  Guess what the 
                        temperature is, in Hawaii? 

           Did they hear right?  He's on the phone, with the door wide open, 
           making no effort whatsoever, to conceal the conversation. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Well, the best thing for a bad 
                        sunburn, is to have a handsome              
                        man rub butter on it. 

           Paralyzed, they don't know whether to retreat, or continue past 
           the door. One thing sure, they don't want to get caught like this.

                                 TOMMY
                        (shouts)  Hey, you guys!  Let's 
                        bring the plates into the kitchen!

           BILL WAVES TO THEM as they pass the door - and continues! 

                                 BILL
                        (into phone)  Grant and the girls are             
                        gone, Kevin goes to Australia Saturday 
                        morning, and we could be on the beach            
                        in Oahu by sunset, with a couple of rum 
                        punches in our hands. 

           IN THE KITCHEN: THE CREW IS MIND-BLOWN.
                                 TOMMY GOODWIN
                        Is he not aware we can hear this? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Of course he is.  He's showing off.

                                 TOMMY
                        Should we shoot it?  The door's 
                        wide open.

                                 ALAN
                        And, let Patty see it?  Uh-uh.

                                 TOMMY
                        You know what Gilbert would do,       
                        if he knew we didn't get this?

                                 ALAN
                        Gilbert won't know.  Let's go.

           INT. CRAIG GILBERT'S SANTA BARBARA HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           A PHONE RINGS, he picks it up - SURPRISED AT WHO'S CALLING.    

                                 GILBERT
                        Bill?  Hi.  Did they get off, okay?

                                 BILL
                        A few hours ago.  How long are                  
                        you around?

                                 GILBERT
                        I'm out, on the red-eye, Why?

           INTERCUT: BILL, AT HOME.

                                 BILL
                        I wonder if you could do me a favor.

                                 GILBERT
                        If it's in my power, you've got it.  

                                 BILL
                        I have a friend, who'd like to get 
                        into show business.

           EXT/INT "JOE'S BARBERSHOP" - SAME

           Much excitement as KEVIN introduces the FILM CREW to the 
           barber/owner (JOE); ALLAN and TOMMY scouting the set-up.

                                 ALAN
                        We could use more light.  
                                 TOMMY
                        (re: the chandelier)  I'll clip a 
                        couple of 500's, over his chair. 

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - SAME

           BILL and GILBERT breezing along in a flashy convertible; CRAIG 
           READY TO BELIEVE IN GOD, for what has just been delivered to him.

                                 BILL
                        Now, you don't have to actually       
                        "do" anything.  Just give her some 
                        advice, look at her photos.  On the 
                        other hand, if you can do something, 
                        that would be great.  I personally 
                        think she's a knock-out, and you being 
                        a movie producer... well, it's all 
                        very exciting for her.  

                                 GILBERT
                        It's clear to you, I'm not that kind 
                        of producer, right? 

                                 BILL
                        Yes, but she doesn't have to know 
                        that.  And Patty doesn't have to   
                        know about this, either.  

           BILL'S GUY-TO-GUY GRIN is meant to feel GILBERT out. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Not that I'm doing anything wrong,      
                        mind you, just that Patty can be a 
                        little paranoid.  And, I've learned, 
                        the hard way, not to make any moves,   
                        or leave anything around, that could   
                        get her started. 

                                 GILBERT
                        "Leave anything around," like what?

                                 BILL
                        Oh, you know.  "Souvenirs."                 

                                 GILBERT
                        What kind of souvenirs?   

                                 BILL
                        Matchbooks, swizzle sticks, (wink) 
                        "etcetera."  You've been married?

                                 GILBERT
                        I never could figure out where to 
                        stash those "souvenirs," either.    
                                    BILL
                        "Two words."  Lock and key.  Or, is                            
                        that "three?"      

                                 GILBERT
                        I'd think anything with a "lock" on 
                        it, would be the first place she'd 
                        go.  My wife would have, anyway.

                                 BILL
                        Not if she doesn't know it exists.  
                        More than that, I cannot say. 

           HE FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR, hard enough to give GILBERT whiplash.  

           INT. BARBER SHOP - SAME

           THE HI-WATTAGE LIGHTS clipped to the CHANDELIER over KEVIN'S CHAIR 
           are turned on; CAMERA ROLLS, and JOE THE BARBER takes his stance.

                                 BARBER
                        Any last words?

                                 KEVIN
                        Please don't make me look like a 
                        businessman.

           No worries.  Before he takes the first snip, THE CHANDELIER        
           CRASHES DOWN on top of KEVIN, opening a nasty GASH in his head. 

                                 ALL
                        (panicked)  Use the sheet!  Get             
                        a wet towel! Call an ambulance!   
                        Get him into the van!

           BILL and CRAIG studying 8X10 GLOSSIES of "SALLY" an aging wannabe,  
           with the requisite bleached hair,and  pendulous breasts. 

                                 BILL
                        She photographs great, don't               
                        you think?  How 'bout this one? 
                        (scanty-panties)

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, Billy.

                                 GILBERT
                        Very lovely.

                                 BILL
                        You know what I tell her, the problem 
                        is?  Too much like Marilyn Monroe. 
                                 GILBERT
                        That could be it.

                                 BILL
                        So, what do you think?  Do we have 
                        something to "work with," here?  
                        Screen test, maybe?  If it costs 
                        money, I'd personally consider it    
                        a wise investment.

                                 ALAN
                        I have no idea who that was,        
                        and no interest in finding out.

                                 TOMMY
                        If they can't stitch him, without

                        we have?

           He's showing CRAIG GILBERT an 8mm film of SALLY, in Nun's Habit,            
           singing The Sound of Music; the answer to GILBERT'S prayers.       
           When it ends, they anxiously await his verdict.

                                 BILL

                        Truly?  I think I know someone       
                        who'd be interested in this.

                        anytime," he said, and he'd have 
                        dinner on the table.

                        Then why not go home?  Isn't that 
                        "ruined" enough?

                        Who?  Andy Platt?

                                 GILBERT
                        Her name is Sally.  I have an 8X10     
                        glossy, and a tape of her singing 
                        The Sound of Music.  He was hoping 
                        I could get her into the movies.

           Hit hard, her awareness of the girls watching, forces containment.  

                                 PATTY
                        How's her singing?
                                 GILBERT
                        You said you wanted to know this.

                                 PATTY
                        I said I needed to, not I wanted to.

                                 GILBERT
                        If this doesn't convince you, there's 
                        more. "Souvenirs," he said, that he's 
                        got under "lock and key." Any idea 
                        where that would be?

                                 PATTY
                        No.

                                 GILBERT
                        I think we should meet, in L.A. as     
                        soon as possible, and deal with this.  

           Fighting not to lose it, she's unable to respond.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Patty?

                                 PATTY
                        The crew is on the way. 

                                 GILBERT
                        The crew can turn around. 

                                 PATTY
                        I'd like them to film me here.           
                        In this beautiful place.  If 
                        Singing Sally ever sees me on               
                        TV, I want her to see me smiling.              

           EXT. TAOS BUS TERMINAL - NEXT MORNING

           Putting the two girls on a bus for home, PATTY gives DELILAH last 
           minute instructions; MICHELLE, the loyalist, sticking by her side.

                                 PATTY
                        Nancy knows the arrival time, she'll           
                        makes sure your Dad's there to meet            
                        you.  Do you have phone change?                
                        Watch your purses, when you sleep.

                                 DELILAH
                        Bye, Mom.  Are you mad?

                                 PATTY
                        All Mom's are mad, Honey.          

           Hugs, kisses; WE MOVE IN ON PATTY, watching the bus pull away.
                                 PATTY (VO) (CONT’D)
                        I sent Delilah back, to cramp her  
                        Father's style, while I wrestled 
                        with what to do.  I'll always feel 
                        guilty, about using her that way. 

           EXT. THE TAOS HOUSE - LATER

           THE FILM CREW (THE RAYMONDS AND TOMMY) PULL UP in an AIRPORT VAN, 
           reuniting with PATTY and MICHELLE, like long-lost family.

           EXT. THE TAOS HOUSE - VERANDA - DINNER

           The group (including Michelle) gathered around a candle-lit table, 
           laughing about the crew's visit to Grant, to film him shoveling 
           cement - and the "haircut" that ended with Kevin being stitched up 
           by the next door neighbor, because BILL was nowhere to be found. 

                                 PATTY
                        (troubled)  That happened, the day I left? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Within hours of your hitting the road.

           UNEASY SILENCE;  MICHELLE turns the topic to HORSES. 

           EXT. THE VERANDA - LATER

           DINNER OVER, MICHELLE gone to bed; TOMMY retired too; PATTY, ALAN 
           and SUSAN, gathered around the firepit, sipping Brandy; a sense of 
           intimacy among them, in the silence of the night. 

                                 PATTY
                        Have you found your soulmate, 
                        Susan?  (off her nod) Can you 
                        imagine there'd ever come a time 
                        when you'd have to leave him?

           ON SUSAN - and ALAN - aching with sympathy for her.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Bill was my soulmate too; long ago.  
                        And I've known I have to (leave him) 
                        for a very long time.  Craig wants me 
                        to do it now.   While you're here. Do 
                        it, on camera.  What do you think?

           SUSAN doesn't have to look at ALAN, to know this will STEAM HIM.

                                 ALAN
                        I think it's none of his business. He's 
                        making a film, you're living your life. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        He wants drama, you'll give it to him, 
                        he'll get an Emmy for it, and move on  
                        to the next film.   You can't do that, 
                        with your life.  "Cinema Verite" is 
                        about your truth, not his."  What do            
                        I think?"  Craig Gilbert is out of line.               

                                 PATTY
                        (noting)  You're not surprised,               
                        I'm leaving him. Did you know he               
                        was cheating on me?

                                 SUSAN
                        (sadly)  Sort of figured.

           A COYOTE HOWLS: MICHELLE appears, in her pajamas, terrified.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Did you hear that?

           PATTY opens her serape; MICHELLE scampers inside, clinging tight. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I need to go home too, Mom. 

           EXT/INT. PATTY'S CAR - MOVING FAST -NIGHT

           MICHELLE asleep in the back, PATTY grim-faced behind the wheel. 
           Towns move by us.  Radio on. Radio off.  She's losing it. 

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        I can't describe the terror of that  
                        night; knowing I had to do it, but  
                        not knowing how, or when, or even 
                        "if" I could.  What I did know was, 
                        that I'd lost, forever, the blissful 
                        blindness, of thinking everything 
                        would be okay.  

           AT A RAILROAD CROSSING: BELLS CLANG, LIGHTS FLASH, REFLECTING THE 
           FEAR IN HER EYES. But the nightmare of this night has just  begun.     

           INT. COMMUTER PLANE TO SANTA BARBARA - SAME (NIGHT)               

           The RAYMONDS and TOMMY, arriving home ahead of her, buckle up            
           for their final approach, when they hear:

                                 CAPTAINS ANNOUNCEMENT 
                        Asking your patience, we've been 
                        asked by the Tower, to maintain a 
                        holding pattern due to brush fires    
                        in the Santa Barbara area.

           They look out, and see HUGE SMOKE PLUMES.
                                 ALAN
                        Holy shit. 

                                 SUSAN
                        When was Delilah supposed to get in?           

                                 ALAN
                        4:00 today.  

           INT. SANTA BARBARA AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           The RAYMONDS, race off the plane, to a PAYPHONE, tossing coins in, 
           and get an immediate answer.  DELILAH was waiting by the phone.

                                  SUSAN
                        Delilah?!  It's Susan.  Is that               
                        fire anywhere near you?  (nods 
                        "yes" to Alan)  Is your Dad with  
                        you?  "He didn't show up?!"            

           EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - NEW MEXICO

           PATTY at a PAYPHONE, frantic, as her home phone rings.  Until: 

                                 PATTY
                        Delilah!  I heard, on the radio -- 

           INTERCUT:  DELILAH and CROW: one with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, 
           the other with a bucket.

                                 DELILAH
                        Mom, its burning around here!

                                 PATTY
                        How close?!

                                 DELILAH
                        So far, we're okay. 

                                 PATTY
                        What about the back of the house?  
                        Where all the brush is?

                                 DELILAH
                        (to Crow)  Go check the back.

                                 PATTY
                        Put your Father on the phone.

                                 DELILAH
                        He's not here.  He didn't show up.

                                 PATTY
                        What?!
                                 DELILAH
                        We took a taxi home, and he called 
                        to say he was at a meeting, but he 
                        wouldn't say where. 

                                 PATTY
                        Son of a bitch!  Can you get down the hill?

                                 DELILAH
                        There's all kinds of fire trucks down 
                        there.  But the Raymonds are coming. 

           EXT. THE STREET BELOW: THE RAYMONDS trying to argue their way 
           past a blockade of COPS and FIRE TRUCKS. 

                                 ALAN
                        There are two kids alone up there!  
                        Can't we just...?  (refused)  Can I 
                        "walk" up there? (turned down again, 
                        he grabs his camera)  Let me get a 
                        picture of you, so I can identify      
                        the man who wouldn't let us up there! 

           SENSING THIS GUY IS TROUBLE, THE COP CALLS FOR BACK-UP.

           INT. THE LOUD HOUSE - SAME 

           DELILAH still on the phone with PATTY.

                                 PATTY
                        Go next door!  Is Mr. Shestak home? 

                                 DELILAH
                        He's on his roof with a hose. I'm 
                        going to get ours, and do it, too. 

                                 PATTY
                        Delilah!  Listen to me!  Get the 
                        Hell the out of there!!

           HEARING THE WHOOP-WHOOP OF A SIREN, DELILAH looks out to see:

                                 DELILAH
                        The cops are here! 

                                 PATTY
                        Go! Go! For Gods sake! GO

           EXT THE HOUSE - SAME

           THE GIRLS RUN OUT.

                                 COP
                        Are you, Delilah?  Get in!
                                 DELILAH
                        Cn you help us save house!

                                 COP
                        In the car, Ladies.  NOW!

           Able to hear the siren fading, PATTY prays they've been taken away

           EXT. THE HOUSE - EARLY NEXT MORNING

           Surrounded by scorched earth right up to the door; which steams as 
           GRANT hoses it down.  DELILAH and her boyfriend (BRAD) are 
           sweeping the patio, THE RAYMONDS filming the clean-up effort - 
           WHEN PATTY'S CAR SPEEDS IN.

                                 GRANT
                        Mom! 

           Emotions break loose as they run into each other's arms, the kids 
           all talking at once, about whose house was burned, and whose 
           wasn't, how scarey it was  - until they realize PATTY is sobbing. 

                                 DELILAH
                        It's okay, Mom.  I'm fine. Really.  

                                 PATTY
                        I was wrong, to send you home.

                                 MICHELLE
                        She's been saying that, for the    
                        last 500 miles!

                                 DELILAH
                        I made you send me home.

                                 GRANT
                        Get it together, Mom!  We're all 
                        good.  Be an adult, here!

           She regains her composure, but LOSES IT again, when SHE HEARS: 

                                 DELILAH
                        And guess what?!  Lance is coming  
                        home!  He was trying to get through          
                        to us, all night.  Kevin's turning 
                        around too, to make sure we're okay.  
                        He'll be back tomorrow!    

                                 PATTY
                        They're coming home?!  Oh My God.            
                        Alan! Susan!  My babies are coming home!  

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA AIRPORT - DAY:   [ NOTE   SIGNS FOR   "ANNUAL  FIESTA !"  )
           PATTY and FOUR OF HER FIVE KIDS (KEVIN'S already back), searching 
           for LANCE among the PASSENGERS exiting the plane and filing down 
           the mobile staircase.  But the flow is dwindling. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Could he have missed it? 

                                 PATTY
                        I don't see how.  He called from 
                        LAX, to say he was getting on it.

                                 DELILAH
                        Uh....folks?  Hold on, there.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh.  My.  God.

           LANCE, making a grand entrance at the top of the stairs, is in 
           full Gloria Swanson mode, with purse, pantsuit, and a sun hat  
           that dips over one eye. 

                                 GRANT
                        Gol' Damn!  A true "Unidentified          
                        Flying Object!"

           Bursting into laughter, the kids run onto the tarmac and swarm 
           him; PATTY's heart aglow, as she watches.  

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        The fire brought my chicks, flying 
                        back to the coop.  And the rooster 
                        was soon to follow. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - SOON AFTER

           Much laughter as LANCE hands out gifts from Paris; a bra with 
           tassels for Delilah, azebra-striped jockstrap for Grant, a newly-
           minted John Lennon record, sung in French, for MICHELLE, who                    
           runs to put it on the turntable - WHEN BILL APPEARS ON THE SCENE;  
           mobbed by the kids, in a way he doesn't deserve to be. 

                                 BILL
                        My World travelers!

           He's bearing a gift too, for PATTY;  Some kind of document,              
           to justify his dereliction of duty.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        $10,000.00 worth of drill bits,     
                        Babe.  Worth a long weekend in the 
                        hellhole of Fresno, wouldn't you say?  

                                 PATTY
                        It must have been very difficult.
           THE PATIO - LUNCHTIME                                                         

           The kids exchanging tales of their travels, their "one-upmanship" 
           escalating until LANCE has taken center stage, as a PARISIAN POOF, 
           all gasping with  laughter. Except PATTY, who can't disguise her 
           revulsion for the man at the head of the table.

                                 BILL
                        Say, isn't this Fiesta Day?  Who 
                        wants to go to the parade?  Patty?

                                 PATTY
                        I'm shopping for Helen Harrison, 
                        today.  Her house burned down.

                                 BILL
                        (reminded there was a fire) Oh, yeah, 
                        that was a Hell of a thing, I guess.

                                 DELILAH
                        I almost died.

                                 BILL
                        No kidding.

                                 GRANT
                        When I got here, this morning, the 
                        whole patio was covered with ash. 

                                 BILL
                        Is that why the pool's so green?

                                 PATTY
                        The poolman left a note saying he 
                        couldn't get in.  You apparently 
                        locked the patio when you went to 
                        "Fresno."  Judging by the algae, 
                        that must have been some time ago.

                                 BILL
                        Well, I got back in time for Fiesta, 
                        how 'bout I flip some burgers, would 
                        that be good?  To put on the buffet,  
                        at El Paseo, tonight?

                                 PATTY
                        Yes, Bill.  Why don't you flip 
                        burgers, for the buffet tonight.           

           INT. THE STUDY - LATER                                                    

           DELILAH, ON THE PHONE, speaks in a whisper 
                                 DELILAH
                        It's so embarrassing.  I told him I      
                        almost got killed - and he's looking       
                        for "meat," to flip burgers! I'll never 
                        get married - well, except to you, but 
                        not like they are. "Hey, Dad, I almost 
                        died." "Really?  How 'bout I flip 
                        burgers?"  It's just embarrassing, Man.   

           EXT. PATIO - SAME

           BILL, flipping burgers ridiculously high, calls out to the CREW. 

                                 BILL
                        Hey, Alan, shoot this! It's my   
                        event! Some guys do the pole vault, 
                        some break the hundred yard dash...

           And some guys wives are slipping out the front door, looking        
           way too good, to go "grocery shopping for Helen Harrison."

           EXT/INT. THE SANTA BARBARA MARRIOT HOTEL - LATER

           PATTY, her nervousness concealed by the Jackie-O sunglasses and 
           power-pantsuit she wore when Craig Gilbert saw her as the "vision 
           of the "Liberated Woman," STRIDES TO THE FRONT DESK and asks to 
           call his room; disconcerted when she's directed to the bar. 

           INT. MARRIOT "BAR & LOUNGE" - CONTINUOUS

           He's in a back booth, so deep in shadow she can barely find him; 
           her "hug" less than forthcoming - worried about being seen. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Are you alright?

                                 PATTY
                        Married woman, meeting a man in a 
                        bar at 3:00 in the afternoon - ?

                                 GILBERT
                        That's why I didn't presume you'd 
                        come up to the room.

           She pointedly considers it, before taking off her sunglasses.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh!  There you are!

                                 GILBERT
                        And there you are.  I'm a big fan         
                        of those things.  Your eyes.  You 
                        should undress them, more often.  
                        Sorry, poor choice of words.
                                 PATTY
                        Good choice.  I just don't know how 
                        to respond to a compliment anymore.

                                 GILBERT
                        You'd better learn.  In the cutting 
                        room, everyone's dazzled by you. The 
                        word "regal" is used.  And Princess 
                        Grace.  And Jackie-O. 

                                 PATTY
                        And, what do you think?

                                 GILBERT
                        They're right.  Hungry?

           He hands her a menu which she quickly scans, and sets aside.

                                 PATTY
                        It hasn't changed.

                                 GILBERT
                        You've been here before?

                                 PATTY
                        I once picked up a man, at that bar. 

           It gets a SHOCKED LAUGH; until he realizes she's not kidding. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Truly?

                                 PATTY
                        Twice. 

                                 GILBERT
                        I'm astonished. 

                                 PATTY
                        That I could do such a thing?

                                 GILBERT
                        That you could tell me.

                                 PATTY
                        I guess the "Grace Kelly" thing. 
                        Must mean I look "untouchable."    
                        In case you had that impression,      
                        I wanted to correct it. 

           He signals a waiter: beer for him, a highball for her. 

                                 GILBERT
                        And - waiter?  It's an emergency.
           It draws a laugh; and smiles of mutual appreciation.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Was it out of "revenge?"

                                 PATTY
                        Yes and no.  I always imagined          
                        I'd leave him, if I could find            
                        the right man. 

                                 GILBERT
                        When you leave him this time, 
                        you'll have a clearer reason.

           Not the response she'd hoped for.

                                 PATTY
                        (hurt) Oh?

                                 GILBERT
                        I have the photograph.  "Singing Sally." 

                                 PATTY
                        What kind of photo is it?

                                 GILBERT
                        Her face.  A professional head shot.

                                 PATTY
                        And that's your "evidence?"  My 
                        "irrefutable proof" of adultery?  
                        (mocking) "Your honor, look at this           
                        8X10 glossy! It's an open and shut case."      

                                 GILBERT
                        You're angry at me?

           More like "humiliated."  She grabs her purse.

                                 PATTY
                        I should go.

                                 GILBERT
                        Why?

                                 PATTY
                        I'm tired of whoring in this hotel. 

                                 GILBERT                 
                        (stops her)  Okay.  Hold it. I was           
                        hoping we could wait, until you've 
                        put it behind you.  Leaving him.
                                 PATTY
                        Then, I "get to sleep with you,"                       
                        is that it?

                                 GILBERT
                        I didn't mean it, to sound -

                                 PATTY
                        Listen, twenty pounds lighter,       
                        maybe you'll be in a position           
                        to blackmail me.

           A good fat joke will always crack him up.  Tension eased,                    
           the drinks arrive.

                                 GILBERT
                        I've been thinking about those 
                        "souvenirs," that Bill keeps under 
                        "lock and  key." 

                                 PATTY
                        I found three keys in a sock drawer.

                                 GILBERT
                        Keys to what?

                                 PATTY
                        I don't know.

                                 GILBERT
                        When I had something too hot to 
                        leave around the house, I kept it 
                        in my office.  

                                 PATTY
                        (taken aback)  You cheated on your wife?!   

                                 GILBERT
                        (sheepish)  "Viva La 70's."

                                 PATTY
                        I'll drink to that.

           They do - the atmosphere thickening. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Where is that photograph, anyway?

                                 GILBERT
                        Up in my room. 

                                 PATTY
                        I think I'd better see it, don't           
                        you?
                                 GILBERT
                        Would you prefer to go up by yourself?  
                        I mean, if someone should spot you --- 

                                 PATTY
                        Cinema Verite.  Let's go.

           Throwing caution to the wind, they head for the elevator; she runs 
           back to the table to retrieve her purse, and slug her drink down.  

           EXT. EL PASEO RESTAURANT: "FIESTA!"

           Mariachi music blasts out the door, as people stream in; 
           CRAIG GILBERT with PATTY, among them.  

           INT. EL PASEO - SAME

           Revelers packed like sardines in a sea of Margueritas, the music 
           so loud, that conversations have to shouted, mouth-to-ear, to be 
           heard.  OUR CREW is in the thick of it, their camera trained on 
           BILL, who's at a long table with friends, looped and flirting 
           shamelessly with the woman seated next to him. 

                                 BILL
                        I don't know how else to say it, 
                        Kay, other than I envied your 
                        husband from the moment we met.  

                                 KAY
                        And I pitied your wife. 

                                 BILL
                        She's always mad at me, Kay.

                                 KAY
                        Can't imagine why.

                                 BILL
                        I'm at a dangerous age.

                                 KAY
                        Fourteen is always difficult.

           ALAN and SUSAN, filming from a distance, are amused. 

                                 ALAN
                        Are you getting this?

                                 SUSAN
                        Unbelievable.

           TOMMY sees something that STUNS HIM.
                                 TOMMY
                        Pan "left," Alan.  And be prepared 
                        to shit your pants. 

           It's PATTY, escorted by CRAIG GILBERT - who spots them, and waves! 

                                 ALAN
                        What the Hell does he think he's doing?

                                 SUSAN
                        This is too bizarre.

           Ducking his head as if it will make him invisible, GILBERT 
           shepherds PATTY into a tight space next to BILL, forcing him              
           too close to KAY, who gets up and leaves. 

                                 BILL
                        Hey, Kay!  Tell Jerry I hope he 
                        feels better soon!

           No idea that PATTY is beside him, he catches the eye of a 
           BUSTY BEAUTY - instantly smitten; it looks like she is, too.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Come over here.  I saved this space 
                        just for you!

           She's with someone else, but it leads to a shouted conversation 
           that ends with BILL looking for something to write with - coming 
           eye-to-eye with PATTY sitting right beside him.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  There you are!  I saved       
                        this space for you! 

                                 PATTY
                        (her pen)  Here you go.

                                 BILL
                        What's that for?

                                 PATTY
                        Her phone number. 

                                 BILL
                        Oh, Man, there you go again.

           She scoops a Marguerita off a passing tray; a second one for 
           GILBERT, who has settled into a seat right across from her. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        (spots Gilbert)  Well, look who's 
                        here!  Cecil B. De Mille!  (toasts)  
                        "Viva La Fiesta," Mister DeMille!
           WHEN GILBERT'S "toast" comes into frame, ALAN CUTS THE SHOT.

                                 ALAN
                        What are you doing, Craig?

                                 GILBERT
                        I'm not on camera.  Just shoot    
                        over my shoulder.  

                                 ALAN
                        You can't be at the party, Craig.

                                 GILBERT
                        Patty wants me here. 

                                 ALAN
                        For what?

                                 GILBERT
                        Moral support.  Now, get that thing  
                        on your shoulder, and shoot.                                                                             

           Tempted to belt him, ALAN catches SUSAN'S signal, that she's 
           picking up something in her earphones, he should get on film. 
           Shelving his anger, he raises his camera; and finds himself 
           shooting the scene he hoped he'd never have to film.  

                                 PATTY
                        "Grumpy?"  I'm not grumpy at all, 
                        Bill.  Matter of fact, I'm pretty 
                        damn happy right now.

                                 BILL
                        Then, how 'bout put a hat on the 
                        table and start dancing around it?  
                        You used to be a great table 
                        dancer, you remember that, Kiddo? 

                                 PATTY
                        I'm afraid you're confusing me              
                        with someone else, Bill.   

                                 BILL
                        No, that was you, before you turned                     
                        into.... "this."

                                 PATTY
                        What did I turn into, Bill?

                                 BILL
                        Someone who brings me down.  Isn't 
                        that your purpose in life?
                                 PATTY
                        If it is, I'm not doing too well at it. 

                                 BILL
                        You did just fine tonight, Kiddo.            
                        I think I'll go sit somewhere else.

                                 PATTY
                        Why don't you do that?  (re: the 
                        busty babe)  She's right over there.  

                                 BILL
                        Good.  Right in "plain sight."  Save you                
                        from having to snoop around my closet and              
                        open my drawers, looking for something             
                        you'll never find - because it doesn't exist!  
                        That's what you've "become" - paranoid.             
                        You've turned my pockets inside out, so               
                        many times, there's no lint left!  And you 
                        accused your best friend Val, of having 
                        something "going on," with me?!  Do you               
                        want to know what's going  on?  I'll let              
                        you watch!  It's called  flirting, God                    
                        help me, send me to the electric chair,             
                        for just trying to have  a little fun,                     
                        like I was tonight, because I'm married                           
                        to a downer!  (in her face)  So, what do                
                        you think of that?

                                 PATTY
                        I think you're full of crap.

                                 BILL
                        Do you?

                                 PATTY
                        I think you're a pathetic fool.  A sad, 
                        ludicrous, idiotic, incomprehensible, 
                        childish, schizophrenic, sadomasochistic...

                                 BILL
                        Whoa, whoa, gimme that pen. I gotta 
                        write this down. Seriously, Patty, 
                        I think this is important stuff.

                                 PATTY
                        Did I mention GOD DAMN ASSHOLE?!!

           Loud enough to have cut through the din, ALL EYES TURN TO PATTY -   
           and ALAN CUTS THE SHOT, pulling off his headset and summoning 
           TOMMY and SUSAN to follow him out.  GILBERT, unable to believe his 
           eyes, bounces out of his seat, chasing them through the crowd.
                                 GILBERT
                        Alan!  Susan!  What the hell - ?!

                                 ALAN
                        "Technical problems", Craig.         

                                 GILBERT
                        Then, get the second camera! 

                                 ALAN
                        We're out of film.

                                 GILBERT
                        That's bullshit!  Don't do this to me!

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           GILBERT IN HOT PURSUIT, as they head for the VAN.

                                 GILBERT  (CONT’D)
                        Get back in there, Goddammit!  This 
                        is what we've waited for!  The best 
                        stuff is happening right now!

                                 ALAN
                        The "best stuff" in your opinion,       
                        is the worst stuff, in mine.  

                                 GILBERT
                        Gimme that camera!

                                 ALAN
                        You don't know how to shoot.

                                 GILBERT
                        I want that camera, so nothing happens to  
                        the film we just shot!  I own it, Goddammit!  
                        And I'll sue your ass if you destroy it! 

                                 ALAN
                        What about destroying these people?

                                 GILBERT
                        They're destroying themselves!  And                     
                        not shy about it! 

                                 ALAN
                        They forgot we were there! 

                                 GILBERT
                        (freaking)  That's the point!  Don't               
                        you get it?!  Cinema verite!  We       
                        succeeded, Goddammit!  And you're              
                        fucking it all up! 
                                 ALAN
                        There are five kids who shouldn't 
                        have to see what happened in there.

                                 GILBERT
                        And there are five million families          
                        that should!  This is a lesson for all 
                        families!  You think I don't care?!  
                        About the kids?  And Patty?  I've              
                        been with her all afternoon!  And,        
                        I assure you, she knows I "care!"

                                 ALAN
                        (catches the innuendo) We're leaving now. 

                                 GILBERT
                        (grabs him) The hell you are.

                                 ALAN
                        Don't put your hands on me.

                                 SUSAN
                        Guys!  Guys!

           Too late.  They're into it, GILBERT'S fists flailing as ALAN lifts 
           him off the ground and tosses him onto the cement. 

                                 TOMMY & SUSAN
                        (running to him)  Craig!  Are                         
                        you okay?

                                 GILBERT
                        Congratulations, Tommy.  You just           
                        got your boss's job.  Pick up a 
                        camera, we're going back in!

                                 SUSAN
                        Alan, go home.   

                                 ALAN
                        Get in!

                                 SUSAN
                        Let me handle this!  Go!

           ALAN pulls out, but stops short, as GILBERT to his feet, RAGING.

                                 GILBERT
                        Call the police! I want the police!
                                 SUSAN
                        Excuse me.  "Award winning filmmaker in 
                        drunken brawl?" "Crew rebels against 
                        Gilbert's orders to shoot foul language 
                        for Family Show on Educational TV?!"

           Her point made, he dusts himself off, and heads back inside.

           INT. EL PASEO:  GILBERT LOOKS FOR PATTY - BUT SHE'S GONE.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA - MOMENTS LATER

           HER CAR pulls up, in stealth mode, in front BILL'S OFFICE.  She 
           pulls the KEY RING out of her purse, with the 3 "MYSTERY KEYS."  
           Marshalling her courage, she gets out, and tries her keys on the 
           front door, despairing, when all three fail.  But she's drawn the 
           attention of a NIGHT WATCHMAN, who, before can flee, calls out - 

                                 WATCHMAN
                        Do you need "in," Mrs. Loud?

                                 PATTY
                        (breathless)  Yes.  My husband sent 
                        me, for something in his office.

           Happy to oblige, he opens up, escorting her to the elevators.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        (re: the markings on her 3 keys)       
                        I figured "F" probably stands for 
                        "Front door." "O" for "Office."  
                        And, "E" would be...I don't know.

                                 WATCHMAN
                        "E" is for "elevator."  I'll send                            
                        you up. "O" is for the office door.                   
                        "F" is for files.

                                 PATTY
                        Files.  Good.  That's what my husband 
                        forgot to bring home.         

           INT. UPPER  FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           She steps off the elevator, moving down a darkened hall, to a             
           locked door, marked "WESTERN FOUNDRIES.' The "O" key gets her 
           inside, where she moves through Reception, to the office of 
           "William C. Loud, Pres." and steps in, locking it behind her.  

           In the semi-darkness, she surveys the photo gallery of FAMILY  
           PHOTOS, horse shows, vacations, Christmases and graduations; not 
           the office of someone who doesn't love his wife and kids.  It 
           brings a wave of emotion, which she can't afford to succumb to.
           Her first target is the desk; all drawers locked; none will yield 
           to her keys.  HEARING FOOTSTEPS, SHE FREEZES until they've passed, 
           her eyes falling on THE FILING CABINET.  Free-standing.  Solid 
           steel.  But, this time THE KEY - "F" for "file" - FITS!  A DRAWER 
           SLIDES OPEN.  Her hands tremble, as she thumbs through the files, 
           the NIGHTMARE OF HER LIFE, materializing before her eyes

                                 PATTY (VO) (CONT’D)
                        "For my Mother's generation, the            
                        World changed with Pearl Harbor.  For 
                        my generation, it was the shot that 
                        killed JFK.  For me, personally, it 
                        would be "The Night of The Files.”  
                        After that, the World would never              
                        be the same.  

           The cache is overwhelming: file after file of incriminating hotel 
           bills, boarding passes, love letters and locks of hair, photos of 
           Bill with all the bimbos he's wined and dined, on yachts and four-
           star hotels.  There are Polaroid peek-a-boos, taken in hot tubs 
           and four-poster beds; several off "AUNT VALERIE"; judging by her 
           aging process, taken over a period of years.  Overwhelmed by it, 
           PATTY anchors herself in a chair. 

           INT. GILBERT'S HOTEL ROOM - 2:00 A.M. 

           GILBERT startled by the phone. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Hello?

                                 PATTY
                        Craig?  It's me. 

           INTERCUT PATTY: IN HER BEDROOM; eyes swollen from crying, a bottle 
           of Scotch on the table; a cigarette trembles in her hand. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I'll do it.  And, I'll do it, on             
                        camera.  But, not talking to the            
                        kids.  I have to do, alone.  And,               
                        with my brother and his wife; I have            
                        to tell them alone.  Just "Bill."               
                        You can film that; me, telling Bill             
                        to get the Hell out, and never come 
                        back.  I want the women of America             
                        to see that.  That's what I want his 
                        Bimbos to see.  

                                 GILBERT
                        I am so proud of you.   
                                 PATTY
                        Just Alan and Susan.  Not you.  Not 
                        Tommy.  Just me and Bill.  And Alan             
                        and Susan.  No one else. 

                                 GILBERT
                        I'll abide by whatever you say.  

           GILBERT HANGS UP.  THE THRILL OF VICTORY IN HIS EYES.

           INT. MICHELLE'S ROOM - LATER

           MICHELLE and LANCE singing, with the French version of Imagine. 

                                 LANCE & MICHELLE 
                        "Imagine there's no Heaven; It's 
                        easy if you try. No Hell below us -                      

                                 GRANT
                        (interrupting)  Family meeting.

           INT. THE LIVING ROOM -  MOMENTS LATER

           We sense the kids' anxiety, as they wait for PATTY - who breezes 
           in, wearing the pants LANCE bought for her in Paris.  

                                 PATTY
                        How do they look?

                                 LANCE
                        A little loose around the tush.              
                        (her mantra) " Are you eating      
                        anything besides junk food?!"    

                                 OTHERS
                        (piling on)  Yeh, Mom. "You look             
                        too skinny."  "Are you trying to             
                        be Twiggy?"  "I can see your bones."

           The anxiety-born outburst fades; too soon for PATTY, who knows 
           what this is going to do to them.  

                                 PATTY
                        I guess we'll call this meeting    
                        to order. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Can we do "old business?"

                                 GRANT
                        That would be pretty "old."         
                        We haven't had a family meeting            
                        since you were six.
                                 KEVIN
                        Why are we having it? 

                                 GRANT
                        Why do you think?

                                 DELILAH
                        (fearful)  Is it about Dad? 

                                 PATTY
                        Let me talk.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What about Dad?

                                 GRANT
                        Jesus!  Let her talk!  Okay?!

           It shuts them up.  PATTY prays for strength.

                                 PATTY
                        This is hard.  Life is hard.  I love   
                        you all, very much.  And the hardest 
                        thing I can imagine, in life, is 
                        disappointing the people I love most  
                        in the world.  And I'm about to do 
                        that; disappoint all of you. 

           DREAD sweeps through the room like an arctic breeze; DELILAH's 
           eyes beginning to water.  LANCE seated on the floor, drops his            
           head into his hands.  No turning back; PATTY bites the bullet.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I'm divorcing your Father.  When  
                        he gets back from out of town,             
                        I'm asking him to move out.

           The silence is so profound, it seems like no one is breathing.

                                 MICHELLE
                        We can't get divorced, we're "The 
                        American Family!"

                                 PATTY
                        No, we're not, we're just a family, 
                        like everyone else.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don't you love him anymore?

                                 PATTY
                        It's more complicated than that. 
                                 MICHELLE
                        "It's all that counts," you once said.

                                 PATTY
                        I was wrong. 

           MICHELLE bursts into tears, DELILAH quick to her side. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Why?!

                                 PATTY
                        Grown up reasons, Honey.

                                 GRANT
                        We thought, you didn't know, Mom.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Even people in Australia know.

                                 MICHELLE
                        "Know" what?

                                 PATTY
                        (for Michelle's sake) The details 
                        aren't important.

                                 GRANT
                        Yeah, they are.  It's "reality," 
                        right?!  Let's get it all out! 

           His free-floating anger doesn't know where to land.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        He "hit on" Candace Graham.               
                        Shelby's Mom?  And the hygienist      
                        at doctor Frankel's office. 

                                 KEVIN
                        The old gnarly one?

                                 GRANT
                        The young gnarly one.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (horrified)  He's a cheat?

                                 GRANT
                        And Danny Zietler's parents saw him, at -  

                                 DELILAH
                        (cuts him off)  Grant!
                                 PATTY
                        "Saw him, at" what," Grant?

                                 GRANT
                        At the airport coming back from 
                        Hawaii, with Valerie.

                                 MICHELLE
                        (horrified) "Aunt Valerie?!"
                        You're a thousand times more    
                        pretty, than Aunt Valerie!

                                 GRANT
                        Can we end this now?

                                 PATTY
                        No.

                                 GRANT
                        Why not?  Just do what you gotta 
                        do!  He does!  "Off with his head!"  
                        I'm outta here.

                                 PATTY
                        This meeting is not adjourned!

                                 GRANT
                        Why not?!

                                 PATTY
                        Because we are a family, and 
                        families help each other.

                                 GRANT
                        I don't need help from this family.

                                 PATTY
                        Maybe this family needs help from you!

           Having nailed him in place, PATTY'S gaze goes to LANCE, whose 
           participation ended when he heard the word "divorce." 

                                 KEVIN 
                        The film.  What about the film?

                        Yeah, what about that?  Just flush it 
                        down the toilet, with Dear Old Dad?  

                                 PATTY
                        I'll try to keep that from happening.
                                 MICHELLE
                        I don't want Susan and Alan, and         
                        Tommy to go away.

                        Where are they?

                                 PATTY
                        I asked them not to come tonight.

                                 DELILAH
                        Do they know?

                                 PATTY
                        That I've decided to end it?  No.

                        (re: "ending it")  When are you?

                                 PATTY
                        I'll go to Glendale in the morning, 
                        and speak to Uncle Tom and Yvonne 
                        about it.  I'll tell your Dad, when 
                        he comes home, tomorrow night. 

                                 DELILAH
                        Where will he live?

                                 PATTY
                        He'll be fine.

           LANCE remains an island unto himself, hugging his knees to

                        I thought some day we'd get to       
                        know each other.  I always thought 
                        there'd be time for that. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        He'll be so sad,

                                 PATTY
                        We'll all be sad.  But we'll be 
                        sad, together.

           DELILAH is on the front porch swing with BRAD, tucked under his 
           strong, comforting arm; as GRANT pulls in, ambling up the walk. 

                                 GRANT 
                        (re: the gloom)  Somebody die, around 
                        here?  Come on, it's only a divorce.

                                 DELILAH
                        She wants you to pick Dad up at the

                                 GRANT 
                        Oh, I'm afraid not.  Walk him to the 
                        guillotine?  Not on your life. (calls 
                        into the house) Mom - ?!

                                 DELILAH
                        She went to Glendale, to tell Tom

           SHE storms in, finding ALAN rigging cable, her Brother and            
           Sister-in-law looking as confused as she is.  

                                 PATTY
                        What are you doing, Alan?

                        We're not filming what's happening 
                        here.  

                                 ALAN
                        I have no idea what's "happening here."  
                        Craig called and said - 

                                 PATTY
                        Craig promised me!

                        He's in the back bedroom, on the phone. 

           Her march down the hall resonates with increasing anger, 
           until it sounds like JACKBOOTS -

           INT. THE BEDROOM - SAME

           SHE BURSTS IN; GILBERT quick to get off the phone.

                                 GILBERT
                        You're upset.  I understand.

                                 PATTY
                        You gave your word.

                                 GILBERT
                        Let me explain.

                                 PATTY
                        You said I was in charge!

                                 GILBERT
                        You are, but "hear me out!"

                                 PATTY
                        No, hear me out.

                                 GILBERT
                        That's exactly what I want to do!       
                        "Hear you out!"  In your own words!    
                        Spoken to people who won't interrupt,            
                        or argue, or shut you down, or walk           
                        out, because that's what Bill is going     
                        to do, when he gets hit with his walking 
                        papers.  And no one will ever know about 
                        the years of lies, and betrayal, and 
                        humiliation that brought you to this.

                                 PATTY
                        (unswayed)  All that "big talk" 
                        about the "threshold of privacy?!"

                                 GILBERT
                        It has be crossed, in order for           
                        this story to be told, in a way             
                        that can reach peoples hearts. 

                                 PATTY
                        Then, go make a Lassie movie!              
                        There is real suffering going on,          
                        here!  You should have seen my kids - !  
                                 GILBERT
                        I should have seen your kids!  And            
                        the whole world should have!  And 
                        frankly, without that, and without             
                        this, I don't know if it's even           
                        worth putting this thing on the air! 

                                 PATTY
                        I'll be fine with that!  

                                 GILBERT
                        Maybe you will, but how about Alan and             
                        Susan?  And Tommy and Charlotte and               
                        Sharon, who've worked round-the-clock,

                        who believe - and rightfully so - that                 
                        this show can change their lives.

           LOW BLOW.  IT WON'T BE FORGOTTEN.

           CRAIG, listening through earphones, paces in front of the window,           
           where PATTY is doing what she has to do, to get this over with.  
           Seated on the floor, with her back to us, our only measure of her 
           words, is the look of horror on TOM and YVONNE'S faces

           INT - THE ROOM - SAME

           At the end of her tale, PATTY is wiping her eyes.

                                 TOM
                        Remember what Mom said, at your 
                        wedding?  That you were the 
                        "champagne," and he was the" beer?"

                                 PATTY
                        I said, "I like beer."  She said, 
                        "So do I, but I don't mix it with 
                        champagne."

           It provides a laugh, in spite of all.

                                 TOM
                        How did the kids take it?
                                 PATTY
                        Hard.  You know who took it     
                        hardest of all?

                                 TOM
                        You've more than made up for that.

           The thought of the children, renews her tears. 

           Sensing she's at the end of her endurance, ALAN signals GILBERT 
           he's going to cut.  GILBERT, having gotten his "gold, agrees.  

                                 ALAN
                        (gently)  Cut.

           Her BROTHER pulls her into an embrace; YVONNE joins in. 
           GILBERT is waiting outside, to walk her to her car.

                                 GILBERT
                        There's no one with that kind of 
                        courage, Patty.  Felt good though, 
                        didn't it?  To get it all out? 

                                 PATTY
                        In front of the camera?  Not at all. 

           Shunning his attempt to touch her, she open her car door.

                        Kind of funny isn't it.  That I let 
                        you into my life, to show how solid 
                        my marriage was. 

                                 GILBERT
                        I understand.  But after tonight, 
                        the hard stuff is over.

                        not to come home, tonight.

                        morning. (answering Nancy) Because I have                
                        to tell him something very personal, and                
                        the crew will be at the house tonight.       
                        (answers, again) That I'm leaving him. Tell            
                        him that.  And, tell him not to come home.

                        Hopefully, Nancy will have gotten            
                        to him, and you won't have to.  But,

                        What am I supposed to say?

                                 PATTY
                        That I'm telling him to move out,   
                        and prefer not to humiliate him in 
                        front of the camera.  (off Grant's 
                        look)  You'll be doing him a favor.

                        Right.  "Hey, Pop, you're gonna

           DELILAH in the living room watching TV; PATTY in the den playing 
           solitaire; THE RAYMONDS are in the kitchen, ready to film 
           dinner, as they do every night, waiting for Bill to arrive.

                                 ALAN (OS)
                        I'd have bet good money, it wasn't 
                        going to go down, that night.  

           INTERCUT:     "AN  EVENING  WITH  FILMMAKERS  ALAN  AND  SUSAN  RAYMOND"                   

            THE RAYMONDS, ON STAGE at the Academy of radio and TV.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        She seemed determined, at her Brothers 
                        house.  But, after all the years of not 
                        having the courage to end it, there     
                        was no reason to believe her hand was 
                        actually "on the trigger," that night.

                                 SUSAN
                        Also, she wasn't very nervous, which I'd 
                        have thought she'd be. We didn't know,               
                        of course, that she’d sent her emissaries,              
                        to keep Bill from coming home.

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA AIRPORT - OUTDOOR WAITING AREA - SAME

           GRANT watches BILL'S PLANE taxi to a halt - and takes a fortifying 
           breath when he sees him coming toward. 

                                 BILL
                        Hey, "Big G!"

                                 GRANT
                        Hey, "Big B!"

           A hearty hug, much back-patting, GRANT grabs the bags. 

                                 BILL
                        You sure you're strong enough to 
                        carry those?  Oh, right.  You've 
                        been hauling cement. 

                                 GRANT
                        Sure have.

                                 BILL
                        A little hard work never hurt anyone.

           GRANT turns away to hide the TERROR in his eyes. 

           INT. THE CAR - HEADED HOME

           GRANT, behind the wheel; mute.  BILL, as always, provides filler.

                                 BILL
                        The Datsun's still up at Eagle, right?  
                        Has your mother been driving the Jag?  
                        (silence)  Grant?

                                 GRANT
                        The jag?  Yes.  

                                 BILL
                        I'd like to rotate those tires.       
                        Makes a big difference. 
                                 GILBERT
                        Bet it does.

           GRANT turns to him, searching for some sign that he already knows.  

                                 BILL         
                        If my eyes look a little funny, I          
                        was up at 5:00 o'clock, this morning. 

                                 GRANT
                        Have you talked to your secretary?

                                 BILL
                        Every day.

                                 GRANT
                        Today?

                                 BILL
                        No.  Why?

                                 GRANT
                        (Dear God)  Oh, just wondering                
                        how everything is, at the office.

                                 BILL
                        (impressed)  You know, I don't think 
                        you've ever asked me that, before.  
                        That's because you "earned your keep," 
                        this summer. You can finally appreciate 
                        what it takes to bring home a buck or 
                        two.  I sometimes I think, if your 
                        Mother ever had to make a buck in the 
                        world, she'd have a little more respect 
                        for the Old Man, too. 

           EYES RIVETED STRAIGHT AHEAD, GRANT can feel FLOPSWEAT forming.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        How's she doing, by the way?            
                        Your Mom.

                                 GRANT
                        Mom?  Good.  Well - y'know.  "Mom."

                                 BILL
                        I sure do.

           THE MOMENT HAS COME, now or never - AND IT GOES.  GRANT turns 
           up the radio, burning with SHAME. 

           EXT/INT. THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Hearing the CAR PULL UP, PATTY pauses in her game of solitaire.
           ELILAH lowers the sound on the TV.  ALAN and SUSAN, not knowing 
           that BILL wasn't expected, get ready to roll.  

           PATTY, hearing HIS FOOTSTEPS, and turns to STONE. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        (calling out)  Hello....!

           THE RAYMONDS see him pass the kitchen.  GRANT, close behind 
           him, drops the luggage, and scrambles up the stairs. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        (calling out)  Patty - ?

           IN THE VESTIBULE, he looks through the mail until the RAYMONDS 
           catch up to him, then steps into the LIVING ROOM - where PATTY 
           looks like she's seen a ghost. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Are you alright?

                                 PATTY
                        I didn't expect to see you. 

                                 BILL
                        Why not?

                                 PATTY
                        (thinks he's "conning" her)  Come 
                        on, Bill.  We both know. 

                                 BILL
                        "Know" what?

                                 PATTY
                        (stopped)  You haven't spoken to Nancy?

                                 BILL
                        About what? (spots Delilah, watching 
                        from the door)  Hey, Big Dude!  

                                 DELILAH
                        Hi, Dad.

           She throws herself into his arms, clinging tight 

                                 BILL
                        Well, at least somebody's glad to     
                        see me come home.  (back to Patty)  
                        I'm sorry; What about "Nancy?"  I 
                        haven't spoken to her today. 

                                 PATTY
                        Well - Didn't Grant say anything?
                                 BILL
                        About what?

                                 PATTY
                        Don't be playing with me, Bill. 

                                 BILL
                        (at a loss)  What the hell are you 
                        talking about?!

                                 PATTY
                        You don't know there's a "problem".  

                                 BILL
                        No, what's your problem?

                                 PATTY
                        Oh, this is great.

           DELILAH flees the premises; PATTY cuts to the chase. Digging 
           through her wallet, she pulls out a business card.                          

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Let's not spill any blood here.  
                        I've spoken to a lawyer.  This            
                        is his card.  

                                 BILL
                        Oh?

                                 PATTY
                        You can call him in the morning.               
                        I want you to move out, tonight.       
                        Now.  Just, turn around and get out. 

                                 BILL
                        (stunned)  Really?

                                 PATTY
                        We're done, Bill.  The marriage is over.

                                 BILL
                        Just like that?

                                 PATTY
                        Just like that.

                                 BILL
                        Twenty-two years, just like that.

                                 PATTY
                        (a finger-snap)  Just like that.

           Painfully aware of the camera, he forces a casual smile.            
                                 BILL
                        Fair deal.

                                 PATTY
                        I figured, you'd think that.

                                 BILL
                        Yeah, well...I think it's a little 
                        short-sighted on your part.

                                 PATTY
                        Do you, Bill? 

                                 BILL
                        I really do.

                                 PATTY
                        He'll be in his office tomorrow, 
                        waiting to hear from you.  I've 
                        been to the bank and copied our    
                        tax forms.

           No signal could be clearer; the life force drains out of him.        

                                 BILL
                        Right.  (re: the kids)  Got them 
                        pretty shaped up here, have you?

                                 PATTY
                        They all understand the problem;  
                        and, that it's only between you      
                        and me. 

                                 BILL
                        The problem.

                                 PATTY
                        The problem.

                                 BILL
                        Well then.  I don't have to unpack             
                        my bags, do I?

                                 PATTY
                        See how easy it is?

           Numbed, BILL turns and leaves the room. 

           WE HEAR the "slap-slap" of a film runout; ALAN makes a quick 
           switch of magazines, catching up with BILL, in the KITCHEN,     
           where DELILAH waits; her heart aching for him.  

                                 BILL
                        How are we doing out here, Big D?
                                 DELILAH
                        Not so good, Dad.  None of us, are.

                                 BILL
                        Do you know the number of the 
                        Lemon Tree?

                                 DEILIAH
                        They're already got a room for you.

                                 BILL
                        That's.....handy.

           Fearing she's going to break down, she grabs her backpack. 

                                 DELILAH
                        I have to go, Daddy. 

                                 BILL
                        Are you going?

                                 DELILAH
                        I really have to.

                                 BILL
                        Keep in touch.

                                 DELILAH
                        Bye, Dad.

                                 BILL
                        Honey - ?

                                 DELILAH
                        Yeh?

                                 BILL
                        We're all going to be fine. 

           The door closes behind her, Bill forcing himself to move picks up 
           his suitcase to go; but stops, to call back:

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Patty?  If Glen Bernson calls me, 
                        it's very important.  Make sure he 
                        calls me at the Lemon tree.  We've 
                        got a pretty huge order in Dayton, 
                        and your friend Merriwether - you 
                        remember him? - is going to try to 
                        sell Bernson the same damn thing.  
                        And we can't have that happen.  We 
                        really can't.  
           No response.  The crew follows him to the car where he deposits 
           his luggage in the trunk, and turns to them, forcing a smile.              

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Don't be strangers, okay.  There'll  
                        be plenty to be filmed, on my end, 
                        too.  I can guarantee you, that. 

           ALAN'S CAMERA remains trained on the car, until its tail lights  
           disappear - and puts down his camera.  Susan comes into his arms, 
           for a hug.  

           INT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ALAN and SUSAN find PATTY in MICHELLE'S ROOM, still as statuary, 
           staring out a window, her back to the door. 

                                 SUSAN
                        (gently)  Patty?  Would you like us stay?             

                                 PATTY
                        Thank you, I'd like to be alone.

                                 SUSAN
                        You know where to find us, okay?

           When they leave, WE MOVE IN ON PATTY, hearing her VOICE OVER:

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        There was "plenty" to film on 
                        "Bill's end," and Craig made sure 
                        to get it, hiring a second crew, so 
                        as not to  miss "one juicy morsal."

           EXT/INT.  "VILLA CABRILLO" - DAY 

           BILL, being filmed by a DIFFERENT CAMERA CREW, is meeting with   
           his DECORATOR, on the patio of his "swinging singles" complex,  
           built around a swimming pool, where plenty of prospective new 
           "friends" in bikinis are sunning themselves below.

                                 BILL
                        I thought I'd drop a bamboo curtain, 
                        some kind of filter deal, that would 
                        give it a nice warm, easy feel...

                                 DECORATOR
                        (taking notes)  Warm and easy...

                                 BILL
                        Warm and easy.  And, you know, I like 
                        that French, Louis The 15th, kinda 
                        jazz.  I really do, dig that stuff.
           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET

           PATTY and LANCE out for a stroll, while the dogs romp in the surf, 
           ALAN and SUSAN filming far enough behind, to give them privacy and 
           get their silhouettes against the setting sun

                                 PATTY
                        It's not a question of "enjoying your 
                        company," it's just not right for you            
                        to be "hanging out" with your Mother           
                        all the time.  Since Daddy's been gone,  
                        you've said you're going to San Francisco, 
                        you're going to the South of France... 

                                 LANCE
                        If I were you, Mom, I'd enjoy me           
                        while I last.  Because I'm not going            
                        to last forever.

                                 PATTY
                        That makes two of us.  Which is why we 
                        both have to figure out what we want to 
                        be when we grow up, and "go for it."

                        (laughs)  I don't know. 

           BARKING AT THE DOGS, he chases them, knee-deep, into the surf.

                        Back to Greenwich Village! 

           EXT. MIRAMAR-ON-THE-BEACH MOTEL - A STORMY DAY

           Watching a TRUCK haul their equipment away, the RAYMONDS bring   
           their luggage outside, where PATTY is waiting, to say goodbye.

           Lone survivors of a gut wrenching war, their hugs are heartfelt, 
           too emotional for words; Patty, framed against the storm-tossed 
           ocean, is a portrait of abandonment, as they drive away. 

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        When Bill left, I had the comfort             
                        of the Raymonds by my side.  When             
                        they left, I was hit with the enormity 
                        of what I'd done - and the fact that                
                        I was on my own.  

           EXT. STREETS OF SANTA BARBARA - MORNING
           WE FIND PATTY, carrying a briefcase, in the march of foot 
           soldiers on their way to work. 

                                 PATTY (V0) (CONT’D)
                        Bill had played hardball with the 
                        finances, as I suspected he would.          
                        I joined the workforce at the age of 
                        44, as a fact-checker for The Santa 
                        Barbara Historical Society.... 

           INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY OFFICES - SAME 

           PATTY at a SECRETARIAL DESK, sorts through the morning mail. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        And Craig Gilbert, my mentor and 
                        Svangali, who'd made me feel smart, 
                        sexy, and strong enough to do this, 
                        had evaporated like spit in a hot pan. 

           In the stack of mail, is one addressed to her, from WNET, NEW YORK 
           which she opens, and reads; her eyes filling with FEAR. 

                                 ALAN (OS)
                        He doesn't answer your calls either?              

           INTERCUT: BETWEEN ALAN (IN NY), and PATTY, ON THE PHONE.                

                                 PATTY
                        No, but I just got this letter        
                        from him, saying I'm "gorgeous in 
                        every frame, the kids are the five 
                        most fascinating kids ever seen   
                        on TV, and the film is fantastic   
                        in spite of what I may hear!" 

           ON ALAN; instructing SUSAN to pick up the phone.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell does that mean,              
                        "In spite of what I may hear?"

                                 ALAN
                        He's probably screened it a few times, 
                        and taking the usual sniper fire. 

                                 PATTY
                        How can it be "screen" it?  I was    
                        supposed to have a say.  He gave his word! 

                                 ALAN
                        Craig's "word?"  He denied me, my 
                        director's credit.  We're boycotting 
                        the premier.
                                 PATTY
                        What premier?!

                                 SUSAN
                        Here at the Museum of Modern Art                
                        next week.  You weren't invited?

                                 PATTY
                        No!  What the hell's going on?  

                                 ALAN
                        Obviously, clearing everybody                               
                        out of the spotlight, so he can                              
                        have it all to himself.               

                                 PATTY
                        I'm terrified, Alan, of what this            
                        film is going to be.  Can't your just -             
                        go to it "incognito," or something,              
                        and let me know how it is?             

                                 ALAN
                        (a thought)  No.  But, I bet Lance can.

           Limousines off-loading New York Glitterati, from Norman Mailer             
           to Mayor John Lindsay -- and LANCE LOUD, who gets out of a TAXI, 
           wearing a feather boa, accompanied by KRISTIAN in full BIKER MODE.  
           Drawing press attention just for being bizzaros, the barrage of

           given PROGRAMS, and find seats.

           But, one look at the PROGRAM sends LANCE INTO SHOCK.  The cover 
           is the Christmas Card Portrait, captioned:

           BIG APPLAUSE greets GILBERT, who steps to the podium, unbuttons 
           his too-tight tuxedo jacket, puts on his glasses, and reads:

                        no place like home."

           A buzz of titillation ripples through the crowd, LANCE flipping 
           through the program, in HORROR.

           when the Main Title, AN AMERICAN FAMILY appears, written on blocks 
           of stone that suddenly "CRACK."  A not-too-subtle indication of 
           the story GILBERT intends to tell.

           TIME/CUT TO: LANCE DEVASTATED, as the AUDIENCE HOWLS WITH LAUGHTER 
           at the scene of him and his Mom attending the drag show in N.Y. 

           TIME/CUT TO: LANCE being subjected to a scene of BILL telling his 
           HARD-HAT BUDDIES what a con-artist "the one in Paris" is, and how

           CLOSE ON PATTY - STEAM COMING OUT HER EARS.

           INT. GILBERT'S NEW YORK OFFICE - MORNING

           GILBERT, flushed with self-importance, giving a phone interview, 
           is INTERRUPTED by his SECRETARY, with a note, that makes him 
           recoil with surprise.  "PATTY LOUD IN THE OFFICE. NOT HAPPY."  

           By the time he's hung up, she's at the door.

                                 GILBERT 
                        Wait a second.  Aren't you Patty Loud? 
                        The sexy divorcee who's soon to be TV, 
                        every week?  The "social phenomenon of 
                        the 70's?"  That's what I was just told, 
                        by The New York Times - just now - on the 
                        phone.  That's what our show is going to 
                        be!  Did you hear about the screening? 

                                 PATTY
                        By chance.   I wasn't invited.

                                 GILBERT
                        You're going to be the big deal,             
                        at the one, in L.A.  I'm hiring 
                        photographers just for you and      
                        the kids, you're going to be all   
                        over the papers the next morning.

           In the face of his "FLOPSWEATING," she speaks with complete calm.  

                                  PATTY
                        You're a bastard, Craig.  And a 
                        liar.  You've held my family up              
                        to public ridicule. 

           Though surprised by her pluck; he's ready to stand his ground.

                                 GILBERT
                        It's not a work of fiction, Patty.  
                        The film speaks for itself. 
                                 PATTY
                        (challenging that statement)  "Would 
                        you live next door to this family?"  

                                 GILBERT
                        Well, yeah, that's the Advertising 
                        Department.  Listen, you're the one 
                        who wanted to reach the "dummies."

                                 PATTY
                        I flew here, to tell you to stop     
                        using it.

                                 GILBERT
                        I don't really control that.

                                 PATTY
                        I retained a lawyer who has a good  
                        feel for bullshit artists, to deal  
                        with Bill Loud, and I'd be happy to  
                        sic him on you, if you don't stop  
                        using that slogan, and handing out  
                        that program full of slanderous crap, 
                        meant to make us look like fools. 

                                 GILBERT
                        No one put words in the mouths of 
                        the critics Patty.  They "call it 
                        like they see it."

                                 PATTY
                        I assume, what they see has been 
                        twisted.

                                 GILBERT
                        I'd quit "assuming," until you know 
                        what's in it.

                                 PATTY
                        I don't need to, I know what's              
                        in you.

                                 GILBERT
                        You know nothing about me, Patty.  
                        Who I am, or what I've done, to 
                        keep this "Ship of Fools' afloat.

                                 PATTY
                        Shame on you.

           The words, delivered with the quiet intensity of a voodoo 
           curse, silence him.  She picks up her purse and goes to the 
           door - but isn't finished,

                        Are you capable of making "one promise," 
                        and keeping it?  Just one?  For the sake 
                        of my family, who you once professed to 
                        care about? 

                                 GILBERT
                        What would that be?

                                 PATTY
                        Discontinue handing out that program.

                                 GILBERT
                        They'll never be handed out again.

           EXT. THE LOUD HOUSE - A WEEK LATER

           Having come full circle to the scene that opened our story: PATTY 
           comes out her door, on a beautiful morning, to get the mail, and 
           finds a mailing tube from WNET, with something scrolled up inside 
           of it - which we now know is "the program," captioned:

                       ""WOULD YOU WANT TO  LIVE NEXT DOOR  TO THESE PEOPLE?!!” 

                                 PATTY (VO)
                        Craig lived up to his promise and 
                        didn't hand them out.  He sent them.  
                        Everybody on the L.A. screening list 
                        got one in their mailbox, that morning. 

           INT THE LOUD HOUSE - NIGHT

           PATTY, WITH ALL THE KIDS (including LANCE), gathered in front 
           of the TV, with bowls of popcorn.

                        to watch it, with the rest of the 
                        world, hunkerd in front of our TV. 

           THE SHOW BEGINS - and WE CUT TO:

           A MONTAGE OF PEOPLE WATCHING: TOM and YVONNE (Patty's brother 
           and his wife), THE HARTELLS (who didn't get the gig); MARY 
           AVERY (who introduced Craig to Patty), BILL in his bachelor 
           pad, with a group of friends, "AUNT VALERIE," "SINGING

                                 CAVETT
                        Thank you.  We have an exciting show    
                        today: the William C. Loud family, who 
                        everyone in America has a strong opinion 
                        about, and award-winning filmmaker Craig 
                        Gilbert, who brought them into our lives.

           THE APPLAUSE IS SPONTANEOUS, THIS TIME.  
                                 CAVETT (CONT'D)
                        Or, as one of our Staffers suggested, as 
                        an introduction: "The Family you love to 
                        hate, and the Man they hate even more."
                        Not funny?  That's why I didn't use it. 

           MINUTES LATER: THE "TOUGH STUFF" HAS BEGUN.

                                 CAVETT
                        Craig. There's been a lot of criticism 
                        of the Louds - Patty in particular, 
                        centered around the scene where she 
                        tells her brother about all the 
                        womanizing Bill has done - so candidly, 
                        that she even refers to one of her 
                        children as the "unfavorite" son.  Was 
                        it her idea to film this?

                                 CRAIG
                        It wouldn't be on film, if it weren't.           
                        And I applaud her commitment to the truth.

                                 PATTY
                        Not so.  He pushed me into it, with                
                        the  promise I'd have final say over             
                        what goes in, and out, of the film. A 
                        promise he failed to honor, in spite of 
                        knowing the psychic damage it would cause 
                        us all.

                                 GILBERT
                        Look.  I'm no psychiatrist.  I'm no      
                        anthropologist, or sociologist.  I'm 
                        just a filmmaker, who had an idea.   
                        That idea, was to make an honest film.

           TIME CUT: BILL'S TURN

                                 BILL
                        So, here we are, sitting around in Santa 
                        Barbara, and this guy comes walking down 
                        the street, looking like Buddha in baggy 
                        pants - and says, how'd you like to be 
                        the most famous family in America? 
                                 (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)
                        You know, we'd spent 25 years, at hard 
                        labor, raising kids, with no particular 
                        upside in sight, and along comes this 
                        guy, saying we could be "famous" for      
                        just being who we are.

           TIME CUT: CAVETT TURNS TO LANCE; the only one on stage having fun 
           with it.  Cavett is having fun with him, too.
                                 CAVETT
                        Now, Lance.

                                 LANCE
                        Yes, Dick.

                                 CAVETT
                        I understand you've met Margaret 
                        Mead, who called An American Family 
                        "The "most revolutionary concept 
                        since the invention of the novel."

                                 LANCE
                        Margaret is wonderful.  I had to 
                        sleep with her, to get that review. 

           HUGE LAUGH: the audience loves him. 

                                 CAVETT
                        You emerged, as the "star" of the 
                        show.  Or am I wrong about that?

                                 LANCE
                        Yeah, like the girl in Deep Throat.  
                        But I loved it.  I get a suntan, 
                        just thinking of it.

                                 CAVETT
                        I noticed they never used the word 
                        "homosexual," in the film.  

                                 LANCE
                        The critics made up for it.  One of            
                        them said, my sexuality was so slimy, 
                        to get in bed with me would be like 
                        getting into a bath-tub with an 
                        electric eel. It made me very popular 
                        at the 97th Street Spa.

           ANOTHER ROAR OF LAUGHTER; he has the instincts of a stand-up. 

                                 LANCE (CONT’D)
                        But seriously,  the way Craig edited 
                        it, made me seem really obnoxious.    
                        And I really, really, get harder to 
                        swallow, over the course of the series.

           "Swallow" sets off some snickers; CAVETT jumps aboard, with a 
           sibilant "S."

                                 CAVETT
                        So to speak.  (off Lance's look)  
                        Sorry, not meaning to imitate you.
                                 LANCE
                        You just can't help yourself.  It's 
                        okay, I've been imitating you, the 
                        whole time, too.

           TIME CUT:  THE MAIN EVENT: GILBERT AND PATTY SQUARING OFF.                

                                 GILBERT
                        No one betrayed you, Patty, except                
                        the mirror.  It didn't show you what               
                        you wanted to see.  Are any of us,                  
                        seen the way we wish to be seen?                 
                        This is where "ego" comes in, and 
                        accusations are made, and people look             
                        for a Fall Guy.  What seems like a             
                        happy scene to one person, might seem 
                        unhappy to another.  What seems tragic 
                        could seem funny, and what seems funny 
                        could be tragic.   

                                 CAVETT
                        What do you think, Patty?

                                 PATTY
                        I don't even understand the guy.

           AUDIENCE LAUGHTER.

                                 CAVETT
                        Which brings up a "delicate matter."  
                        But, I have to ask.  

                                 GILBERT
                        I know what you're going to ask.  
                        Did Patty and I go to bed together?  
                        Everyone asks, and I don't know why. 
                        The truth is, I was never attracted 
                        to her.

                                 CAVETT
                        Patty?

                                 PATTY
                        That must be why it didn't work. 

           THE LAUGH IS ON GILBERT; he laughs too, as though she's joking. 

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Craig.  Do you still "applaud 
                        my commitment to the truth?"  

           Having seized command of the audience, she makes her FINAL POINT.                          
                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Here's the thing.  We're going on this 
                        show, and others like it, because we 
                        need to show people we're not monsters, 
                        or idiots - or "zombies."   We're pretty 
                        decent people, who were doing pretty 
                        well, and didn't really understand what 
                        we were signing up for.  This man came 
                        to us, through a friend, as a friend, 
                        and persuaded us to put our lives in  
                        his hands, and abused our trust.  And 
                        now, all the barnyard sociologists, and 
                        Model-T Freudians, are having their 
                        "fifteen minutes," at our expense.

           THE TV CAMERA CUTS TO HER KIDS.  ("Go, Mom!")

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Some people are mad at us, because we      
                        were too real, and not edited enough.  
                        Other people are mad, because we were             
                        too edited, and not real enough.  To this 
                        man, we were more "real" on celluloid, 
                        where he could turn us into whatever he 
                        wanted to, than we were in the flesh. 

           GILBERT makes sure to signal, he's rejecting every word.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        He set out to prove that marriage is an           
                        institution "so weak," that a puff of wind           
                        could blow it over.  He selected one that 
                        was fighting for its life, and subjected it 
                        to a hurricane.  I blame myself for putting 
                        my family in the eye of that hurricane, 
                        because we'll never be the same.  Bottom 
                        line?  Real people should never expose 
                        themselves to judgement, for being who they 
                        are.  And, beware of anyone who knocks on 
                        your door, and tells you he'll make you 
                        famous for just being yourself.  Because he 
                        does not have your best interests at heart. 

           Home run.  Her children are the first to applaud, joined by BILL, 
           then the whole audience; GILBERT eating shit, with a smile.

           INT. N.Y. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           PATTY, BILL and THE KIDS bonded by victory, looking every bit as 
           solid as PATTY had wanted them to be portrayed.  WE MOVE IN ON 
           HER, wanting to hold the vision in her mind, like birdwatcher 
           trying to capture a breathtaking sight, before it flits away.
                                 PATTY (VO) (CONT’D)
                        Bill got married the following year, 
                        divorced two years later, and grew 
                        closer to the kids, as a single Dad, 
                        with the passage of time.

           INT. CHELSEA HOTEL - LOBBY (1974)- 2:OO A.M.   

           LANCE, ASLEEP ON A COUCH, is SHAKEN AWAKE by KRISTIAN, so excited, 
           he can hardly breath.          

                                 KRISTIAN
                        Lance!  On the payphone, upstairs!  
                        You're not gonna believe this! I 
                        recognized him right away, this 
                        soft little voice, asking if knew        
                        a person named Lance Loud! 

           LANCE BOUNDS OFF THE COUCH, dashing out of frame.

                        Andy recognized Lance on the show,   
                        as the young fan he used to enjoy 
                        talking to, in Santa Barbara, and 
                        tracked him down to the Chelsea 
                        Hotel.  And they became best friends, 
                        after all.

                        Andy once said, "everyone in the

                        of fame."  Our fifteen minutes,        
                        stretched out over six months of 
                        filming, two months of editing,    
                        three months on the air...with
